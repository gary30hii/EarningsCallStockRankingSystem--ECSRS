All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call.   I would like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth quarter and full year 2020 conference call. Yesterday evening, we issued a press release announcing our financial results and outlook for 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Mike, and thank you, all who have joined us today as close to tiptoe and legacy IFF and begin a new journey with N&B. We will begin by sharing a detailed look into all fourth quarter and the full year 2020 results, and then Rustom and I will highlight the go forward outlook and opportunity for the new IFF.  I'm really excited and proud to say that as of February 1, we have officially completed our merger with DuPont N&B. Our teams have hit the ground running, establishing our new company, as an innovation leader and the global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. For the close of the N&B transaction, we also unveiled a new brand identity and purpose intended to unify our organization and best position all divisions for success. As a purpose driven enterprise, we share a mission to build from strengths and transform our industry. We are now squarely focused on execution. Building on recent performance to leverage the exciting capabilities and brought our customer base of our new company. I'm confident that the direction that we are moving and the opportunity ahead of us will lead to accelerated growth and improve profitability as we generate strong value creation and total shareholder return.  Beginning with Slide 6, I would like to recap what was truly a remarkable 2020. Amidst an unprecedented pandemic, the challenge to our global organization, we delivered solid financial results, while embarking on a transformational journey to create a new industry leader together with DuPont N&B. \nRustom Jilla: Thank you, Andreas. I\u2019d only cover the P&L high points on this slide and get into additional detail as we go through the following several slides. In the fourth quarter, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, down 2% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. When excluding the roughly $50 million impact of 2019s 53rd week, a comparable currency neutral growth was plus 2%. And as I'll explain on the next slide up approximately 4% counting foreign exchange related price changes as appears in many CPGs disclose.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Rustom. Turning to Slide 17, let\u2019s focus on 2021 and the new IFF with the N&B business. Our team\u2019s executed well on the tremendous integration planning for the transformational combination, despite working remotely due to COVID-19. This integration planning effort more than a year long has provided an opportunity to create the right team and operating model needed to secure a global leadership position. It has been driven by the lessons we have learned in past integrations across both organizations, running our plans and practical experience that will enable near-term execution. We set out an aggressive timeline in 2019 to close and complete integration planning in 2020. A global pandemic only challenged us even further. But I\u2019m very pleased to say that our teams work extraordinarily well together to compete every aspect out integration planning. I\u2019m confident that the new IFF is ideally positioned to succeed. With this planning complete, we can entirely focus on execution, delivering our commitment and realizing significant revenue cost synergies, resulting in significant value creation for shareholders for the years to come. Let\u2019s move to Slide 18 and take a second and we focus on the value proposition of the new IFF. Our new company is poised to realize significant value for all of our stakeholders. And these two highly complementary companies form a true innovation partner for all customers. The new IFF will be a force in shaping the future of our industry. Our R&D investment will be 1.5 times greater than our nearest sphere. We will have number one or number two positions on core categories and nutrition, cultures, enzymes, probiotics, soy proteins, flavors and fragrances. This is coupled with a broadest and most diverse customer base in our industry more than 45,000 in total and about 48% of our annual sales from small, medium and private label customers. We are well positioned to drive profitable growth for our shareholders. This allows us to enhance the value we can deliver to our customers in a very powerful way. We can deliver value to customers in every interaction from leading product offerings to significant benefits of speed to market and supply chain simplification as we deliver market leading integrated solutions. I think it is important to remember that while the N&B transaction is a culminating and transformational move, it is completely consistent how we have been evolving the portfolio over the past five years. Our friendly focused on positioning the company for where the industry is going, not where it has been. As we acquired more naturals, more regional supply chains, reaching smaller customers and increasing technology and science that innovation. Actions like Frutarom, Lucas Meyer, Ottens Flavors and others were important foundational steps as we executed this strategy. As we look ahead, we are pleased we have the most complete portfolio in the business, while portfolio may change around the edges. It is complete and gives us a right base to grow and the right assets to drives a financial results you see from our long-term targets. Put simply the new IFF will be the strongest part that to customers worldwide to corporate essential solutions for on-trend innovation. Now to Slide 19, I would like to emphasize the long-term value creation potential we have seen for IFF. Our new company has substantial synergy opportunities that will drive growth and expand margins. So our integration planning we confirmed, the run rate revenue synergy expectation at approximately $400 million by 2024 was a contribution of at least $145 million of EBITDA by that time. In addition, we expect to achieve meaningful cost savings, including a runway cost synergy expectation of $300 million by the end of 2023. We expect that execution on our plan will unlock about $50 million in EBITDA contribution in 2021. I think it\u2019s important to say that any combination is not just about synergies, but also too strong and leading based businesses. Our leaders across legacy IFF and legacy N&B businesses are committed to running every part of this business, both space business and combined to use superior results. This requires a mindset of continuous improvement and operational excellence that we\u2019re embracing across the organization. It is critical to underscore that with a comprehensive structure in place to track our progress against the identified objectives. At the center of our discussion will be synergy realization, where we\u2019ll be track diligently, including the one-time costs in both expense and capital. Our hope is to highlight on a continuous basis, all value creation leavers to provide you with a critical how component of our value creation story. And in the end, while we are focused on synergy realization, success will not be defined just as that. It will be the cumulative results where synergies are edited to base business performance for a stronger total P&L. On Slide 20, I want to highlight the actions that will be immediately taken to begin the execution. One of the most questions we get from investors is not, what will you deliver, but instead, how will you actually do it? As you can imagine, synergy capture is all about the how. And as we mentioned on January 11, there are 85 separate initiatives behind the $300 million cost savings that in our plan on the cost side and another several initiatives on the revenue side. We tried to give you a flavor for the type of actions that are part of these initiatives. In terms of revenue synergies, we\u2019ve engaged with our top global and regional customers to introduce joint portfolio and capabilities accelerated co-development partnership with global customers, activated cost division on innovation and collaboration in R&D and launch combined commercial excellence and integrated solution teams. At a high level, I would characterize the cost actions as follow. First, whether it\u2019s the publication we elevate the duplication, you can imagine across two global companies, there\u2019s a lot of duplication in back office and admin functions. Second, we look to align our cost structure with best in class PS, where it is comparable. We have undertaken benchmarking cross functions like G&A, which gives us a tangible target for improvement. No two organizations identical. So we use this as a goal rather than prescription. So it \u2013 whether it\u2019s efficiency, we spread the benefits of dollars, spend across a larger base. Let me give you an example. Also, organizations invest in R&D, but can now leverage across double the categories and customers. This is powerful and shows you the benefit of global scale for supporting cutting edge science investments. First, I would report all the power of centralized services. We have had powered regional business leaders, who drive their P&Ls, but they have access to the best in class global shared service centers in areas like HR, finance and procurement, where there\u2019s a tangible benefit to scale and combined resources. And finally, we have set all of our incentive compensation metrics to reflect in align with our waste business and integration objectives. I really hope this gives you some flavor for the how, we now know the targets we want to deliver and we have told you our long-term goals. So over the coming quarters focus will be very much on these actions. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 21. The new IFF is set to deliver a best in class financial profile and maximize value for our shareholders. This slide summarizes our long-term outlook, which we introduce to investors at the beginning of this year. From a revenue perspective, we expect continued organic sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% over the next few years, led by our unrivaled product and solutions portfolio, which is set to benefit from our industry leading R&D programs. We also expect to see meaningful operating margin improvements for IFF, including an estimated adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 26% in 2023 up around 400 basis points from our 2020 performance. The new IFF will continue to generate strong free cash flows and we expect a significant increase to approximately $2 billion in 2023. As we pursue further gross, so our capital management and delevering, we remain \u2013 that will remain a core priority. We are targeting on those three times net debt to EBITDA ratio 24 to 36 months post-close and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining our investment grade rating. Finishing on Slide 22, I would like to thank you all again for joining our call. Across the world, our teams have worked tirelessly throughout a difficult year to ensure IFF continue to serve our customers and deliver strong business results. Our full year financial results showcase the strengths of our portfolio and most importantly, our people. So those challenging environment, we made tremendous progress on our transformational journey. The formation of the new IFF together with N&B has made us an even stronger company, better positioned to deliver value for our stakeholders. With the pre-integration process completed, it\u2019s now time to execute. We have the team and structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet our financial and operating goals in order to shape the future of our industry and improve our world. By global volatility is expected to persists, foundational commitment to our people, customers, communities and planet will remain unchanged as we look to strengthen and redefine our role as the industry leading ingredients and solutions partner. I\u2019m really thrilled by IFF exciting new chapter, and hope that you will join us on our pursuit to revolutionize the industry and deliver for customers, teams and shareholders. So before opening to questions, please note that our plan for Q&A today is to focus on our results and outlook and not to address questions about market rumors. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator:  And we\u2019ll take our first question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. I guess, one question two parts on the long-term \u2013 the new long-term targets. So on the sales growth piece, what gives confidence, you can achieve 4% to 5% organic growth when you haven\u2019t achieved that level in recent years. Or I should say even both businesses haven\u2019t achieved that kind of growth in recent years you\u2019re guiding, I think Rustom said 2% to 3% organic, something like that in year one. So how do you get there? And I guess also too, just mechanically, how much contribution from the change in FX accounting would add to that. And on the same long-term targets, EBITDA margins \u2013 why the same confidence to achieve those margins, when EBITDA or EBITDA margin had been essentially flat over the last couple of years, despite cost synergies, legacy business productivity initiatives. And I get the puts and takes in 2020, but your results have been below here\u2019s from an EBITDA growth standpoint too, in recent years. So maybe if you could just touch on those, I appreciate it\u2019s a long question, but it\u2019s hopefully important.\nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Thank you, Mark. A very important question. I take the first piece and then I give it on the FX to Rustom. We are very confident that we are very much on track for the long-term targets. Let me explain why. You see that for example, Scent a very important division of ours has turned around quite significantly already in a very tough year, like 2020. And we see good signs also early this year that this journey will continue. So we are basically here on very much on track. The second one is taste. And taste has a bit of a performance issue in the years 2019 and then reaching into 2020. But we have seen some sequential improvement and a good start to 2021 as well. We have done all the actions we have to take to bring this division back on track. We have basically split the European region into Europe, Western Europe, Africa, Middle East to put more focus on the emerging markets and on the more mature markets. We have put a lot of, let\u2019s say, focus on integration efforts of the Frutarom organization, particularly in Europe last year. So fully integrated and we have restructured our go-to-market strategy and it looks like that we are starting to perform well. So I think that\u2019s very confident on the legacy IFF side. On N&B, I think it depends, you\u2019ve seen a lot of pieces of the portfolio, which has a good growth profile, and we will continue and we should not underestimate that parts of the portfolio was also particular last year pressured by COVID. And that will help, at least in the second half of this year to come out of that. And secondly, we have \u2013 certainly, we have seen actually good customer response as well on their portfolio. And in terms of recent wins. On top of it, we have the cross selling and integrated solutions, which will help us to increase our growth rate as well. So we are very confident that we can do it. On the EBITDA margin, we took on legacy IFF. We took actions, we started, as I said, was Scent division or just on sales, but on EBITDA as well. We see good improvement. The same will happen on the taste side and actually I\u2019m less worried about the N&B side, because there\u2019s not actually a good EBITDA, let\u2019s say increase of margins in the last couple of years. With that, that I hand it over to Rustom to comment on FX days.\nRustom Jilla: Thanks, Andrea. Hi, Mark. The guidance that we provided Mark was in dollars, right, as we rolled out, if you think back, basically if you look at the S-4 and then when we talked about the synergies additional revenue synergies that we expected. So as we FX is very hard to call. I mean, we basically ran out the FX rates that we had as of the time we provided all those forward estimates. The new way of the new methodology, which we\u2019ve talked about in any particular period and as we look back does give us a better growth rate. It doesn\u2019t change the overall actual dollars, right?\nMark Astrachan: Exactly.\nRustom Jilla: Yes. I think Andreas covered everything else in your question there.\nMark Astrachan: Thank you, Rustom.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGunther Zechmann: Hi, good morning, Andreas. Good morning Rustom. Hi, Mike. That\u2019s almost emotional for me that you changed the reporting to the way that the European TS disclose organic sales growth. So that\u2019s a bit of a long failed wish. Can I just clarify on your 2021 guidance, what is the organic component and how much do you bake in for FX pricing? I hear what you say Rustom about FX being difficult to predict, but maybe if we break it down to what is the volume expectation and what is the, call it, underlying pricing on the back of any cost inflation that you include in your 2021 guidance, please? And then I have a follow-up as well.\nRustom Jilla: The underlying \u2013 the pricing, I mean, we do expect the raw material costs during the period. I mean, higher raw material costs and recovery of that is based into our pricing as well. So maybe I\u2019ll address the FX part of it. I mean, if you think about, weighted average basket of our currencies, and we look at the biggest currencies for us the U.S. dollar is the biggest, but the Euro/Danish krona, because that\u2019s pretty much tied to the Euro. That\u2019s the second biggest. It\u2019s actually, when you put in the Danish krona, it\u2019s about 27%. Okay. Those are the two big ones. And then the other is, I mean, the Reals and of the Japanese Yen, the Indian rupee or many others, right. If we look to the weighted basket of those and if we look at the \u2013 what is in our basic budget this year was 2020 \u2013 2021 versus 2020, it was about a 1% difference. That\u2019s what we had. And then if you look at spot today, it\u2019s actually running better than that from our perspective from revenue. So our expected 2021 growth rate remains about 3.5%. That\u2019s what we put out there, right? With a small contribution from synergies and no change to the S-4  and as you\u2019ve seen from our January 2021 preliminary sales growth around 3%, we\u2019ve started, we\u2019ve started roughly in line with expectations.\nGunther Zechmann: Great, thanks. If I can just follow-up, what \u2013 can you talk us through the drivers positive and negative growth as you see 2021 as part of the guidance assumptions that you\u2019ve made around COVID place.\nRustom Jilla: First top of the year, we resumed that the \u2013 we would remain more or less the same broad macro impact on us. That\u2019s on fine fragrance, food, et cetera \u2013 food service, et cetera, as the second part of last year of 2020. And we expect that we recover to the second half should be better.\nOperator: Next we have Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael DeVeau: Faiza, are you there? Okay, maybe operator, we can go to the next question.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So Andreas I know there are some activists who are more than the market, but I know, you can\u2019t comment. Hello.\nAndreas Fibig: Hello? Yes, we can hear you.\nFaiza Alwy: Can you guys hear me?\nAndreas Fibig: Yes, we can. Can you go ahead? Faiza?\nFaiza Alwy: Hello.\nAndreas Fibig: Okay. Now we hear again.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll move next with Matthew Deyoe with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew Deyoe: Good morning. So you\u2019d said food service was down double digits on the quarter and on the gear. Can you be more specific? And we\u2019ve seen a lot of European lockdown headlines as well. So is that the decelerated in 1Q. And I guess more holistically, why didn\u2019t taste ex-food service grow mid-single digits are better? What is keeping \u2013 what ex or excluding the food service businesses keeping growth and taste in maybe the 1% to 2% range versus closer to mid single digits?\nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Let\u2019s talk about the food service first and thank you for the question. So food service in general, we\u2019ll come back certainly over the course of 2021 following up to the level of 2019, that we will achieve next year. But we have seen actually a better start into January was down high single digit, which was much better than we have seen in the last year. I think that\u2019s good despite the lockdowns in Europe. So it was driven by many of the other regions as well. What was impacting a taste in general was probably also the customer structure, because we had probably more, smaller customers and mid-sized customers compared to some of the competitors. But we see no good recovery and a better pipeline of new projects coming in. And as we said, actually, the start into 2021 was very, very promising. I hope that helps.\nMatthew Deyoe: It does. And as we look at the Scent business in 2021, what do you expect, like, fine fragrance obviously has some pretty easy comps, as we move through the year, but consumer scent business could move the other way. And how much room is there left to run on the new business wins? It seems like you made some very good traction in the back half of 2020.\nAndreas Fibig: Yes, no, absolutely. And as we see it for now, we triangulate that we are gaining market share here. And that has two effects. One is, as you touched on, it is certainly a COVID volume effect on personal wash and hygiene products, which we are taking fully and which is helping us to fill the growth. But we have made three new core wins, maybe year and half ago and these core wins, we are winning and growing our business quite significantly, double-digit, in these three year counts. And this has now a critical mass that it gives us some tailwind into 2021. So now the question is, will it stay a very strong business over the course of the year? And what we see right now? Yes, it will. We have started year-to-year very well as well. So we believe we will have good growth in 2022 as well on the consumer fragrance business, driven by the demand volume demand, but also by  that\u2019s very, very promising.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, thank you. Sorry about that before. I hope you guys can hear me now.\nAndreas Fibig: We can. Very clear.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay, great. So Andreas, there are some activist rumors in the market, but I know you can\u2019t comment on. But I was hoping you could reflect on your tenure as CEO. In the last few years, IFF has underperformed peers. So what do you think has driven that operating underperformance? Do you think you\u2019ve been focused on the right customers and categories? Have you invested appropriately in R&D or maybe have you been too focused on M&A, sort of, is there anything you would have done differently over the last few years?\nAndreas Fibig: Very good. Thank you, Faiza. First of all, when we started actually laying out or looking at our strategy in 2015, I think what went well, we had a very clear strategy, because the environment is changing or was changing. So we had different customer demands, maybe more integrated solutions, more demands for naturals. We have seen that the smaller customers have taking a bigger share, and that adjacencies play a role, not just for integrated solutions, but in general to move the business forward.  So I believe our strategy was very clear that that worked out very, very, very well. And that has led to achieve when we look at the company back in 2014, it was slightly grow of $3 billion in sales with the limited offering that point in time, and now we're in an $11 billion company with a very broad offering. And in many instances, we are number one or number two in the defined categories.  I think so our strategy and our response to the changing market was very, very good. We have basically positioned ourselves really to deliver very significant growth over the years to come. If you look at things, which might have gone better, we can touch on food or my \u2013 I think what went well is it was strategically the right move. We have good synergies on the cost side. I would say top line was challenged for many reasons. I think we learned our lesson on compliance certainly. And we probably could have integrated faster the European organization, which has done right now. I think that was important. And then in between, we certainly had the crisis in Scent we supply, and we have to turn around the business and I think that worked out very well. So in balance, I think the right strategy, the right moves, on the food side, I think some areas on the top line where some of it is compliance, let's say related, but we fixed it. I think we \u2013 and we fixed it fast, maybe faster than others would have done it. And we finally have integrated the commercial structure here as well.  So that's all what look at the next \u2013 at the last five years, and I think we are tremendously good positioned for the next couple of years right now. And I can promise you there are certainly no big acquisitions coming in the next couple of years. It's all focused about execution and shareholder value. That's very clear, because we have everything we need.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next with Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In terms of the effects of COVID on the DuPont business, in your business, you said that roughly 15% of your revenues were down 15%. So there's a 2.25% penalty. Is the penalty for the DuPont business bigger or smaller? And secondly, were you a customer of DuPont previous to the merger? And if you were, was it by a lot and are the other flavor and fragrance companies customers of DuPont, Chevy and Symrise.\nAndreas Fibig: I can take the customer piece first and then maybe Rustom you take the first part of it. So we had some customer relationships, but very, very little. The other flavors and fragrance companies had some business with legacy DuPont, because legacy DuPont was buying some flavors as well, but to a very, very limited demand. I think that's not another big movement, but Rustom if you could take the first piece of Jeff\u2019s question, please.\nRustom Jilla: Sure. It's roughly about 20% as we're getting to the numbers of N&Bs business was also impacted by COVID, Jeff. And it varied the impacts on different areas with biorefineries, microbials, food service, they raised a little bit, but that brought 15% reduction number. I would think at this point, I'd say it's in the ballpark. \nOperator: Our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. \nGhansham Panjabi: Hey guys, good morning. \nAndreas Fibig: Good morning.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thanks for putting me in. Just first off on Slide 14, where you listed out many of your 2021 assumptions. I'm just hoping you can just kind of help us with the tax rates guidance for 2021 CapEx as well on a pro forma basis. And also the EPS waiting between the first half and second half, just given your comments about the first half being challenging relative to the current COVID environment. Thanks so much.\nAndreas Fibig: Rustom?\nRustom Jilla: Yes. On the tax rates, I mean look, we've got a sense of how and what the taxes are, the one more time before we come out with that, right. Tax rates because remember DuPont N&B is a carve out. It's a carve out coming out of DuPont and so a whole lot of entities set up at numbers and work to be done. Their tax rate is definitely higher than our tax rate, which was in the year, it was 17.5% rate effective tax rate DuPont\u2019s is higher. We\u2019ll come back with more details there on that. Regarding the \u2013 your questions on the EPS, we actually focused on EBITDA more as the metric that we'd like to think gives us all the best from our owner's perspective, gives us the most clearest, most transparent ways of looking at it, sales and EBITDA performance on the business. And because we haven't actually provided guidance on EBITDA for the first quarter, I'd rather not sort of answer the \u2013 how the ask breakout, if you don't mind.\nGhansham Panjabi: I think Rustom, the question on CapEx for the full year expectation\u2026\nRustom Jilla: No change at all from what was in our S-4 that we had out there as it was like in the high 400s, 465, I think 470, somewhere about there. We have \u2013 we expected specifically $235 million from the N&B side and $230 million from ours. Sorry, missed, I forgot that one.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next with Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. \nAndreas Fibig: Hey, good morning, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: Hi, so two questions. One was more a technicality is just to understand on the long-term target of 4% to 5% FX neutral. Does that target need to change with the new methodology for revenue disclosure? Because inherently you're including some effects driven pricing in that. So I just wanted to make sure I understand that. And the second was just a longer-term question on that revenue target. And while I certainly appreciate taking a more conservative view and leaving room for delivery on synergies and so on to provide upside. I just wonder what that implies about your view on market growth, because with this transaction and with the objective of creating a different business model for the industry, your long-term revenue targets are sort of what they were before. And I'm just wondering how that relates to your view on market growth, because it just seems like a lot of work to sort of grow at the same pace you were targeting before. Thanks.\nAndreas Fibig: Let me Lauren I take the second piece and then I handed over to Rustom on the first piece. So listen, the revenue target and we were discussing it internally a lot. The issue right now for us is in this COVID period, we have certainly for 2021, let's say time for a slower start, because as Rustom said for the first half of the year, it's still a COVID time was a lockdown in Europe. So we take it a bit more carefully before we go full force.  We believe that the market grows will be impacted this year, in particularly the first six months. So that makes \u2013 make certain the on, let's say for a slower start. But looking further, we are actually pretty bullish, because if you take the average 4% to 5% for the following years, we had 5% and that's actually is for the two combined companies quite a nice and good target to go. And it's certainly above the average, both organizations that have done in the last two or three years.  So I feel good about it. And certainly it is the focus of the execution are very, let's say, very good exposure to some of the growth markets. And then certainly the cross selling opportunities, we are having and integrated solution, as you were mentioning, we are changing a bit the business model, yes. So that's how we see it, but more to come look at the end of the day, in these volatile times, we have to move forward into a debt as fast as we can. Rustom, if you can take the first piece of the question long-term target. \nRustom Jilla: Yes. Lauren, we set our long-term targets in dollars and using effects assumptions back at the time if you said that, right, actual dollars. So the methodology that we use doesn't actually change. So if the exact same situation applied over the last couple of years, our revenue dollars wouldn't have been any different, but the currency neutral growth would have been higher, right. Having said that, this is kind of interesting, if you took this morning's spot rates and assume that they extrapolated out for the entire year. I mean they are a couple of percent higher than that weighted average that we talked about earlier to answer the earlier question, right, that maybe up a percent on the prior year. So you have another couple of percent, and that would translate out into reported group, for sure, the actual reported dollar numbers would be higher, but I mean, you wouldn't see the currency neutral percentages coming off. So it's a complex kind of way of looking at it. But the bigger point, if you're looking about the way we came up with the actual numbers back then, and this is the \u2013 I just want to reinforce that. We had in the out years of our business growth from the base business without synergies and anything like that, growing at 3.5% to 4%, and that we think is realistic based on our Scent and Taste business, right. If I go back to that and the N&B business was in that ballpark as well. Okay, we think that's realistic going through those numbers. You put in the synergies, which are like $140 million in 2022 revenue and $300 million in 2023 our expectation and that's how you get up to the 5% that number is out there.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Rustom.\nMichael DeVeau: Operator, we\u2019ll take one more, if that\u2019s okey.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. \nPJ Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning. \nAndreas Fibig : Hi, good morning, PJ.\nPJ Juvekar: Thank you for taking my question. Good, good. So I got a couple of related questions on margins. Your operating leverage in the business is not coming through. And what I mean by that is if you take your effects out on cost and currency, in Scent, your sales were up 3% profit was flat, in Taste sales was down 5% at profit was down 10%. So why isn't the bottom line growing faster than the top line? That's my first question. And then I have a quick second question.\nAndreas Fibig : Okay. Rustom?\nRustom Jilla: Bottom line actually is growing faster. If you looked at our full year number in Scent, you will find that it's a ballpark. The full year number for us is ballpark about 3% on revenue growth, right, the way you see where it goes and much that's on profit. If you look at the \u2013 if you look at Scent in the quarter, we had and/or even quarter three for that matter, we've had very large increases coming through on that.  So we are seeing that. We have the \u2013 I think what you're factoring in, and this is an important point is on a full-year basis and also particularly in the fourth quarter, we had a large increase from AIP, right. We had a AIP going up quite a annual incentive plan, because 2019 was so bad, that there was a credit in 2019 in the fourth quarter whereas this time there were costs put in that, that I think from memory was around $27 million just to swing. I think that\u2026\nAndreas Fibig : Yes. And it\u2019s important because it will not repeat actually in 2021, so that's a good thing. Rustom?\nRustom Jilla: The other thing was \u2013 yes, sorry. \nAndreas Fibig : Move on.\nRustom Jilla: The other thing there is numbers is in the year is COVID. I mean COVID costs, not COVID the impact on revenue, which we've talked about at noseeum, but COVID the impact on cost. I mean the extra air freight costs, the extra sea freight costs, the extra personal protective equipment for our people, the working different ships, the paying extra compensation by the time you factor all of those in it's probably about 20 \u2013 it was around $26 million of extra cost in the year as well. \nAndreas Fibig : Thank you, Rustom.\nOperator: And we have reached our allotted time. I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Andreas for any closing remarks.\nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Thank you for the good question. We know we have a big line still for questions. We will continue with our one-on-ones was really good to talk to all of you and yes, more to come over the next couple of weeks and months. Thank you for that. Bye-bye. Thank you. \nRustom Jilla: Bye, everyone.\nOperator: And this does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your line at any time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Andreas. I'd only cover the P&L high points on this slide and get into additional detail as we go through the following several slides. In the fourth quarter, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, down 2% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. When excluding the roughly $50 million impact of 2019s 53rd week, a comparable currency neutral growth was plus 2%. And as I'll explain on the next slide up approximately 4% counting foreign exchange related price changes as appears in many CPGs disclose. Thanks, Andrea. Hi, Mark. The guidance that we provided Mark was in dollars, right, as we rolled out, if you think back, basically if you look at the S-4 and then when we talked about the synergies additional revenue synergies that we expected. So as we FX is very hard to call. I mean, we basically ran out the FX rates that we had as of the time we provided all those forward estimates. The new way of the new methodology, which we've talked about in any particular period and as we look back does give us a better growth rate. It doesn't change the overall actual dollars, right? Yes. I think Andreas covered everything else in your question there. The underlying \u2013 the pricing, I mean, we do expect the raw material costs during the period. I mean, higher raw material costs and recovery of that is based into our pricing as well. So maybe I'll address the FX part of it. I mean, if you think about, weighted average basket of our currencies, and we look at the biggest currencies for us the U.S. dollar is the biggest, but the Euro/Danish krona, because that's pretty much tied to the Euro. That's the second biggest. It's actually, when you put in the Danish krona, it's about 27%. Okay. Those are the two big ones. And then the other is, I mean, the Reals and of the Japanese Yen, the Indian rupee or many others, right. If we look to the weighted basket of those and if we look at the \u2013 what is in our basic budget this year was 2020 \u2013 2021 versus 2020, it was about a 1% difference. That's what we had. And then if you look at spot today, it's actually running better than that from our perspective from revenue. So our expected 2021 growth rate remains about 3.5%. That's what we put out there, right? With a small contribution from synergies and no change to the S-4  and as you've seen from our January 2021 preliminary sales growth around 3%, we've started, we've started roughly in line with expectations. First top of the year, we resumed that the \u2013 we would remain more or less the same broad macro impact on us. That's on fine fragrance, food, et cetera \u2013 food service, et cetera, as the second part of last year of 2020. And we expect that we recover to the second half should be better. Sure. It's roughly about 20% as we're getting to the numbers of N&Bs business was also impacted by COVID, Jeff. And it varied the impacts on different areas with biorefineries, microbials, food service, they raised a little bit, but that brought 15% reduction number. I would think at this point, I'd say it's in the ballpark. Yes. On the tax rates, I mean look, we've got a sense of how and what the taxes are, the one more time before we come out with that, right. Tax rates because remember DuPont N&B is a carve out. It's a carve out coming out of DuPont and so a whole lot of entities set up at numbers and work to be done. Their tax rate is definitely higher than our tax rate, which was in the year, it was 17.5% rate effective tax rate DuPont's is higher. We'll come back with more details there on that. Regarding the \u2013 your questions on the EPS, we actually focused on EBITDA more as the metric that we'd like to think gives us all the best from our owner's perspective, gives us the most clearest, most transparent ways of looking at it, sales and EBITDA performance on the business. And because we haven't actually provided guidance on EBITDA for the first quarter, I'd rather not sort of answer the \u2013 how the ask breakout, if you don't mind. No change at all from what was in our S-4 that we had out there as it was like in the high 400s, 465, I think 470, somewhere about there. We have \u2013 we expected specifically $235 million from the N&B side and $230 million from ours. Sorry, missed, I forgot that one. Yes. Lauren, we set our long-term targets in dollars and using effects assumptions back at the time if you said that, right, actual dollars. So the methodology that we use doesn't actually change. So if the exact same situation applied over the last couple of years, our revenue dollars wouldn't have been any different, but the currency neutral growth would have been higher, right. Having said that, this is kind of interesting, if you took this morning's spot rates and assume that they extrapolated out for the entire year. I mean they are a couple of percent higher than that weighted average that we talked about earlier to answer the earlier question, right, that maybe up a percent on the prior year.

            "name": "Andreas Fibig",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thank you, all who have joined us today as close to tiptoe and legacy IFF and begin a new journey with N&B. We will begin by sharing a detailed look into all fourth quarter and the full year 2020 results, and then Rustom and I will highlight the go forward outlook and opportunity for the new IFF.  I'm really excited and proud to say that as of February 1, we have officially completed our merger with DuPont N&B. Our teams have hit the ground running, establishing our new company, as an innovation leader and the global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. For the close of the N&B transaction, we also unveiled a new brand identity and purpose intended to unify our organization and best position all divisions for success. As a purpose driven enterprise, we share a mission to build from strengths and transform our industry. We are now squarely focused on execution. Building on recent performance to leverage the exciting capabilities and brought our customer base of our new company. I'm confident that the direction that we are moving and the opportunity ahead of us will lead to accelerated growth and improve profitability as we generate strong value creation and total shareholder return.  Beginning with Slide 6, I would like to recap what was truly a remarkable 2020. Amidst an unprecedented pandemic, the challenge to our global organization, we delivered solid financial results, while embarking on a transformational journey to create a new industry leader together with DuPont N&B. Thank you, Rustom. Turning to Slide 17, let's focus on 2021 and the new IFF with the N&B business. Our team's executed well on the tremendous integration planning for the transformational combination, despite working remotely due to COVID-19. This integration planning effort more than a year long has provided an opportunity to create the right team and operating model needed to secure a global leadership position. It has been driven by the lessons we have learned in past integrations across both organizations, running our plans and practical experience that will enable near-term execution. We set out an aggressive timeline in 2019 to close and complete integration planning in 2020. A global pandemic only challenged us even further. But I'm very pleased to say that our teams work extraordinarily well together to compete every aspect out integration planning. I'm confident that the new IFF is ideally positioned to succeed. With this planning complete, we can entirely focus on execution, delivering our commitment and realizing significant revenue cost synergies, resulting in significant value creation for shareholders for the years to come. Let's move to Slide 18 and take a second and we focus on the value proposition of the new IFF. Our new company is poised to realize significant value for all of our stakeholders. And these two highly complementary companies form a true innovation partner for all customers. The new IFF will be a force in shaping the future of our industry. Our R&D investment will be 1.5 times greater than our nearest sphere. We will have number one or number two positions on core categories and nutrition, cultures, enzymes, probiotics, soy proteins, flavors and fragrances. This is coupled with a broadest and most diverse customer base in our industry more than 45,000 in total and about 48% of our annual sales from small, medium and private label customers. We are well positioned to drive profitable growth for our shareholders. This allows us to enhance the value we can deliver to our customers in a very powerful way. We can deliver value to customers in every interaction from leading product offerings to significant benefits of speed to market and supply chain simplification as we deliver market leading integrated solutions. I think it is important to remember that while the N&B transaction is a culminating and transformational move, it is completely consistent how we have been evolving the portfolio over the past five years. Our friendly focused on positioning the company for where the industry is going, not where it has been. As we acquired more naturals, more regional supply chains, reaching smaller customers and increasing technology and science that innovation. Actions like Frutarom, Lucas Meyer, Ottens Flavors and others were important foundational steps as we executed this strategy. As we look ahead, we are pleased we have the most complete portfolio in the business, while portfolio may change around the edges. It is complete and gives us a right base to grow and the right assets to drives a financial results you see from our long-term targets. Put simply the new IFF will be the strongest part that to customers worldwide to corporate essential solutions for on-trend innovation. Now to Slide 19, I would like to emphasize the long-term value creation potential we have seen for IFF. Our new company has substantial synergy opportunities that will drive growth and expand margins. So our integration planning we confirmed, the run rate revenue synergy expectation at approximately $400 million by 2024 was a contribution of at least $145 million of EBITDA by that time. In addition, we expect to achieve meaningful cost savings, including a runway cost synergy expectation of $300 million by the end of 2023. We expect that execution on our plan will unlock about $50 million in EBITDA contribution in 2021. I think it's important to say that any combination is not just about synergies, but also too strong and leading based businesses. Our leaders across legacy IFF and legacy N&B businesses are committed to running every part of this business, both space business and combined to use superior results. This requires a mindset of continuous improvement and operational excellence that we're embracing across the organization. It is critical to underscore that with a comprehensive structure in place to track our progress against the identified objectives. At the center of our discussion will be synergy realization, where we'll be track diligently, including the one-time costs in both expense and capital. Our hope is to highlight on a continuous basis, all value creation leavers to provide you with a critical how component of our value creation story. And in the end, while we are focused on synergy realization, success will not be defined just as that. It will be the cumulative results where synergies are edited to base business performance for a stronger total P&L. On Slide 20, I want to highlight the actions that will be immediately taken to begin the execution. One of the most questions we get from investors is not, what will you deliver, but instead, how will you actually do it? As you can imagine, synergy capture is all about the how. And as we mentioned on January 11, there are 85 separate initiatives behind the $300 million cost savings that in our plan on the cost side and another several initiatives on the revenue side. We tried to give you a flavor for the type of actions that are part of these initiatives. In terms of revenue synergies, we've engaged with our top global and regional customers to introduce joint portfolio and capabilities accelerated co-development partnership with global customers, activated cost division on innovation and collaboration in R&D and launch combined commercial excellence and integrated solution teams. At a high level, I would characterize the cost actions as follow. First, whether it's the publication we elevate the duplication, you can imagine across two global companies, there's a lot of duplication in back office and admin functions. Second, we look to align our cost structure with best in class PS, where it is comparable. We have undertaken benchmarking cross functions like G&A, which gives us a tangible target for improvement. No two organizations identical. So we use this as a goal rather than prescription. So it \u2013 whether it's efficiency, we spread the benefits of dollars, spend across a larger base. Let me give you an example. Also, organizations invest in R&D, but can now leverage across double the categories and customers. This is powerful and shows you the benefit of global scale for supporting cutting edge science investments. First, I would report all the power of centralized services. We have had powered regional business leaders, who drive their P&Ls, but they have access to the best in class global shared service centers in areas like HR, finance and procurement, where there's a tangible benefit to scale and combined resources. And finally, we have set all of our incentive compensation metrics to reflect in align with our waste business and integration objectives. I really hope this gives you some flavor for the how, we now know the targets we want to deliver and we have told you our long-term goals. So over the coming quarters focus will be very much on these actions. Let's turn to Slide 21. The new IFF is set to deliver a best in class financial profile and maximize value for our shareholders. This slide summarizes our long-term outlook, which we introduce to investors at the beginning of this year. From a revenue perspective, we expect continued organic sales growth of approximately 4% to 5% over the next few years, led by our unrivaled product and solutions portfolio, which is set to benefit from our industry leading R&D programs. We also expect to see meaningful operating margin improvements for IFF, including an estimated adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 26% in 2023 up around 400 basis points from our 2020 performance. The new IFF will continue to generate strong free cash flows and we expect a significant increase to approximately $2 billion in 2023. As we pursue further gross, so our capital management and delevering, we remain \u2013 that will remain a core priority. We are targeting on those three times net debt to EBITDA ratio 24 to 36 months post-close and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining our investment grade rating. Finishing on Slide 22, I would like to thank you all again for joining our call. Across the world, our teams have worked tirelessly throughout a difficult year to ensure IFF continue to serve our customers and deliver strong business results. Our full year financial results showcase the strengths of our portfolio and most importantly, our people. So those challenging environment, we made tremendous progress on our transformational journey. The formation of the new IFF together with N&B has made us an even stronger company, better positioned to deliver value for our stakeholders. With the pre-integration process completed, it's now time to execute. We have the team and structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet our financial and operating goals in order to shape the future of our industry and improve our world. By global volatility is expected to persists, foundational commitment to our people, customers, communities and planet will remain unchanged as we look to strengthen and redefine our role as the industry leading ingredients and solutions partner. I'm really thrilled by IFF exciting new chapter, and hope that you will join us on our pursuit to revolutionize the industry and deliver for customers, teams and shareholders. So before opening to questions, please note that our plan for Q&A today is to focus on our results and outlook and not to address questions about market rumors. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Mark. A very important question. I take the first piece and then I give it on the FX to Rustom. We are very confident that we are very much on track for the long-term targets. Let me explain why. You see that for example, Scent a very important division of ours has turned around quite significantly already in a very tough year, like 2020. And we see good signs also early this year that this journey will continue. So we are basically here on very much on track. The second one is taste. And taste has a bit of a performance issue in the years 2019 and then reaching into 2020. But we have seen some sequential improvement and a good start to 2021 as well. We have done all the actions we have to take to bring this division back on track. We have basically split the European region into Europe, Western Europe, Africa, Middle East to put more focus on the emerging markets and on the more mature markets. We have put a lot of, let's say, focus on integration efforts of the Frutarom organization, particularly in Europe last year. So fully integrated and we have restructured our go-to-market strategy and it looks like that we are starting to perform well. So I think that's very confident on the legacy IFF side. On N&B, I think it depends, you've seen a lot of pieces of the portfolio, which has a good growth profile, and we will continue and we should not underestimate that parts of the portfolio was also particular last year pressured by COVID. And that will help, at least in the second half of this year to come out of that. And secondly, we have \u2013 certainly, we have seen actually good customer response as well on their portfolio. And in terms of recent wins. On top of it, we have the cross selling and integrated solutions, which will help us to increase our growth rate as well. So we are very confident that we can do it. On the EBITDA margin, we took on legacy IFF. We took actions, we started, as I said, was Scent division or just on sales, but on EBITDA as well. We see good improvement. The same will happen on the taste side and actually I'm less worried about the N&B side, because there's not actually a good EBITDA, let's say increase of margins in the last couple of years. With that, that I hand it over to Rustom to comment on FX days. Hello? Yes, we can hear you. Yes, we can. Can you go ahead? Faiza? Okay. Now we hear again. Yes. Let's talk about the food service first and thank you for the question. So food service in general, we'll come back certainly over the course of 2021 following up to the level of 2019, that we will achieve next year. But we have seen actually a better start into January was down high single digit, which was much better than we have seen in the last year. I think that's good despite the lockdowns in Europe. So it was driven by many of the other regions as well. What was impacting a taste in general was probably also the customer structure, because we had probably more, smaller customers and mid-sized customers compared to some of the competitors. But we see no good recovery and a better pipeline of new projects coming in. And as we said, actually, the start into 2021 was very, very promising. I hope that helps. Yes, no, absolutely. And as we see it for now, we triangulate that we are gaining market share here. And that has two effects. One is, as you touched on, it is certainly a COVID volume effect on personal wash and hygiene products, which we are taking fully and which is helping us to fill the growth. But we have made three new core wins, maybe year and half ago and these core wins, we are winning and growing our business quite significantly, double-digit, in these three year counts. And this has now a critical mass that it gives us some tailwind into 2021. So now the question is, will it stay a very strong business over the course of the year? And what we see right now? Yes, it will. We have started year-to-year very well as well. So we believe we will have good growth in 2022 as well on the consumer fragrance business, driven by the demand volume demand, but also by  that's very, very promising. We can. Very clear. Very good. Thank you, Faiza. First of all, when we started actually laying out or looking at our strategy in 2015, I think what went well, we had a very clear strategy, because the environment is changing or was changing. So we had different customer demands, maybe more integrated solutions, more demands for naturals. We have seen that the smaller customers have taking a bigger share, and that adjacencies play a role, not just for integrated solutions, but in general to move the business forward.  So I believe our strategy was very clear that that worked out very, very, very well. And that has led to achieve when we look at the company back in 2014, it was slightly grow of $3 billion in sales with the limited offering that point in time, and now we're in an $11 billion company with a very broad offering. And in many instances, we are number one or number two in the defined categories.  I think so our strategy and our response to the changing market was very, very good. We have basically positioned ourselves really to deliver very significant growth over the years to come. If you look at things, which might have gone better, we can touch on food or my \u2013 I think what went well is it was strategically the right move. We have good synergies on the cost side. I would say top line was challenged for many reasons. I think we learned our lesson on compliance certainly. And we probably could have integrated faster the European organization, which has done right now. I think that was important. And then in between, we certainly had the crisis in Scent we supply, and we have to turn around the business and I think that worked out very well. So in balance, I think the right strategy, the right moves, on the food side, I think some areas on the top line where some of it is compliance, let's say related, but we fixed it. I think we \u2013 and we fixed it fast, maybe faster than others would have done it. And we finally have integrated the commercial structure here as well.  So that's all what look at the next \u2013 at the last five years, and I think we are tremendously good positioned for the next couple of years right now. And I can promise you there are certainly no big acquisitions coming in the next couple of years. It's all focused about execution and shareholder value. That's very clear, because we have everything we need. I can take the customer piece first and then maybe Rustom you take the first part of it. So we had some customer relationships, but very, very little. The other flavors and fragrance companies had some business with legacy DuPont, because legacy DuPont was buying some flavors as well, but to a very, very limited demand. I think that's not another big movement, but Rustom if you could take the first piece of Jeff's question, please. Good morning. Rustom? Hey, good morning, Lauren. Let me Lauren I take the second piece and then I handed over to Rustom on the first piece. So listen, the revenue target and we were discussing it internally a lot. The issue right now for us is in this COVID period, we have certainly for 2021, let's say time for a slower start, because as Rustom said for the first half of the year, it's still a COVID time was a lockdown in Europe. So we take it a bit more carefully before we go full force.  We believe that the market grows will be impacted this year, in particularly the first six months. So that makes \u2013 make certain the on, let's say for a slower start. But looking further, we are actually pretty bullish, because if you take the average 4% to 5% for the following years, we had 5% and that's actually is for the two combined companies quite a nice and good target to go. And it's certainly above the average, both organizations that have done in the last two or three years.  So I feel good about it. And certainly it is the focus of the execution are very, let's say, very good exposure to some of the growth markets. And then certainly the cross selling opportunities, we are having and integrated solution, as you were mentioning, we are changing a bit the business model, yes. So that's how we see it, but more to come look at the end of the day, in these volatile times, we have to move forward into a debt as fast as we can. Rustom, if you can take the first piece of the question long-term target. Thank you, Rustom. Hi, good morning, PJ. Okay. Rustom? Yes. And it's important because it will not repeat actually in 2021, so that's a good thing. Rustom? Move on. Thank you, Rustom. Yes. Thank you for the good question. We know we have a big line still for questions. We will continue with our one-on-ones was really good to talk to all of you and yes, more to come over the next couple of weeks and months. Thank you for that. Bye-bye. Thank you."

I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements.\n During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in our yesterday's press release. \n Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website as well. \n With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. \n With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas. \nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into our third quarter performance, I would like to, once again, take a moment to thank all of our frontline workers and dedicated colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly throughout the course of this year to continue fueling our global supply chain and meeting our customers' needs. But every business is built to weather pandemic. But over the last few months, we have continued to show that our business is well equipped to navigate the most unpredictable of storms. I can't thank each and every one of our passionate employees enough of their continued hard work, dedication and focus throughout this difficult year. \n On today's call, I will start, as usually, by reviewing IFF's recent third quarter performance and summarizing the trends that we are experiencing across the business before providing a more in-depth review of our year-to-date performance. Rustom will then provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financials. I will then provide an outlook on the road ahead for our business and provide an update on our merger with DuPont N&B and the integration planning efforts that are well underway.\n Despite the COVID-related headwinds, we saw a strong sequential improvement across all key financial metrics in Q3. We achieved 1% currency-neutral sales growth in the third quarter, a 500 bps improvement relative to our second quarter 2020 results. Outside of Fine Fragrance and Food Service, IFF's portfolio remains resilient with growth of 3% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and 4% year-to-date. Nearly every category, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, is growing, led by a third consecutive quarter of double-digit currency-neutral growth in Consumer Fragrance.\n We continue to experience challenges in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which saw improve relatively in Q2 sales, declined 14% this quarter on a currency-neutral basis. These segments continue to be the most affected among our portfolio by pandemic-driven trends in retail and away-from-home channels. On our second quarter earnings call, we presented this monthly chart to provide increased transparency during the uncertain period. At the time, July finished was about 2% growth. In the subsequent months of August and September, we saw a modest deceleration in sales performance versus July, actually, largely due to weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. \n Now let's turn to Slide 7, where I would like to review our year-to-date performance 2020 basis. Our Flavors category, excluding Food Service, is resilient, growing low single digits. Outside of Food Service, all categories are growing. Inclusions led the segment with impressive double-digit growth, followed by mid single-digit growth in Natural Product Solutions and Savory Solutions, again, all excluding Food Service. From a regional perspective, growth was led by a double-digit improvement in North America and Greater Asia, where new win performance is strong. In EAME, results were challenged, which is in an area where we are focused on improving as we move forward. \n I want to take a moment to formally welcome our new Taste division leader, Kathy Fortmann. On October 1, Kathy officially took over leadership of our Taste division. She is an outstanding executive with experience across our industry and joined IFF early in 2020 as part of our succession planning for IFF as well as post our combination with N&B. In her short term with IFF, Kathy has already brought tremendous expertise and insights to our team, leading IFF integration of Taste with N&B food and beverage platform. With a proven track record of delivering growth and innovation at global food and beverage ingredients organizations, I'm confident Kathy will do an exceptional job leading our Taste business now and the Taste, Food and Beverage division following transaction close.\n I also want to thank Matthias Haeni who has retired from IFF after 30 years in our industry. He had a long and successful career. And during his tenure with IFF he has advanced our position as leader within the taste industry. I wish him the very best for his next chapter. Overall, IFF Scent division continues to perform very well. I'm proud to share that we have achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, with double-digit growth in Fabric Care, Home Care, Air Care and Personal Wash. Our new core list customers where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, are growing more than 50% this year, in the third quarter provided a double-digit contribution to Consumer Fragrance growth. Particularly, I want to note that our entire Consumer Fragrance team have worked diligently through the pandemic to differentiate our offerings, win new business and achieve strong market share gains. \n In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong. Yet the pandemic created a raw material headwind in Q2 as we prioritized the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business foregoing external sales. As restriction has eased, the business improved sequentially, but on a year-to-year basis remains down slightly. The areas most impacted by COVID-19 have been Food Service and Fine Fragrances. On a year-to-date base, Food Service and Fine Fragrances are down almost 20% as COVID-related actions impacted consumer behavior as well as retail channels have been temporarily closed, and travel retail is down.\n As I stated earlier, we are encouraged that the Fine Fragrance and Food Service improved in Q3 relative to Q2 sales on a currency-neutral basis. Yet we remain cautious about trends given the increase in COVID-19 infections more recently. Excluding Fine Fragrance, Scent has achieved strong currency-neutral growth rate of plus 8% year-to-date, while Taste has improved 2% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding Food Service. \n With that, I would like to pass it over to Rustom to provide more details on the third quarter. \nRustom Jilla: Thank you, Andreas. Slide 8 provides a high-level overview of Q3's financial performance. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, a 1% increase from 2019's third quarter. Scent was up 4% and Taste down 1%, and I'll provide additional divisional color in a few minutes. As Andreas noted, Q3 sales recovered from Q2's low point and over 3/4 of our $69 million sequential improvement came from Scent, and total IFF sales improved in all 4 regions.\n In the third quarter, our adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, increased 1% to $241 million on a currency-neutral basis from 2019's Q3. Our gross profit and gross margin were both higher than the third quarter of 2019 despite higher COVID-19-related manufacturing expenses and logistics costs. Continued OpEx controls and lower T&E essentially offset additional personnel-related COVID-19 costs and other inflationary increases. On a currency-neutral basis, interest, other income and expenses, taxes and noncontrolling interests together amounted to an additional $1 million headwind versus last Q3. And adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.40, up 1%. \n Note that FX movements adversely impacted our reported numbers. On a reported basis, Q3 sales were flat and adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, was down 4%. Balance sheet revaluation FX losses had a large negative impact in other income and expenses as a result both of weaker emerging market currencies against the dollar and a stronger euro. Currency volatility has impacted OIE all year, with Q1 and Q3 negative and Q2 positive. \n We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market currency devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition. So on Slide 9, I want to take a moment to show what our currency-neutral growth in the third quarter would be using the same calculation methodology of our peers. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local currencies.\n So when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude those foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. During the third quarter of 2020, continued currency devaluations year-over-year in several key emerging markets would have added approximately 2 percentage points to growth if we include those foreign exchange-related price changes in our emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, we estimate that our third quarter currency-neutral sales growth would have been 3% versus the 1% we have shared. And using this methodology Scent with its strong LatAm businesses would have 8% plus Q3 growth, while Taste would have been flat. \n Moving on to Slide 10. It is worth taking a closer look at the underlying business and market dynamics influencing our overall profitability in the quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, our sequential improvement in sales was accompanied by a strong rebound in profitability relative to our Q2 performance. Our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, grew 1% in Q3, clearly not what we want, but substantially better than the year-on-year decrease of 19% we reported in the second quarter. As expected, price to raw material costs was a gross margin headwind as was unfavorable mix due to our Fine Fragrance business.\n Also affecting profitability for the third quarter were incremental COVID-19 costs, which essentially doubled from Q2. The incremental manufacturing and logistics expenses related to COVID-19 that we had incurred in Q2 flowed into the P&L in Q3 as inventories were used. And we also paid a bonus to our essential workers around the world as they continued their exceptional service to our customers during this unprecedented time. In the end, we were able to offset these negatives through a combination of productivity initiatives in Scent and Frutarom cost synergies in Taste and tight cost management throughout IFF.\n We have been very careful with hiring, with headcount down over the course of the year, have been tighter in general within expenses and, of course, have had lower T&E costs like most businesses. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were up less than 1% despite absorbing the usual inflationary increases and COVID-19-related costs. As we forge ahead, especially in this uncertain environment, we will continue to drive growth but also review our cost structure to find additional opportunities to support overall profitability levels. \n Now turning to Slide 11, where we take a closer look at the performance of the Scent division in the quarter. Scent sales totaling $503 million were up 4% overall as Consumer Fragrance continues to outperform. Specifically our Fabric, Home, Hair Care and Personal Wash product categories all experienced robust growth and are also benefiting from the pandemic-related increase in global consumer staples purchases. As Andreas noted earlier, it's not all COVID-19 related. We are seeing strong growth from our new core list customers that we recently gained access to.\n While Fine Fragrance sales remain challenged, Q3's 14% decrease is a significant improvement from last quarter, where sales were down 40%. Importantly, our Fragrance Ingredients business, which was impacted by COVID-19-related supply constraints in Q2, returned to growth, led by double-digit gains in Cosmetic Actives. These metrics are encouraging and reflect the recovery this summer in global retail markets and consumers' ability to reach them. In addition, the Scent division saw meaningful profit improvement this quarter, as segment profit grew 20% to $101 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, strong benefits from management productivity initiatives and cost discipline and tight OpEx controls. \n Moving on to Slide 12, where we focus on the performance of our Taste division. While we saw sequential improvements in Food Service compared with a 36% decline in the second quarter of 2020, this remained under pressure in the third quarter, declining 13% on a currency-neutral basis versus the prior year as the pandemic limited food consumption away from home. To put this in context, Food Service took Taste's overall sales growth down by roughly 2 percentage points. That said, the rest of the Taste portfolio, excluding Food Service, delivered positive currency-neutral growth across all global markets. One particular bright spot was North America, where IFF realized double-digit growth in Taste across nearly all categories.\n We continue to see weaker growth in the other regions due to COVID-19 and related regulatory restrictions such as EAME, Latin America and Greater Asia. Natural Product Solutions, our food ingredients business, and our North American Flavors businesses were the strongest performing in the quarter, while Savory and Inclusion both more impacted by Food Service were negative in the quarter. Frutarom declined 2% compared to the prior year as their strong presence in Food Service and customer base of mostly smaller local and regional customers continued to be more adversely impacted by COVID-19. For  Taste overall, the segment achieved a 13.3% profit margin, with $102 million in segment profit on $765 million in sales. Benefits from acquisition-related synergies and tight OpEx controls were more than offset by lower sales volume, unfavorable price to raw materials costs and higher COVID-19-related costs.\n Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's strong and growing cash flow position. The chart on the left illustrates the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow and includes all key drivers. Operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 8% and 30% this quarter, respectively, led by core working capital improvements and stepped up reviews of capital expenditure. Our thoughtful and disciplined approach to investments amid the pandemic has resulted in CapEx of approximately 3.3% of sales versus 4.2% the prior year.\n While continuing to support our customers and suppliers, our teams have also been very focused on optimizing working capital, and our cash conversion cycle has improved 8 days year-over-year. We clearly need to generate cash, given our leverage and the impending merger with N&B. So it's good to see the improvements in days payables outstanding and days sales outstanding. Where inventory is concerned, we did see a small improvement in inventory days with more originally projected for Q4. But now with COVID-19 picking up again, we will increase our safety stocks. Note that we are not expecting to repeat last Q4's strong cash flow performance this year, primarily because of the benefit last year from extra sales and collections in the 53rd week. Further, despite continued stress in all industries across the globe, we believe that this quarter's strong balance sheet is a testament to our continued capital allocation focus and discipline. \n Moving to Slide 14. As we look to remainder of 2020 and into 2021, we will remain laser-focused on maintaining discipline across our balance sheet to ensure that IFF is well positioned as we navigate a prolonged challenging market environment. The situation remains highly uncertain, given the steady increase in global COVID-19 infections and the potential for additional regulatory restrictions in various regions. We're incredibly fortunate that the majority, roughly 85% of IFF's portfolio, has remained resilient and essential around the world for food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products. Unfortunately, the persistence or even worsening of the pandemic will likely translate into continued weakness for Fine Fragrance and Food Service in Q4.\n I will also remind you that we face a very strong Q4 comparison to last year, which had a 53rd week of sales and profit contributions. As we noted at the time, this represented about 400 basis points of growth in the fourth quarter last year and is a large, roughly $50 million headwind, this quarter and will occur all in the last week of December 2020, impacting our monthly performance comparative significantly. This extra week last year also clearly came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it is hard to be precise, we estimate that this will represent a $15 million to $20 million headwind for us in Q4. \n We began the fourth quarter with low single digits growth in October on a currency-neutral basis, in line with Q3's results. Based on this first month and given the uncertainty, it's unlikely that we will see higher growth for the full fourth quarter than the 1% we achieved in Q3. That is before taking into account the headwinds from the 53rd week. In this uncertain and difficult environment, we are more than ever controlling what we can control such as OpEx and also capital expenditure. And of course, we remain focused on driving strong cash flow and reducing leverage. \n And with that, I'll hand it back to Andreas to discuss the near-term road ahead for IFF. \nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Rustom. Before providing an update on our pre-integration work with N&B, I want to spend a moment on the progress we have made on our Frutarom integration. On Slide 15, I'm pleased to share that we have made strong strides with our Frutarom integration work. As of the third quarter 2020, we have complete integration of our business teams and believe that by the first quarter 2021 we will substantially complete our manufacturing optimization plan essentially at 90% of the consolidated -- consolidation complete. As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related complexity, we are delayed about 6 to 8 weeks was our original projection, but remain on track to be largely complete in the first quarter of 2021 around the time of our transaction close with N&B.\n As a reminder, as part of the Frutarom integration initiative, we expect to close approximately 35 manufacturing sites. For the end of 2020, we are on track to close between 20 to 24 sites around the world and expect to be completely finished by the end of 2021. With the integration of Frutarom, we have learned a lot. This experience has been important for IFF, and we will leverage these experiences and apply lessons learned as we take next step with DuPont N&B. First, we have put more ability to deliver value through cost synergies. We know how to build teams to quickly and efficiently identify and capture these opportunities in ways that create real shareholder value.\n Second, revenue synergies need to align with the product development life cycle. We need to recognize in our planning that this can mean that these synergies take more time to achieve, but the key takeaways being start early to ensure delivery. As of today, we have a strong pipeline of Frutarom-related cross-selling projects, over 2,000 with a pipeline potential of approximately $235 million, and we believe we are on track to meet or exceed our target for 2021. Third, we need to recognize the potential for sales dis-synergies plan accordingly to properly mitigate and anticipate when it can't be avoided. Fourth, we must build teams and organizational functions that protect base business growth. This was a major consideration how we designed the organization structure at our future combined company. Growth through synergies and innovation have to be incremental to core business growth.\n And fifth, we need to move with speed and be decisive. There's always an urge to be cautious through integration as 2 cultures learn to work together. We have to break down these barriers with focused, accountable leadership towards clear shared goals prioritizing profitable growth. I will also add that moving towards a transformational merger and working through the challenges of a global pandemic has forced all of us at IFF to work in new ways. We have learned quite a bit in these last several months and in many ways it has forced us to take a fresh look at our business in a way that I think will prove beneficial as we continue in our transformation journey. \n Turning to Slide 16. I'm pleased to share an update on our integration planning process for our previously announced merger with DuPont N&B. As you can see, we have reached all targets for the second half of 2020 and are on track with our targeted close date of February 1, 2021. The 3 notable milestones we achieved in the third quarter 2020 include a successful shareholder award, the completion of the permanent financing and the announcement of the executive team minus 1 leadership teams. I'm pleased to have received a strong support of IFF shareholders who have recognized this unique opportunity to create significant long-term value.\n With more than 99% of the votes cast in favor, IFF shareholders have overwhelmingly approved the issuance of shares pursuant to the merger agreement, through which IFF and N&B will combine to create a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions for global food, beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. We also completed a successful pricing of the $6.25 billion bond offering in September. This financing, together with the previously procured term loan facility, will provide N&B with the funding needed to make the special cash payment of USD 7.3 billion to DuPont in connection with the completion of our merger with N&B. I'm happy to report that there was tremendous interest in the bond offering. The interest rates were favorable and the offering was significantly oversubscribed. \n I'm also happy to announce that at the end of last week, we received antitrust approval in Mexico, which was 1 of the 2 remaining jurisdictions where we needed for approval. As we move towards close, we have only a few integration milestones left to reach and are confident in our abilities to execute on our post-closing time line. We anticipate receiving antitrust approval for Europe in December and will be filing our amended S-4 with updated pro formas in the coming months. \n I continue to be very excited about the combination between IFF and N&B. I believe we have a significant amount of opportunities to create strong shareholder value in the future. We actively review our portfolios on a constant basis, especially in light of the future combination with N&B to look to maximize our returns by driving growth in accretive categories and deprioritizing our low-value businesses by reducing allocations of expense and capital fixed or exit completely with divestitures. \n Moving on to Slide 17. In summary, I continue to value the continued resilience of our portfolio during an exceptionally challenging time for all industries and communities across the globe. Despite this unpredictable environment, we have delivered sustained growth across some of our largest segments and returned to growth in others in the third quarter. Our 1% currency-neutral growth for the quarter marks an important sequential improvement from Q2. And excluding Fine Fragrance and Food Service, we are pleased to have delivered 4% year-to-year currency-neutral growth with improvement across nearly all categories. We also made great progress in our N&B pre-integration planning and remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021.\n As global conditions remain volatile and unpredictable, we will continue to focus on controlling the controllable, to drive strong cash flow, maintain strong operational capital discipline and leverage the strength of our portfolio to depth and succeed. I'm proud and grateful to all of our employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to ensure the continuity and resiliency of our business, all while delivering for our 30,000 customers across the globe and executing on the integration process for Frutarom and N&B. While we recognize we always have opportunities to improve, in particular, on within our Taste division, I'm confident that as we move ahead, we will improve our performance as we did in our Scent division over the past few years, both in terms of sales through new customer, core lists and margins through operational performance programs. I believe that we have the strategy and the team in place to position our organization for long-term success both now and upon uniting with N&B. \n With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. \nMark Astrachan: I wanted to ask about adjusted EBIT and EBITDA performance versus your peers. So the European peers, at least by my math, have seen profit growth in the first half and anticipated for the full year. Based on what you just walked through, Rustom, I get down mid-single digits or so for your business on each in 2020. So I guess the question is why has IFF underperformed? And perhaps, could you walk through the specifics of pressures on gross margin and SG&A? And when do you anticipate those trends to normalize versus peers? And just related to that, a quick one for you, Rustom, probably. Could you just provide the Frutarom synergies in the third quarter as that was no longer provided in the Q? \nRustom Jilla: Will do. And yes, a long question, so let me make sure I cover all of it. Look, first of all, on the competitors' performance, I mean, I can't really comment on our competitors' performance. But let me take you through ours and give you some context. So our year-to-date -- so, see not Q3, our year-to-date adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, is down 4%, and that's on currency-neutral sales growth of plus 1%. So that's clearly not good, but here are the drivers. So we had a negative type this quarter. We had a negative sales mix. I mean, Fine Fragrance -- I mean you've seen the impact in Q2 in particular and minus 40% and then Q3 as well, much lesser, but you've seen it in there. There's unfavorable price to raw material costs. Now that's mainly Fragrance Ingredients, and that's mainly price reductions in advance of raw material declines. There's COVID-19-related incremental costs. I mean, we put the -- we've shown you the bridge on the slides in the quarter.\n But if you look at the year, I mean we're talking about almost just a little under $20 million in costs that we've actually incurred on COVID. And incentive comp, I mean incentive comp as well year-on-year, if you remember, we expected a year-on-year headwind when we finish because of everything that had happened last year. And that has played through and to a little extent in the quarter and certainly in the full year as well. Then, of course, you've got the basic. And then on the other side, some of the positives in the year-to-date, it's been a negative on volume, and that's because of Q2. But in Q3, volume was actually a positive. And synergies, I mean, synergies have been a positive all year-long in what we've seen. And then, of course, there's productivity and cost discipline, right? So I'll come to Frutarom in a second.\n Earlier in the year, we were unsure as to the severity and the duration of COVID-19. So we choke back hiring. And we acted to control expenses, but we decided against taking costs out of IFF. And now with infections rising and no line of sight as to countermeasures, I mean vaccine comments notwithstanding, we are planning on acting to reduce costs over the coming months. And then Frutarom. You asked about Frutarom. And look, despite COVID-19, we're still on track to deliver on the procurement and manufacturing optimization cost synergy of $50 million that we outlined earlier this year. We did modify the 10-Q and it's not required to disclose the exact amounts every quarter. But I can tell you, we had $10-plus million of synergies in Q3. So when you combine that with the first half savings of $32 million, that puts us at $42 million, $43 million, something like that, and clearly on track to achieve our full year $50 million goal. And Mark, just to remind you, our target was $100 million by year 2 and $145 million by year 3. Did I cover everything in there that you asked? \nMichael Deveau: His line may be muted. Rustom, sorry. So maybe we'll go to the next question. Mark, if you have another question, feel free to jump back in the queue. \nOperator: Heidi Vesterinen with Exane BNP. \nHeidi Vesterinen: So a question on Taste. I understand the pandemic related challenge in out-of-home, but it does appear that you've had additional challenges. This year, you have negative organic and margin hit by input costs. Your peers are not talking about this. Last year, I think it was destocking by multinational customers. Your peers were not seeing this. Can you talk about what explains this underperformance? And you finished your presentation talking about there being a strategy in place to change this. So could you maybe tell us about your action point? \nAndreas Fibig: Sure, Heidi. I can take it. I think, first, please remember that we need to adjust the reporting differences, specifically FX-related pricing. But I think Rustom talked about that. Certainly, we have an impact on the Food Service, which is happening in the home market for the competition as well. But despite that, we are not entirely happy, and there's more work to be done. We see if you zero down, in particular, some weakness in Europe, where we have to dig in and figure out how we go forward. We see actually a very strong performance in North America. And we have to model what we have done over the last, let's say, 2 or 3 years in North America, in other regions as well. So there's a program underway. And I might remind you, a couple of years ago, we had similar questions on our Scent business. We are taking it very seriously. And I think we have turned around the Scent business quite significantly. And I would say in that area, we are outperforming our competition now, in particular, on the Consumer Fragrance side. So that's what we see. And we will take the action to make sure that we fix what we have to fix here. \nHeidi Vesterinen: And just as a follow-up, you also talked about challenges with small and mid-sized customers. I think you had talked about it last quarter as well. Is this a short-term issue or are these business opportunities that have simply disappeared like a customer and you're exiting the market? What is happening there, please? \nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Sure. Absolutely. And that's a quite important question because it's strategic in a sense. We still believe that you need a good exposure to the smaller and midsized customers over long-term to grow your business. Certainly, the small customers had more impact of the COVID crisis than some of the big ones. We believe that most of them will come back to growth. And let me give you 2 examples. We see right now still quite a bit of an impact on the small customers in India, for example, where we are market leader with our Taste business, so that has an impact on our business.\n On the contrary, we see actually very good results of our Tastepoint business here in the U.S., and we are starting to accelerate again with small customers. And I think what we are seeing is now since the, let's say, supply lines are again very robust and delivering, I think it gets better here as well. So you see, it depends on the region, it depends on the country, but we believe in the long-term that this is a customer base we would like to keep it because we believe we will get some good growth out of it. I hope that helps, Heidi. \nOperator: We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: I wanted to catch up on 2 things. One was just thinking about some of the puts and takes to fourth quarter. I know Rustom you were specific on the 53rd week dynamics. But just how we should be thinking about the increased COVID costs, if there's any other one-off lapse that we should be aware for 4Q? And then the second thing was just looking back at the July S-4, the management projections that are shared there for the N&B transaction. It just struck us as interesting that you're pegging growth for IFF at 5% and for N&B at 4%. And for sure, IFF was delivering at that level before Frutarom, but not since. And N&B, I don't think has hit that number, I'm not sure, ever. So I just wanted to hear a little bit about the buildup of that projection. How much of that already assumes what you think you can do in terms of integrated solutions, but I am curious what those kind of baseline projections for the business is? \nAndreas Fibig: Sure. I take the first piece of it on the sales for the fourth quarter, then Rustom can comment on the cost, and then I come back on the S-4. Look, Lauren, in all honesty, it's tough on the fourth quarter. As Rustom said, we had a good start into the fourth quarter basically on all measures, in particular also on the Scent business, very, very strong start into it. But we are cautious for a couple of reasons. First of all, we see now in Europe, again, many of these, let's say, lockdowns, even if they call it soft lockdowns. So we will see what that brings for us in terms of Food Service, but Fine Fragrance business as well, which started well in October, but we will see what's happening here. But what we know is that we are running against a very strong fourth quarter last year, first of all, good growth but then also driven by the 53rd week. So still, good start into the quarter, also a good order book, but we remain cautious because of the 53rd week and also about the new lockdowns we have seen in Europe. That's the reason why we are taking a bit more of a conservative stance. But Rustom, please comment on the cost and then the operating profit side. \nRustom Jilla: Yes, absolutely, Andreas. Yes, look, I mean, the situation is pretty uncertain. I mean Andreas made that point on the cost end of things, right? And we're fortunate the majority of our portfolio is resilient and essential, the food, beverage, hygiene, disinfection, all the rest of that. But we are looking right now as far as we can tell that a worsening of the pandemic, and that will likely translate into continued weakness in Q4 in our COVID-19 impacted areas, Fine Fragrance and Food Service, right? So we are kind of not 100% sure how that plays out. But Food Service already, as we think about it, we think that it's going to be probably slightly worse than Q3 was.\n On COVID costs, by the way, Lauren, I mean, we had -- Q3 was big. I mean, we had close to around $13 million of COVID costs, and that's because we had about several million for the one-off costs, for the special payments that were made. In Q4, based on the run rate and how things flow-through from our inventories and all the rest of it, we'll expect a COVID cost, but much smaller number, probably closer to around the $5 million type range. So yes, you're right. And you do remember that last year as well, we talked about the 53rd week and it being 400 basis points in revenue and all the rest of that. That's a roughly $50 million sales headwind when you come around to this Q4. And the extra week also comes with a -- came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it's hard to be precise, okay, we estimate that this represents a roughly $15 million to $20 million headwind in Q4. So if you think about that, I mean, that's a big one.\n And then if you look at the other numbers in there and what we may have, we also have in Q4 last year -- we had a Brazilian tax indirect, what is it -- indirect taxes last year that we got. And that was -- and that had been subject to litigation. We disclosed that in our 10-K. That was roughly about $8 million. So if you look at that, I mean, those items between them. And finally was the AIP, okay? We mentioned that the AIP was nothing -- for the whole year we talked about AIP being a $40 million headwind last year for the whole year projections in '20. And  about half of that amount will come in the fourth quarter, the delta year-on-year. There wasn't too much in Q3. But also going in the other directions, you don't think it's all simply negative, right? We have some positives. And last year in Q4 you may remember that we had inventory impacted much lower gross profit margin. And so this year, we fully expect to be at least $10 million better on that account. And then we have the synergies, as Mark asked about the synergies to start with. And so we'll have a similar positive amount compared to last year's Q4 in synergy and productivity benefits. So I think that... \nAndreas Fibig: Okay, Rustom. Thank you for that. So in summary, I would say, good start, but we are very cautious about the situation we are having. And I think the put and takes on the cost side Rustom explained quite well. Coming back to the S-4 question. And I think what plays an important role here is, first of all, the area where we want to focus on. What we have done a quite extensive, let's say, review of our new portfolio. And there are certainly a couple of areas, which have really good growth perspective. And I'm not giving you our guidance or budget for next year. But I would like to give you some background how we think about next year in terms of the different categories. So look, the Consumer Fragrance business has performed very well in the last couple of quarters, and we don't see any change in the fourth quarter, and we don't see too much change for the next year.\n And that's a quite significant business between $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, because we believe that the demand for hygiene products will stay high next year and Personal Wash as well. And as Rustom commented in his comments on the earnings, the 3 new callers are really producing now really nice growth and have enough critical mass to give us some additional growth. So that will be a good focus area. Fine Fragrance will come back eventually as soon as COVID is normalizing over the course of next year. And that gives us just technically already a nice growth going forward into the 2021. And then we see actually a good performance on the Active Cosmetic business and the Ingredients business as well. Since we have solved for the, let's say, raw material issues out of India, I think that's working well. So that should give us good growth going forward.\n On the Taste side, as I said, we have to focus on the most important categories where we can get growth. One of the fastest-growing areas was the beverage area for us, in particular, hard sales in the U.S. We believe that it's a good growth driver for us going forward. We see some of the Natural Product Solutions driving forward, which is -- could be the INFAT business, the food protection business and that helps us to grow nicely. And Food Service, over the course of next year, the quick-service restaurants should normalize as soon as we see some more regular business after -- in the post COVID period. So we believe that could give us good growth drivers going forward.\n On the N&B side, even it's not our business now, but what I see from the outside and the pre-integration, you have a couple of business like the biorefinery business or microbial control business, which has challenges which should normalize after the COVID crisis as well. And then you see certainly businesses like the probiotics business or the cultures or enzyme business, which are going quite nicely. So we believe that could drive our growth going forward in 2021. You mentioned integrated solutions. That's certainly a growth driver as well. But I would expect this more in year 2 after the integration because it needs a bit of time that our customers not just, let's say, buying the concept, but launching these products in the marketplace as well. And then it will drive quite nice revenue synergies and certainly profit synergies as well going forward.\n I hope it helps to unpack how we see the different portfolio pieces. Maybe just a remark on the regions. As I said before, we have nice growth in North America and a great momentum on both sides of our business, which is fantastic. I think Latin America is better than you might think. And hopefully, it will go better next year as well. We have a bit of a topic on Europe, which is certainly driven by COVID because Fine Fragrance has a big footprint in Europe, as you well know. Lots comes out of France and the Food Service business as well. So we will focus here to fix as much as we can. And then, hopefully, with the, let's say, introduction of the vaccine and the post-COVID period that can give us more growth going forward. So I talked a lot, but I hope that gave you a bit of a perspective how we see the world for now. \nOperator: Next to Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. \nFaiza Alwy: Andreas, I have, I guess, two questions for you related to some comments you made regarding N&B. I guess the first thing is you mentioned that you've learned from -- there were some lessons that you learned from the Frutarom integration. And I'd love for you to dig a little bit more into that and how you think this one might go differently. So what are those lessons and how you intend to apply those to N&B? And then, secondly, you made some comments around the portfolio. It sounds to me like you're suggesting that there might be some divestitures. So just want to see if there's anything more -- if I'm reading that right and if there's anything more you can say regarding the timing or the size of that. \nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Thank you, Faiza, for the question. Let me start with your last part. As I said, we have rigorously looked at our portfolio and there are pieces where we really want to accelerate our growth going forward because we believe it's the right thing to do. And there are pieces which might not fit too much any longer into our portfolio on the IFF side. And it's probably too early to talk about concrete pieces but we are looking actively into it, and we can't make a decision on N&B, but we are looking into the portfolio here as well. I think your read is quite spot on.\n On the lessons learned, I would say there are a couple of lessons. The first one is that you need some time, if you bring these organizations together. You have to start with an aligned team and do as much work before day 1 as you can. Let me give you an example. Look, we have now announced basically up to the top 150, 170 leaders in the new organizations already. And we are still 2, 2.5 months ahead of closure. And hopefully, we will go down 1 layer further. We didn't do it because it was a shorter time frame with Frutarom. I think that's an incredible important step because we can hit the rubber or we can hit the road much, much faster than the Frutarom.\n The second thing is we have done an extensive work on the integrated solutions and the cross-selling opportunities. And one of the learnings was, we were, even in food, never short of ideas, but it took longer to realize it. And as I said, we will achieve our top line synergies with food, but it took longer than we were thinking. And that was mainly driven not just selling these ideas to our customers, but until the customer was launching the actual products. And it just takes a bit of more time. And here, we were -- let's say, we started earlier. We tested more robustly our ideas. And we have planned for more time to realize it. I think that's an important one as well.\n And then I think we have learned a lot in terms of, let's say, optimizing our footprint. And that was going okay and well. On the food side, I think we are even better prepared now for the merge with N&B on this side as well. So a ton of learnings. I could talk even further, but this might be the most important ones. And it was very helpful. I think for us, to take on something like N&B without having had Frutarom before as an integration exercise, would have been a very, very tough one. But I think the key learnings have helped that quite a bit to be very, very well prepared. And I would say, right now, we are light years ahead of what we had with our last integration. That's what I always hear when I talk to my head of integration. I hope that helps. \nOperator: Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. \nGunther Zechmann: Can I ask two, please? Firstly, on the intra-quarter trends in Q3, thanks for providing that slide with the monthly sales growth. When I think back what you said with Q2 earnings call, I think I remember you said that July order book was up in the mid- to high single digits. So can you just talk about the difference between what you saw then in the order book and what actually came through to lead to the lower growth? That's the first question. And the second one, on the raw material side, Rustom, did I understand you correctly that raw material -- price to raw material was still a headwind, but you included the COVID costs into -- or some of it at least in the raw material cost? If you could clarify that, and how much that would be, if that's right? How much that would be if you strip that out? \nAndreas Fibig: Sure thing. Gunther, I take the first one. What we've seen in the COVID crisis is that many customers have changed a bit their behavior in terms of orders. We see at the beginning of the quarter probably more orders than usual because everybody tries to get their stuff they need. And that's true, by the way, for the fourth quarter as well, which is very high, but we are cautious because we don't know how that will, let's say, good on over the quarter. That's the reason. So we have seen, let's say, a deterioration also in the third quarter over the course of the quarter that the order book went down.\n And you see sales went up a bit in October, again, but who knows what will happen in September -- in December. Sorry for that. And also the comparison is certainly a tough one. So as I said, a bit of a different order behavior of our customers, also depending on the region. We see now some movements in Europe, which is probably because of the lockdown situation. And you sit in London, and we see some movements now for the Brexit, which will now happen probably finally. And you see some movements back and forth as well. So that's the reason for that. But on the raw materials, please, Rustom, you comment. \nRustom Jilla: Yes. Thanks, Andreas. Yes, in Q3, it was a negative, right? I mean -- and one of it was Fragrance Ingredients that I talked about where we continue to use high cost inventory, right? And COVID -- the COVID part within our raw materials of usage coming through was a few million dollars as well, which will be much less going into Q4, simply the lag of when we order and the inventory and when it gets used, right? In Q4, I mean, Gunther, we expect it to be still the net of pricing and raw material costs to be negative, but a very slight negative because we actually expect, in general, some positive input costs and then rest in there. So hopefully, that gives you the answer to that. \nOperator: Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. \nThomas Digenan: This is Tom Digenan on for Ghansham. So starting with Taste, could you provide some additional details on margins in the quarter and why they were down more on a year-over-year basis versus 2Q, particularly in context of the sequential improvement in Food Service and what appeared to be solid results otherwise? \nRustom Jilla: Let me take that. \nAndreas Fibig: You go, Rustom. You go. \nRustom Jilla: Thanks. Let me take this quickly. It's the -- it's COVID impact, right? If you think about the COVID costs coming through, we saw that the roughly $5 million of extra costs that we incurred in the quarter flowed through, and it was much more in Taste than it was in Scent when we had. I mean there was also -- Scent benefited -- you are comparing Scent and Taste implicitly and Scent benefited from Fine Fragrance coming back, I mean, like a minus 17% at the end and the minus 14% in the quarter. Those numbers is considerably better than the minus 40% that we had in Q2. So you saw the benefit plus a lot of productivity and cost discipline coming through the numbers. Taste was good in terms of its cost control -- of its OpEx cost control as well. But just the combination of the Food Service and the different businesses, I mean, on the gross margin, we had a tough quarter. \nThomas Digenan: That's really helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. You called out a positive trends in October. Could you provide some more granularity on this from an end market and geographic perspective? And whether there's anything that's changed in November as lockdowns have been gradually reinstated? \nRustom Jilla: October, I mean, Andreas, do you want me to take that? \nAndreas Fibig: Yes, sure. You take it. You start. \nRustom Jilla: I mean, October, I mean, the sales -- I mean, it was basically -- I mean, basically, in the low single digits. I mean it was pretty much in line with Q3. We're not really seeing anything bigger from that perspective. The -- as the lockdowns come into Europe, which have been coming basically at the end of October into November, right, we do expect that's going to have a bit of an impact on our Food Service, in particular. Andreas? \nAndreas Fibig: No. I think that's exactly right. What we have seen actually is stronger sales on Fine Fragrances, which was positive in October, which is actually -- it's great. We will see how it pans out over the rest of the quarter. It's an important season for us because it's ahead of the holiday season. So that's important. That's what we have seen. And we have seen still a double-digit growth on Consumer Fragrances, which is great as well, but not too much of a change, as was some said of the previous quarter. And as I said, we are really looking here from week-to-week how we are moving forward. And Gunther's question was the same as how is the order book? The order book is strong, but we will see whether it deteriorates over the course of the quarter. And that's the reason why we are cautious. In terms of regions, I think Rustom is right. Europe is our focal area right now. I think it's good for North America. North America is good. Latin America is probably better than you would expect. Asia is okay because now we see that India is coming back, which is great. But Europe is still a focus area. And that's certainly driven by the new lockdowns we see all over Europe. \nOperator: We'll go next to John Roberts with UBS. \nJohn Roberts: I just have 1 question. One of the N&B revenue synergy examples cited earlier was plant-based meat. Could we get an update on what's going on in that marketplace, since it seems like there have been a lot of developments recently? \nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Thank you, John, for the question. It's certainly one of our focus areas because I believe we are exceptionally strong positioned in that area going forward because we have all the ingredients to satisfy by the market here. What we see is that basically, many companies are now moving into that area. The category was suffering at the beginning a bit from quick-service restaurants being down. That is coming back now in some of the geographies, which is good. But you see more and more that these products are going into supermarkets like Whole Foods and others alike. So what I want to say here is they had a bit of a hard time at the beginning of the pandemics with the quick-service restaurants. They are coming back. We see more companies moving into that area, and we see that the whole category is growing, and that's our expectations for the years to come as well. I hope it helps, John. \nOperator: We'll go next to Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. \nMatthew DeYoe: A question on the way you report and walked through all these slides. Like why not use the same currency-neutral sales results as all your peers? It just seems like we're wasting time walking through all these quarter-to-quarter and candidly it's odd that you plan to flag on kind of fundamentals with this? \nAndreas Fibig: I couldn't agree more. I give it to Rustom. \nRustom Jilla: Look, it's something we're looking at, honestly. I mean we do believe that our way of looking at it is more right, as I said earlier. And -- but at the end of the day, I mean, it is frustrating that when you compare it to our peers, it makes the report, the numbers that we put out, we're doing ourselves a disservice in an environment where the emerging currency -- where the emerging currencies are weakening. As I said in there, I'll just say 1 quick thing in point. So if you just look at our Scent's performance and if you look at our Scent performance reported on apples-to-apples basis, right, I mean we're talking about 8% type growth. So anyway, I'll leave it at that. \nAndreas Fibig: Yes. It's a discussion with our Audit Committee, but we're working on it. Let's put it that way. \nOperator: Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. \nAdam Samuelson: So I wanted to come back to something, Andreas, you said in the prepared remarks around lessons from Frutarom. And you made the point on sales dis-synergies. And I was hoping if you could kind of maybe provide a little more tangible examples of where within the Frutarom experience that has been a headwind? Are you just talking like resource or other businesses there that we should be mindful that they've been a little bit more pressured? \nAndreas Fibig: Yes, sure. Absolutely. Look, there were some dis-synergies we have seen. Maybe we have talked about the citrus business we had out of Florida, where we have supplied 1 of our competitors. They lost their big customers, but they also have built their own, let's say, capabilities here, and we lost quite significant part of the citrus business. That's actually probably 1 of the premier examples for sales dis-synergy. We don't expect too many sales dis-synergies from N&B. But we have built it in. And we said that if we look at the sales synergies, it always has to be a net number as it is on the cost side as well. So we are very aware of that. And we make sure that we really capture it in the right way. I hope that example helps. \nOperator: We are out of time for Q&A. I'll turn it back to Andreas for any closing remarks. \nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Thank you for all of your questions. Thank you for that. It was a good discussion, and we're looking forward for the one on ones. Thank you, and stay healthy, please. Bye-bye. \nRustom Jilla: Bye-bye everyone. \nOperator: And this does conclude today's program. We appreciate your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rustom Jilla",
            "content": "Thank you, Andreas. Slide 8 provides a high-level overview of Q3's financial performance. On a currency-neutral basis, IFF generated $1.3 billion in sales, a 1% increase from 2019's third quarter. Scent was up 4% and Taste down 1%, and I'll provide additional divisional color in a few minutes. As Andreas noted, Q3 sales recovered from Q2's low point and over 3/4 of our $69 million sequential improvement came from Scent, and total IFF sales improved in all 4 regions.\n In the third quarter, our adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, increased 1% to $241 million on a currency-neutral basis from 2019's Q3. Our gross profit and gross margin were both higher than the third quarter of 2019 despite higher COVID-19-related manufacturing expenses and logistics costs. Continued OpEx controls and lower T&E essentially offset additional personnel-related COVID-19 costs and other inflationary increases. On a currency-neutral basis, interest, other income and expenses, taxes and noncontrolling interests together amounted to an additional $1 million headwind versus last Q3. And adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $1.40, up 1%. \n Note that FX movements adversely impacted our reported numbers. On a reported basis, Q3 sales were flat and adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, was down 4%. Balance sheet revaluation FX losses had a large negative impact in other income and expenses as a result both of weaker emerging market currencies against the dollar and a stronger euro. Currency volatility has impacted OIE all year, with Q1 and Q3 negative and Q2 positive. \n We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency-neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market currency devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar or euro. However, it's important to help all of you understand our performance relative to competition. So on Slide 9, I want to take a moment to show what our currency-neutral growth in the third quarter would be using the same calculation methodology of our peers. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in U.S. dollars or other hard currencies or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local currencies.\n So when reporting our currency-neutral sales growth, we exclude those foreign exchange-related price changes in emerging markets, but this is different from our peers. During the third quarter of 2020, continued currency devaluations year-over-year in several key emerging markets would have added approximately 2 percentage points to growth if we include those foreign exchange-related price changes in our emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, we estimate that our third quarter currency-neutral sales growth would have been 3% versus the 1% we have shared. And using this methodology Scent with its strong LatAm businesses would have 8% plus Q3 growth, while Taste would have been flat. \n Moving on to Slide 10. It is worth taking a closer look at the underlying business and market dynamics influencing our overall profitability in the quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, our sequential improvement in sales was accompanied by a strong rebound in profitability relative to our Q2 performance. Our currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, grew 1% in Q3, clearly not what we want, but substantially better than the year-on-year decrease of 19% we reported in the second quarter. As expected, price to raw material costs was a gross margin headwind as was unfavorable mix due to our Fine Fragrance business.\n Also affecting profitability for the third quarter were incremental COVID-19 costs, which essentially doubled from Q2. The incremental manufacturing and logistics expenses related to COVID-19 that we had incurred in Q2 flowed into the P&L in Q3 as inventories were used. And we also paid a bonus to our essential workers around the world as they continued their exceptional service to our customers during this unprecedented time. In the end, we were able to offset these negatives through a combination of productivity initiatives in Scent and Frutarom cost synergies in Taste and tight cost management throughout IFF.\n We have been very careful with hiring, with headcount down over the course of the year, have been tighter in general within expenses and, of course, have had lower T&E costs like most businesses. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were up less than 1% despite absorbing the usual inflationary increases and COVID-19-related costs. As we forge ahead, especially in this uncertain environment, we will continue to drive growth but also review our cost structure to find additional opportunities to support overall profitability levels. \n Now turning to Slide 11, where we take a closer look at the performance of the Scent division in the quarter. Scent sales totaling $503 million were up 4% overall as Consumer Fragrance continues to outperform. Specifically our Fabric, Home, Hair Care and Personal Wash product categories all experienced robust growth and are also benefiting from the pandemic-related increase in global consumer staples purchases. As Andreas noted earlier, it's not all COVID-19 related. We are seeing strong growth from our new core list customers that we recently gained access to.\n While Fine Fragrance sales remain challenged, Q3's 14% decrease is a significant improvement from last quarter, where sales were down 40%. Importantly, our Fragrance Ingredients business, which was impacted by COVID-19-related supply constraints in Q2, returned to growth, led by double-digit gains in Cosmetic Actives. These metrics are encouraging and reflect the recovery this summer in global retail markets and consumers' ability to reach them. In addition, the Scent division saw meaningful profit improvement this quarter, as segment profit grew 20% to $101 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, strong benefits from management productivity initiatives and cost discipline and tight OpEx controls. \n Moving on to Slide 12, where we focus on the performance of our Taste division. While we saw sequential improvements in Food Service compared with a 36% decline in the second quarter of 2020, this remained under pressure in the third quarter, declining 13% on a currency-neutral basis versus the prior year as the pandemic limited food consumption away from home. To put this in context, Food Service took Taste's overall sales growth down by roughly 2 percentage points. That said, the rest of the Taste portfolio, excluding Food Service, delivered positive currency-neutral growth across all global markets. One particular bright spot was North America, where IFF realized double-digit growth in Taste across nearly all categories.\n We continue to see weaker growth in the other regions due to COVID-19 and related regulatory restrictions such as EAME, Latin America and Greater Asia. Natural Product Solutions, our food ingredients business, and our North American Flavors businesses were the strongest performing in the quarter, while Savory and Inclusion both more impacted by Food Service were negative in the quarter. Frutarom declined 2% compared to the prior year as their strong presence in Food Service and customer base of mostly smaller local and regional customers continued to be more adversely impacted by COVID-19. For  Taste overall, the segment achieved a 13.3% profit margin, with $102 million in segment profit on $765 million in sales. Benefits from acquisition-related synergies and tight OpEx controls were more than offset by lower sales volume, unfavorable price to raw materials costs and higher COVID-19-related costs.\n Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's strong and growing cash flow position. The chart on the left illustrates the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow and includes all key drivers. Operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 8% and 30% this quarter, respectively, led by core working capital improvements and stepped up reviews of capital expenditure. Our thoughtful and disciplined approach to investments amid the pandemic has resulted in CapEx of approximately 3.3% of sales versus 4.2% the prior year.\n While continuing to support our customers and suppliers, our teams have also been very focused on optimizing working capital, and our cash conversion cycle has improved 8 days year-over-year. We clearly need to generate cash, given our leverage and the impending merger with N&B. So it's good to see the improvements in days payables outstanding and days sales outstanding. Where inventory is concerned, we did see a small improvement in inventory days with more originally projected for Q4. But now with COVID-19 picking up again, we will increase our safety stocks. Note that we are not expecting to repeat last Q4's strong cash flow performance this year, primarily because of the benefit last year from extra sales and collections in the 53rd week. Further, despite continued stress in all industries across the globe, we believe that this quarter's strong balance sheet is a testament to our continued capital allocation focus and discipline. \n Moving to Slide 14. As we look to remainder of 2020 and into 2021, we will remain laser-focused on maintaining discipline across our balance sheet to ensure that IFF is well positioned as we navigate a prolonged challenging market environment. The situation remains highly uncertain, given the steady increase in global COVID-19 infections and the potential for additional regulatory restrictions in various regions. We're incredibly fortunate that the majority, roughly 85% of IFF's portfolio, has remained resilient and essential around the world for food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products. Unfortunately, the persistence or even worsening of the pandemic will likely translate into continued weakness for Fine Fragrance and Food Service in Q4.\n I will also remind you that we face a very strong Q4 comparison to last year, which had a 53rd week of sales and profit contributions. As we noted at the time, this represented about 400 basis points of growth in the fourth quarter last year and is a large, roughly $50 million headwind, this quarter and will occur all in the last week of December 2020, impacting our monthly performance comparative significantly. This extra week last year also clearly came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it is hard to be precise, we estimate that this will represent a $15 million to $20 million headwind for us in Q4. \n We began the fourth quarter with low single digits growth in October on a currency-neutral basis, in line with Q3's results. Based on this first month and given the uncertainty, it's unlikely that we will see higher growth for the full fourth quarter than the 1% we achieved in Q3. That is before taking into account the headwinds from the 53rd week. In this uncertain and difficult environment, we are more than ever controlling what we can control such as OpEx and also capital expenditure. And of course, we remain focused on driving strong cash flow and reducing leverage. \n And with that, I'll hand it back to Andreas to discuss the near-term road ahead for IFF. Will do. And yes, a long question, so let me make sure I cover all of it. Look, first of all, on the competitors' performance, I mean, I can't really comment on our competitors' performance. But let me take you through ours and give you some context. So our year-to-date -- so, see not Q3, our year-to-date adjusted operating profit, excluding amortization, is down 4%, and that's on currency-neutral sales growth of plus 1%. So that's clearly not good, but here are the drivers. So we had a negative type this quarter. We had a negative sales mix. I mean, Fine Fragrance -- I mean you've seen the impact in Q2 in particular and minus 40% and then Q3 as well, much lesser, but you've seen it in there. There's unfavorable price to raw material costs. Now that's mainly Fragrance Ingredients, and that's mainly price reductions in advance of raw material declines. There's COVID-19-related incremental costs. I mean, we put the -- we've shown you the bridge on the slides in the quarter.\n But if you look at the year, I mean we're talking about almost just a little under $20 million in costs that we've actually incurred on COVID. And incentive comp, I mean incentive comp as well year-on-year, if you remember, we expected a year-on-year headwind when we finish because of everything that had happened last year. And that has played through and to a little extent in the quarter and certainly in the full year as well. Then, of course, you've got the basic. And then on the other side, some of the positives in the year-to-date, it's been a negative on volume, and that's because of Q2. But in Q3, volume was actually a positive. And synergies, I mean, synergies have been a positive all year-long in what we've seen. And then, of course, there's productivity and cost discipline, right? So I'll come to Frutarom in a second.\n Earlier in the year, we were unsure as to the severity and the duration of COVID-19. So we choke back hiring. And we acted to control expenses, but we decided against taking costs out of IFF. And now with infections rising and no line of sight as to countermeasures, I mean vaccine comments notwithstanding, we are planning on acting to reduce costs over the coming months. And then Frutarom. You asked about Frutarom. And look, despite COVID-19, we're still on track to deliver on the procurement and manufacturing optimization cost synergy of $50 million that we outlined earlier this year. We did modify the 10-Q and it's not required to disclose the exact amounts every quarter. But I can tell you, we had $10-plus million of synergies in Q3. So when you combine that with the first half savings of $32 million, that puts us at $42 million, $43 million, something like that, and clearly on track to achieve our full year $50 million goal. And Mark, just to remind you, our target was $100 million by year 2 and $145 million by year 3. Did I cover everything in there that you asked? Yes, absolutely, Andreas. Yes, look, I mean, the situation is pretty uncertain. I mean Andreas made that point on the cost end of things, right? And we're fortunate the majority of our portfolio is resilient and essential, the food, beverage, hygiene, disinfection, all the rest of that. But we are looking right now as far as we can tell that a worsening of the pandemic, and that will likely translate into continued weakness in Q4 in our COVID-19 impacted areas, Fine Fragrance and Food Service, right? So we are kind of not 100% sure how that plays out. But Food Service already, as we think about it, we think that it's going to be probably slightly worse than Q3 was.\n On COVID costs, by the way, Lauren, I mean, we had -- Q3 was big. I mean, we had close to around $13 million of COVID costs, and that's because we had about several million for the one-off costs, for the special payments that were made. In Q4, based on the run rate and how things flow-through from our inventories and all the rest of it, we'll expect a COVID cost, but much smaller number, probably closer to around the $5 million type range. So yes, you're right. And you do remember that last year as well, we talked about the 53rd week and it being 400 basis points in revenue and all the rest of that. That's a roughly $50 million sales headwind when you come around to this Q4. And the extra week also comes with a -- came with a substantial operating profit contribution. And while it's hard to be precise, okay, we estimate that this represents a roughly $15 million to $20 million headwind in Q4. So if you think about that, I mean, that's a big one.\n And then if you look at the other numbers in there and what we may have, we also have in Q4 last year -- we had a Brazilian tax indirect, what is it -- indirect taxes last year that we got. And that was -- and that had been subject to litigation. We disclosed that in our 10-K. That was roughly about $8 million. So if you look at that, I mean, those items between them. And finally was the AIP, okay? We mentioned that the AIP was nothing -- for the whole year we talked about AIP being a $40 million headwind last year for the whole year projections in '20. And  about half of that amount will come in the fourth quarter, the delta year-on-year. There wasn't too much in Q3. But also going in the other directions, you don't think it's all simply negative, right? We have some positives. And last year in Q4 you may remember that we had inventory impacted much lower gross profit margin. And so this year, we fully expect to be at least $10 million better on that account. And then we have the synergies, as Mark asked about the synergies to start with. And so we'll have a similar positive amount compared to last year's Q4 in synergy and productivity benefits. So I think that... Yes. Thanks, Andreas. Yes, in Q3, it was a negative, right? I mean -- and one of it was Fragrance Ingredients that I talked about where we continue to use high cost inventory, right? And COVID -- the COVID part within our raw materials of usage coming through was a few million dollars as well, which will be much less going into Q4, simply the lag of when we order and the inventory and when it gets used, right? In Q4, I mean, Gunther, we expect it to be still the net of pricing and raw material costs to be negative, but a very slight negative because we actually expect, in general, some positive input costs and then rest in there. So hopefully, that gives you the answer to that. Let me take that. Thanks. Let me take this quickly. It's the -- it's COVID impact, right? If you think about the COVID costs coming through, we saw that the roughly $5 million of extra costs that we incurred in the quarter flowed through, and it was much more in Taste than it was in Scent when we had. I mean there was also -- Scent benefited -- you are comparing Scent and Taste implicitly and Scent benefited from Fine Fragrance coming back, I mean, like a minus 17% at the end and the minus 14% in the quarter. Those numbers is considerably better than the minus 40% that we had in Q2. So you saw the benefit plus a lot of productivity and cost discipline coming through the numbers. Taste was good in terms of its cost control -- of its OpEx cost control as well. But just the combination of the Food Service and the different businesses, I mean, on the gross margin, we had a tough quarter. October, I mean, Andreas, do you want me to take that? I mean, October, I mean, the sales -- I mean, it was basically -- I mean, basically, in the low single digits. I mean it was pretty much in line with Q3. We're not really seeing anything bigger from that perspective. The -- as the lockdowns come into Europe, which have been coming basically at the end of October into November, right, we do expect that's going to have a bit of an impact on our Food Service, in particular. Andreas? Look, it's something we're looking at, honestly. I mean we do believe that our way of looking at it is more right, as I said earlier. And -- but at the end of the day, I mean, it is frustrating that when you compare it to our peers, it makes the report, the numbers that we put out, we're doing ourselves a disservice in an environment where the emerging currency -- where the emerging currencies are weakening. As I said in there, I'll just say 1 quick thing in point. So if you just look at our Scent's performance and if you look at our Scent performance reported on apples-to-apples basis, right, I mean we're talking about 8% type growth. So anyway, I'll leave it at that. Bye-bye everyone."

            "name": "Andreas Fibig",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Before I dive into our third quarter performance, I would like to, once again, take a moment to thank all of our frontline workers and dedicated colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly throughout the course of this year to continue fueling our global supply chain and meeting our customers' needs. But every business is built to weather pandemic. But over the last few months, we have continued to show that our business is well equipped to navigate the most unpredictable of storms. I can't thank each and every one of our passionate employees enough of their continued hard work, dedication and focus throughout this difficult year. \n On today's call, I will start, as usually, by reviewing IFF's recent third quarter performance and summarizing the trends that we are experiencing across the business before providing a more in-depth review of our year-to-date performance. Rustom will then provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financials. I will then provide an outlook on the road ahead for our business and provide an update on our merger with DuPont N&B and the integration planning efforts that are well underway.\n Despite the COVID-related headwinds, we saw a strong sequential improvement across all key financial metrics in Q3. We achieved 1% currency-neutral sales growth in the third quarter, a 500 bps improvement relative to our second quarter 2020 results. Outside of Fine Fragrance and Food Service, IFF's portfolio remains resilient with growth of 3% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis and 4% year-to-date. Nearly every category, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, is growing, led by a third consecutive quarter of double-digit currency-neutral growth in Consumer Fragrance.\n We continue to experience challenges in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which saw improve relatively in Q2 sales, declined 14% this quarter on a currency-neutral basis. These segments continue to be the most affected among our portfolio by pandemic-driven trends in retail and away-from-home channels. On our second quarter earnings call, we presented this monthly chart to provide increased transparency during the uncertain period. At the time, July finished was about 2% growth. In the subsequent months of August and September, we saw a modest deceleration in sales performance versus July, actually, largely due to weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. \n Now let's turn to Slide 7, where I would like to review our year-to-date performance 2020 basis. Our Flavors category, excluding Food Service, is resilient, growing low single digits. Outside of Food Service, all categories are growing. Inclusions led the segment with impressive double-digit growth, followed by mid single-digit growth in Natural Product Solutions and Savory Solutions, again, all excluding Food Service. From a regional perspective, growth was led by a double-digit improvement in North America and Greater Asia, where new win performance is strong. In EAME, results were challenged, which is in an area where we are focused on improving as we move forward. \n I want to take a moment to formally welcome our new Taste division leader, Kathy Fortmann. On October 1, Kathy officially took over leadership of our Taste division. She is an outstanding executive with experience across our industry and joined IFF early in 2020 as part of our succession planning for IFF as well as post our combination with N&B. In her short term with IFF, Kathy has already brought tremendous expertise and insights to our team, leading IFF integration of Taste with N&B food and beverage platform. With a proven track record of delivering growth and innovation at global food and beverage ingredients organizations, I'm confident Kathy will do an exceptional job leading our Taste business now and the Taste, Food and Beverage division following transaction close.\n I also want to thank Matthias Haeni who has retired from IFF after 30 years in our industry. He had a long and successful career. And during his tenure with IFF he has advanced our position as leader within the taste industry. I wish him the very best for his next chapter. Overall, IFF Scent division continues to perform very well. I'm proud to share that we have achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, with double-digit growth in Fabric Care, Home Care, Air Care and Personal Wash. Our new core list customers where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, are growing more than 50% this year, in the third quarter provided a double-digit contribution to Consumer Fragrance growth. Particularly, I want to note that our entire Consumer Fragrance team have worked diligently through the pandemic to differentiate our offerings, win new business and achieve strong market share gains. \n In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong. Yet the pandemic created a raw material headwind in Q2 as we prioritized the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business foregoing external sales. As restriction has eased, the business improved sequentially, but on a year-to-year basis remains down slightly. The areas most impacted by COVID-19 have been Food Service and Fine Fragrances. On a year-to-date base, Food Service and Fine Fragrances are down almost 20% as COVID-related actions impacted consumer behavior as well as retail channels have been temporarily closed, and travel retail is down.\n As I stated earlier, we are encouraged that the Fine Fragrance and Food Service improved in Q3 relative to Q2 sales on a currency-neutral basis. Yet we remain cautious about trends given the increase in COVID-19 infections more recently. Excluding Fine Fragrance, Scent has achieved strong currency-neutral growth rate of plus 8% year-to-date, while Taste has improved 2% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding Food Service. \n With that, I would like to pass it over to Rustom to provide more details on the third quarter. Thank you, Rustom. Before providing an update on our pre-integration work with N&B, I want to spend a moment on the progress we have made on our Frutarom integration. On Slide 15, I'm pleased to share that we have made strong strides with our Frutarom integration work. As of the third quarter 2020, we have complete integration of our business teams and believe that by the first quarter 2021 we will substantially complete our manufacturing optimization plan essentially at 90% of the consolidated -- consolidation complete. As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related complexity, we are delayed about 6 to 8 weeks was our original projection, but remain on track to be largely complete in the first quarter of 2021 around the time of our transaction close with N&B.\n As a reminder, as part of the Frutarom integration initiative, we expect to close approximately 35 manufacturing sites. For the end of 2020, we are on track to close between 20 to 24 sites around the world and expect to be completely finished by the end of 2021. With the integration of Frutarom, we have learned a lot. This experience has been important for IFF, and we will leverage these experiences and apply lessons learned as we take next step with DuPont N&B. First, we have put more ability to deliver value through cost synergies. We know how to build teams to quickly and efficiently identify and capture these opportunities in ways that create real shareholder value.\n Second, revenue synergies need to align with the product development life cycle. We need to recognize in our planning that this can mean that these synergies take more time to achieve, but the key takeaways being start early to ensure delivery. As of today, we have a strong pipeline of Frutarom-related cross-selling projects, over 2,000 with a pipeline potential of approximately $235 million, and we believe we are on track to meet or exceed our target for 2021. Third, we need to recognize the potential for sales dis-synergies plan accordingly to properly mitigate and anticipate when it can't be avoided. Fourth, we must build teams and organizational functions that protect base business growth. This was a major consideration how we designed the organization structure at our future combined company. Growth through synergies and innovation have to be incremental to core business growth.\n And fifth, we need to move with speed and be decisive. There's always an urge to be cautious through integration as 2 cultures learn to work together. We have to break down these barriers with focused, accountable leadership towards clear shared goals prioritizing profitable growth. I will also add that moving towards a transformational merger and working through the challenges of a global pandemic has forced all of us at IFF to work in new ways. We have learned quite a bit in these last several months and in many ways it has forced us to take a fresh look at our business in a way that I think will prove beneficial as we continue in our transformation journey. \n Turning to Slide 16. I'm pleased to share an update on our integration planning process for our previously announced merger with DuPont N&B. As you can see, we have reached all targets for the second half of 2020 and are on track with our targeted close date of February 1, 2021. The 3 notable milestones we achieved in the third quarter 2020 include a successful shareholder award, the completion of the permanent financing and the announcement of the executive team minus 1 leadership teams. I'm pleased to have received a strong support of IFF shareholders who have recognized this unique opportunity to create significant long-term value.\n With more than 99% of the votes cast in favor, IFF shareholders have overwhelmingly approved the issuance of shares pursuant to the merger agreement, through which IFF and N&B will combine to create a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions for global food, beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. We also completed a successful pricing of the $6.25 billion bond offering in September. This financing, together with the previously procured term loan facility, will provide N&B with the funding needed to make the special cash payment of USD 7.3 billion to DuPont in connection with the completion of our merger with N&B. I'm happy to report that there was tremendous interest in the bond offering. The interest rates were favorable and the offering was significantly oversubscribed. \n I'm also happy to announce that at the end of last week, we received antitrust approval in Mexico, which was 1 of the 2 remaining jurisdictions where we needed for approval. As we move towards close, we have only a few integration milestones left to reach and are confident in our abilities to execute on our post-closing time line. We anticipate receiving antitrust approval for Europe in December and will be filing our amended S-4 with updated pro formas in the coming months. \n I continue to be very excited about the combination between IFF and N&B. I believe we have a significant amount of opportunities to create strong shareholder value in the future. We actively review our portfolios on a constant basis, especially in light of the future combination with N&B to look to maximize our returns by driving growth in accretive categories and deprioritizing our low-value businesses by reducing allocations of expense and capital fixed or exit completely with divestitures. \n Moving on to Slide 17. In summary, I continue to value the continued resilience of our portfolio during an exceptionally challenging time for all industries and communities across the globe. Despite this unpredictable environment, we have delivered sustained growth across some of our largest segments and returned to growth in others in the third quarter. Our 1% currency-neutral growth for the quarter marks an important sequential improvement from Q2. And excluding Fine Fragrance and Food Service, we are pleased to have delivered 4% year-to-year currency-neutral growth with improvement across nearly all categories. We also made great progress in our N&B pre-integration planning and remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021.\n As global conditions remain volatile and unpredictable, we will continue to focus on controlling the controllable, to drive strong cash flow, maintain strong operational capital discipline and leverage the strength of our portfolio to depth and succeed. I'm proud and grateful to all of our employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to ensure the continuity and resiliency of our business, all while delivering for our 30,000 customers across the globe and executing on the integration process for Frutarom and N&B. While we recognize we always have opportunities to improve, in particular, on within our Taste division, I'm confident that as we move ahead, we will improve our performance as we did in our Scent division over the past few years, both in terms of sales through new customer, core lists and margins through operational performance programs. I believe that we have the strategy and the team in place to position our organization for long-term success both now and upon uniting with N&B. \n With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Sure, Heidi. I can take it. I think, first, please remember that we need to adjust the reporting differences, specifically FX-related pricing. But I think Rustom talked about that. Certainly, we have an impact on the Food Service, which is happening in the home market for the competition as well. But despite that, we are not entirely happy, and there's more work to be done. We see if you zero down, in particular, some weakness in Europe, where we have to dig in and figure out how we go forward. We see actually a very strong performance in North America. And we have to model what we have done over the last, let's say, 2 or 3 years in North America, in other regions as well. So there's a program underway. And I might remind you, a couple of years ago, we had similar questions on our Scent business. We are taking it very seriously. And I think we have turned around the Scent business quite significantly. And I would say in that area, we are outperforming our competition now, in particular, on the Consumer Fragrance side. So that's what we see. And we will take the action to make sure that we fix what we have to fix here. Yes. Sure. Absolutely. And that's a quite important question because it's strategic in a sense. We still believe that you need a good exposure to the smaller and midsized customers over long-term to grow your business. Certainly, the small customers had more impact of the COVID crisis than some of the big ones. We believe that most of them will come back to growth. And let me give you 2 examples. We see right now still quite a bit of an impact on the small customers in India, for example, where we are market leader with our Taste business, so that has an impact on our business.\n On the contrary, we see actually very good results of our Tastepoint business here in the U.S., and we are starting to accelerate again with small customers. And I think what we are seeing is now since the, let's say, supply lines are again very robust and delivering, I think it gets better here as well. So you see, it depends on the region, it depends on the country, but we believe in the long-term that this is a customer base we would like to keep it because we believe we will get some good growth out of it. I hope that helps, Heidi. Sure. I take the first piece of it on the sales for the fourth quarter, then Rustom can comment on the cost, and then I come back on the S-4. Look, Lauren, in all honesty, it's tough on the fourth quarter. As Rustom said, we had a good start into the fourth quarter basically on all measures, in particular also on the Scent business, very, very strong start into it. But we are cautious for a couple of reasons. First of all, we see now in Europe, again, many of these, let's say, lockdowns, even if they call it soft lockdowns. So we will see what that brings for us in terms of Food Service, but Fine Fragrance business as well, which started well in October, but we will see what's happening here. But what we know is that we are running against a very strong fourth quarter last year, first of all, good growth but then also driven by the 53rd week. So still, good start into the quarter, also a good order book, but we remain cautious because of the 53rd week and also about the new lockdowns we have seen in Europe. That's the reason why we are taking a bit more of a conservative stance. But Rustom, please comment on the cost and then the operating profit side. Okay, Rustom. Thank you for that. So in summary, I would say, good start, but we are very cautious about the situation we are having. And I think the put and takes on the cost side Rustom explained quite well. Coming back to the S-4 question. And I think what plays an important role here is, first of all, the area where we want to focus on. What we have done a quite extensive, let's say, review of our new portfolio. And there are certainly a couple of areas, which have really good growth perspective. And I'm not giving you our guidance or budget for next year. But I would like to give you some background how we think about next year in terms of the different categories. So look, the Consumer Fragrance business has performed very well in the last couple of quarters, and we don't see any change in the fourth quarter, and we don't see too much change for the next year.\n And that's a quite significant business between $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, because we believe that the demand for hygiene products will stay high next year and Personal Wash as well. And as Rustom commented in his comments on the earnings, the 3 new callers are really producing now really nice growth and have enough critical mass to give us some additional growth. So that will be a good focus area. Fine Fragrance will come back eventually as soon as COVID is normalizing over the course of next year. And that gives us just technically already a nice growth going forward into the 2021. And then we see actually a good performance on the Active Cosmetic business and the Ingredients business as well. Since we have solved for the, let's say, raw material issues out of India, I think that's working well. So that should give us good growth going forward.\n On the Taste side, as I said, we have to focus on the most important categories where we can get growth. One of the fastest-growing areas was the beverage area for us, in particular, hard sales in the U.S. We believe that it's a good growth driver for us going forward. We see some of the Natural Product Solutions driving forward, which is -- could be the INFAT business, the food protection business and that helps us to grow nicely. And Food Service, over the course of next year, the quick-service restaurants should normalize as soon as we see some more regular business after -- in the post COVID period. So we believe that could give us good growth drivers going forward.\n On the N&B side, even it's not our business now, but what I see from the outside and the pre-integration, you have a couple of business like the biorefinery business or microbial control business, which has challenges which should normalize after the COVID crisis as well. And then you see certainly businesses like the probiotics business or the cultures or enzyme business, which are going quite nicely. So we believe that could drive our growth going forward in 2021. You mentioned integrated solutions. That's certainly a growth driver as well. But I would expect this more in year 2 after the integration because it needs a bit of time that our customers not just, let's say, buying the concept, but launching these products in the marketplace as well. And then it will drive quite nice revenue synergies and certainly profit synergies as well going forward.\n I hope it helps to unpack how we see the different portfolio pieces. Maybe just a remark on the regions. As I said before, we have nice growth in North America and a great momentum on both sides of our business, which is fantastic. I think Latin America is better than you might think. And hopefully, it will go better next year as well. We have a bit of a topic on Europe, which is certainly driven by COVID because Fine Fragrance has a big footprint in Europe, as you well know. Lots comes out of France and the Food Service business as well. So we will focus here to fix as much as we can. And then, hopefully, with the, let's say, introduction of the vaccine and the post-COVID period that can give us more growth going forward. So I talked a lot, but I hope that gave you a bit of a perspective how we see the world for now. Yes. Thank you, Faiza, for the question. Let me start with your last part. As I said, we have rigorously looked at our portfolio and there are pieces where we really want to accelerate our growth going forward because we believe it's the right thing to do. And there are pieces which might not fit too much any longer into our portfolio on the IFF side. And it's probably too early to talk about concrete pieces but we are looking actively into it, and we can't make a decision on N&B, but we are looking into the portfolio here as well. I think your read is quite spot on.\n On the lessons learned, I would say there are a couple of lessons. The first one is that you need some time, if you bring these organizations together. You have to start with an aligned team and do as much work before day 1 as you can. Let me give you an example. Look, we have now announced basically up to the top 150, 170 leaders in the new organizations already. And we are still 2, 2.5 months ahead of closure. And hopefully, we will go down 1 layer further. We didn't do it because it was a shorter time frame with Frutarom. I think that's an incredible important step because we can hit the rubber or we can hit the road much, much faster than the Frutarom.\n The second thing is we have done an extensive work on the integrated solutions and the cross-selling opportunities. And one of the learnings was, we were, even in food, never short of ideas, but it took longer to realize it. And as I said, we will achieve our top line synergies with food, but it took longer than we were thinking. And that was mainly driven not just selling these ideas to our customers, but until the customer was launching the actual products. And it just takes a bit of more time. And here, we were -- let's say, we started earlier. We tested more robustly our ideas. And we have planned for more time to realize it. I think that's an important one as well.\n And then I think we have learned a lot in terms of, let's say, optimizing our footprint. And that was going okay and well. On the food side, I think we are even better prepared now for the merge with N&B on this side as well. So a ton of learnings. I could talk even further, but this might be the most important ones. And it was very helpful. I think for us, to take on something like N&B without having had Frutarom before as an integration exercise, would have been a very, very tough one. But I think the key learnings have helped that quite a bit to be very, very well prepared. And I would say, right now, we are light years ahead of what we had with our last integration. That's what I always hear when I talk to my head of integration. I hope that helps. Sure thing. Gunther, I take the first one. What we've seen in the COVID crisis is that many customers have changed a bit their behavior in terms of orders. We see at the beginning of the quarter probably more orders than usual because everybody tries to get their stuff they need. And that's true, by the way, for the fourth quarter as well, which is very high, but we are cautious because we don't know how that will, let's say, good on over the quarter. That's the reason. So we have seen, let's say, a deterioration also in the third quarter over the course of the quarter that the order book went down.\n And you see sales went up a bit in October, again, but who knows what will happen in September -- in December. Sorry for that. And also the comparison is certainly a tough one. So as I said, a bit of a different order behavior of our customers, also depending on the region. We see now some movements in Europe, which is probably because of the lockdown situation. And you sit in London, and we see some movements now for the Brexit, which will now happen probably finally. And you see some movements back and forth as well. So that's the reason for that. But on the raw materials, please, Rustom, you comment. You go, Rustom. You go. Yes, sure. You take it. You start. No. I think that's exactly right. What we have seen actually is stronger sales on Fine Fragrances, which was positive in October, which is actually -- it's great. We will see how it pans out over the rest of the quarter. It's an important season for us because it's ahead of the holiday season. So that's important. That's what we have seen. And we have seen still a double-digit growth on Consumer Fragrances, which is great as well, but not too much of a change, as was some said of the previous quarter. And as I said, we are really looking here from week-to-week how we are moving forward. And Gunther's question was the same as how is the order book? The order book is strong, but we will see whether it deteriorates over the course of the quarter. And that's the reason why we are cautious. In terms of regions, I think Rustom is right. Europe is our focal area right now. I think it's good for North America. North America is good. Latin America is probably better than you would expect. Asia is okay because now we see that India is coming back, which is great. But Europe is still a focus area. And that's certainly driven by the new lockdowns we see all over Europe. Yes. Thank you, John, for the question. It's certainly one of our focus areas because I believe we are exceptionally strong positioned in that area going forward because we have all the ingredients to satisfy by the market here. What we see is that basically, many companies are now moving into that area. The category was suffering at the beginning a bit from quick-service restaurants being down. That is coming back now in some of the geographies, which is good. But you see more and more that these products are going into supermarkets like Whole Foods and others alike. So what I want to say here is they had a bit of a hard time at the beginning of the pandemics with the quick-service restaurants. They are coming back. We see more companies moving into that area, and we see that the whole category is growing, and that's our expectations for the years to come as well. I hope it helps, John. I couldn't agree more. I give it to Rustom. Yes. It's a discussion with our Audit Committee, but we're working on it. Let's put it that way. Yes, sure. Absolutely. Look, there were some dis-synergies we have seen. Maybe we have talked about the citrus business we had out of Florida, where we have supplied 1 of our competitors. They lost their big customers, but they also have built their own, let's say, capabilities here, and we lost quite significant part of the citrus business. That's actually probably 1 of the premier examples for sales dis-synergy. We don't expect too many sales dis-synergies from N&B. But we have built it in. And we said that if we look at the sales synergies, it always has to be a net number as it is on the cost side as well. So we are very aware of that. And we make sure that we really capture it in the right way. I hope that example helps. Yes. Thank you for all of your questions. Thank you for that. It was a good discussion, and we're looking forward for the one on ones. Thank you, and stay healthy, please. Bye-bye."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's second quarter 2020 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2020. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 3, 2020 and in our press release, all of which are on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday and which is posted on our website. With me on the call is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into some of the highlights and key accomplishments for the first half of 2020, I would like to take a moment to recognize essential workers around the world, including some of our IFFers who continue to fuel our global supply chain and keep our economy moving forward. Your strength and dedication are truly commendable and I thank you for your efforts. While we continue to operate in challenging times, I'm proud to say that our employees have continued to meet and exceed the needs and expectations of our customers around the world. Today, I will focus my remarks on a review of the highlights from the first half of 2020, as well as an update of business dynamics with regards to COVID-19. Rustom will then provide a more detailed review of our Q2 financial performance. Lastly, we will provide an update on our progress towards completing the previously announced transaction with DuPont N&B. There is no question that over the last several months, our business has been operating in a very difficult environment. Nevertheless, we have acted quickly to maintain continuity across our global operations in 44 countries, while simultaneously integrating the Frutarom business and establishing the foundation for our pending combination with DuPont N&B. I'm extremely proud of what our teams around the world has accomplished as we continue to move our business forward and tirelessly serve our customers. In this uncertain environment, our business has proven to be resilient. Fortunately, approximately 85% of our portfolio serves end markets that remain in high demands for COVID-19, including food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection. Our strong performance and growth in these areas, which in the first half of 2020 was approximately 5% on a currency neutral basis, helped to partially offset expected weakness in our segments that have been most affected by the pandemic. These markets, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, have been particularly sensitive to the downward pressure of the pandemic and have seen a double-digit decline over the first half of 2020. The challenges of 2020 also affirms to us that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for the world's most import manufacturers in food and beverage, as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies. IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. Amid these challenges, we remain on track with our Frutarom integration efforts, with only modest delays due to COVID-19, achieving very good cost synergies. We continue to expect to have majority of the integration completed by the end of this year. Similarly, we continue to make significant progress with our efforts to complete our merger with N&B. We have now achieved regulatory clearance in the United States, China, Colombia and Serbia. We have filed our definitive proxy statement and look forward to the shareholder award on August 27. We continue to make significant strides in our integration planning, which is very exciting when you consider the long-term potential of the combined businesses. As we shared in our business update in June 8, 2020, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The pandemic continues to be significant and a volatile factor in our lives. It creates uncertainty around the world, with rapidly changing operating environment and economic impacts. We are fortunate that a majority of our end markets continue to operate with relative strengths, but, as we have discussed before, our business is not totally immune from disruption of the pandemic. Turning to slide 7 and an overview of our financial performance in the first half of 2020, the first two quarters, we achieved $2.5 billion in sales, with currency neutral sales growth of 1%, which is largely attributed to the strong growth we saw in the Consumer Fragrances, which grew double digits and Savory Solutions, which was up mid-single digits. We also generated an adjusted operating profit of $478 million and adjusted EPS of $2.99, both excluding amortization. While this performance is moderately down year-over-year, these metrics reflect pressure from lower sales volume and adverse mix, as well as higher costs as a result of COVID-19. Through the prioritization of CapEx and improving our core working capital, I am pleased to report that we are able to generate significant free cash flow. For the first half of 2020, cash flow improved double digits, with operating cash flow increased 12% and free cash flow growing a very strong 94%. I'm encouraged by the resilience of our business through incredible challenging environment of the second quarter, where we saw the global peak to-date of regulatory restrictions. Moving to slide 8, I would like to walk you through IFF's effort and approach to managing through the pandemic, while ensuring the safety of our employees and our continued uninterrupted partnership with our customers around the globe. As our teams have led a truly admirable performance to deliver through the challenging period, we have also begun to look ahead to our operations in this new normal. Like I've said before, ensuring the health and safety of our employees has and always will be our utmost concern and is number one priority at IFF. As many countries and cities have begun to reopen and are moving out of complete lockdown, we are keeping a close eye on the recommendations of local and global public health officials, especially as it relates to implementing our return to work protocols. With each region recovering along varying timelines, our approach is to evaluate each of our facilities and offices on a case-by-case basis. While all of our manufacturing sites are open and operating fully, most remain limited to essential employees only. As for our corporate offices, all of our non-essential employees continue to work from home as of right now. Logistics remain an operating challenge, with lead times still higher than they would be on a normal basis, but we have been able to adapt fairly quickly to new local policies with minimal incremental expense. On the procurement side, costs remained elevated, as there are still some challenges in obtaining various raw materials. We are proactively addressing the situation to secure these necessary materials going forward and evaluating opportunities to mend processes of our supply chain for the future. Finally, when it comes to our creative centers, I am proud to say that even amid a global pandemic, in typical IFF fashion, we are creating innovative solutions to support our customers, whether in person or remotely. As restrictions and closures ease, we have already seen significant improvement in our pipeline. With that, I will turn the call over to Rustom, who will discuss the Q2 results in greater detail.\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Andreas. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody. On slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. On a currency neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to Q2 2019 and primarily driven by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which represents approximately 15% of our portfolio. The remainder of our portfolio, which includes food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products, collectively grew 2% in the quarter on a currency neutral basis, though offset by a 38% decline on a currency neutral basis in Fine Fragrance and Food Service combined. In addition to lower sales volume, we were impacted by an adverse sales mix and unfavorable price to raw material costs in the quarter, which pressured our operating profit excluding amortization and offset operational expense savings in the quarter. Despite a lower effective tax rate and more favorable other income, therefore, our adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was similarly impacted in Q2, driven by the decline in operating profit. Before moving into the details, I want to take a moment to remind those that are new to the IFF story about the currency neutral sales growth methodology difference between the way we report our growth and our competitors report. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in US dollars or other hard currencies, or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When reporting our currency neutral sales growth, we exclude these foreign exchange-related prices in emerging markets. But this is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the US dollar or euro. However, it's important to have all of you understand our performance relative to competition. During the second quarter of 2020, the stronger USD environment, plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets, had approximately a 2 percentage point currency impact on growth, if we include emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, our second quarter sales decline would have been 2% rather than 4%. Turning to slide 10, it's important to take a closer look at the underlying dynamics of our various business segments. In our first quarter 2020 conference call, I presented this slide in the outlook section as I believed it provided a good summary of the many moving parts we saw at that point in time. As we now see, much of what we expected and communicated came to fruition. As we've said before, we remain fortunate that most of IFF's business serves end markets and categories with relative strength. The categories most exposed to temporary disruption of customer access to retail markets, such as Fine Fragrance and the away-from-home channel, such as Food Service suffered. And yet, increased demand for products used in packaged food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection categories has led to strong results in Taste, excluding Food Service and in Consumer Fragrances. In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong. Yet, the pandemic created a raw materials headwind as we prioritize the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business forgoing external sales. I'm happy to report that in the month of July, as restrictions have eased, we have seen that the business has returned to growth, a trend that we expect to continue in the third quarter. As we approach the new normal in many regions across the world, we expect that the supply chain complications will ease and demand for away-from-home products will slowly return. Looking at slide 11, I'd like to review the underlying drivers impacting our profitability in the quarter. COVID-19 has clearly had an impact on profitability, significantly influencing volume, mix, and costs. The year-over-year change in profitability is mainly a result of a significant drop in volume, representing approximately half of our adjusted operating profit decline. Unfavorable price to raw material costs also impacted profitability, primarily in Fragrance Ingredients where prices were reduced to reflect future commodity cost reduction and where we are working through higher cost inventory. Unfortunately, with the steep decline in Fine Fragrance, sales mix was unfavorable and we also saw incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and procurement costs. To minimize these impacts, we were focused on disciplined cost management and continued productivity, both helping to protect profitability during this difficult time. We were encouraged by the realization of cost synergies from the Frutarom deal and expect this will remain core to our profitability story as we see revenues return in the coming quarters. Now, looking at our Scent division on slide 12, currency neutral sales declined 4% in the quarter. I'm happy to share that for the third quarter in a row, we achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, which can be attributed to robust growth in fabric, home, hair care, and personal wash. And while we did benefit from COVID-19 in some areas through higher volume, our commercial performance, or new wins was very strong, nearly 50% higher than our previous five-year average for the second quarter. Also the new core lists (16:34) where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, grew more than 85% in the second quarter and represented nearly 20% of our Consumer Fragrance growth. At the BU level, this was offset largely by the 40% sales decline in Fine Fragrance due to the disruption of our consumers' ability to reach retail markets and reduced travel needs. This had an adverse impact on volume in the existing business, which was down double digits, as well as new wins which traditionally are very strong but were also down as a result of COVID-19. We also saw lower Fragrance Ingredients external sales as we prioritized our Fragrance Compounds business due to supply restrictions in India. This has now improved, and we expect performance will continue to improve going forward. Cumulatively, the Scent business had sales of $450 million, down 4%; and a segment profit of $70 million, down roughly 25% at a 15.6% profit margin. Now, moving to Taste on slide 13, we saw currency neutral sales decline 5% in the quarter. From a category perspective, as COVID-19 restrictions kept consumers from eating outside their homes, away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, saw a significant 36% decline in the quarter. To put this in context, the decline in Food Service represented about 5 percentage points of the sales decline, meaning the business would have grown, excluding Food Service. From a regional perspective, North America showed resilience, yet emerging markets underperformed, given significant COVID-19 driven regulatory restriction in places like India and Latin America. India alone, which represents about 4% of total Taste sales, saw sales drop by almost 30%. From a customer perspective, we saw weakness across smaller local and regional customers, mainly Food Service. This was most evident in Frutarom, where standalone sales declined high-single digits in the second quarter. Discontinued Frutarom businesses, which will not be in the comparative periods going forward, remained headwind in Q2. So, for Taste overall, the business had $748 million in sales, down 5%; and segment profit of $107 million, down 15% for a 14.3% profit margin. Now, turning to slide 14, I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's cash flow performance and it's probably more useful to look at this year-to-date. The chart on the left is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was up 12% in the first half, which was primarily due to improvements in core working capital levels in Q2. Within core working capital, the improvement was largely driven by days payable outstanding, while days sales outstanding ended better than expected. We will continue to effectively manage our balance sheet by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and to maintain ample liquidity even during a prolonged global downturn. We also continue to invest in the business, especially as we work towards completing the Frutarom integration. Our capital expenditure as a percentage of sales was roughly 3.1% compared to 4.6% the previous year. The improvements in core working capital levels combined with the prioritized CapEx structure has led to strong free cash flow of $128 million, up 94% from the year ago period. Reflecting our confidence in our future cash flow generation, we are pleased to announce that we are raising our quarterly dividend by 3% to $0.77 per share. This marks 11 years of consecutive dividend increases and underscores our confidence in our business, our long-term strategy, and strong cash flow generation. Moving forward, we will continue to take a thoughtful approach to managing cash flow, continuing to prioritize the focus on core working capital and CapEx. Before passing back to Andreas, I want to take a moment to provide an update through the first month of the third quarter. On slide 15, you can see our sales trajectory during the first half of 2020 and the marked rebound we have seen unfold in the third quarter so far. We started the year strong in January with mid-single digit currency neutral sales growth. And although the emergence of COVID-19 impacted sales from mid-March, we are starting to see a notable performance in \u2013 improvement in performance in July. As global mobility is gradually improving and restrictions and closures are eased, the categories and markets impacted in Q2 are showing promising signs of improvement. Should the environment continue to improve, we're quite hopeful that we can regain a more normalized level of growth. And with that, let me turn back to Andreas.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Thank you, Rustom. Now, as we consider what the remainder of 2020 will look like for IFF, we're doing our best to anticipate performance in a global environment that remains quite volatile and unpredictable. We are actively evaluating evolving global market dynamics and regulatory conditions to understand and anticipate how these factors will impact our business performance, our people, and our customers. We are proud to supply solutions and ingredients for essential products in the food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection product categories, especially as these drive 85% of our current portfolio. As Rustom has stated earlier, our July sales performance has improved, growing in low-single digits. Consumer Fragrance continues to grow double digits and we are seeing a double-digit trend in Cosmetic Actives. Fragrance Ingredients had also improved as restriction eased, growing mid-single digits in July. In Taste, growth in Flavors in North America led by Tastepoint is more than offsetting pressure in Latin America. And we are seeing robust double-digit growth in health-oriented products, as well as an improvement in natural colors. We do, however, anticipate that Fine Fragrances and Food Services will remain impacted by market pressures in the second half of the year, but expect improving trends versus what we experienced in Q2. A good example of this is that our gelato ingredients, a category severely impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter is now up low-single digits to-date in the third quarter. As we enter the second half of 2020, we will continue to effectively manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow by targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. With the positive signs of improvement in our performance that we are beginning to see in the third quarter, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will see further market improvements in the quarter and beyond. Turn to slide 17, I'm very pleased to share with you now an update on where we stand with the integration planning of our previously announced merger agreement with DuPont N&B. We made a lot of headway in the first half of 2020, reaching key milestones like clearance in the US, China, Colombia, Ukraine, and Serbia, regulatory processes and announcing our combined company's progress vision, operating model, and leadership team. We are well on our way to establishing the foundation and framework that will be essential to achieving the potential of this exciting combination. More recently, in July, we filed definitive proxy and set the date for our special shareholders' meeting in connection with the merger which will occur later this month on August 27. We expect to earn our shareholder support for this exciting combination in the coming weeks, and remain on track to completing our transaction and uniting our organization in the first quarter of 2021. In summary, I'm proud to say that IFF has stayed resilient through the first half of 2020 amid the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19. We have achieved solid financial performance, while delivering for our 30,000-plus customers globally and executing on the integration processes for Frutarom and N&B. As we have said before, IFF plays a central role in the global CPG supply chain as a vital partner to world renowned brands, regional leaders and new innovators alike. Our position across end markets, customers with our global reach has created a real resiliency in our business that shines through these difficult times. With Frutarom, we are realizing the significant potential that our enhanced capabilities and expanded customer base will have for the IFF's long-term growth. Similarly, we look forward to joining forces with DuPont N&B and have made significant advancements in our integration planning and paths to regulatory and shareholder approval. I am deeply grateful to our employees across the globe, whose commitment and dedication to IFF and our customers has been unwavering. We have started to see improvements in our performance in July and remain cautiously optimistic about how this may translate into financial performance in the second half of 2020. IFF and our balanced portfolio remain well equipped to adapt and succeed in this unpredictable global environment. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: We'll take our first question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMark Astrachan - Stifel Financial Corp.: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning.\nMark Astrachan - Stifel Financial Corp.: I guess just to start. So, if you look at the broader share trend, even normalizing for how you're accounting for FX relative to peers, it seems there's a bit of an increasing divergence in your results for sales versus those of the largest F&F peers. I guess, I'm curious. Do you see the same thing, or it seems somewhat obvious to the folks from the outside in? So, I'd be curious to that perspective. And then if so, what is driving it and when should we anticipate those trends to normalize? And sort of related to that, it would seem, maybe, to trace back to the Frutarom deal. So, if true, what are you doing, best practices and such that you're putting in place, so as to not repeat those when you close the DNB (28:09) deal early next year.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Mark, for the question. I'll take it. As you alluded, certainly, it's good to take the FX reported numbers and compare apple-to-apples. I think that's number one. Number two I would say, we should judge our performance beyond just one quarter and should look at multiple quarters. And if you see, for example, in the first quarter, we led our industry in growth. I think that's a topic. The second one is, if you look at Q2, the emerging markets were pretty much under pressure. And you see that we are a bit over-indexed in the emerging markets. For example, India, we're a market leader in India with our Taste business, for example. That was actually a pretty bad hit on that business, which is, by the way, rebounding. And then we are \u2013 certainly, we're winning some smaller customers, which plays a role here as well. Fundamentally, I believe both will help us with our long-term growth, the smaller customers and the emerging market as well, as soon as we see the COVID pressures are easing. And if you look at July, I expect, actually, that the third quarter already will be \u2013 will look much different than the second quarter. That's what we have seen in our numbers for July. I think Rustom has shown it in his slide. We see it, in particular, in some of these areas where we have a good and strong performance on Consumer Fragrances, for example. You see that categories like home care or personal wash are really up in very, very high single digits. We believe that's a trend to stay. So, hygiene products will stay even after the, let's say, acute COVID crisis, quite as strong. We see a good rebound already in Fine Fragrances, so not as bad as we have seen it before. And the same holds true actually for Food Service. I just looked it up. April was our worst number and Food Service was down by 44.1%; in July, it's down by minus 7.7%. Just to tell you that the weak spots I think are improving, and the strong pieces of the portfolio are staying strong and helping us to grow our business going forward, which will help us with our mix going forward in the third quarter as well. I hope that helps, Mark.\nMark Astrachan - Stifel Financial Corp.: Sure. Thank you. I guess just somewhat related to that, maybe sticking on the commentary about June versus July. So, I guess, I was surprised a bit that June was worse, given that most of your customers kind of talked about sequentially improving trends through the second quarter. So, maybe why, beyond the obvious, the comparisons for you are easier in 3Q, why did you see this improvement beginning in July? Why was June a bit worse? Does it speak to inventory levels for customers? Is it just simply third quarter, people started ordering more product? Where do you think inventory levels are for those customers? And how do you think about the durability of what you just said about July through the quarter?\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Look, on inventory levels of the customers, it's tough to comment on, because we see huge differences from customer-to-customer, from region-to-region, and category-to-category. That's a big difference. I would say July is better for us because some of the categories which were hard hit in the second quarter, like Food Service, are improving better. That's certainly helping and that some of the emerging markets like India, for example, are performing much, much better. In July, we have actually a double-digit growth going forward and that helped us a lot. Why June had a little bit of a dip even compared to May? If I look at our daily sales, it's not so much. I think it's a comparable. I would not take this too \u2013 I think it depends also on the order pattern and what we see right now, as I said, July pretty strong for us and the order book for the third quarter is up mid-single to high-single digits as well. So, I believe that the trend will continue. So, it's a bit of phasing in there as well. But, Rustom, you please or Mike, you please comment.\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. I agree, Andreas. I would just \u2013 you've seen the phasing, you've seen the average daily sales. There's no deceleration in the numbers. And then coming through into July, I mean, you've seen a very nice \u2013 we've seen a very nice in comparative terms pickup in areas that were like Fine Fragrances where \u2013 compared to where they were going through May, and then June, and where July is, and then Food Service, as Andreas said. So, nothing, but reiterating what he said really there.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning.\nFaiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, I wanted to just shift gears a little bit actually, and talk about N&B because it feels like \u2013 so you have your shareholder vote at the end of this month, and it feels to me that the deal might close soon after that, maybe earlier than your target. And I'm looking at slide 17 and I was wondering, Andreas, maybe if you could give us a little bit more color around how do you expect to go from at close, like the second to last box that you have on that slide to the revenue and cost synergy capture by end of year three. So, I'm sure we'll get into it in more detail as time goes on, but I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of a preview of how you are expecting things to play out from here.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, first of all, our assumption is still that we're closing first quarter next year. That's actually the plan also for the carve-out of the business. I think that's important. And right now, we are focusing a lot on, let's say, closing on our food integration. So, the remaining piece of it, which will happen in the early part of the fourth quarter, I think that's important. On the N&B side, as we said, we are progressing actually absolutely according to plan, in some of the areas even a couple of days ahead, which is quite interesting during the COVID environment. I think the teams are doing really a fantastic job. We see also \u2013 and just as a remark on the N&B business, you have seen when they reported, actually a bit of growth with 1%, a strong mix. 85% of the portfolio is pretty resilient against the COVID crisis as well. So very similar and a good mix in particular tilted towards the probiotics. But maybe, Rustom, if you can comment as well on the page 17?\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Absolutely, I'd love to Andreas. We're \u2013 and good morning. We are also \u2013 in a very detailed way on the synergies, on the sales synergies, we have teams from within the project from the IMO, the integration team working with our business unit people and specifically identifying opportunities to have revenue synergies and what pre-work needs to be done as much as possible. Now, obviously, we can't work together with the N&B people, but we can plan together at this point in time. And so, we are trying to do that. Likewise, on the costs, I mean, I can sort of put on a functional hat for a second. I mean, we are looking at our structure, looking at their structure, looking at our systems, looking at their systems, and basically in a very methodical way going through and trying to identify opportunities to optimize the business and make it stronger and get greater revenue growth without cost and also areas where there's duplication of costs that we can take out. So, just a bit more detail, but it's moving. We want to basically hit the ground running.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. And absolutely, and I would say on the cost savings, we're really on both parts, on the sales savings or synergy certainly as well. We have pretty robust plans in place. I just give you two numbers. We certainly have for the cost savings internally a higher number, which we are working towards. And secondly, we have started with, I think, 400 projects, which could help us with the sales synergies. We narrowed it down to around 100, to make sure that we really focus on the most important ones. And I would say these are really good and robust plans we have in place. And we still have a couple of months until day one. And \u2013 but it gives us a good feel because in some areas, as Rustom said, it's robust and we are probably even ahead of plan, which is great.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. You noted double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. I assume that included a decline in emerging markets outside of China. So, maybe you could peel that apart, how much was emerging markets, excluding China, down in Consumer Fragrance? And then how \u2013 actually how high was the rest of the portfolio?\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. So, we see actually a good rebound in our China business, that's for sure. But we have to say that it's not just China, we saw, for example, in July already, actually, a very strong performance of our Consumer Fragrance business in India. Actually, it might just because we looked at the numbers, it was more than 40% for July, which was kind of amazing. But it is because we had a couple of good wins and it's going very well. And we have actually a quite significant and good performance in Latin America as well, believe it or not. So, it's not just China, it is also on the Consumer Fragrance side, some of the emerging markets. Not all of them, but some of the emerging markets are actually performing better than we have expected as well. But maybe, Rustom, you give even more details.\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. So, the emerging markets, there's \u2013 John, there's variation between the emerging markets rather than treating them as a particular group, right. India has been the outlier in terms of underperformance. But we have also had an impact in Latin America, in Brazil, and where we have switching from Consumer from \u2013 into Fine, where we have a significant market over there that we have seen come off. We don't really think that what's going on in emerging markets is necessarily predictive of what the future is going to be. I mean, it's just as you look at different countries, country-by-country on where they are in terms of the \u2013 on the curve of handling COVID is really what we're seeing in terms of Consumer, Food Service, Fine, I mean, all the areas basically.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: What might be interesting, John, for you and for all the colleagues on the phone as well, what we try, because in this very volatile environment, we have doubled down on our consumer insights' studies, and we look certainly how the Consumer looks like during COVID and what can we expect after COVID. And we have never drawn down on three scenes which we're sharing with our customers as well; it's health, home, and hygiene. So, we believe that in some of the areas, like, for example, hygiene and we see it in our Scent products we are selling there, this is a trend which will stay even post-COVID. And as I said, our home care in July, category is up by 27% and personal wash by plus-16%, just to show you what the impact on the business is because these products are so much in demand. On the other hand, it's the home area. We believe that this cocooning at home will stay at least for a couple of months through the winter. So, culinary, everything which is culinary products for home cooking will stay up. We believe that malodor control is an important one. And on the health side, we see that all of our health ingredients, most of them we got through Frutarom, are very much in high demand, that the modulation of sweet is in high demand because governments are again starting to double down on sugar and products. So what I tried to say here is, that we have looked at the consumer insights quite carefully and we are basically now looking how we can orient our organization towards these trends where we believe they will stay for a while to make sure that we get more than a fair share of growth out of these categories. So that's what we're doing, just to give you a bit of a bigger picture and an outlook beyond the third quarter.\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: And I didn't answer the specific question by the way. The emerging market is actually mid-single digit. Just to put it in context. So not negative or anything like that, but not as strong as the developed markets, which were obviously much higher to get us to the average.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Oh, yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning.\nAdam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: A lot of ground's been covered on the revenue side, so maybe just switching to the cost side a little bit, a lot of moving pieces in the second quarter given the volume declines in mix and COVID costs. And I'm just trying to make sure I understand kind of what happened in 3Q, if we're back to organic revenue growth. Price cost, just how do we think about that dynamics playing out over the balance of the year? Kind of what's the incremental COVID-related cost expenses you expect to be absorbing in the next couple of quarters? And just thinking about kind of the operating leverage that is or is not in the business if the revenue growth is back to the trend you saw in July?\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, let me...\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Absolutely. We take this. Rustom, you take it.\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Yeah. So, let me break it up and give you a thing. First of all, I'll give you the COVID-related costs, okay? And then primarily procurement, logistics and manufacturing costs. And in Q2, they were about $6 million, okay? $6 million and we would expect this to start declining as we go through the rest of the year, right? Because Q2, as we've already said, is when we thought we had the highest point. There will still be some continuing manufacturing, because as Andreas has said many times, we put the safety of our people first. And so, there are things that we are doing differently until the vaccine comes, in terms of how we manufacture. Then the second part of your question, I believe, and if I missed something, take me back. But the second part of your question was really about pricing and raw material costs, right, and what we have. So, in Q2, it was negative. I mean, our pricing actions did not fully recover our higher costs. And Fragrance Ingredients, for example, we talked about that as well. Now, moving forward, we have the oil-related costs selectively helping us as we move forward. And we should see a benefit from some of those \u2013 from \u2013 in general, the input costs, we will see a benefit coming from them, right? Definitely. We, however, will have a negative on pricing and that comes a lot from vanilla. I mean, vanilla has dropped back. It was in the 500s. It's dropped back into the 200s. I mean, it could go even lower. And so, you will see that impact on pricing. So, what we are projecting right now is for the net price to raw material costs for the rest of the year to remain negative. Did I cover the \u2013 your \u2013 both aspects of your question there?\nAdam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then just maybe following on, the cash flow performance in the second quarter was very strong. Is there any reason why that wouldn't persist in the second half of the year? Any cash flow dynamics we should be mindful of?\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. I mean, we'll continue to work on cash flows. So, let me sort of just break up the components, right? I mean, first of all, on our CapEx, I mean, we've been very focused on our CapEx, very early literally from probably February or so. And we set ourselves the target of spending roughly about 10% less on our CapEx for the year than our budget. And we're running even below that, by the way, at this point in time, but that will continue. That's the CapEx, right? We're watching our cash expenses, in general, across the board. And some things are obvious and you'll see that like some things benefit EBITDA, like travel, which will keep coming through. But the other biggest one is working capital. And on our working capital, if you remember what we said even a few months ago, we deliberately moved to build up our inventories so as to avoid customer disruption. I mean, because the two things we tried to do is keep our people safe and avoid disrupting our customers, right? And so far, we've managed to do both. Inventory, we \u2013 inventory actually, because of lags in actually receiving it, we were actually a little bit better in Q1 than we expected, a little bit worse in Q2. We do expect that to start to come down now gradually as we go through Q3 and Q4 as we have built it up, right? On our DSO, which is the other big area where we flagged that we were expecting an increase, we actually did particularly well in terms of \u2013 compared to where we expected to be. And that was just, say, a lot of focused management from the teams. And that should continue and we would hope as the broad economic situation abates and things get a little bit better, we'd hope to do well on that, too. And then the last component of it was just payables. I mean, we managed that very tightly, in terms of making \u2013 sometimes accelerating payments and there's smaller suppliers that we want to keep afloat. And other times, just managing it very tightly, like you'd expect from any company of our size.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. So first, could you update us on regulatory developments on Nutrition & Biosciences transaction in Europe? Why haven't we received a ruling from Europe and do you expect to get one before the shareholder vote?\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: We expect actually in the August-September timeframe the ruling. We were going back and forth with them to answer the questions before the summer break. And I think in the next couple of weeks, we should get the clearance in Europe. That's what our lawyers are telling us. So I think we should be on track. Whether we can make it before the shareholder vote, I'm not 100% sure, but early September will be my best guess right now.\nJeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then secondly, it looks like your Fine Fragrance business in the first half was down, I don't know, 25%, and maybe your key Swiss competitor was down 16%. Can you talk about the differences in like-for-like sales growth?\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. Look, the differences, I would say, are, probably, with the customers. If you look at many of our big Fine Fragrance customers, you see even worse performance than the minus 20%, 25% and that's what's driving it. Because the win rate in our Fine Fragrance business is still pretty good. We see also a good influx of new projects coming. And, as we said, the start into the third quarter was actually pretty encouraging, what we have seen for Fine Fragrances. So, I would say the main differences is the customer structure and how much the customers are selling of their actual products. But I actually expect that this will normalize over the course of the year, because in general, I think our win rate in that area is a very, very good one. And we will see the \u2013 and just the \u2013 the most important season is right before the holidays, that's where we sell most of our Fine Fragrances. So, end of third quarter, early fourth quarter is actually \u2013 that's where you win the year. And that's what we have to watch and I hope when we have the third quarter announcement, that we can give you more news on that one as well. I hope that helps.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Good morning.\nLauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just wanted to \u2013 good morning. I wanted to ask a bit first about the US. So, the business was down slightly in the second quarter. It was a sequential improvement, because it was down closer to 1% in the first quarter. But can you talk a little bit about what's going on there because given the first half performance, it wouldn't seem to be specifically COVID-related? All consumer packaged goods sales are through the roof, when you kind of look at what's going on from an end market standpoint. So, what's going on in that business? Maybe have you lost any big contracts or things like that, because it's kind of fallen off because the performance there is, candidly, a bit surprising still? Thanks.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. So, Rustom, can you take the numbers?\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: So, yeah. I mean, I think you're \u2013 are you comparing \u2013 are you including sales of Consumer Fragrances in there as well, with the Fine Fragrances or what (51:56)?\nLauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm just looking at just US sales.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: In general, Taste and Fragrances, everything?\nLauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Correct.\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: In general, our North American business has held up relatively well. I mean, we have seen \u2013 if you look at Taste and you look at some of the performance that we've had there, we haven't really seen any big disappointments. We did have the impact in Fine, specifically in North America and Europe. And that could be coloring part of our numbers there because that's where our large global customers are concentrated, right. And in terms of our Consumer business, our Consumer business did well across the board. I mean, in developed markets and I don't have the North American number in my fingertips, but if you look at developed markets, it was in the high-teens, the growth in Q2, Consumer specifically. So, I mean... (52:52)\nLauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. I think the numbers in the Q suggested the US entirely did not grow in the second quarter, nor in the first, and North America, in total, was like 1% or 2%. So, again, it is a huge contrast to what the majority of the customers are doing. But we'll look back at the Q and double check I haven't misread something that's in the filing. Thanks.\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Sure. And we can always follow up. We can always follow up later as well, too.\nLauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yeah. That would be good. Let's follow up on that one.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from James Targett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nJames Targett - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Hi. Good morning. Two questions for me. Just, firstly, on innovation, you mentioned that you see the project pipeline improving as restrictions are minimized. But just generally, could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of customer appetite for innovation, new product launches, generally? Obviously, we're hearing a lot of CPG companies talk about rationalizing their innovation programs, cutting tail innovations, SKUs, et cetera. So, any color you can give on your position that'd be great. And secondly, just on the \u2013 sort of the recovery momentum you're seeing in July. Can you maybe talk about a little \u2013 any sort of differences you're seeing between the momentum in your large customers, your global customers versus your smaller or more local ones? Thank you.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Sure. Absolutely. If I touch on innovation, what we have seen actually when the COVID crisis was on its peak in Europe and in the US, so starting in March, April, even parts of parts of May, we've seen a slowdown in our innovation pipeline. Also, driven by the demand of some of the packaged food, for example, or some of the Consumer Fragrances. So, everybody was trying to get the existing product on the shelf as fast as they could. Since then actually, starting with May, we have seen actually a continuous influx of new projects, actually across the board, in all of our different categories we are playing in and there's more coming. We saw it first, obviously, in China, because that was the first country basically out of the gates in \u2013 after the COVID crisis for them and they are already almost back to normal. So, we see that many of the bigger CPGs and also the smallers are now really are back to normal. It's certainly depending customer-by-customer, but many are coming again with new projects to us. So, that's on the first one. On the second one, on the recovery, we see a recovery. We should look at country-by-country and category-by-category. Let me start with not maybe countries, but with regions. Here as well, in the recovery, Asia is now big, in particular India is surging, after India was very impacted in the second quarter. It's really coming back. We see a good comeback on Europe as well. The US is very, very good for us, maybe with the exception of the Fine Fragrance business. And we see an impact on newer projects in Latin America, where we see \u2013 and in particular in Brazil and Mexico are now at the peak of the crisis. In terms of the categories, we are happy to report back that not just everybody is looking for solutions on hygiene products, but we see also more demand and new projects on Food Service products, which is really good. I commented already on the Fine Fragrances. Fine Fragrance are coming back as well. On the customer base, we certainly see it with large customers; with smaller customers, it's probably more of a mixed situation where we are in, but some of them are coming back to us as well. So I hope that helps to picturize how we see the situation right now, in terms of innovation, but in terms of recovery as well. And as I said, look, I don't want to bank too much on just the July results, but we see that the order book is quite strong as well for the rest of the quarter and that should help us, actually, with a positive performance as far as we see it. Rustom?\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. And we talked a fair amount about Scent earlier on and maybe a little bit of color on our Taste categories, right? If you look at Flavors and if you exclude the impact of India, which we have covered in Food Service, right, the big negative, all our other businesses grew at around 2.5%, and that was mainly due to an increase in North America and Greater Asia, driven by strong commercial performance there and some decrease in EMEA in EAME, due to some postponed new wins, and then of course Latin America, where you have the big negative because of COVID. Savory was another strong quarter, I mean, comparatively. I mean, the in-home consumption channels were up like over 5%, call it, mid-single digits. And again, strong performance in North America and Great Asia offset by some weakness in EMEA and that was due to Food Service because we have a lot of small Food Service customers in EMEA. And then inclusions, I mean, obviously impacted a lot by COVID, but this \u2013 as Andreas said, I mean, with gelato coming back quite strongly with what we are going there since \u2013 in the last several weeks. And finally, MPS, mixed performance in there. The health aspects of it is extremely strong. And then in some of other food protection areas, there have been some delayed launches and stuff like that. So, all in all, I mean, that just gives a bit of additional color that we didn't share earlier.\nOperator: We'll take our final question today from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nMark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Just two quick things. How much differently would you run your operations if we did have a long-term shift to more meals at home, a limited restaurant recovery? I'm wondering how big a restructuring that would be for you. And second, I was just hoping you could help me understand your exposure between quick serve and regular restaurants, and whether those two trended differently as you started to see recovery.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Look, for the meals at home, actually, we are pretty well positioned with our Savory Solutions business because we have an extra culinary area, which we're using for that area. We certainly would look and double down what we can develop here. So, I think that's an important aspect. So, I think it \u2013 I wouldn't say it would benefit us more, but it would be certainly very manageable for us as well. On QSR and retail restaurants, we have almost a similar mix. I think that's an important one. And what we see is that some of the quick service restaurants are really coming back now, which is good and it's helping us on the Food Service area as well. But, Rustom, you may comment if you have any more insights.\nRustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: No. I mean, it's a mix of those two. I mean, we're actually seeing the restaurants coming back as well too, if you looked at our most recent Food Service numbers. But apart from that, the quick service is clearly coming back faster.\nMark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Very good.\nOperator: Thank you. And this will conclude today's Q&A session. I'll return the floor to Andreas for closing remarks.\nAndreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.: Yes. Thank you very much for your time. And these are very exciting times. I hope we gave you good insights on how we see the business, even beyond the second quarter. And we are looking forward to the one-on-ones. Thank you very much. Take care and stay healthy.\nOperator: We'll conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Rustom F. Jilla - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.",
            "content": "Thank you, Andreas. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody. On slide 9, we've outlined a more detailed look at our financial performance in the last quarter. On a currency neutral basis, IFF generated $1.2 billion in sales, down 4% when compared to Q2 2019 and primarily driven by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service, which represents approximately 15% of our portfolio. The remainder of our portfolio, which includes food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection products, collectively grew 2% in the quarter on a currency neutral basis, though offset by a 38% decline on a currency neutral basis in Fine Fragrance and Food Service combined. In addition to lower sales volume, we were impacted by an adverse sales mix and unfavorable price to raw material costs in the quarter, which pressured our operating profit excluding amortization and offset operational expense savings in the quarter. Despite a lower effective tax rate and more favorable other income, therefore, our adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization, was similarly impacted in Q2, driven by the decline in operating profit. Before moving into the details, I want to take a moment to remind those that are new to the IFF story about the currency neutral sales growth methodology difference between the way we report our growth and our competitors report. For a variety of reasons, many of our sales transactions in the emerging markets occur either in US dollars or other hard currencies, or are indexed to hard currencies when we have to invoice in local market currencies. When reporting our currency neutral sales growth, we exclude these foreign exchange-related prices in emerging markets. But this is different from our peers. We believe our reporting standard provides investors with a truer assessment of underlying currency neutral growth, especially when there are large emerging market devaluations relative to the US dollar or euro. However, it's important to have all of you understand our performance relative to competition. During the second quarter of 2020, the stronger USD environment, plus significant emerging market devaluations year-over-year in several key markets, had approximately a 2 percentage point currency impact on growth, if we include emerging market pricing. Factoring in this comparability adjustment, our second quarter sales decline would have been 2% rather than 4%. Turning to slide 10, it's important to take a closer look at the underlying dynamics of our various business segments. In our first quarter 2020 conference call, I presented this slide in the outlook section as I believed it provided a good summary of the many moving parts we saw at that point in time. As we now see, much of what we expected and communicated came to fruition. As we've said before, we remain fortunate that most of IFF's business serves end markets and categories with relative strength. The categories most exposed to temporary disruption of customer access to retail markets, such as Fine Fragrance and the away-from-home channel, such as Food Service suffered. And yet, increased demand for products used in packaged food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection categories has led to strong results in Taste, excluding Food Service and in Consumer Fragrances. In our Fragrance Ingredients business, demand is strong. Yet, the pandemic created a raw materials headwind as we prioritize the use of our Fragrance Ingredients to support our Fragrance Compounds business forgoing external sales. I'm happy to report that in the month of July, as restrictions have eased, we have seen that the business has returned to growth, a trend that we expect to continue in the third quarter. As we approach the new normal in many regions across the world, we expect that the supply chain complications will ease and demand for away-from-home products will slowly return. Looking at slide 11, I'd like to review the underlying drivers impacting our profitability in the quarter. COVID-19 has clearly had an impact on profitability, significantly influencing volume, mix, and costs. The year-over-year change in profitability is mainly a result of a significant drop in volume, representing approximately half of our adjusted operating profit decline. Unfavorable price to raw material costs also impacted profitability, primarily in Fragrance Ingredients where prices were reduced to reflect future commodity cost reduction and where we are working through higher cost inventory. Unfortunately, with the steep decline in Fine Fragrance, sales mix was unfavorable and we also saw incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and procurement costs. To minimize these impacts, we were focused on disciplined cost management and continued productivity, both helping to protect profitability during this difficult time. We were encouraged by the realization of cost synergies from the Frutarom deal and expect this will remain core to our profitability story as we see revenues return in the coming quarters. Now, looking at our Scent division on slide 12, currency neutral sales declined 4% in the quarter. I'm happy to share that for the third quarter in a row, we achieved double-digit sales growth in Consumer Fragrance, which can be attributed to robust growth in fabric, home, hair care, and personal wash. And while we did benefit from COVID-19 in some areas through higher volume, our commercial performance, or new wins was very strong, nearly 50% higher than our previous five-year average for the second quarter. Also the new core lists (16:34) where we recently gained access, core to our 2021 strategy, grew more than 85% in the second quarter and represented nearly 20% of our Consumer Fragrance growth. At the BU level, this was offset largely by the 40% sales decline in Fine Fragrance due to the disruption of our consumers' ability to reach retail markets and reduced travel needs. This had an adverse impact on volume in the existing business, which was down double digits, as well as new wins which traditionally are very strong but were also down as a result of COVID-19. We also saw lower Fragrance Ingredients external sales as we prioritized our Fragrance Compounds business due to supply restrictions in India. This has now improved, and we expect performance will continue to improve going forward. Cumulatively, the Scent business had sales of $450 million, down 4%; and a segment profit of $70 million, down roughly 25% at a 15.6% profit margin. Now, moving to Taste on slide 13, we saw currency neutral sales decline 5% in the quarter. From a category perspective, as COVID-19 restrictions kept consumers from eating outside their homes, away-from-home channels, such as Food Service, saw a significant 36% decline in the quarter. To put this in context, the decline in Food Service represented about 5 percentage points of the sales decline, meaning the business would have grown, excluding Food Service. From a regional perspective, North America showed resilience, yet emerging markets underperformed, given significant COVID-19 driven regulatory restriction in places like India and Latin America. India alone, which represents about 4% of total Taste sales, saw sales drop by almost 30%. From a customer perspective, we saw weakness across smaller local and regional customers, mainly Food Service. This was most evident in Frutarom, where standalone sales declined high-single digits in the second quarter. Discontinued Frutarom businesses, which will not be in the comparative periods going forward, remained headwind in Q2. So, for Taste overall, the business had $748 million in sales, down 5%; and segment profit of $107 million, down 15% for a 14.3% profit margin. Now, turning to slide 14, I'd like to provide an overview of IFF's cash flow performance and it's probably more useful to look at this year-to-date. The chart on the left is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to free cash flow, inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was up 12% in the first half, which was primarily due to improvements in core working capital levels in Q2. Within core working capital, the improvement was largely driven by days payable outstanding, while days sales outstanding ended better than expected. We will continue to effectively manage our balance sheet by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and to maintain ample liquidity even during a prolonged global downturn. We also continue to invest in the business, especially as we work towards completing the Frutarom integration. Our capital expenditure as a percentage of sales was roughly 3.1% compared to 4.6% the previous year. The improvements in core working capital levels combined with the prioritized CapEx structure has led to strong free cash flow of $128 million, up 94% from the year ago period. Reflecting our confidence in our future cash flow generation, we are pleased to announce that we are raising our quarterly dividend by 3% to $0.77 per share. This marks 11 years of consecutive dividend increases and underscores our confidence in our business, our long-term strategy, and strong cash flow generation. Moving forward, we will continue to take a thoughtful approach to managing cash flow, continuing to prioritize the focus on core working capital and CapEx. Before passing back to Andreas, I want to take a moment to provide an update through the first month of the third quarter. On slide 15, you can see our sales trajectory during the first half of 2020 and the marked rebound we have seen unfold in the third quarter so far. We started the year strong in January with mid-single digit currency neutral sales growth. And although the emergence of COVID-19 impacted sales from mid-March, we are starting to see a notable performance in \u2013 improvement in performance in July. As global mobility is gradually improving and restrictions and closures are eased, the categories and markets impacted in Q2 are showing promising signs of improvement. Should the environment continue to improve, we're quite hopeful that we can regain a more normalized level of growth. And with that, let me turn back to Andreas. No. I agree, Andreas. I would just \u2013 you've seen the phasing, you've seen the average daily sales. There's no deceleration in the numbers. And then coming through into July, I mean, you've seen a very nice \u2013 we've seen a very nice in comparative terms pickup in areas that were like Fine Fragrances where \u2013 compared to where they were going through May, and then June, and where July is, and then Food Service, as Andreas said. So, nothing, but reiterating what he said really there. Yes. Absolutely, I'd love to Andreas. We're \u2013 and good morning. We are also \u2013 in a very detailed way on the synergies, on the sales synergies, we have teams from within the project from the IMO, the integration team working with our business unit people and specifically identifying opportunities to have revenue synergies and what pre-work needs to be done as much as possible. Now, obviously, we can't work together with the N&B people, but we can plan together at this point in time. And so, we are trying to do that. Likewise, on the costs, I mean, I can sort of put on a functional hat for a second. I mean, we are looking at our structure, looking at their structure, looking at our systems, looking at their systems, and basically in a very methodical way going through and trying to identify opportunities to optimize the business and make it stronger and get greater revenue growth without cost and also areas where there's duplication of costs that we can take out. So, just a bit more detail, but it's moving. We want to basically hit the ground running. Sure. So, the emerging markets, there's \u2013 John, there's variation between the emerging markets rather than treating them as a particular group, right. India has been the outlier in terms of underperformance. But we have also had an impact in Latin America, in Brazil, and where we have switching from Consumer from \u2013 into Fine, where we have a significant market over there that we have seen come off. We don't really think that what's going on in emerging markets is necessarily predictive of what the future is going to be. I mean, it's just as you look at different countries, country-by-country on where they are in terms of the \u2013 on the curve of handling COVID is really what we're seeing in terms of Consumer, Food Service, Fine, I mean, all the areas basically. And I didn't answer the specific question by the way. The emerging market is actually mid-single digit. Just to put it in context. So not negative or anything like that, but not as strong as the developed markets, which were obviously much higher to get us to the average. So, let me... Yes. Thanks. Yeah. So, let me break it up and give you a thing. First of all, I'll give you the COVID-related costs, okay? And then primarily procurement, logistics and manufacturing costs. And in Q2, they were about $6 million, okay? $6 million and we would expect this to start declining as we go through the rest of the year, right? Because Q2, as we've already said, is when we thought we had the highest point. There will still be some continuing manufacturing, because as Andreas has said many times, we put the safety of our people first. And so, there are things that we are doing differently until the vaccine comes, in terms of how we manufacture. Then the second part of your question, I believe, and if I missed something, take me back. But the second part of your question was really about pricing and raw material costs, right, and what we have. So, in Q2, it was negative. I mean, our pricing actions did not fully recover our higher costs. And Fragrance Ingredients, for example, we talked about that as well. Now, moving forward, we have the oil-related costs selectively helping us as we move forward. And we should see a benefit from some of those \u2013 from \u2013 in general, the input costs, we will see a benefit coming from them, right? Definitely. We, however, will have a negative on pricing and that comes a lot from vanilla. I mean, vanilla has dropped back. It was in the 500s. It's dropped back into the 200s. I mean, it could go even lower. And so, you will see that impact on pricing. So, what we are projecting right now is for the net price to raw material costs for the rest of the year to remain negative. Did I cover the \u2013 your \u2013 both aspects of your question there? No. I mean, we'll continue to work on cash flows. So, let me sort of just break up the components, right? I mean, first of all, on our CapEx, I mean, we've been very focused on our CapEx, very early literally from probably February or so. And we set ourselves the target of spending roughly about 10% less on our CapEx for the year than our budget. And we're running even below that, by the way, at this point in time, but that will continue. That's the CapEx, right? We're watching our cash expenses, in general, across the board. And some things are obvious and you'll see that like some things benefit EBITDA, like travel, which will keep coming through. But the other biggest one is working capital. And on our working capital, if you remember what we said even a few months ago, we deliberately moved to build up our inventories so as to avoid customer disruption. I mean, because the two things we tried to do is keep our people safe and avoid disrupting our customers, right? And so far, we've managed to do both. Inventory, we \u2013 inventory actually, because of lags in actually receiving it, we were actually a little bit better in Q1 than we expected, a little bit worse in Q2. We do expect that to start to come down now gradually as we go through Q3 and Q4 as we have built it up, right? On our DSO, which is the other big area where we flagged that we were expecting an increase, we actually did particularly well in terms of \u2013 compared to where we expected to be. And that was just, say, a lot of focused management from the teams. And that should continue and we would hope as the broad economic situation abates and things get a little bit better, we'd hope to do well on that, too. And then the last component of it was just payables. I mean, we managed that very tightly, in terms of making \u2013 sometimes accelerating payments and there's smaller suppliers that we want to keep afloat. And other times, just managing it very tightly, like you'd expect from any company of our size. Yeah. Look, the differences, I would say, are, probably, with the customers. If you look at many of our big Fine Fragrance customers, you see even worse performance than the minus 20%, 25% and that's what's driving it. Because the win rate in our Fine Fragrance business is still pretty good. We see also a good influx of new projects coming. And, as we said, the start into the third quarter was actually pretty encouraging, what we have seen for Fine Fragrances. So, I would say the main differences is the customer structure and how much the customers are selling of their actual products. But I actually expect that this will normalize over the course of the year, because in general, I think our win rate in that area is a very, very good one. And we will see the \u2013 and just the \u2013 the most important season is right before the holidays, that's where we sell most of our Fine Fragrances. So, end of third quarter, early fourth quarter is actually \u2013 that's where you win the year. And that's what we have to watch and I hope when we have the third quarter announcement, that we can give you more news on that one as well. I hope that helps. So, yeah. I mean, I think you're \u2013 are you comparing \u2013 are you including sales of Consumer Fragrances in there as well, with the Fine Fragrances or what (51:56)? In general, our North American business has held up relatively well. I mean, we have seen \u2013 if you look at Taste and you look at some of the performance that we've had there, we haven't really seen any big disappointments. We did have the impact in Fine, specifically in North America and Europe. And that could be coloring part of our numbers there because that's where our large global customers are concentrated, right. And in terms of our Consumer business, our Consumer business did well across the board. I mean, in developed markets and I don't have the North American number in my fingertips, but if you look at developed markets, it was in the high-teens, the growth in Q2, Consumer specifically. So, I mean... (52:52) Sure. Sure. And we can always follow up. We can always follow up later as well, too. Yes. Thank you. And we talked a fair amount about Scent earlier on and maybe a little bit of color on our Taste categories, right? If you look at Flavors and if you exclude the impact of India, which we have covered in Food Service, right, the big negative, all our other businesses grew at around 2.5%, and that was mainly due to an increase in North America and Greater Asia, driven by strong commercial performance there and some decrease in EMEA in EAME, due to some postponed new wins, and then of course Latin America, where you have the big negative because of COVID. Savory was another strong quarter, I mean, comparatively. I mean, the in-home consumption channels were up like over 5%, call it, mid-single digits. And again, strong performance in North America and Great Asia offset by some weakness in EMEA and that was due to Food Service because we have a lot of small Food Service customers in EMEA. And then inclusions, I mean, obviously impacted a lot by COVID, but this \u2013 as Andreas said, I mean, with gelato coming back quite strongly with what we are going there since \u2013 in the last several weeks. And finally, MPS, mixed performance in there. The health aspects of it is extremely strong. And then in some of other food protection areas, there have been some delayed launches and stuff like that. So, all in all, I mean, that just gives a bit of additional color that we didn't share earlier. No. I mean, it's a mix of those two. I mean, we're actually seeing the restaurants coming back as well too, if you looked at our most recent Food Service numbers. But apart from that, the quick service is clearly coming back faster."

            "name": "Andreas Fibig - International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc.",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into some of the highlights and key accomplishments for the first half of 2020, I would like to take a moment to recognize essential workers around the world, including some of our IFFers who continue to fuel our global supply chain and keep our economy moving forward. Your strength and dedication are truly commendable and I thank you for your efforts. While we continue to operate in challenging times, I'm proud to say that our employees have continued to meet and exceed the needs and expectations of our customers around the world. Today, I will focus my remarks on a review of the highlights from the first half of 2020, as well as an update of business dynamics with regards to COVID-19. Rustom will then provide a more detailed review of our Q2 financial performance. Lastly, we will provide an update on our progress towards completing the previously announced transaction with DuPont N&B. There is no question that over the last several months, our business has been operating in a very difficult environment. Nevertheless, we have acted quickly to maintain continuity across our global operations in 44 countries, while simultaneously integrating the Frutarom business and establishing the foundation for our pending combination with DuPont N&B. I'm extremely proud of what our teams around the world has accomplished as we continue to move our business forward and tirelessly serve our customers. In this uncertain environment, our business has proven to be resilient. Fortunately, approximately 85% of our portfolio serves end markets that remain in high demands for COVID-19, including food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection. Our strong performance and growth in these areas, which in the first half of 2020 was approximately 5% on a currency neutral basis, helped to partially offset expected weakness in our segments that have been most affected by the pandemic. These markets, including Fine Fragrance and Food Service, have been particularly sensitive to the downward pressure of the pandemic and have seen a double-digit decline over the first half of 2020. The challenges of 2020 also affirms to us that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for the world's most import manufacturers in food and beverage, as well as essential home, personal care and sanitation supplies. IFF's broad-based exposure across regions, categories and customer positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. Amid these challenges, we remain on track with our Frutarom integration efforts, with only modest delays due to COVID-19, achieving very good cost synergies. We continue to expect to have majority of the integration completed by the end of this year. Similarly, we continue to make significant progress with our efforts to complete our merger with N&B. We have now achieved regulatory clearance in the United States, China, Colombia and Serbia. We have filed our definitive proxy statement and look forward to the shareholder award on August 27. We continue to make significant strides in our integration planning, which is very exciting when you consider the long-term potential of the combined businesses. As we shared in our business update in June 8, 2020, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The pandemic continues to be significant and a volatile factor in our lives. It creates uncertainty around the world, with rapidly changing operating environment and economic impacts. We are fortunate that a majority of our end markets continue to operate with relative strengths, but, as we have discussed before, our business is not totally immune from disruption of the pandemic. Turning to slide 7 and an overview of our financial performance in the first half of 2020, the first two quarters, we achieved $2.5 billion in sales, with currency neutral sales growth of 1%, which is largely attributed to the strong growth we saw in the Consumer Fragrances, which grew double digits and Savory Solutions, which was up mid-single digits. We also generated an adjusted operating profit of $478 million and adjusted EPS of $2.99, both excluding amortization. While this performance is moderately down year-over-year, these metrics reflect pressure from lower sales volume and adverse mix, as well as higher costs as a result of COVID-19. Through the prioritization of CapEx and improving our core working capital, I am pleased to report that we are able to generate significant free cash flow. For the first half of 2020, cash flow improved double digits, with operating cash flow increased 12% and free cash flow growing a very strong 94%. I'm encouraged by the resilience of our business through incredible challenging environment of the second quarter, where we saw the global peak to-date of regulatory restrictions. Moving to slide 8, I would like to walk you through IFF's effort and approach to managing through the pandemic, while ensuring the safety of our employees and our continued uninterrupted partnership with our customers around the globe. As our teams have led a truly admirable performance to deliver through the challenging period, we have also begun to look ahead to our operations in this new normal. Like I've said before, ensuring the health and safety of our employees has and always will be our utmost concern and is number one priority at IFF. As many countries and cities have begun to reopen and are moving out of complete lockdown, we are keeping a close eye on the recommendations of local and global public health officials, especially as it relates to implementing our return to work protocols. With each region recovering along varying timelines, our approach is to evaluate each of our facilities and offices on a case-by-case basis. While all of our manufacturing sites are open and operating fully, most remain limited to essential employees only. As for our corporate offices, all of our non-essential employees continue to work from home as of right now. Logistics remain an operating challenge, with lead times still higher than they would be on a normal basis, but we have been able to adapt fairly quickly to new local policies with minimal incremental expense. On the procurement side, costs remained elevated, as there are still some challenges in obtaining various raw materials. We are proactively addressing the situation to secure these necessary materials going forward and evaluating opportunities to mend processes of our supply chain for the future. Finally, when it comes to our creative centers, I am proud to say that even amid a global pandemic, in typical IFF fashion, we are creating innovative solutions to support our customers, whether in person or remotely. As restrictions and closures ease, we have already seen significant improvement in our pipeline. With that, I will turn the call over to Rustom, who will discuss the Q2 results in greater detail. Thank you, Rustom. Now, as we consider what the remainder of 2020 will look like for IFF, we're doing our best to anticipate performance in a global environment that remains quite volatile and unpredictable. We are actively evaluating evolving global market dynamics and regulatory conditions to understand and anticipate how these factors will impact our business performance, our people, and our customers. We are proud to supply solutions and ingredients for essential products in the food, beverage, hygiene and disinfection product categories, especially as these drive 85% of our current portfolio. As Rustom has stated earlier, our July sales performance has improved, growing in low-single digits. Consumer Fragrance continues to grow double digits and we are seeing a double-digit trend in Cosmetic Actives. Fragrance Ingredients had also improved as restriction eased, growing mid-single digits in July. In Taste, growth in Flavors in North America led by Tastepoint is more than offsetting pressure in Latin America. And we are seeing robust double-digit growth in health-oriented products, as well as an improvement in natural colors. We do, however, anticipate that Fine Fragrances and Food Services will remain impacted by market pressures in the second half of the year, but expect improving trends versus what we experienced in Q2. A good example of this is that our gelato ingredients, a category severely impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter is now up low-single digits to-date in the third quarter. As we enter the second half of 2020, we will continue to effectively manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow by targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. With the positive signs of improvement in our performance that we are beginning to see in the third quarter, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will see further market improvements in the quarter and beyond. Turn to slide 17, I'm very pleased to share with you now an update on where we stand with the integration planning of our previously announced merger agreement with DuPont N&B. We made a lot of headway in the first half of 2020, reaching key milestones like clearance in the US, China, Colombia, Ukraine, and Serbia, regulatory processes and announcing our combined company's progress vision, operating model, and leadership team. We are well on our way to establishing the foundation and framework that will be essential to achieving the potential of this exciting combination. More recently, in July, we filed definitive proxy and set the date for our special shareholders' meeting in connection with the merger which will occur later this month on August 27. We expect to earn our shareholder support for this exciting combination in the coming weeks, and remain on track to completing our transaction and uniting our organization in the first quarter of 2021. In summary, I'm proud to say that IFF has stayed resilient through the first half of 2020 amid the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19. We have achieved solid financial performance, while delivering for our 30,000-plus customers globally and executing on the integration processes for Frutarom and N&B. As we have said before, IFF plays a central role in the global CPG supply chain as a vital partner to world renowned brands, regional leaders and new innovators alike. Our position across end markets, customers with our global reach has created a real resiliency in our business that shines through these difficult times. With Frutarom, we are realizing the significant potential that our enhanced capabilities and expanded customer base will have for the IFF's long-term growth. Similarly, we look forward to joining forces with DuPont N&B and have made significant advancements in our integration planning and paths to regulatory and shareholder approval. I am deeply grateful to our employees across the globe, whose commitment and dedication to IFF and our customers has been unwavering. We have started to see improvements in our performance in July and remain cautiously optimistic about how this may translate into financial performance in the second half of 2020. IFF and our balanced portfolio remain well equipped to adapt and succeed in this unpredictable global environment. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Good morning. Sure. Thank you, Mark, for the question. I'll take it. As you alluded, certainly, it's good to take the FX reported numbers and compare apple-to-apples. I think that's number one. Number two I would say, we should judge our performance beyond just one quarter and should look at multiple quarters. And if you see, for example, in the first quarter, we led our industry in growth. I think that's a topic. The second one is, if you look at Q2, the emerging markets were pretty much under pressure. And you see that we are a bit over-indexed in the emerging markets. For example, India, we're a market leader in India with our Taste business, for example. That was actually a pretty bad hit on that business, which is, by the way, rebounding. And then we are \u2013 certainly, we're winning some smaller customers, which plays a role here as well. Fundamentally, I believe both will help us with our long-term growth, the smaller customers and the emerging market as well, as soon as we see the COVID pressures are easing. And if you look at July, I expect, actually, that the third quarter already will be \u2013 will look much different than the second quarter. That's what we have seen in our numbers for July. I think Rustom has shown it in his slide. We see it, in particular, in some of these areas where we have a good and strong performance on Consumer Fragrances, for example. You see that categories like home care or personal wash are really up in very, very high single digits. We believe that's a trend to stay. So, hygiene products will stay even after the, let's say, acute COVID crisis, quite as strong. We see a good rebound already in Fine Fragrances, so not as bad as we have seen it before. And the same holds true actually for Food Service. I just looked it up. April was our worst number and Food Service was down by 44.1%; in July, it's down by minus 7.7%. Just to tell you that the weak spots I think are improving, and the strong pieces of the portfolio are staying strong and helping us to grow our business going forward, which will help us with our mix going forward in the third quarter as well. I hope that helps, Mark. Look, on inventory levels of the customers, it's tough to comment on, because we see huge differences from customer-to-customer, from region-to-region, and category-to-category. That's a big difference. I would say July is better for us because some of the categories which were hard hit in the second quarter, like Food Service, are improving better. That's certainly helping and that some of the emerging markets like India, for example, are performing much, much better. In July, we have actually a double-digit growth going forward and that helped us a lot. Why June had a little bit of a dip even compared to May? If I look at our daily sales, it's not so much. I think it's a comparable. I would not take this too \u2013 I think it depends also on the order pattern and what we see right now, as I said, July pretty strong for us and the order book for the third quarter is up mid-single to high-single digits as well. So, I believe that the trend will continue. So, it's a bit of phasing in there as well. But, Rustom, you please or Mike, you please comment. Okay. Good morning. Yeah. So, first of all, our assumption is still that we're closing first quarter next year. That's actually the plan also for the carve-out of the business. I think that's important. And right now, we are focusing a lot on, let's say, closing on our food integration. So, the remaining piece of it, which will happen in the early part of the fourth quarter, I think that's important. On the N&B side, as we said, we are progressing actually absolutely according to plan, in some of the areas even a couple of days ahead, which is quite interesting during the COVID environment. I think the teams are doing really a fantastic job. We see also \u2013 and just as a remark on the N&B business, you have seen when they reported, actually a bit of growth with 1%, a strong mix. 85% of the portfolio is pretty resilient against the COVID crisis as well. So very similar and a good mix in particular tilted towards the probiotics. But maybe, Rustom, if you can comment as well on the page 17? Yeah. And absolutely, and I would say on the cost savings, we're really on both parts, on the sales savings or synergy certainly as well. We have pretty robust plans in place. I just give you two numbers. We certainly have for the cost savings internally a higher number, which we are working towards. And secondly, we have started with, I think, 400 projects, which could help us with the sales synergies. We narrowed it down to around 100, to make sure that we really focus on the most important ones. And I would say these are really good and robust plans we have in place. And we still have a couple of months until day one. And \u2013 but it gives us a good feel because in some areas, as Rustom said, it's robust and we are probably even ahead of plan, which is great. Yeah. Sure. So, we see actually a good rebound in our China business, that's for sure. But we have to say that it's not just China, we saw, for example, in July already, actually, a very strong performance of our Consumer Fragrance business in India. Actually, it might just because we looked at the numbers, it was more than 40% for July, which was kind of amazing. But it is because we had a couple of good wins and it's going very well. And we have actually a quite significant and good performance in Latin America as well, believe it or not. So, it's not just China, it is also on the Consumer Fragrance side, some of the emerging markets. Not all of them, but some of the emerging markets are actually performing better than we have expected as well. But maybe, Rustom, you give even more details. What might be interesting, John, for you and for all the colleagues on the phone as well, what we try, because in this very volatile environment, we have doubled down on our consumer insights' studies, and we look certainly how the Consumer looks like during COVID and what can we expect after COVID. And we have never drawn down on three scenes which we're sharing with our customers as well; it's health, home, and hygiene. So, we believe that in some of the areas, like, for example, hygiene and we see it in our Scent products we are selling there, this is a trend which will stay even post-COVID. And as I said, our home care in July, category is up by 27% and personal wash by plus-16%, just to show you what the impact on the business is because these products are so much in demand. On the other hand, it's the home area. We believe that this cocooning at home will stay at least for a couple of months through the winter. So, culinary, everything which is culinary products for home cooking will stay up. We believe that malodor control is an important one. And on the health side, we see that all of our health ingredients, most of them we got through Frutarom, are very much in high demand, that the modulation of sweet is in high demand because governments are again starting to double down on sugar and products. So what I tried to say here is, that we have looked at the consumer insights quite carefully and we are basically now looking how we can orient our organization towards these trends where we believe they will stay for a while to make sure that we get more than a fair share of growth out of these categories. So that's what we're doing, just to give you a bit of a bigger picture and an outlook beyond the third quarter. Good morning. Sure. Absolutely. We take this. Rustom, you take it. We expect actually in the August-September timeframe the ruling. We were going back and forth with them to answer the questions before the summer break. And I think in the next couple of weeks, we should get the clearance in Europe. That's what our lawyers are telling us. So I think we should be on track. Whether we can make it before the shareholder vote, I'm not 100% sure, but early September will be my best guess right now. Good morning. Yeah. So, Rustom, can you take the numbers? In general, Taste and Fragrances, everything? Yeah. That would be good. Let's follow up on that one. Sure. Absolutely. If I touch on innovation, what we have seen actually when the COVID crisis was on its peak in Europe and in the US, so starting in March, April, even parts of parts of May, we've seen a slowdown in our innovation pipeline. Also, driven by the demand of some of the packaged food, for example, or some of the Consumer Fragrances. So, everybody was trying to get the existing product on the shelf as fast as they could. Since then actually, starting with May, we have seen actually a continuous influx of new projects, actually across the board, in all of our different categories we are playing in and there's more coming. We saw it first, obviously, in China, because that was the first country basically out of the gates in \u2013 after the COVID crisis for them and they are already almost back to normal. So, we see that many of the bigger CPGs and also the smallers are now really are back to normal. It's certainly depending customer-by-customer, but many are coming again with new projects to us. So, that's on the first one. On the second one, on the recovery, we see a recovery. We should look at country-by-country and category-by-category. Let me start with not maybe countries, but with regions. Here as well, in the recovery, Asia is now big, in particular India is surging, after India was very impacted in the second quarter. It's really coming back. We see a good comeback on Europe as well. The US is very, very good for us, maybe with the exception of the Fine Fragrance business. And we see an impact on newer projects in Latin America, where we see \u2013 and in particular in Brazil and Mexico are now at the peak of the crisis. In terms of the categories, we are happy to report back that not just everybody is looking for solutions on hygiene products, but we see also more demand and new projects on Food Service products, which is really good. I commented already on the Fine Fragrances. Fine Fragrance are coming back as well. On the customer base, we certainly see it with large customers; with smaller customers, it's probably more of a mixed situation where we are in, but some of them are coming back to us as well. So I hope that helps to picturize how we see the situation right now, in terms of innovation, but in terms of recovery as well. And as I said, look, I don't want to bank too much on just the July results, but we see that the order book is quite strong as well for the rest of the quarter and that should help us, actually, with a positive performance as far as we see it. Rustom? Look, for the meals at home, actually, we are pretty well positioned with our Savory Solutions business because we have an extra culinary area, which we're using for that area. We certainly would look and double down what we can develop here. So, I think that's an important aspect. So, I think it \u2013 I wouldn't say it would benefit us more, but it would be certainly very manageable for us as well. On QSR and retail restaurants, we have almost a similar mix. I think that's an important one. And what we see is that some of the quick service restaurants are really coming back now, which is good and it's helping us on the Food Service area as well. But, Rustom, you may comment if you have any more insights. Yes. Thank you very much for your time. And these are very exciting times. I hope we gave you good insights on how we see the business, even beyond the second quarter. And we are looking forward to the one-on-ones. Thank you very much. Take care and stay healthy."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFFs first quarter 2020 conference call. Yesterday evening, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay.Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the companys performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the second quarter and full year 2020. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on March 3, 2020, and in our press release.Today\u2019s presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday.With me on the call is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have.With that, I would now like to introduce Andreas.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. At IFF with global operations in 44 countries and sales into approximately 200 countries, we have seen firsthand how the coronavirus pandemic has touched our world. This is truly a remarkable moment in history. It presents all of us with new challenges, but also revealed the best of best humanity at the same time.On behalf of everyone at IFF, I want to express my sincere sympathy for all those affected by the pandemic. I also want to thank everyone in the global health care community who exemplifies the best of all of us in responding to this crisis with courage and grace. Everyone on the frontlines to continue to keep our society moving towards as our thanks to all the essential workers in the consumer good supply chain of which IFF is proud to play an important role we thank you for responding so quickly and moving swiftly to deliver for consumers around the world.It is very clear that we are still in the early stages of adjusting to the challenges that pandemic poses to our world. As we will review in more detail later, the IFF business is strongly positioned to be resilient through economic cycles given our substantial portfolio delivering needed solutions to vital consumers and markets. The steps we have taken in recent years including diversifying of our customer base and expansion into more categories have only served to further strengthened our ability to be a vital partner to our customers and affirm our ability to be resilient through the cycles.Like many, were seeing uneven impacts on our business due to the pandemic and the resulting economic challenges. While some end markets are seeing increases in demand, others are seeing notable declines. We are fortunate that only about 15% of our revenue not including Fragrance Ingredients that is subject to the downward pressure right now.However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the early stage of the economic impact creates enough uncertainty for us that we have made the decision to withdraw our full year financial guidance. Rustom will cover this in more detail later, but while we navigate through this challenge, we are committed to providing as much for what outlook as we can. So you understand the trends driving earnings.On today\u2019s call, I will provide an executive overview of our operational and financial performance for the first quarter 2020, before offering a more in depth review of IFFs management of the ongoing and evolving COVID-19 situation. Following this discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a more detailed financial review of the business, including additional insight into our liquidity and capital structure, which is very strong given the uncertainty of the pandemic going forward.As you may also have seen today, we announce important progress related to our pending combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences, including a new guiding purpose and vision for the future combined company as well as our operating model and executive management team post close. Following Rustom\u2019s remarks, I will provide an overview of these important integration updates. Upon the completion of all prepared commentary, well take any questions that you may have.Our strong performance for the first quarter of 2020 affirms the strengths of our organization and the essential position and serving vital end markets through economic cycles. We achieved a strong start of the year with mid-single digit sales and double digit adjusted EPS ex-motorization growth. Most of which are currency neutral basis.Importantly, we continue to achieve financial benefits related to integration of the Frutarom business, both revenue and cost synergies. As I mentioned before, we have also made significant progress with integration planning to support or combination where the DuPont N&B business and I must acknowledge our teams that have worked hard to build the foundation for this combination by continuing to contribute to IFFs day to day operations. All the teams have worked tirelessly to deliver for our customers and have gone above and beyond to support our communities around the world during this time.Our strong quarter as a testament to their unwavering dedication, the underlying strength of our business and our role as an essential partner in the global food and consumer product supply chains. While we have certainly faced many challenges through these unprecedented situation, our operations and global network remains strong and we have taken appropriate steps to ensure our business is well positioned to successfully manage through the pandemic.Looking at our financial performance in the first quarter, I am pleased to say we delivered strong improvements across key financial metrics. In the first quarter, I have achieved sales of US$1.3 billion, which represent a 6% growth on currency neutral basis, driven by our performance in both our Taste and Scent businesses. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share of $1.62 excluding amortization, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase on a currency-neutral basis, led by currency-neutral adjusted operating profit of 9% to US$271 million.In addition, we expanded our operating margin excluding amortization by 60 basis points to 20.1% driven by volume growth and productivity.In summary, IFF entered 2020 with solid momentum and continue to deliver currency neutral sales growth in the high single digits through the end of February. However, for March onwards we started to see the global impact of COVID-19 on our business and we expect this to impact our results in the second quarter as we have seen uneven impact across end markets.Rustom will touch on this in more detail later. I would like to spend a few moments outlining the key characteristics and drivers of our business, which leave IFF very well positioned to navigate today\u2019s new reality. More than ever, it is clear that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for world\u2019s most important manufacturers in food and beverage, as well as essential home personal care and sanitation supplies.IFFs broad-based exposure across regions, categories, and customer positions us to remain resilient, so the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. As a result of regulatory actions and corresponding economic challenges, were as seeing certain reduction and demand in our Fine Fragrance, Cosmetic Active and Food Service offerings where end markets are seeing significant impact.This represents approximately 15% of our revenue. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing tremendous pickup in areas with the solutions that IFF poised absolutely critical to the production of essential products.Our categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and hygiene and disinfection saw continued strong growth during the quarter. That is about 85% of our revenue.Fortunately, our operations remain strong as we continue to deliver the creative solutions that our customers and end consumers demand during these unprecedented times. Our goal from the outset of this crisis has been twofold. First, we are deeply determined to ensure the wellbeing of all people. Second, we are committed to preserve and continue to across the network so that we can continue meeting the needs of our customers.Our global, regional and local crisis teams are working around the clock to do what is the best for people and our business. At core working group, including representative from our executive team and across functional support groups and business teams, meets daily to ensure alignment from top to bottom across our teams. This team is putting in place plans and protocols to be sure we are anticipating what is to come and keep all of our stakeholders engaged to this extended period of disruption.We have been proactively reviewing our resiliency plan to address COVID-19 developments and we are coordinating our response was federal and local health and government entities around the world. We have updated internal protocols as the situation has evolved, taking significant measures to protect our people including implementing enhanced disinfection and sanitation measures at operational facilities and taking precautions to minimize contact among employees as part of social distancing by grouping our professionals into smaller pots and separating their work shifts. For those able to work from home, were instituting a remote working policy across many of our locations as well.Given IFFs vital role in the consumer product supply chain, we continue to secure essential designations that provide our company with permission to manufacture our products around the world as governments extend workplace restrictions. A good example of our team working through these unexpected challenges has been India.Recently, our Chennai facility, where we have been secured essential business designations was still forced to shut for several days due to regulatory restrictions. Thanks to the diligence of our team and a strong working relationship was regulated. We were able to move ahead of time and response to the shutdown to meet all customer demands to the shutdown while keeping employees safe.In terms of all operations, we are seeing some challenges with logistics and our lead times have increased, but the team is doing an excellent job navigating the transportation restrictions. We realize we are certainly not alone in this challenge. For these reasons, we have also seen some limitation on raw material distribution and have activated our contingency plans to limit the disruption that any material shortages might have for our customers.While we have seen disruptions to our supply chain, it has been mostly limited to the regions where the most significant government restrictions are in place, including Italy, Spain and India. On the new project and innovation front, most of our creative centers remain open and engaging remotely as needed and I\u2019m happy to say that all project pipeline remains solid across our entire portfolio.As I mentioned from the outset, while our business has displayed impressive resilience through the evolving situation, we continue to proactively take steps that will ensure that IFF is operating from a position of financial strengths. Specifically, we are adapting and especially disciplined approach to cost management. This means were tightening any nonessential spend and reviewing new opportunities for efficiencies that can preserve our margin profile.We also are looking at CapEx and considering near-term priorities while pushing out our longer-term investments as appropriate and were considering additional ways to optimize our net working capital by closely reviewing existing inventories and pursuing collections.Lastly, we have a strong cash position with US$1 billion of untapped credit revolver available, giving us confidence and ensuring our strong position even in the event of a prolonged economic downturn. Even in the midst of increased demand and the challenging operating environment, our teams have mobilized to support frontline healthcare workers and first responders across the global IFF network. IFFers across the globe have found very creative ways to leverage the companys unique capabilities and innovative spirit and lead a number of exciting community focused initiatives, including from New Jersey to the Netherlands, IFF has modified our production facilities to allow for the manufacturer and distribution of hand sanitizers.Today, IFF has donated more than 65 metric tons of hand sanitizers globally to first responders and other organizations in need. Our North America Scent creative team quickly developed a new scent, HOPE 2020, that has been used by IFF and other partners in the production of hand sanitizers.Our Scent team has also partnered with Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital to create early detection smell test for asymptomatic carriers, the first develop globally. In India, our facilities donated food and other necessary sanitation items to local orphanages, hospitals and police stations. These actions speak to how I\u2019m please continue to embody our commitment to care for the resource of our world and nothing could be more important than caring for our communities.I could not be more proud of the spirit of caring that IFF has demonstrated throughout the global pandemic.With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in greater detail.\nRustom Jilla: Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, I am taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance. On a currency neutral basis, IFF delivered broad based sales growth of 6% versus 2019 first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved in both Taste and Scent with procurement synergies, volume leverage and productivity initiatives and discipline research, sales and administration or RSA cost containment. And this helped produce our operating expenses as a percentage of sales.I am therefore pleased to say that we also saw solid profit growth in roughly 60 points of currency neutral margin expansion on an adjusted operating profit mix amount basis. COVID-19 did impact our P&L in Q1, but more in terms of sales mix rather than in total dollars and only in the final weeks of the quarter.It did have a modest negative impact on our adjusted operating profit in the quarter causing us to incur extra manufacturing costs, additional freight expenses and higher raw material costs. But most of these went into inventory and will not be in expenses. Our currency neutral earnings per share excluding amortization grew a strong 13% with robust operating profit growth boosted by lower year-over-year interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate.FX adversely impacted our reported numbers pulling sales and adjusted operating profits down a couple of percent. It had a much larger negative impact on other income/expenses in March as a result of currencies collapsing globally against the dollar and the Euro. So on a reported basis, this pulled down year-on-year adjusted EPS growth.Now looking at our Scent division, on Slide 13. In the first quarter, currency neutral Scent sales grew 7% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Sales performance was strongest in consumer fragrance with the double digit increase led by robust growth at led by robust growth in Fabric, Home & Hair Care. And while we did experience a volume lift on COVID-19, especially from the increase in hygiene and disinfection categories, we also benefited from strong new wins including with customers where we have recently gained access through their colleagues.We also saw high single digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients led by robust volume growth. At the same time, Fine Fragrances sales declined as disruption of consumer access to retail market. And it pronounced drop in global travel due to COVID-19 led to deceleration late in the quarter.Fine Fragrance has started 2020 well and was growing until the last couple of weeks of the quarter even against last Q1 double digit comp. And then we saw a significant contraction as our customers adapted their supply chains for new store closure and travel realities. This trend has continued in Q2 with a far greater impact and I will elaborate on this shortly. For the entire Scent segment, we posted a 20.4% segment profit margin and segment profit grew to $105 million, up 19% on a currency neutral basis driven by volume growth and lower operating expenses.Moving to Taste on Slide 14. We saw currency neutral sales growth of 5% in the first quarter, having achieved increases in all regions. We saw mid-to-high single digit growth in LATAM, Greater Asia & EAME. From a category perspective, we again saw significant mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions with very strong growth in EAME, our largest market and also LATAM.Flavors grew low single digits led by Greater Asia and Latin America and this was driven by strong commercial performance or new wins in particular in the attractive categories of beverage and dairy. Though Frutarom is now mostly incorporated in the Taste business, we did commit to continue providing updates as to how sales were doing as if this had remained on a stand-alone basis. So if we had measured Frutarom as a stand-alone currency neutral sales would have grown by roughly 4% versus the prior year.For the entire Taste business, we had a 16.5% margin with segment profit growing 6% to $137 million led by volume benefits and Frutarom integration-related synergies. You may have noticed that Taste segment profit margin appears lower than you are used to see. This is because Frutarom is now included and there is approximately $44 million of amortization of intangible assets.Now, I would like to provide an update on cash flow through the first quarter of 2020. The chart on Page 15 is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to cash flow inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was $17 million in the first quarter down from $47 million in 2019s first quarter primarily due to higher core working capital levels. Within core working capital, we had solid improvements in inventory that were offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of strong sales in Q1 2020 as well as the 2019 calendar effect.We expect the portion of this will normalize as we moved through the year. Nevertheless, our cash conversion cycle in Q1 2020 was consistent with 2019s first quarter. We continue to invest in the business, particularly for planned capacity increases and Frutarom integration.Our capital expenditures as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2020 was 3.6% and this was versus last years 4.5%. And I will touch on our outlook for the balance of the year in a moment. The net impact on our free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, were a negative $31 million.As a reminder, Q1 is a seasonably lowest quarter of the year and last year it was a negative $11 million. In terms of cash usage, M&A and earn-outs and dividends amounted to $94 million versus $112 million in the prior years first quarter and this was all due to lower M&A and earn-outs.As Andreas noted before, we are taking steps to preserve our strong financial position at this time, given the current environment and the possibility that the global economy could face a protective downturn. We are constantly refining our scenario planning to ensure we are well prepared. This starts with controlling what we can control, targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. We are being very cautious with hiring, mainly just critical replacement positions and a handful of critical new hires. And we are reducing any and all nonessential spend in the near term including the likes of travel, entertainment, consulting, et cetera. COVID-19 does bring some working capital headwind. We had experienced supply chain disruptions as various countries to block down action. We value our long-term customer relationships, so we additional raw materials to serve as safety stocks, giving us capability to move manufacturing around and, in general, to help insulate against supply chain disruption as we\u2019ve seen in India.We also paying some of our smaller and/or COVID-19 impacted suppliers more promptly if this is warranted and this could be expected. We are experiencing an increase in receivables, particularly from Food Service and Fine Fragrance customers. Of course we are working to offset these working capital pressures where we can. For inventory, we are constantly balancing the need to ensure business continuously during COVID-19 with the need to not over order. Where we could extend our payables, we are working with suppliers to do so.And we are pursuing collections from customers with overviews at being proactive with those where there is credit risk. For capital expenditures, we are targeting reductions across the business. Specifically, we are prioritizing the highest returning projects while delaying longer-term investment that are not absolutely necessary at this time. And of course practically COVID-19 is making it much harder to launch or complete projects where significant travel is required. But moving forward, we also have to be smart to ensure that we invest in a flexible and healthy ecosystem.Turning to Slide 17. As we consider our current capital structure and manage our balance sheet moving forward, we\u2019ve outlined our upcoming debt maturity schedule, which includes a good balance of short- and long term tiers. We have strong and ample liquidity well within our debt covenants as our net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of Q1 2020 was 3.3 times.Our cash position at the end of Q1 is strong at $433 million with $1 billion of an untapped credit revolver available should we need it. Looking ahead, following the close of the DuPont, N&B transaction. We are committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. As stated in December, we intend to quickly delever after the close of the transaction to get below three times net debt-to-EBITDA within the following 24 months.Now turning to our outlook. To conceptualize, I expected sales dynamic in Q2. I wanted to highlight the many moving parts we are seeing and expecting this quarter. COVID-19 presents both opportunities and challenges as we forge ahead. Starting on the left side of the slide, we expect to see continued robust growth in our Taste business, excluding Food Service as well as in our Consumer Fragrance business. The demand and consumption of the products that these businesses are supporting remain high and we are well positioned with our global footprint to capitalize on this.In the middle box, there\u2019s Fragrance Ingredients where demand is strong. However, we are facing challenges in the supply chain and in particular the Indian lockdown. This means that we have to forgo external sales to ensure that we protect our Fragrance Compounds business. The last category is where demand has been adversely impacted by COVID-19. Food Service where the vast stay-at-home orders across the globe as well as changes in consumer behaviors have impacted away from home consumption, Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives where the retail channels have been temporarily closed and travel retail is down both due to COVID-19, as well as these categories being discretionary in nature.Now more than ever IFFs broad based exposure across the regions categories and customers positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges. We are fortunate that the majority of our revenues comes from categories exposed to package food and beverage and from hygiene and disinfection. So parts of our business are experiencing higher sales volumes in this current environment.Having said this, were not totally immune. Not surprisingly, April\u2019s currency-neutral sales were challenged, with strong Consumer Fragrance and Flavors offset primarily by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. For the second quarter, while we are not giving specific guidance, it is worth noting that with the pressure in Fine Fragrances, operating margin mix will be a headwind as well as the additional COVID-19 related costs.We continue to evaluate what evolving global market dynamics will need for our business performance and projections moving forward. As the second quarter progresses and we gain greater visibility, as Andreas noted, well provide updates as appropriate. While our ability to pivot quickly and modify our daily operation to pivot quickly and modify a daily operation has enabled us to responsibly operate our business. The constantly evolving global responses to COVID-19 have created uncertainties for IFF and for other companies and our partners as well.Even the extent of the current uncertainty globally and the potential for uneven impact on our businesses, we have decided to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance. We will continue to manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and maintain ample liquidity.With that, let me turn the call back over to Andreas.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Rustom. I\u2019m also very pleased that today were introducing the next step in our planned integration process with N&B. As you know, we are extremely excited to combine our two customer focused and consumer led organizations with leading positions in higher value categories. Together, our product portfolio will be among the industry most robust and diverse. We have a coveted R&D program with an industry leading pipeline and most importantly we will be poised to redefine our industry by delivering essential solutions to our customers.Well remain on target to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021, until then IFF and N&B will remain independent entities and will operate separately. Since we announced our merger in December 2019, our teams have been hard at work bringing this combination to life. We have formed an integration management office, create the U.S. regulatory process, filed for regulatory clearance in Europe and China and filed our initial registration statement.The potential of this combination continues to excite our teams and we are working diligently to make sure we can hit the ground and full sprint on day one. Some of our important highlights over the past four months include completed strategic assessment of the future combined company portfolio, joint cross-function integration program in place and operational, created ideation framework to identify, assess and prioritize synergy opportunities.Today, we took another significant step forward. We have announced our purpose, vision and operating model and executive committee for the future combined company. In short, we are announcing who will be, what we intend to do and who will lead our incredible team once we combine forces with the N&B business in the first quarter of 2021. Our purpose is the why that drives everything we do. The combined companies purpose, applying science and companies for a better world. We\u2019re focused on our intend to push past traditional industry boundaries and commit to be a force for better, more sustainable future.We will shape the future of our industry with best-in-class solutions at the intersection of science and creativity where passionate organizations, made up team members who see their job as so much more. Our collective purpose inspires us every day to strive for better. It\u2019s not just that we are talented scientists and creators, but that we are passionate about using those talents to generate results for customers and for the world. We need both the rigor of scientific expertise and the imagination of new possibilities to create the best results.The fusion of both that will lead us to realizing the full potential of this combination. Everything we do is for the purpose of improving the world, lengthening life spans, replacing our sustaining resources, enhancing sensorial experiences, solving house problems and more. And together, we can do even more good.Creative science, scientific art, when science and creativity intersect, the possibilities are better. Here, innovation isn\u2019t a business department, it\u2019s our business. Incredible curiosity, relentless drive, purposeful impact, innovation is simply our way of operating and now with double the R&D resources unmatched in the industry. If you are keeping track, our people can\u2019t wait to get starting collaborating on something new. We are shaping the future of the industry for the better.Our vision is our strategy for future success. It articulates our aspirations and guides the development of future strategies and initiatives. It is a filter by which the endeavors can be evaluated. Our vision is to be the partner for essential solutions. From day one we will bring unmatched innovation and leading edge insight to anticipate what will be essential to tomorrows consumers. Helping all customers meet consumers need is at the heart of our business.We are more than a vendor or supplier. Yes, we supply the ingredients, components and solutions you require, but we also united in understanding and meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow. Essential solutions means that we will work to make both our relationship and what we provide invaluable to our customers business. It pushes us to supply the technology and knowhow that no one else can. There\u2019s customers of all sizes across the globe from startup to multinational, we have the agility and the expertise to deliver more of what you need. Unmatched innovation and leading edge insight means we are already anticipating what will be essential to tomorrows consumers. As we come together as one organization, we can help our customers meet consumers needs faster.On the operational model well leverage the capabilities and offerings of both organizations to create a sustainable framework that best position our teams, customers, shareholders for success on day one and well into the future. The complimentary structure will focus organization into four divisions, taste, food and beverage, scent, health and bioscience, and pharma solutions. We carefully examined how each division goes to market, including customer overlap R&D focus and service level requirements. Among other several factors to make sure we created global divisions that we have built for success.Just as important as our four operating divisions will be our global centralized functions, each of these will work in collaboration across our divisions. I want to call out in particular that we will be establishing a new integrated solutions center of excellence to focus on incubating new business opportunities and total product solutions. We\u2019re also creating a center for commercial excellence to support our business and commercial teams through development of best practices, customer insights and analysis, resource deployment, and the optimization of pricing strategies and solutions. These two are extremely important as it will be instrumental in collaborating with the business to achieve all revenue synergy goals.We also noticed the executive committee for the combined company, including highly qualified and diverse leaders with deep knowledge and expertise. If you are interested in the teams background, please check out on stronger, innovationtogether.com. I won\u2019t go through all of these distinguished leaders here, but I will note that this was a particular challenging process. Most organizations have tremendously talented individuals. We are fortunate that as a significant large organization we will be able to create many challenging, exciting new opportunities to further the careers of all employees.I\u2019m also very encouraged by the world-class Board of Directors, we are beginning to assemble. As shared at the deal announcement, DuPont Executive Chairman and CEO, Ed Breen will join the board of the combined company as the DuPont designee following the close of the transaction and will serve as Lead Independent Director starting in June 1, 2021. I am also pleased to say that Matthias Heinzel, President of Nutrition & Biosciences at Dupont will be joining the Board of Directors of IFF following the close of the transaction. Under his leadership, Matthias has strategically transformed the N&B business, driving customer-focused innovation, operational effectiveness, and multiple business integrations. As an Independent Director, his extensive global management experience and deep knowledge of the industry will support the future company as it unlocks the value of the merger.In addition, Carol A. Davidson will also be appointed to join the Board of Directors of the future combined company following the close of the transaction. Mr. Davidson, is a CPA with more than 30 years of leadership experience across multiple industries. He has held a variety of leadership roles at Tyco International Ltd. and Dell Incorporated and financial leadership roles at Eastman Kodak Company. Mr. Davidson is the elite Independent Director like Mason and serves on the Board of TE Connectivity. For this team, both Board and management, I know our combined company will chart a new path forward for our industry and have a powerful impact on the world around us.Stepping back, I will say that I\u2019m deeply impressed even more so during COVID-19 by the dedication of focus both the IFF and N&B teams have brought to this effort. We knew early on that these companies would be a strong cultural match and our excitement and conviction behind the potential of this combination was only grown as our teams began more and more to collaborate. As we look ahead, we are focused on executing the next key milestones and well do so within the same spend and diligence we have achieved thus far.In summary, we are pleased with our strong financial performance despite an unprecedented first quarter 2020. We delivered on all of our key metrics and saw broad-based growth in both divisions with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to make important progress in the integration of Frutarom business and have taken substantial steps forward and bringing on our combination with DuPont and N&B to life.I\u2019m also credibly proud of each and every one of my colleagues at IFF for what they have achieved during these challenging times, not just for our business but for our partners, our customers and all communities.While global conditions remain volatiles in the near term, our order book for Q2 looks solid as we are successfully navigating through these unprecedented times to emerge as a stronger company.I would now like to open the call for questions\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Well take a question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is open.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning everybody.\nAndreas Fibig: Hey. Good morning Mark.\nMark Astrachan: Speaking of promotions, by the way congrats.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you.\nMark Astrachan: Senior Vice President, well-deserved there. So I guess I wanted to talk a bit about just general sales ordering patterns. You basically talk a bit about whatever you can on emerging versus developing markets, anything notable there as well as between multinational, and local and regional customers, especially related to the Frutarom business.And what are you hearing from customers regarding timing new product launches? And how does any change impact that or even just category dynamics? Thanks.\nAndreas Fibig: Okay, Mark, I will take it. The emerging markets in the first quarter where particular strong, Latin America by around about 10% and greater Asia by five plus nine. What we see in terms of the different categories in particular the Consumer Fragrance in Latin America in high teens, as well as Flavors high single and Savory Solutions in high teens as well, so really, really good results, probably strongest from the multinationals specifically in the HPC field. In Asia was all about Consumer Fragrance as well. So mid teens, really good, Taste in high single digits, most required to COIVD-19, I would say.And here, in Asia, very much across both multinationals, as well as regional and locals. Frutarom, as we said, is probably around about 4% growth with some benefits of small M&A, but still very, very good performance.I would say country-wise it depends where the COVID-19 wave has started. We have seen the first impact in Asia, particularly in China, then it moved to Europe, then to the U.S. and Latin America. So that\u2019s probably what you can see in the first quarter.In terms of the pipeline, our pipeline remains strong also into the second quarter. But having said all of that, it is really different from customer to customer. I can say, also for us, our creative labs are basically almost all open. They are working on new launches. They are working on, lets say, better, lets say, improvements of some of the products. So all in all, I would say a very strong picture, certainly impact on Fine Fragrance because \u2013 and you heard this from our customer base as well, which is not positive, but all the essential products are really going actually very, very strong. Rustom you might comment on that.\nRustom Jilla: Yes. No, I actually agree. There\u2019s not much to add there Andreas, you covered it.\nAndreas Fibig: Good.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And once again, that is star one. If you would like to ask a question. Well move next to Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMike Sison: Hey guys that you guys all sound happy and a nice start to the year. Andreas, you\u2019ve made some progress on the transaction, getting your operating model leadership team in place. How much can you do before you close the deal to get the integration synergies accelerated? And then \u2013 and maybe just talk about how you think about the business, the transaction different now given the current environment.\nAndreas Fibig: Let me start probably with the second part of your question first. So combination with the DuPont N&B business is fully on, on track. And if you look at the product portfolio, its now among the industry in particular are in this COVID-19 situation, one of the most robust ones and very diverse. We are in all of the categories, number one and number two in the market. We have a great R&D pipeline with combined spend upon around about $550 million, more than 9,000 patents granted. So I believe very, very robust. And as you have seen the N&B results in the first quarter as well, it shows its an essential business. Probiotics are going gangbusters and many of the other portfolio areas, as well.Coming back to the integration piece, so as you know, we have formed an IMO as an Integration Management Office, we cleared antitrust in the U.S. we filed in Europe and in China. The combined integration planning team can do a lot, which is even in these challenging times and I\u2019m very, very pleased how they work together all over Zoom or Skype. Of course, its very, very interesting. So we really make sure that we are ready for the day one. The next up on the schedule is the shareholder vote in September, then the financing and then the close, hopefully in the first quarter of 2021.So I have to say that this COVID-19 has further solidified our position. Strategic logic is very strong, very resilient business, very great market position. And I believe we\u2019re in a very, very good spot right now.\nOperator: Well move next to John Roberts of UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. For the 15% of sales that are impacted by COVID-19, have you had two sequential weeks of stable sales yet or were they still declining at the end of April? And where are those product lines sales in China versus the start of the year?\nRustom Jilla: Good morning. John its Rustom, let me take that. No, we have still had sales decline even as we go through and look at that area. Its Fine Fragrance and Food Services that we really see. But let me just step back for a second. From March onwards know as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally, we had locked downs, changes in customer order patterns. We are fortunate that most of our revenue comes from the package food and beverage categories, as well as hygiene and disinfection, right. So we have continued strength there.I mean the part that you\u2019re referring to is that the part that we\u2019re not immune is the category is most exposed to retail end markets where stores closed and travel dropped sharply and that hasn\u2019t changed as of now. So that\u2019s Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives as well, right and also the away-from-home channels. So we\u2019re seeing that impact, and we are choosing to be \u2013 try to stay resilient, flexible, close to our customers as we possibly can be and always sort of trying to be cognizant of the safety of our employees and wellbeing as we go forward.China, regarding the China part of your question, Fine Fragrance is a very small part of the portfolio. I mean based on category demand, I mean less than 2% of total Fine. And although it was quite strong in Q1, I mean, lets see, China is opening up as well. Now Food Service in China was particularly challenged in Q1 and that\u2019s obviously COVID. And I think that answers your questions John.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you. So I also just wanted to hone in on, trends that you\u2019ve seen since the quarter in April and May. And in particular, I was wondering if its possible for you to maybe disaggregate the benefit from potential stockpiling versus underlying demand. And then particularly focus on Consumer Fragrance where you had double digit growth. And I know you mentioned that emerging markets were particularly strong where I don\u2019t think that was much stockpiling. But I was just wondering if you could offer more perspective there and how you\u2019re thinking, what terms you have seen since the end of the quarter and how you\u2019re thinking about the sustainability of growth there as we go through the year? Thanks.\nAndreas Fibig: Sure, absolutely Faiza. Let me get started and then I hand it over to Rustom. It is hard to disaggregate the underlying demand versus stockpiling. But when we talk with many of our customers and we believe on the Consumer Fragrance side, certainly, the activity in washing clothes and detergent, the softness \u2013 its very much demand, its not so much stockpiling here. I think we see this. We see also all the hygiene products are really used. Its not just that people put it in the pantry. That\u2019s what we see.And also on the food side when you talk to some of our customers, the yogurts are going like there\u2019s no tomorrow, which is probably not a big surprise to all of us because working-from-home, instead of going to the company cafeteria, you go to the fridge and pull yogurt and that\u2019s your lunch. So we see some categories very much its consumption, its moving, but I cant give you all the details.What is for us right now really important is on the consumer insight side. We do all of our studies, we know how the consumer behaves right now, but what is sustainable so that we really can orient ourselves in terms of our R&D and the new product development towards things which might, will come. We believe that everything in terms of sanitizing will stay. We believe also that many of the health products, in particular, fortified with vitamins or probiotics will stay. But there\u2019s more and more to come. So that\u2019s the work we are doing right now. So in many areas the consumption is real. By the way, one last one, potato chips are also going like gangbusters. But Rustom, please comment.\nRustom Jilla: Thanks Andrea. Thank you, good morning Faiza. So yes, look at the raw materials part of your questions. And yes, we\u2019ve had some limitations in raw material sourcing and logistics. And we activated our contingency plans very early to limit the disruption to our customers, right. And the disruptions were from material shortages because of government restriction of various sorts. As Andreas said earlier, Italy, Spain, India were three of them out there.I mean the part of your question \u2013 then you also talked about sustainability, right? Sustainability of Consumer Fragrance, we do believe this will continue to be robust, where consumer demand remains high in hygiene and disinfection. And if anyone has been to the store lately, it\u2019s just hard to get those products right. But let me address one aspect, too. I mean that\u2019s same profitability because of specifics and we got to fine right. Same profitability without [indiscernible] will be adversely impacted in Q2.I cant get into spend or can I get into specifics, but based on our largest \u2013 what our largest fine fragrance customers are saying publicly, the category is declining double digits. So Id expect the same for IFF and our competitors. And being that it is one of our highest margin categories, well above consolidated average and with these declines, margins will be down. Then you add in additional COVID cost that we\u2019ve had in Q2, a full quarters worth, and that\u2019s just another factor.\nAndreas Fibig: So it all depends right now when the economy is opening up and the stores are open. And some of these products can be sold again to our all consumers. I think that\u2019s what we all are waiting. And the big experiment is not so much China because its very small for this category as Rustom said. But what will happen now in Europe, you see Germany is basically open. And we will see next week France is opening again and then Spain and Italy and then we take it from there. So its a very volatile environment, but we are very well prepared for it. I hope it helps Faiza?\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Well move next to PJ Juvekar of Citi. Your line is open.\nPJ Juvekar: Yes, hi. Good morning.\nRustom Jilla: Good morning PJ.\nPJ Juvekar: Andreas quick question for you. We talked about this restocking quite a bit here in the pantries, and so on and so forth. When do you think orders go back to normal level? And then as the economies open up, is there some destocking in the pantries? And related to that, that\u2019s the inventory at the sort of the core household level, but what are the inventory levels that you are applying and in the supply chain? Thank you.\nAndreas Fibig: Okay, yes. Its a very, very important point actually. And we are looking at this. I would say in some of the countries we have seen already, normalization because people are back to work and people see that they can buy everything. You might remember at the beginning, toilet paper was a very precious article around the world in many of the supermarkets, but that\u2019s back to normal.So actually we have seen already quite normalization, not because COVID is gone, but people see and feel that they can buy whatever they need. There was not a big disruption in the supply chain. So we believe that the inventory has changed. Its different than pharmaceuticals, for example, where people just keeping the diabetes products better for three or four months instead of one month to make sure that they are covered. But here I think in many cases we are already back to normal.On the plants, its a bit of a different situation because we are managing the supply chain actually almost by the week because India, which is a big country for raw materials in our industry, has some challenges with lockdown as well. So you really had to make sure that we get enough inventory in all the plants around the world to secure supply for our customers. So here you probably will see some elevated inventory levels for quite some time. But again situation is volatile. I expected this actually for the first quarter as well. But we were selling so much, the inventory actually went down. So that\u2019s our plan or basically what we assume for now, but it might change because its very dependent on the demand as well.But Rustom may be you comment.\nRustom Jilla: I mean again, I mean you covered it. I mean PJ, I mean, this is really hard to predict, right, because we\u2019re going into government regulations, consumer psychology and also the possible fear of any wave twos or anything like that. I mean you never know. Its hard to predict. But even after COVID19, I mean, consumers, actual consumers, might maintain higher stockpiles as a common practice. Who knows.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi, guys. Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nAndreas Fibig: Hi, Adam.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi. I was hoping to get a little bit more on the performance in the first quarter in the Taste segment, specifically around the margins, I\u2019m just trying to think about margins that were essentially flat year-on-year and kind of just thinking about the against pretty healthy top line growth. So how do you construct that in terms of mix, in terms of incremental Frutarom synergies, in terms of COVID related costs? And then just thinking about the balance of the year kind of has the expectation on Frutarom synergies changed? Specifically, kind of, can you do all the facilities closures you were looking for this year given the pandemic?\nAndreas Fibig: Hi Adam its Rustom. Let me say that. You actually were triangulating in on exactly what the factors were. So in the \u2013 first of all, we are on track with our cost synergies target through Q1 Frutarom I mean. With more than 25% of our $50 million full year savings coming in Q1. And in terms of geography, its about three quarters Taste and the rest in Scent roughly, okay? The Scent synergies showed through. And as you saw Scents performance, there\u2019s leverage. But Taste, where you\u2019re homing in, did benefit some synergies as well. But it also had mix. I mean we went straight there. We also had mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions which is a lower margin business. We had the lot citrus [ph] sales and then we have some added costs, right, manufacturing and procurement, and unit costs head up in the balance sheet and everything. But we also had some bad debt as we increased our bad debt provisions, not actually bad debts, but actual provisions as we did. So there were all offsets in here.\nRustom Jilla: Now as for your, second part of your question, about the ongoing plans that we have, I mean, yes, there will be some delays. There is a little bit of disruption to achieving, in particular, the manufacturing synergies that we expected from Frutarom around, right. And that\u2019s quite simply because we cant \u2013 that people are not traveling out to various sites, even we are working from home quite effectively. But as Andreas has mentioned too, we do prioritize the safety of our people. And people are just not traveling out to sites. So there will be some delays in realizing the synergies from Frutarom coming through.And the same thing on procurement, on the procurement end by the way, because with the huge disruption that we\u2019ve seen out there in raw materials and sourcing and all the rest of that, that hasn\u2019t shown up in our P&L, but that\u2019s because our teams have been sort of pulling in really hard yards, making sure that we handled all this without disrupting our customers, right. But something gives and that something has one of those things that have given is pushing through some of those other synergies. Andreas, is there anything you want to add there as well?\nAndreas Fibig: Actually just one thing on the closure of the factories, we might have in some cases a delay of maybe two to three months. That\u2019s what we are planning, right now. So we will be done with what we saw in the mid end of third quarter, mid and end of fourth quarter. So that\u2019s the planning right now. I hope Adam that helps.\nAdam Samuelson: It does. Thank you.\nOperator: Well take a question from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. It\u2019d be good to actually just clarify that. So I think in the queue on the food integration, there were risk associated was not being done this year and said it could even extend into not just fiscal 2021, but into 2022. So into 2020 kind of clarify that versus what you had just said about only a three months delay on synergy. And then just more broadly on Frutarom, I was just curious to know kind of what drove the upside in the quarter. Is it sustainable? From what we can see, it looks like Savory was a big part of that. And just is that also \u2013 we talked about some mix dynamic, the areas in Frutarom that are coming through maybe a bit better than expected. Is that also another drive on mix? Thank you.\nRustom Jilla: Okay. Let me start with a second piece first. We have seen a couple of elements of the legacy food business which performed very well and we believe its sustainable. So everything which is connected to health, we believe will be sustainable because its an incredible drive for these healthy ingredients. That\u2019s number one. The second one is on food protection, because people really want to increase shelf life and make sure that this works out well so that\u2019s going extremely well double digit. But we believe it will be also sustainable.And then on Savory, we will see the Savory Solutions has made actually extremely progress in terms of bringing it together with the legacy flavors. And we have seen good developments. This is certainly not sustainable in a double digit growth rate, it is more dependent on how quickly the economies open up and how much is in the Food Service area because that\u2019s certainly has more negative impact here as well.On the other hand this is part of this famous butchers business. People in Austria and Germany were eating meat like there\u2019s no tomorrow because all the restaurants were closed. And that helped us with sales as well. So sometimes \u2013 these are interesting dynamics. But I hope it helps us as an explanation.And then on the food integration, risk associated was not being done with the integration work before merging with DuPont. It is basically \u2013 some wanted to, on our manufacturing plants, we just hold back because we believe with N&B now we have a different way forward where we can use these capacities and can use them for some of the N&B products. So we do now everything, which we have said we are doing. Despite the things where we believe with the N&B combination, we have a better way forward when we have N&B in Board as well. So that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the only thing. And that\u2019s on Tilburg in Holland, but that\u2019s it. We can talk more in detail. I hope it helps.\nOperator: We are now past the top of the hour. And well now conclude the call. I now want to hand it back to Andreas for closing remarks.\nAndreas Fibig: Yes thank you very much for the time. I hope everybody is healthy, and stays healthy. And we certainly have time to speak over the next one or two days. Thank you very much. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a good day.",

            "name": "Rustom Jilla",
            "content": "Thank you, Andreas. Now to Slide 12, I am taking a more detailed look at our quarterly financial performance. On a currency neutral basis, IFF delivered broad based sales growth of 6% versus 2019 first quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin improved in both Taste and Scent with procurement synergies, volume leverage and productivity initiatives and discipline research, sales and administration or RSA cost containment. And this helped produce our operating expenses as a percentage of sales.I am therefore pleased to say that we also saw solid profit growth in roughly 60 points of currency neutral margin expansion on an adjusted operating profit mix amount basis. COVID-19 did impact our P&L in Q1, but more in terms of sales mix rather than in total dollars and only in the final weeks of the quarter.It did have a modest negative impact on our adjusted operating profit in the quarter causing us to incur extra manufacturing costs, additional freight expenses and higher raw material costs. But most of these went into inventory and will not be in expenses. Our currency neutral earnings per share excluding amortization grew a strong 13% with robust operating profit growth boosted by lower year-over-year interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate.FX adversely impacted our reported numbers pulling sales and adjusted operating profits down a couple of percent. It had a much larger negative impact on other income/expenses in March as a result of currencies collapsing globally against the dollar and the Euro. So on a reported basis, this pulled down year-on-year adjusted EPS growth.Now looking at our Scent division, on Slide 13. In the first quarter, currency neutral Scent sales grew 7% with growth in all regions and nearly all categories. Sales performance was strongest in consumer fragrance with the double digit increase led by robust growth at led by robust growth in Fabric, Home & Hair Care. And while we did experience a volume lift on COVID-19, especially from the increase in hygiene and disinfection categories, we also benefited from strong new wins including with customers where we have recently gained access through their colleagues.We also saw high single digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients led by robust volume growth. At the same time, Fine Fragrances sales declined as disruption of consumer access to retail market. And it pronounced drop in global travel due to COVID-19 led to deceleration late in the quarter.Fine Fragrance has started 2020 well and was growing until the last couple of weeks of the quarter even against last Q1 double digit comp. And then we saw a significant contraction as our customers adapted their supply chains for new store closure and travel realities. This trend has continued in Q2 with a far greater impact and I will elaborate on this shortly. For the entire Scent segment, we posted a 20.4% segment profit margin and segment profit grew to $105 million, up 19% on a currency neutral basis driven by volume growth and lower operating expenses.Moving to Taste on Slide 14. We saw currency neutral sales growth of 5% in the first quarter, having achieved increases in all regions. We saw mid-to-high single digit growth in LATAM, Greater Asia & EAME. From a category perspective, we again saw significant mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions with very strong growth in EAME, our largest market and also LATAM.Flavors grew low single digits led by Greater Asia and Latin America and this was driven by strong commercial performance or new wins in particular in the attractive categories of beverage and dairy. Though Frutarom is now mostly incorporated in the Taste business, we did commit to continue providing updates as to how sales were doing as if this had remained on a stand-alone basis. So if we had measured Frutarom as a stand-alone currency neutral sales would have grown by roughly 4% versus the prior year.For the entire Taste business, we had a 16.5% margin with segment profit growing 6% to $137 million led by volume benefits and Frutarom integration-related synergies. You may have noticed that Taste segment profit margin appears lower than you are used to see. This is because Frutarom is now included and there is approximately $44 million of amortization of intangible assets.Now, I would like to provide an update on cash flow through the first quarter of 2020. The chart on Page 15 is designed to show the reconciliation from reported net income to cash flow inclusive of all the drivers. Operating cash flow was $17 million in the first quarter down from $47 million in 2019s first quarter primarily due to higher core working capital levels. Within core working capital, we had solid improvements in inventory that were offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of strong sales in Q1 2020 as well as the 2019 calendar effect.We expect the portion of this will normalize as we moved through the year. Nevertheless, our cash conversion cycle in Q1 2020 was consistent with 2019s first quarter. We continue to invest in the business, particularly for planned capacity increases and Frutarom integration.Our capital expenditures as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2020 was 3.6% and this was versus last years 4.5%. And I will touch on our outlook for the balance of the year in a moment. The net impact on our free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx, were a negative $31 million.As a reminder, Q1 is a seasonably lowest quarter of the year and last year it was a negative $11 million. In terms of cash usage, M&A and earn-outs and dividends amounted to $94 million versus $112 million in the prior years first quarter and this was all due to lower M&A and earn-outs.As Andreas noted before, we are taking steps to preserve our strong financial position at this time, given the current environment and the possibility that the global economy could face a protective downturn. We are constantly refining our scenario planning to ensure we are well prepared. This starts with controlling what we can control, targeting reductions in operational and capital expenses. We are being very cautious with hiring, mainly just critical replacement positions and a handful of critical new hires. And we are reducing any and all nonessential spend in the near term including the likes of travel, entertainment, consulting, et cetera. COVID-19 does bring some working capital headwind. We had experienced supply chain disruptions as various countries to block down action. We value our long-term customer relationships, so we additional raw materials to serve as safety stocks, giving us capability to move manufacturing around and, in general, to help insulate against supply chain disruption as we've seen in India.We also paying some of our smaller and/or COVID-19 impacted suppliers more promptly if this is warranted and this could be expected. We are experiencing an increase in receivables, particularly from Food Service and Fine Fragrance customers. Of course we are working to offset these working capital pressures where we can. For inventory, we are constantly balancing the need to ensure business continuously during COVID-19 with the need to not over order. Where we could extend our payables, we are working with suppliers to do so.And we are pursuing collections from customers with overviews at being proactive with those where there is credit risk. For capital expenditures, we are targeting reductions across the business. Specifically, we are prioritizing the highest returning projects while delaying longer-term investment that are not absolutely necessary at this time. And of course practically COVID-19 is making it much harder to launch or complete projects where significant travel is required. But moving forward, we also have to be smart to ensure that we invest in a flexible and healthy ecosystem.Turning to Slide 17. As we consider our current capital structure and manage our balance sheet moving forward, we've outlined our upcoming debt maturity schedule, which includes a good balance of short- and long term tiers. We have strong and ample liquidity well within our debt covenants as our net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of Q1 2020 was 3.3 times.Our cash position at the end of Q1 is strong at $433 million with $1 billion of an untapped credit revolver available should we need it. Looking ahead, following the close of the DuPont, N&B transaction. We are committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. As stated in December, we intend to quickly delever after the close of the transaction to get below three times net debt-to-EBITDA within the following 24 months.Now turning to our outlook. To conceptualize, I expected sales dynamic in Q2. I wanted to highlight the many moving parts we are seeing and expecting this quarter. COVID-19 presents both opportunities and challenges as we forge ahead. Starting on the left side of the slide, we expect to see continued robust growth in our Taste business, excluding Food Service as well as in our Consumer Fragrance business. The demand and consumption of the products that these businesses are supporting remain high and we are well positioned with our global footprint to capitalize on this.In the middle box, there's Fragrance Ingredients where demand is strong. However, we are facing challenges in the supply chain and in particular the Indian lockdown. This means that we have to forgo external sales to ensure that we protect our Fragrance Compounds business. The last category is where demand has been adversely impacted by COVID-19. Food Service where the vast stay-at-home orders across the globe as well as changes in consumer behaviors have impacted away from home consumption, Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives where the retail channels have been temporarily closed and travel retail is down both due to COVID-19, as well as these categories being discretionary in nature.Now more than ever IFFs broad based exposure across the regions categories and customers positions us to remain resilient through the ongoing challenges. We are fortunate that the majority of our revenues comes from categories exposed to package food and beverage and from hygiene and disinfection. So parts of our business are experiencing higher sales volumes in this current environment.Having said this, were not totally immune. Not surprisingly, April's currency-neutral sales were challenged, with strong Consumer Fragrance and Flavors offset primarily by weakness in Fine Fragrance and Food Service. For the second quarter, while we are not giving specific guidance, it is worth noting that with the pressure in Fine Fragrances, operating margin mix will be a headwind as well as the additional COVID-19 related costs.We continue to evaluate what evolving global market dynamics will need for our business performance and projections moving forward. As the second quarter progresses and we gain greater visibility, as Andreas noted, well provide updates as appropriate. While our ability to pivot quickly and modify our daily operation to pivot quickly and modify a daily operation has enabled us to responsibly operate our business. The constantly evolving global responses to COVID-19 have created uncertainties for IFF and for other companies and our partners as well.Even the extent of the current uncertainty globally and the potential for uneven impact on our businesses, we have decided to withdraw our fiscal 2020 guidance. We will continue to manage our business by taking actions to generate strong cash flow and maintain ample liquidity.With that, let me turn the call back over to Andreas. Yes. No, I actually agree. There's not much to add there Andreas, you covered it. Good morning. John its Rustom, let me take that. No, we have still had sales decline even as we go through and look at that area. Its Fine Fragrance and Food Services that we really see. But let me just step back for a second. From March onwards know as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally, we had locked downs, changes in customer order patterns. We are fortunate that most of our revenue comes from the package food and beverage categories, as well as hygiene and disinfection, right. So we have continued strength there.I mean the part that you're referring to is that the part that we're not immune is the category is most exposed to retail end markets where stores closed and travel dropped sharply and that hasn't changed as of now. So that's Fine Fragrance and Cosmetic Actives as well, right and also the away-from-home channels. So we're seeing that impact, and we are choosing to be \u2013 try to stay resilient, flexible, close to our customers as we possibly can be and always sort of trying to be cognizant of the safety of our employees and wellbeing as we go forward.China, regarding the China part of your question, Fine Fragrance is a very small part of the portfolio. I mean based on category demand, I mean less than 2% of total Fine. And although it was quite strong in Q1, I mean, lets see, China is opening up as well. Now Food Service in China was particularly challenged in Q1 and that's obviously COVID. And I think that answers your questions John. Thanks Andrea. Thank you, good morning Faiza. So yes, look at the raw materials part of your questions. And yes, we've had some limitations in raw material sourcing and logistics. And we activated our contingency plans very early to limit the disruption to our customers, right. And the disruptions were from material shortages because of government restriction of various sorts. As Andreas said earlier, Italy, Spain, India were three of them out there.I mean the part of your question \u2013 then you also talked about sustainability, right? Sustainability of Consumer Fragrance, we do believe this will continue to be robust, where consumer demand remains high in hygiene and disinfection. And if anyone has been to the store lately, it's just hard to get those products right. But let me address one aspect, too. I mean that's same profitability because of specifics and we got to fine right. Same profitability without [indiscernible] will be adversely impacted in Q2.I cant get into spend or can I get into specifics, but based on our largest \u2013 what our largest fine fragrance customers are saying publicly, the category is declining double digits. So Id expect the same for IFF and our competitors. And being that it is one of our highest margin categories, well above consolidated average and with these declines, margins will be down. Then you add in additional COVID cost that we've had in Q2, a full quarters worth, and that's just another factor. Good morning PJ. I mean again, I mean you covered it. I mean PJ, I mean, this is really hard to predict, right, because we're going into government regulations, consumer psychology and also the possible fear of any wave twos or anything like that. I mean you never know. Its hard to predict. But even after COVID19, I mean, consumers, actual consumers, might maintain higher stockpiles as a common practice. Who knows. Now as for your, second part of your question, about the ongoing plans that we have, I mean, yes, there will be some delays. There is a little bit of disruption to achieving, in particular, the manufacturing synergies that we expected from Frutarom around, right. And that's quite simply because we cant \u2013 that people are not traveling out to various sites, even we are working from home quite effectively. But as Andreas has mentioned too, we do prioritize the safety of our people. And people are just not traveling out to sites. So there will be some delays in realizing the synergies from Frutarom coming through.And the same thing on procurement, on the procurement end by the way, because with the huge disruption that we've seen out there in raw materials and sourcing and all the rest of that, that hasn't shown up in our P&L, but that's because our teams have been sort of pulling in really hard yards, making sure that we handled all this without disrupting our customers, right.

            "name": "Andreas Fibig",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. At IFF with global operations in 44 countries and sales into approximately 200 countries, we have seen firsthand how the coronavirus pandemic has touched our world. This is truly a remarkable moment in history. It presents all of us with new challenges, but also revealed the best of best humanity at the same time.On behalf of everyone at IFF, I want to express my sincere sympathy for all those affected by the pandemic. I also want to thank everyone in the global health care community who exemplifies the best of all of us in responding to this crisis with courage and grace. Everyone on the frontlines to continue to keep our society moving towards as our thanks to all the essential workers in the consumer good supply chain of which IFF is proud to play an important role we thank you for responding so quickly and moving swiftly to deliver for consumers around the world.It is very clear that we are still in the early stages of adjusting to the challenges that pandemic poses to our world. As we will review in more detail later, the IFF business is strongly positioned to be resilient through economic cycles given our substantial portfolio delivering needed solutions to vital consumers and markets. The steps we have taken in recent years including diversifying of our customer base and expansion into more categories have only served to further strengthened our ability to be a vital partner to our customers and affirm our ability to be resilient through the cycles.Like many, were seeing uneven impacts on our business due to the pandemic and the resulting economic challenges. While some end markets are seeing increases in demand, others are seeing notable declines. We are fortunate that only about 15% of our revenue not including Fragrance Ingredients that is subject to the downward pressure right now.However, the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the early stage of the economic impact creates enough uncertainty for us that we have made the decision to withdraw our full year financial guidance. Rustom will cover this in more detail later, but while we navigate through this challenge, we are committed to providing as much for what outlook as we can. So you understand the trends driving earnings.On today's call, I will provide an executive overview of our operational and financial performance for the first quarter 2020, before offering a more in depth review of IFFs management of the ongoing and evolving COVID-19 situation. Following this discussion, I will ask Rustom to provide a more detailed financial review of the business, including additional insight into our liquidity and capital structure, which is very strong given the uncertainty of the pandemic going forward.As you may also have seen today, we announce important progress related to our pending combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences, including a new guiding purpose and vision for the future combined company as well as our operating model and executive management team post close. Following Rustom's remarks, I will provide an overview of these important integration updates. Upon the completion of all prepared commentary, well take any questions that you may have.Our strong performance for the first quarter of 2020 affirms the strengths of our organization and the essential position and serving vital end markets through economic cycles. We achieved a strong start of the year with mid-single digit sales and double digit adjusted EPS ex-motorization growth. Most of which are currency neutral basis.Importantly, we continue to achieve financial benefits related to integration of the Frutarom business, both revenue and cost synergies. As I mentioned before, we have also made significant progress with integration planning to support or combination where the DuPont N&B business and I must acknowledge our teams that have worked hard to build the foundation for this combination by continuing to contribute to IFFs day to day operations. All the teams have worked tirelessly to deliver for our customers and have gone above and beyond to support our communities around the world during this time.Our strong quarter as a testament to their unwavering dedication, the underlying strength of our business and our role as an essential partner in the global food and consumer product supply chains. While we have certainly faced many challenges through these unprecedented situation, our operations and global network remains strong and we have taken appropriate steps to ensure our business is well positioned to successfully manage through the pandemic.Looking at our financial performance in the first quarter, I am pleased to say we delivered strong improvements across key financial metrics. In the first quarter, I have achieved sales of US$1.3 billion, which represent a 6% growth on currency neutral basis, driven by our performance in both our Taste and Scent businesses. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share of $1.62 excluding amortization, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase on a currency-neutral basis, led by currency-neutral adjusted operating profit of 9% to US$271 million.In addition, we expanded our operating margin excluding amortization by 60 basis points to 20.1% driven by volume growth and productivity.In summary, IFF entered 2020 with solid momentum and continue to deliver currency neutral sales growth in the high single digits through the end of February. However, for March onwards we started to see the global impact of COVID-19 on our business and we expect this to impact our results in the second quarter as we have seen uneven impact across end markets.Rustom will touch on this in more detail later. I would like to spend a few moments outlining the key characteristics and drivers of our business, which leave IFF very well positioned to navigate today's new reality. More than ever, it is clear that IFF plays a vital role in the global CPG supply chain, especially for world's most important manufacturers in food and beverage, as well as essential home personal care and sanitation supplies.IFFs broad-based exposure across regions, categories, and customer positions us to remain resilient, so the ongoing challenges brought about by the pandemic. As a result of regulatory actions and corresponding economic challenges, were as seeing certain reduction and demand in our Fine Fragrance, Cosmetic Active and Food Service offerings where end markets are seeing significant impact.This represents approximately 15% of our revenue. At the same time, we're seeing tremendous pickup in areas with the solutions that IFF poised absolutely critical to the production of essential products.Our categories exposed to packaged food and beverage and hygiene and disinfection saw continued strong growth during the quarter. That is about 85% of our revenue.Fortunately, our operations remain strong as we continue to deliver the creative solutions that our customers and end consumers demand during these unprecedented times. Our goal from the outset of this crisis has been twofold. First, we are deeply determined to ensure the wellbeing of all people. Second, we are committed to preserve and continue to across the network so that we can continue meeting the needs of our customers.Our global, regional and local crisis teams are working around the clock to do what is the best for people and our business. At core working group, including representative from our executive team and across functional support groups and business teams, meets daily to ensure alignment from top to bottom across our teams. This team is putting in place plans and protocols to be sure we are anticipating what is to come and keep all of our stakeholders engaged to this extended period of disruption.We have been proactively reviewing our resiliency plan to address COVID-19 developments and we are coordinating our response was federal and local health and government entities around the world. We have updated internal protocols as the situation has evolved, taking significant measures to protect our people including implementing enhanced disinfection and sanitation measures at operational facilities and taking precautions to minimize contact among employees as part of social distancing by grouping our professionals into smaller pots and separating their work shifts. For those able to work from home, were instituting a remote working policy across many of our locations as well.Given IFFs vital role in the consumer product supply chain, we continue to secure essential designations that provide our company with permission to manufacture our products around the world as governments extend workplace restrictions. A good example of our team working through these unexpected challenges has been India.Recently, our Chennai facility, where we have been secured essential business designations was still forced to shut for several days due to regulatory restrictions. Thanks to the diligence of our team and a strong working relationship was regulated. We were able to move ahead of time and response to the shutdown to meet all customer demands to the shutdown while keeping employees safe.In terms of all operations, we are seeing some challenges with logistics and our lead times have increased, but the team is doing an excellent job navigating the transportation restrictions. We realize we are certainly not alone in this challenge. For these reasons, we have also seen some limitation on raw material distribution and have activated our contingency plans to limit the disruption that any material shortages might have for our customers.While we have seen disruptions to our supply chain, it has been mostly limited to the regions where the most significant government restrictions are in place, including Italy, Spain and India. On the new project and innovation front, most of our creative centers remain open and engaging remotely as needed and I'm happy to say that all project pipeline remains solid across our entire portfolio.As I mentioned from the outset, while our business has displayed impressive resilience through the evolving situation, we continue to proactively take steps that will ensure that IFF is operating from a position of financial strengths. Specifically, we are adapting and especially disciplined approach to cost management. This means were tightening any nonessential spend and reviewing new opportunities for efficiencies that can preserve our margin profile.We also are looking at CapEx and considering near-term priorities while pushing out our longer-term investments as appropriate and were considering additional ways to optimize our net working capital by closely reviewing existing inventories and pursuing collections.Lastly, we have a strong cash position with US$1 billion of untapped credit revolver available, giving us confidence and ensuring our strong position even in the event of a prolonged economic downturn. Even in the midst of increased demand and the challenging operating environment, our teams have mobilized to support frontline healthcare workers and first responders across the global IFF network. IFFers across the globe have found very creative ways to leverage the companys unique capabilities and innovative spirit and lead a number of exciting community focused initiatives, including from New Jersey to the Netherlands, IFF has modified our production facilities to allow for the manufacturer and distribution of hand sanitizers.Today, IFF has donated more than 65 metric tons of hand sanitizers globally to first responders and other organizations in need. Our North America Scent creative team quickly developed a new scent, HOPE 2020, that has been used by IFF and other partners in the production of hand sanitizers.Our Scent team has also partnered with Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital to create early detection smell test for asymptomatic carriers, the first develop globally. In India, our facilities donated food and other necessary sanitation items to local orphanages, hospitals and police stations. These actions speak to how I'm please continue to embody our commitment to care for the resource of our world and nothing could be more important than caring for our communities.I could not be more proud of the spirit of caring that IFF has demonstrated throughout the global pandemic.With that, I would like to turn it over to Rustom who will discuss our first quarter financial performance in greater detail. Thank you, Rustom. I'm also very pleased that today were introducing the next step in our planned integration process with N&B. As you know, we are extremely excited to combine our two customer focused and consumer led organizations with leading positions in higher value categories. Together, our product portfolio will be among the industry most robust and diverse. We have a coveted R&D program with an industry leading pipeline and most importantly we will be poised to redefine our industry by delivering essential solutions to our customers.Well remain on target to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021, until then IFF and N&B will remain independent entities and will operate separately. Since we announced our merger in December 2019, our teams have been hard at work bringing this combination to life. We have formed an integration management office, create the U.S. regulatory process, filed for regulatory clearance in Europe and China and filed our initial registration statement.The potential of this combination continues to excite our teams and we are working diligently to make sure we can hit the ground and full sprint on day one. Some of our important highlights over the past four months include completed strategic assessment of the future combined company portfolio, joint cross-function integration program in place and operational, created ideation framework to identify, assess and prioritize synergy opportunities.Today, we took another significant step forward. We have announced our purpose, vision and operating model and executive committee for the future combined company. In short, we are announcing who will be, what we intend to do and who will lead our incredible team once we combine forces with the N&B business in the first quarter of 2021. Our purpose is the why that drives everything we do. The combined companies purpose, applying science and companies for a better world. We're focused on our intend to push past traditional industry boundaries and commit to be a force for better, more sustainable future.We will shape the future of our industry with best-in-class solutions at the intersection of science and creativity where passionate organizations, made up team members who see their job as so much more. Our collective purpose inspires us every day to strive for better. It's not just that we are talented scientists and creators, but that we are passionate about using those talents to generate results for customers and for the world. We need both the rigor of scientific expertise and the imagination of new possibilities to create the best results.The fusion of both that will lead us to realizing the full potential of this combination. Everything we do is for the purpose of improving the world, lengthening life spans, replacing our sustaining resources, enhancing sensorial experiences, solving house problems and more. And together, we can do even more good.Creative science, scientific art, when science and creativity intersect, the possibilities are better. Here, innovation isn't a business department, it's our business. Incredible curiosity, relentless drive, purposeful impact, innovation is simply our way of operating and now with double the R&D resources unmatched in the industry. If you are keeping track, our people can't wait to get starting collaborating on something new. We are shaping the future of the industry for the better.Our vision is our strategy for future success. It articulates our aspirations and guides the development of future strategies and initiatives. It is a filter by which the endeavors can be evaluated. Our vision is to be the partner for essential solutions. From day one we will bring unmatched innovation and leading edge insight to anticipate what will be essential to tomorrows consumers. Helping all customers meet consumers need is at the heart of our business.We are more than a vendor or supplier. Yes, we supply the ingredients, components and solutions you require, but we also united in understanding and meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow. Essential solutions means that we will work to make both our relationship and what we provide invaluable to our customers business. It pushes us to supply the technology and knowhow that no one else can. There's customers of all sizes across the globe from startup to multinational, we have the agility and the expertise to deliver more of what you need. Unmatched innovation and leading edge insight means we are already anticipating what will be essential to tomorrows consumers. As we come together as one organization, we can help our customers meet consumers needs faster.On the operational model well leverage the capabilities and offerings of both organizations to create a sustainable framework that best position our teams, customers, shareholders for success on day one and well into the future. The complimentary structure will focus organization into four divisions, taste, food and beverage, scent, health and bioscience, and pharma solutions. We carefully examined how each division goes to market, including customer overlap R&D focus and service level requirements. Among other several factors to make sure we created global divisions that we have built for success.Just as important as our four operating divisions will be our global centralized functions, each of these will work in collaboration across our divisions. I want to call out in particular that we will be establishing a new integrated solutions center of excellence to focus on incubating new business opportunities and total product solutions. We're also creating a center for commercial excellence to support our business and commercial teams through development of best practices, customer insights and analysis, resource deployment, and the optimization of pricing strategies and solutions. These two are extremely important as it will be instrumental in collaborating with the business to achieve all revenue synergy goals.We also noticed the executive committee for the combined company, including highly qualified and diverse leaders with deep knowledge and expertise. If you are interested in the teams background, please check out on stronger, innovationtogether.com. I won't go through all of these distinguished leaders here, but I will note that this was a particular challenging process. Most organizations have tremendously talented individuals. We are fortunate that as a significant large organization we will be able to create many challenging, exciting new opportunities to further the careers of all employees.I'm also very encouraged by the world-class Board of Directors, we are beginning to assemble. As shared at the deal announcement, DuPont Executive Chairman and CEO, Ed Breen will join the board of the combined company as the DuPont designee following the close of the transaction and will serve as Lead Independent Director starting in June 1, 2021. I am also pleased to say that Matthias Heinzel, President of Nutrition & Biosciences at Dupont will be joining the Board of Directors of IFF following the close of the transaction. Under his leadership, Matthias has strategically transformed the N&B business, driving customer-focused innovation, operational effectiveness, and multiple business integrations. As an Independent Director, his extensive global management experience and deep knowledge of the industry will support the future company as it unlocks the value of the merger.In addition, Carol A. Davidson will also be appointed to join the Board of Directors of the future combined company following the close of the transaction. Mr. Davidson, is a CPA with more than 30 years of leadership experience across multiple industries. He has held a variety of leadership roles at Tyco International Ltd. and Dell Incorporated and financial leadership roles at Eastman Kodak Company. Mr. Davidson is the elite Independent Director like Mason and serves on the Board of TE Connectivity. For this team, both Board and management, I know our combined company will chart a new path forward for our industry and have a powerful impact on the world around us.Stepping back, I will say that I'm deeply impressed even more so during COVID-19 by the dedication of focus both the IFF and N&B teams have brought to this effort. We knew early on that these companies would be a strong cultural match and our excitement and conviction behind the potential of this combination was only grown as our teams began more and more to collaborate. As we look ahead, we are focused on executing the next key milestones and well do so within the same spend and diligence we have achieved thus far.In summary, we are pleased with our strong financial performance despite an unprecedented first quarter 2020. We delivered on all of our key metrics and saw broad-based growth in both divisions with mid-single-digit sales and double-digit adjusted EPS ex-amortization growth on a consolidated basis. We continue to make important progress in the integration of Frutarom business and have taken substantial steps forward and bringing on our combination with DuPont and N&B to life.I'm also credibly proud of each and every one of my colleagues at IFF for what they have achieved during these challenging times, not just for our business but for our partners, our customers and all communities.While global conditions remain volatiles in the near term, our order book for Q2 looks solid as we are successfully navigating through these unprecedented times to emerge as a stronger company.I would now like to open the call for questions Hey. Good morning Mark. Thank you. Okay, Mark, I will take it. The emerging markets in the first quarter where particular strong, Latin America by around about 10% and greater Asia by five plus nine. What we see in terms of the different categories in particular the Consumer Fragrance in Latin America in high teens, as well as Flavors high single and Savory Solutions in high teens as well, so really, really good results, probably strongest from the multinationals specifically in the HPC field. In Asia was all about Consumer Fragrance as well. So mid teens, really good, Taste in high single digits, most required to COIVD-19, I would say.And here, in Asia, very much across both multinationals, as well as regional and locals. Frutarom, as we said, is probably around about 4% growth with some benefits of small M&A, but still very, very good performance.I would say country-wise it depends where the COVID-19 wave has started. We have seen the first impact in Asia, particularly in China, then it moved to Europe, then to the U.S. and Latin America. So that's probably what you can see in the first quarter.In terms of the pipeline, our pipeline remains strong also into the second quarter. But having said all of that, it is really different from customer to customer. I can say, also for us, our creative labs are basically almost all open. They are working on new launches. They are working on, lets say, better, lets say, improvements of some of the products. So all in all, I would say a very strong picture, certainly impact on Fine Fragrance because \u2013 and you heard this from our customer base as well, which is not positive, but all the essential products are really going actually very, very strong. Rustom you might comment on that. Good. Let me start probably with the second part of your question first. So combination with the DuPont N&B business is fully on, on track. And if you look at the product portfolio, its now among the industry in particular are in this COVID-19 situation, one of the most robust ones and very diverse. We are in all of the categories, number one and number two in the market. We have a great R&D pipeline with combined spend upon around about $550 million, more than 9,000 patents granted. So I believe very, very robust. And as you have seen the N&B results in the first quarter as well, it shows its an essential business. Probiotics are going gangbusters and many of the other portfolio areas, as well.Coming back to the integration piece, so as you know, we have formed an IMO as an Integration Management Office, we cleared antitrust in the U.S. we filed in Europe and in China. The combined integration planning team can do a lot, which is even in these challenging times and I'm very, very pleased how they work together all over Zoom or Skype. Of course, its very, very interesting. So we really make sure that we are ready for the day one. The next up on the schedule is the shareholder vote in September, then the financing and then the close, hopefully in the first quarter of 2021.So I have to say that this COVID-19 has further solidified our position. Strategic logic is very strong, very resilient business, very great market position. And I believe we're in a very, very good spot right now. Sure, absolutely Faiza. Let me get started and then I hand it over to Rustom. It is hard to disaggregate the underlying demand versus stockpiling. But when we talk with many of our customers and we believe on the Consumer Fragrance side, certainly, the activity in washing clothes and detergent, the softness \u2013 its very much demand, its not so much stockpiling here. I think we see this. We see also all the hygiene products are really used. Its not just that people put it in the pantry. That's what we see.And also on the food side when you talk to some of our customers, the yogurts are going like there's no tomorrow, which is probably not a big surprise to all of us because working-from-home, instead of going to the company cafeteria, you go to the fridge and pull yogurt and that's your lunch. So we see some categories very much its consumption, its moving, but I cant give you all the details.What is for us right now really important is on the consumer insight side. We do all of our studies, we know how the consumer behaves right now, but what is sustainable so that we really can orient ourselves in terms of our R&D and the new product development towards things which might, will come. We believe that everything in terms of sanitizing will stay. We believe also that many of the health products, in particular, fortified with vitamins or probiotics will stay. But there's more and more to come. So that's the work we are doing right now. So in many areas the consumption is real. By the way, one last one, potato chips are also going like gangbusters. But Rustom, please comment. So it all depends right now when the economy is opening up and the stores are open. And some of these products can be sold again to our all consumers. I think that's what we all are waiting. And the big experiment is not so much China because its very small for this category as Rustom said. But what will happen now in Europe, you see Germany is basically open. And we will see next week France is opening again and then Spain and Italy and then we take it from there. So its a very volatile environment, but we are very well prepared for it. I hope it helps Faiza? Okay, yes. Its a very, very important point actually. And we are looking at this. I would say in some of the countries we have seen already, normalization because people are back to work and people see that they can buy everything. You might remember at the beginning, toilet paper was a very precious article around the world in many of the supermarkets, but that's back to normal.So actually we have seen already quite normalization, not because COVID is gone, but people see and feel that they can buy whatever they need. There was not a big disruption in the supply chain. So we believe that the inventory has changed. Its different than pharmaceuticals, for example, where people just keeping the diabetes products better for three or four months instead of one month to make sure that they are covered. But here I think in many cases we are already back to normal.On the plants, its a bit of a different situation because we are managing the supply chain actually almost by the week because India, which is a big country for raw materials in our industry, has some challenges with lockdown as well. So you really had to make sure that we get enough inventory in all the plants around the world to secure supply for our customers. So here you probably will see some elevated inventory levels for quite some time. But again situation is volatile. I expected this actually for the first quarter as well. But we were selling so much, the inventory actually went down. So that's our plan or basically what we assume for now, but it might change because its very dependent on the demand as well.But Rustom may be you comment. Hi, Adam. Hi Adam its Rustom. Let me say that. You actually were triangulating in on exactly what the factors were. So in the \u2013 first of all, we are on track with our cost synergies target through Q1 Frutarom I mean. With more than 25% of our $50 million full year savings coming in Q1. And in terms of geography, its about three quarters Taste and the rest in Scent roughly, okay? The Scent synergies showed through. And as you saw Scents performance, there's leverage. But Taste, where you're homing in, did benefit some synergies as well. But it also had mix. I mean we went straight there. We also had mid-teens growth in Savory Solutions which is a lower margin business. We had the lot citrus [ph] sales and then we have some added costs, right, manufacturing and procurement, and unit costs head up in the balance sheet and everything. But we also had some bad debt as we increased our bad debt provisions, not actually bad debts, but actual provisions as we did. So there were all offsets in here. Actually just one thing on the closure of the factories, we might have in some cases a delay of maybe two to three months. That's what we are planning, right now. So we will be done with what we saw in the mid end of third quarter, mid and end of fourth quarter. So that's the planning right now. I hope Adam that helps. Yes thank you very much for the time. I hope everybody is healthy, and stays healthy. And we certainly have time to speak over the next one or two days. Thank you very much. Take care. Bye-bye."

Before we dive into our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, I think it's important to acknowledge that this has been a transformational year for IFF. We continue to make tremendous progress amid the global -- the complex global operating environment. With a world-class team and an unmatched portfolio, IFF has become a global leader in high value ingredients and solutions for the global food, beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. IFF is a significantly larger, stronger and more diversified organization than when we begun our transformation several years ago. The enhanced scale gained through our combination with N&B makes us an even more powerful innovator and trusted partner to our customers. On a personal level, I must also reflect on what has been a tremendous and highly satisfying journey leading IFF. Together, we have taken a number of strategic actions that have transformed IFF into the category defining leader it is to day, and I'm also incredibly optimistic about IFF's future. The company's leadership team going forward has the right expertise to lead IFF's next chapter of growth and excellence in execution. I and the entire IFF team are pleased that Frank Clyburn will join IFF as our Chief Executive Officer effective, February 14. Frank brings extensive experience leading complex global businesses and overseeing large scale integrations. He is approved operate and will enhance the team's focus on execution to benefit our customers, teams and shareholders. It has been a privilege to lead such a talented global team and I know that was a recent appointment of both Frank and then IFF will be in good hands. We also recently announced the appointment of Barry Bruno to IFF's Board of Directors as an Independent Director. Barry is a welcome addition to our board as he has significant experience leading innovative consumer brands that will benefit all of IFF stakeholders as a company executes its strategic and operating priorities. Barry joins a board eight of which are new to the IFF board within the past year when Frank begins next week. That consists of proven executive with deep experience leading global organizations overseeing transformative merger integrations and executing business strategies across a diverse set of industries. On today's call, I will begin with providing an overview of IFF's full year 2021 performance and discussing the progress we have made so far on our integration. I will then turn the call over to Glenn who will provide a detailed look at our fourth quarter financial results. Before we conclude today's call with a question and answer session, then we'll also speak to our outlook for 2022. I'd like to begin on Slide six by reflecting on our strong performance for the full year 2021. IFF's financial results in 2021 reflect the strengths and durability of our extended portfolio and the exceptional dedication of our teams. Within the challenges of today's global operating environment, we delivered strong sales growth across our business divisions, including meaningful recoveries in the segments most affected by the pandemic. For the four year 2021, IFF delivered $11.7 billion in sales representing 10% growth or 8% on a currency basis consisting of very strong volume growth and modest pricing contributions. Like so many companies now persistent inflation and global supply chain challenges pressured our profitability margin. Yet, we achieve 3% growth in our combined adjusted operating EBITDA. Glenn will cover these topics in greater depths, but I want to note here that we are taking significant actions to best position the business amid evolving macroeconomic environment, including significant pricing actions. IFF continues to operate with a very strong financial foundation having delivered $1.04 billion in free cash flow or approximately 9% of our driven by robust cash generation. Given our strong financial position, we continue to make significant progress towards meeting our de leveraging target, having already reduced net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA to 4.1 times. We also delivered meaningful synergies in connection with our integration initiatives. Importantly, we have all performed our cost synergy targets for year one, post close of the N&B merger and our ongoing focus in execution positions as well to further drive synergy realization and productivity improvements. In 2021, we also made significant strides to optimize our portfolio, including the successful divestiture of food preparations business, and the announced sale of our microbial control business, which we expect will be completed in the second quarter of 2022. Once our microbial control sale is complete, the combination of all of these two transactions will generate approximately $1.4 billion in gross proceeds. Growing IFF to more rapidly de-lever the balance sheet as we continue to progress with our integration objectives, Frank and team will explore additional opportunities to optimize our portfolio driving greater focus on the core parts of the business and enhancing shareholder values through rapid eLeveraging. For IFF, 2021 was filled with exciting achievements and meaningful change that continue to propel us forward and solidify the importance of our business within the global supply chain. Our business is delivering strong growth as an indispensable partner to our customers and while we are operating in a challenging environment, our leadership team is taking the right action to position our business for the future. We are delivering on our commitment to boldly reinvent, deliver consistent execution and transform our ability to reach and partner with more customers around the world. 2021 was a foundational year and one that I have no doubt that the company will build on as it accelerates into the future. Now turning to Slide seven, I would like to walk through the regional sales dynamics underpinning our results for the of full year 2021. I'm pleased to share that we saw strong growth in all four of our key operating regions. In North America, we achieved 8% growth across nearly all segments led by high single digit growth in health and biosciences. In Asia, sales increased by 9% led by continued double digit in India and China, Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions all perform particularly well in Asia with strong growth and momentum throughout 2021. IFF achieved 11% growth in Latin America region with double-digit growth across nearly all countries. Our Nourish division delivered strong double digit growth with health and bioscience and Scent businesses growing in the high single digits. Our EMEA also delivered strong sales results with 9% sales growth driven by the double-digit growth in fine fragrance business. EMEA was also bolted by strengths in our Nourish business. We saw significant growth led by food service. Moving now to Slide eight, I would like to discuss our sales performance across IFF business segments that contributed to our overall storm growth for the year. For the full year, Nourish achieve currency neutral sales growth of 9% was broad based strengths in our flavors, ingredients and food design businesses. Health and Biosciences delivered 6% currency neutral growth in 2021, primarily driven by strong performance and home and personal care, animal attrition and culture and food enzymes. Scent also delivered strong 8% currency neutral growth led by fine fragrance, consumer fragrance and ingredients. Pharma solution achieved 2% currency neutral growth driven by demand in our industrial business, while we continue to see headwinds related to ongoing limited material availability and logistical constraints. Now on to Slide nine, I would like to focus on the underlying dynamics driving segment perform. For Nourish, consistent strong performance included double digit growth in ingredients while our margins were impacted by our costs of raw materials, EBITDA increased 8% from strong volume growth, pricing actions and a continued focus on cost management. In Health and Bioscience, strong growth and home and personal care aim processing and cultures and food en enzymes were key drivers. Higher costs for raw materials and logistic remain a challenge which is adjusted operating EBITDA margin of 26.8% in the segment. Our Scent division benefited by particular, strongly rebound from last year in fine fragrances. In addition to continued solar performance and consumer fragrances and double-digital growth across cosmetic actives. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew 11% as margin expanded 30 Bps led by volume growth, favorable mix and higher productivity and finally, in pharma solutions, we saw significant customer demand and double-digit growth in the segment's industrial business. Global supply chain issues however, remained an overhang for 2021 margin performance. Moving now to Slide 10, I'm very pleased to share that our full year sales result exceeded pre-COVID levels, which is particularly encouraging for the year ahead. As previously outlined, sales goals was consistent across our business segments, reflecting the strengths and resilience of our extended portfolio and IFF's position as an essential partner for customers in critical industries around the world. It is clear that IFF continues to deliver enhanced value to our customers as a result of our merger with N&B and the work we are doing to strategically integrate our businesses and focus on execution. Simply put, we are a stronger business today and our customers recognize the unique value we bring as a trusted innovation partner. Let's move to Slide 11. I would like to reiterate our strong progress to deliver synergies and connection with the N&B combination. In 2021, we exceeded our year one target of $45 million to deliver approximately $60 million in cost savings. This includes approximately $20 million in savings in the fourth quarter. Revenue synergies also were a modest contribution to top line performance with a projected pipeline continuing to develop. Execution and operating discipline remain the top priority for our leadership team and I'm pleased to see results that reflect this commitment. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn.\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Andreas and welcome everyone. Thank you again for being with us today. As Andreas highlighted, 2021 was a strong year for sales growth, including a strong fourth quarter finish. Looking more closely at our consolidated fourth quarter results, IFF generated greater than $3 billion in sales representing a 10% year over year increase on a currency mutual basis, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Health and Biosciences division, as well as high single digit growth across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma divisions. As with our full year results, our fourth quarter margin performance continued to face inflationary pressures, much like our entire industry, which offset positive volume growth, solid price increases, and the benefits of synergies and productivity. Early in the fourth quarter, we recognized a significant escalation in inflationary pressures and as a result, we quickly mobilized to prepare to implement significant pricing actions across all businesses to protect overall profitability. I'll discuss these actions as well as our efforts to accelerate productivity and operational excellence when I discuss our 2022 outlook. On the next several slides, I will briefly dive deeper into the fourth quarter financials of each of our core business segments. Turning to Slide 13, I'll begin with our Nourish segment, which experienced both a solid quarter and overall performance in 2021. In the fourth quarter, Nourish achieved 9% year-over-year sales growth on a currency neutral basis, driven by strong volume growth and price increases. Our Flavors business in particular realized strong growth with increased sales across all regions. Ingredients grew by strong double digits to increasing customer demand and both food design and food service also drove growth for Nourish in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating EBITDA declined slightly due to inflationary pressures. Pressure on profitability occured despite strong volume growth, increased productivity and strategic price increases in the segment. On Slide 14, our Health and Biosciences division delivered fourth quarter year-over-year sales growth of 13% on a currency neutral basis led by double digit growth in health, microbial control, animal nutrition and grain processing. Additionally, cultures and food enzymes and home and personal care each grew at a high single digits against strong year-over-year comparisons. Our adjusted operating EBITDA increased 4% due to volume growth and higher productivity, while margins faced pressure due to inflation and higher logistics cost. Turning now to Slide 15, our Scent division continued to perform well and achieved strong growth in the fourth quarter, delivering 6% year-over-year growth or 7% growth on a currency neutral basis. This performance was supported by a continued rebound in fine fragrances, which saw double digit growth driven by new wins and increased volume. Our Consumer Fragrances category delivered single digit growth against a strong high single digit year ago comparison. The ingredients business continues to contribute to the success of the overall segment with double digit growth in fragrance ingredients. Despite solid volume growth and favorable mix in the business, scent adjusted operating EBITDA growth was affected by higher cost of raw materials, which we continue to take action to mitigate. On Slide 16, our Performance Solutions segment delivered year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth of 9% from 2020 as a result of volume strength and price increases. Both our core pharma and industrial categories contribute to our strong performance in the quarter. Performance Solutions adjusted operating EBITDA and margin was also impacted by higher raw material and energy costs. We recognize the challenges the segment is experiencing due to the current market environment in macro supply chain constraints and are optimistic that as the global situation recovers, we will recognize the full potential of Pharma Solutions. Now on Slide 17, I would like to review our cash flow position and progress in de leveraging. For the full year 2021, we delivered strong cash of over $1 billion and our on track to meet our de leveraging goals. 2021, CapEx was $393 million or approximately 3.4% of sales as we made strategic investments in the most attractive segments of our portfolio. Overall, our capital expenditures were lower than originally planned in part due to slower implementation of projects due to some vendor delays and a continued of the COVID environment. We also paid out $667 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2021. From a leverage perspective, we continued to make substantial progress toward achieving our deleveraging target, finishing 2021 with $4.1, net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio. IFF reduced gross debt by $124 million to $11.4 billion versus Q3 and we finished 2021 with cash and cash equivalence of $716 million. We remain competent that IFF is on track to achieve our deleveraging target of three times net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA by year three, post close, further supported by additional divestitures that I will touch on in a moment. Turning to slide 18, I'd like to provide commentary on our business outlook for 2022. For fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue between $12.3 billion and $12.7 billion with adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We also are forecasting foreign exchange rates will be a headwind in 2022, approximately two percentage point headwind to our revenue and a four percentage point headwind to adjusted operating EBITDA in '22. As you are all well aware, we continue to operate in a complex market environment with ongoing uncertainties from pandemic, global political tensions and supply chain challenges, IFF, and our industry at large have been impacted by these issues and we expect and have planned for that these challenges will remain into 2022. As I shared on our third quarter call, we expect inflationary pressures to be significant in 2022, as we see large cost increases in raw materials, energy and logistics. As a result, we are taking significant pricing actions to fully offset our dollar cost exposure, which we expect will result in strong sales and profit growth, but will depress margin. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to recover margin to pre-inflation levels as we are focused on improving returns to generate strong value creation for our shareholders. We also remain intently focused on driving cost reductions through synergies and increased productivity efforts throughout our business. In addition, we are increasing CapEx in 2022 to approximately 5% of sales as a result of '21 CapEx carryover and increased investments to the passive expansion in key technologies, which will help support growth while also lowering logistics costs. Finally, we will also be increasing inventory by approximately $300 million to more appropriate levels to ensure we can continue to serve our customers. Now moving to Slide 19, I would like to focus more specifically on the cost inflation trends that we saw in '21 and now forecasts to see in '22. Heading into 2022, we expect certain costs, including raw materials, energy and logistics will continue to rise much as they did in '21. Overall, we expect '22 cost increases to be double digits, call it approximately 10%. We are seeing most of these increases related to inflation in raw materials with double digit increases in  oils, cellulose, pulp, turpentine, aroma chemicals, petrochemicals, fragrance specialty chemicals, savory ingredients, specialty chemicals, agriculture, grains and sweeteners. The inflationary pressures manifest themselves differently between the legacy N&B and IFF businesses. Most of the higher energy and logistics cost in '22 are related to legacy N&B. With added capacity coming online later this year, we hope to start to mitigate some of the logistics headwinds we have been facing due to an imbalance in supply and demand. If you look at legacy IFF portfolio, we are seeing high single digit raw material inflation similar to our flavor and fragrance peers. Recognizing these challenges, we have been aggressively pursuing broad based pricing actions and accelerating synergy and productivity efforts. Turning to Slide 20, I will provide a bit more insight into our sales guidance for 2022. Our $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion sales expectation represents continued momentum on top of our strong to 2021 results. To get a more comparable revenue basis, you must add back approximately $500 million of sales related to N&B in January of 2021 as N&B results were not part of IFF until February 01 of 2021. Our sales guidance also accounts for the removal of June to December '21 revenue results following the anticipated completed sale of our microbial control business, as well as the first nine months of '21 sales for their fruit prep divestiture which we closed in October of last year. That gets you to our comparable '21 revenue base of $11.85 billion as indicated on the slide. As I said earlier, we are significantly increasing our prices in order to fully offset the dollar cost exposure of our inflation for 2022. With that in mind, we anticipate pricing to be significantly larger contributor to the top line in '22. This pricing impact plus more months volume growth following a strong '21 will be central to our overall sales performance in '22, where we expect to grow approximately 6% to 9% year over year on a comparable currency neutral basis. Now, in terms of our guidance on the adjusted operating front, we also had to make adjustments for comparability. If you add that EBITDA related to N&B general results and subtract the EBITDA related to seven months of EBITDA as a result of the anticipated divetiture of our microbial control business, as well as the EBITDA related to the fruit prep business for the first nine months of '21, you get to a comparable '21 base of approximately $2.5 billion. As mentioned implementing broad base pricing actions to offset inflationary pressures is critical to our '22 plan. Over the last three plus month, each of our business has executed pricing actions across essentially our entire customer base. As a result, we anticipate to completely offset projected '22 install pressures with pricing actions. The majority of these actions will be implemented in the first and second quarter. I would also note that we anticipate that 2023 will benefit from an additional $200 million of net pricing benefit due to the full annualization of our pricing actions, which will be equal to a 100% capture of the combined 2021 and 2022 inflation impact on our business. Importantly, we also continue to closely monitor the global supply chain environment and will be prepared to execute additional price actions as appropriate. By adding anticipated volume leverage plus synergies and productivity, we expect comparable EBITDA growth in '22 to be strong, up approximately 4% to 8%. It should be noted that the synergy and productivity contribution here is a net number where it is a combination of the benefits of synergy and productivity, net of cost of living increases and reinvestments in the business. Our guidance implies that our adjusted operating EBITDA margin will be down modestly versus '21, principally due to our net dollar cost recovery, which equates to approximately 100 basis points. Over the course of '21 and '22, we will see more than $1 billion of total inflation and while we are working rapidly to cover the price increases, it has impacted margins significantly. To give you a perspective of the magnitude, our margin for full year '22 on an inflation adjusted basis will be approximately 300 basis points higher or approximately 23.5%. In terms of marching cadence throughout '22, we expect the first half to be down year over year with expansion coming in the second half. While sales are expected to be strong in the first quarter, year-over-year adjusted operating EBITDA margin performance will be the most challenged of the year down over 300 basis points versus our reported first quarter 2021 margin with each quarter after that concluding. Much of this will be driven by price to total inflation, where we expect to turn positive starting the third quarter. As I conclude, I want to highlight our four key areas of focus for '22 and provide further color into our detailed execution plans for each. First, we are committed to building on our strong '21 sales momentum. Our 6% to 9% targeted '22 currency neutral sales growth anticipates that we will continue to maintain volume growth consistent with overall industry growth rates. We believe that our exceptional R&D pipeline and scaled global commercial teams including targeted '22 investments will allow us to continue to deliver superior customer solutions and support strong growth. In addition, as I mentioned previously, we are making substantial investments to increase capacity across constrained portions of our portfolio and enhancing supply chain efficiencies. Lastly, we'll be sharpening our focus on our revenue synergy opportunities as we are behind our original planned pace, as much of last year was focused on addressing near term supply chain issues. That said, we are confident that the breadth and depth of our platform will allow us to build meaningful revenue synergies over time. Second, as previously outlined, we are intently focused on broad based pricing actions to offset inflation. And importantly, as the macro environment involves, we are prepared to quickly execute additional pricing actions throughout the year as needed. To enhance our ability to react more quickly to the dynamic environment over the last several months, we have undertaken a comprehensive end to end review of our procurement processes, implemented new pricing tools and established core pricing teams for each one of our businesses. Our focus has been to compress the time between inflation signals and customer pricing actions, ensuring we optimize product segment and customer specific pricing actions and closely monitor the level and pace of pricing utilization. Going forward, we are focused on further enhancing our procurement processes and pricing programs. Third, we are determined to accelerate our synergy realization and more broadly our productivity efforts in 2022. For your reference, included in our '22 guidance, we are targeting approximately $200 million of cost reductions from synergies, yield enhancements and reformulations, logistic efficiencies and other operational improvements. Net of wage inflationary pressures and targeted investments to help drive top line growth. we are targeting net cost efficiencies of approximately a $100 million for the year. While we feel this is good progress, we also recognize that there is more work to do. Consequently, in addition to the end to end review of procurement, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of our global manufacturing and logistics platform, constructing a plan to accelerate the scope and scale of our global shared service capabilities and developing a detailed technology and digital integrated roadmap all with the goal of driving meaningful efficiencies, while also ensuring we provide superior customer solutions and service. Fourth, we are actively working to accelerate our non-core divestitures. As we have discussed, we are on track to successfully complete the sale of our Microbial Control business, which will enhance the efficiency and profitability of our portfolio. We're also targeting additional portfolio optimization to further deliver our balance sheet and focus on core growth opportunities. Over the coming quarters, we will proceed with marketing a handful of nonstrategic businesses, call it three or four, where we believe that over the next 18 months, we can generate expected proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Similar to our fruit prep and Microbial Control business, these are non-strategic and the transactions will be accretive to our go-forward growth rate and margin profile. With this action plan together with our current sales momentum and strength, our leading portfolio, I am confident that IFF will deliver strong results in 2022. With that, I would like to turn the call back to Andreas.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Glenn. IFF's transformation has been deeply personal to me, and I know that this company is stronger today than it has ever been. I am proud of the solid year we had in 2021 with significant year over year sales and profit growth, as well as steady progress towards our integration with N&B. So all my time at IFF, I've been consistently impressed by the thousands of employees who have dedicated their time and talent to make our company, the category defining leader it is today. I want to thank them for their contributions over this year and the time I have led the company and also for that passion about IFF and the commitment to our customers. The path ahead for the company and its new leadership team is clear. I'm confident that IFF enters its next chapter with the right team at best in class portfolio, innovative spirit, significant financial flexibility and a unified sense of purpose to drive long term growth and benefit our shareholders, employees, customers and communities. With that. I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator:  And we will take our first question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nGunther Zechmann: Hi. Good morning everyone. Hi, Andrea. Hi Gleen, thanks for taking my question. Can I start with two? The first one is on the top line guidance for the year. Can you just outline to us what's required to get to the higher or the lower end of the range respectively please? And the second one is you're pushing through quite a lot of price increases already ahead of some of your key peers in F&F. What's the volume elasticity that you expect or have already seen on the price increases and what you hear from your customers in that regard please?\nAndreas Fibig: Yeah. good morning, Gunther. Thanks for the question. Your two questions are highly related because relative to the top line, we'd say the variable that's likely to be the bigger indicator of the range is we're going to be more volume than price. If anything, frankly, we feel very good about what we've implemented from price what's coming through. If there's additional inflationary price pressures, we may in fact push additional pricing, but volume to some extent, I think is the bigger question mark for us. We had a 2% to 3% assumption relative to volumes. That's probably a point lower than historically the market from a standpoint and that will probably drive the difference in terms of the top line. To your second question, we've actually have not seen much elasticity. i.e. as you know yourself sort of amp  up on the consumer product companies have been releasing recently, those volumes generally have been sticking in the market. We have one month by the way, the month of January results, generally volumes are sort of holding  in their Q4. So we're not seeing sort of a drop yet. That being said, when we put the plan together, recognizing this is going to be a very abnormal year, given the sheer degree of pricing, we got it prudent to plan accordingly and we actually expect, and what we've seen from an awful lot of our competitors is everybody is basically implementing the same range of pricing in the market.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMark Astrachan: Yeah. Thanks and morning, everyone. Wanted to follow up sort of related to the last question, so in the '22 guidance, I guess both top line and adjusted EBITDA expectations is really strongly predicated on this pricing. So yeah how do you think about this in kind of broader, longer term strokes. If you go back years ago, competitors or ebbed and flowed in terms of the ability to take price and how quickly they took price and how much they took price. So how do you think about how your competitors react? If you go back through those earnings calls, nobody's really talking about specifics, but you just laid out specifics. So yeah how do you think about or what's embedded in what your competitors are going to do from a pricing standpoint and how quickly can you adapt if your competitors don't directly follow how much you're taking at this point and just a related point, how do we think about it beyond '22 in terms of how much pricing is given back versus what you're taking this year?\nAndreas Fibig: Sure. Great question, Mark. The reality is we're well into midstream on pricing actions. We signal in our third quarter call with heavy inflation on the horizon, we react as a very quickly. So we spent the latter part of the fourth quarter and then sort of every working day this year of executing broad based pricing across the entire customer base. That actually has been quite effective. So based on the read of that i.e., we've implemented most of that pricing already, which will kick in largely over the first and second quarter. It appears to be sticking. We also know from observing our competitors, as they're under similar inflationary pressures, we're all sort of seeing the same thing and they're also are passing pricing through. So we feel like we're sort of neck to neck in terms of what we're doing in the market. We are being surgical. There are certain category is that are slightly more elastic or price competitive, if you will and are being thoughtful about sort of where we price and there are other areas that typically are less of elastic, they also are passing pricing through.  So we feel like we're sort of neck-to-neck in terms of what we're doing in the market. We are being surgical. There are certain categories that are slightly more elastic or price competitive, if you will and are being thoughtful about sort of where we price. And there are other areas that typically are less of elastic for a host of, and sort of making sure that we sort of price appropriate in those segments. But we do believe that -- actually more than believe, we've seen it. A lot of our pricing is in fact now and being implemented over the coming months. And, we have not seen, as I mentioned, a big significant change in terms of volumes and the amount of customers that we've lost has been relatively small, directly related to our pricing actions. We\u2019re relative to the longer term, as we mentioned on the script, we had about $400 million of inflation last year. We anticipated about $600 million, so in all, in a billion dollars, between the two years. We implemented $200 million last and we're planning on matching the $600 million this year. So we're still $200 million short. We do fully anticipate to capture that additional $200 million as we move into 2023. And very importantly, the market continues to ebb and flow. Although we haven't seen a lot of movement on raw materials recently, there's been some ups and downs, but are prepared to react. And if they're additional inflationary pressures, we're, we're positioned to go to the market very rapidly.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mike DeStefano with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike DeStefano: Hey, good morning. Good end of the year. And Andreas has been great working with you. I guess my question is when you, you think about when the deal is put together your -- you seem to be on track to hit your top-line growth goals through 2023. If you're going to do '25 & '26 this year, it does seem like sort of a tall order to get to over $3 billion by '23. So just curious, do you think the absolute EBITDA goal in '23 is still doable or maybe it's delayed a year? And I know if you get the $200 million in pricing next year; that helps a lot. So just curious you can sort of walk us through what happens in '23 relative to the original goals for the deal? Thank you.\nAndreas Fibig: I think it, it is a -- it is the question in some sense, how do we think about our longer term goals? Obviously Frank joins us next week and we will be working very aggressively over the coming months to review our longer term targets. That being said, I would say two things certainly going from '25, '26 to call it 32, 33; it\u2019s a big number for next year. As you pointed out, I think we have a clear line of sight to $200 million of incremental pricing at least another a hundred million of synergy productivity. I actually would hope for more, quite frankly, but we have a hundred million left on the extent synergy side that gets us directionally to 2285 to 29 range from the standpoint. So we're getting to close the gap, but there's still a gap there. And we have work to figure that out. I think on a qualitative basis I am optimistic there's lot year because of the operating environment has been very challenging. And again, he would, would've anticipated the level of inflation and what we had to deal with on top of that, the global supply chain issues, but we do feel a combination of the strength of the platform in terms of revenue opportunities for growth. And in addition, the more I time I spend here, the more I'm convinced that there are meaningful opportunities to enhance our overall performance in terms of productivity and operating margin. So I, until Frank has arrives and we sort of go through that very detailed process, we can't provide a number. But there's a clear line to call it 2829 next year, based on pricing and productivity. And I think we have additional opportunities on top of that.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you and best wishes Andreas. You're guiding to a 4% headwind from current seat there EBITDA in 2022 and that's more than the 2% impact on sales. This is our first time going through an FX headwind with the new portfolio. So maybe help us with how much your costs are in dollars relative to the revenues and foreign currencies. And your side of the Euro continues to be the key currency, but has the overall basket of important currencies changed with the new portfolio?\nAndreas Fibig: The basket has changed actually with the combination of NMB. It's actually slightly more U.S based. Then it is non-US based. Roughly around 50% of our revenues are U.S dollar denominated, about 25% are, are Euro, and then a, a range of currencies for the residual from a an earnings perspective while the Euro's 25% in revenues. It's about 20% in terms of our earnings. From a cash flow standpoint, because we have a higher cost base that European denominated. So, it is a significant portion. It's the one, that's what we focused on from a risk standpoint. As you know, the Euro dropped from circle 118 on average, last year, it's been in sort the 113, 114 range. We were planning a 113, so that's how we sort of think about the year.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was open to maybe dig in a little bit more just on the cost energy capture and the assumption that are embedded in the '20 -- in the '22 guidance. Just, we're kind of what -- and what's left to capture post '22 and guess the corollary to that, and this kind of address a little bit in some of the other conversations, but as we think about where we are exiting 2022 with some of the pricing carryover just relative to the original and be merger plan, kind of the, the margin EBITDA potential in '23?\nAndreas Fibig: Yeah, sure. Adam, thanks. Thanks for the question. Relative to the synergies we identified as reminder, we did $60.21 million. Our commitment was to get to $180 million this year and to ramp up to $300 million. We're actually going to be short of that. We're actually posting another $90 million this year. I would note that our total productivity basket is $200 million. So we're thinking more broadly than just synergies, frankly, a year past the deal. It's important that we just figure out how to cut costs across the enterprise, as opposed to just focus on the narrow combination areas. Now of that shortfall, if you will, this year, it's all in the procurement arena, just given what's going on global supply chain. Wasn't realistic to sort of count on the synergy impact. So 60 plus -- plus the 90 gets us basically to the 150, and as I mentioned, I'm fully confident we're going to get the residual 150 and synergies to other areas and we'll continue to focus on productivity above that. So if you think about the carry over to next year between pricing of $200 million and then another 150 that's how you get to the 28 of the 29 from sort of a carryover standpoint into '23.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan, your line now open.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. You, generated $1.4 billion in cash-flow on an EBITDA base of $2.4 billion or a little less than 60%. Is that the ratio that you expect for 2022, that is your operating cash flow will be about 1.5 or do you think you can make improvements in this ratio? What -- what should be the normal ratio of operating cash flow to EBITDA?\nAndreas Fibig: Yeah. it's a great question. We have some more work to do to figure out sort of where we're going to be longer term relative to cash generation. We're going to be actually making slightly higher investments in two areas this year. I think net of these investments will be sort of about equal on a cash flow basis. One is we're going to be adding inventories building, I should say, inventories of about $300 million. As a reminder, when the deal was closed a year ago, we were at artificially low inventory levels, about 111 days. This historically the combined entity was in the 1 25 range. We built some of that back at the end of the year. We were, but we're still sort of short of where we need to be. The second thing is our CapEx spending will increase this year as well, relative to last year. Those increases are twofold. We ended the year less than $400 million. Some of the CapEx we were unable to implement last year that was a by-product of suppliers, basically being delayed in terms of supplying steel and other products. And in addition, just we operate in COVID environment. So the speed at which we're able to implement the load as well. So we're ramping up. We're also ramping up simply to address some capacity constraints, supply chain, which will actually achieve, help achieve higher demand levels as well as lower costs on the logistics side. So net, there is about a combination of $500 million increase between inventories and higher CapEx year-over-year, but the overall cash-flow apart from the business would be felt relatively neutral, after that's done. Longer term, as I mentioned previously, we, really have some work to do, to think about our longer term sort of goals relative to the cash generation of the enterprise.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question for Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. So I know you commented on there being in that residual $200 million benefit on, on pricing when we get into 2023, but I did think it was worth just referencing the fact that some of your competitors talk about it taking 18 to 24 months for inflation to be covered with pricing. So I'm just curious why that would be such a shorter timeframe for you. So that's kind of point one and point two is just, I think the N&B businesses, there are components of them. My understanding there are little bit more commodity in nature where switching costs would be low for your customers versus more and there's certainly plenty. It's very value add, and that's not true at all. But just any thoughts or the degree you have visibility on elasticity for those portions of the portfolio? I don't know how, what you know, data was like at, N&B and so on. If there's visibility into some history on that piece of business as well, that's informing your elasticity thoughts for this year? Thanks.\nAndreas Fibig: Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question. In general, as I mentioned, we haven't seen much of volume drop off relative to our pricing action. So there are certain categories that are slightly more competitive, but in the environment where demand is still relatively high, we've been able to push through pricing. So there, there nowhere have we seen sort of great pockets of sort of softness across any of the businesses? That's point one. Point two, there is a lag, and that's why there, the $200 million will kick in late this year and roll into next year from an overlap standpoint. And there's too reason for that, that there's contractual relationships that despite actually in this environment, it's been easier to open up renegotiations to the level inflation. It takes time to renegotiate and put it in place. So just a timing element and then some of the contracts are more indices based or tied to certain indexes that certified as well. So recall we had $400 million last year, so we're, we're basically implementing all that. And then we have another $600 million to catch up. So at that billion, we will catch up $800 million of it within literally sort of five. And then we will kick into the residual into '23, which is right in that same window sort 18 months, thinking that sort of for implementation.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from David Butler with Deutsche bank. You line is now open.\nDavid Butler: Thank you. Good morning. Going back to the volume guidance this year, 2% or 3%, it seems a little bit low given you are gaining share. You might have some beginnings of initial revenue synergies. Is there anything limiting that line growth assumption for this year that you can point out? Thank you.\nAndreas Fibig: I, think we have been appropriately prudent in our planning process, given the sheer level of pricing that we have in the plan. We didn't want to sort of sort of push the envelope if you will, from a volume standpoint. As I mentioned previously, it's going to depend upon the consumer certainly in the very, very early days of the year. That seems to be holding up. But we have a lot of year ahead of us, as well. From a capacity standpoint as we've mentioned in the past, we are making very meaningful investments, a combination of CapEx, as well as inventory, to allow us to address some of the legacy issues we had last year. Those issues were principally and legacy N&B businesses that will feel better about having the capacity to meet and if it continues. But it's largely a function of just being prudent in this sort of a very, very unprecedented market from the planning standpoint.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Congrats again. And Andreas, I guess maybe a follow up to the last question in terms of your characterization of channel inventories, if you can you know, I'm looking at two subcategories on slide 9 ingredients and fine fragrance has obviously had a very, very big year. Are you assuming some sort of mean version as the year unfolds just from a demand standpoint as channel inventory comp against, pretty healthy comps from 2021. And then also, I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you break-up the sequencing go inflation in terms of what you're assuming the inflation trajectory as a year unfolds? I know you made comments on one queue.\nAndreas Fibig: Yeah, let me I'll answer the second question really, just to give you some perspective on margin, sort of the margin change year over year progression through the year. So that reflects sort of the combination of the inflation and the pricing, the action, interestingly, it enough because we've been in two years of COVID it's difficult to look at any of the businesses on a given quarter and it's better to look on a two year or normalized basis. And when you, that actually the range relative to the currency neutral results of our businesses actually tightened up quite a bit. And they come very close together. So as it relates to this year from our planning standpoint, we don't have big differences planned per se, across our different business units. There much more tighter distribution in volume in part because we have a two to 3% volume in general. And in part, because we think we're opinion more normalized environment, and some of the capacity issues are also being effectively addressed. So we don't expect to have a, a wide range of impact. A wide range of differences between the businesses as relates to volumes from a pro on the pricing actions and the inflation and how we're offsetting that we do expect that the first half principally the first quarter will be the most challenged. We expect that the first quarter is likely to have margin down year of year, a little over 300 basis points. We expect that that will soft into around 150ish in the second quarter. And then in the back half of the year, we'll basically be up to get to the full year. The full year guidance is sort of directionally down 80 basis points year over year from a combination. So that, basically is a reflection of how we see the, sort of the, the pricings, the pricing kicking in relative to the inflation.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.\nChris Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. So when I look across your portfolio, pretty solid results in Nourish, Scent, et cetera. Do you kind of take a step back and look at the portfolio you know, right here right now, can you just comment on two things the first, just where you feel incrementally more positive of on the potential for revenue synergies then also just any further color on port smaller portfolio printing? Thank you so much.\nAndreas Fibig: Yeah. Good question. So maybe Andres going to add a little bit more on the revenue synergy, right? We feel very good about the longer term prospects on revenue synergies. We admit that we're behind, we, we basically are not on the original plan relative to the timing and for the pace of the revenue synergies. That in our view is simply a function of how we spent the last year. The last year because of the nature of supply chain issues inflation issues. We ended up dedicating resources more to the here and now from the standpoint. It's actually also allowed this for our commercial teams, our R&D teams to basically spend more time working together and a byproduct of that. We do feel like there's a very strong pipeline of opportunities going forward. So I very -- you will see basically the majority of the opportunities within our no division because by the nature of the products and the customer, it just goes very nicely together. If you just take all the plant based protein products where basically can, can offer almost a total solution on in many, many cases, even a total solution to our customers, so that that's one example. The other example is, and we had just one of the big customer meetings on, on the American cleaning Institute, Congress, this this month's where you see that the enzyme business for household care products and the fragrance business are going hand in hand. So these are certainly the biggest opportunities for us going forward and then something which we should not underestimate is that we have opportunities on the R&D side as well. And I give you just one very concrete example. Everybody is looking now for these the capsules for you put the fragrance into detergent and to produce a green capsule. And now with our enhanced capabilities, we have many more programs running to come up with really good solutions. They're already in generation two and three, and that is a synergy by themselves as, as well on the R&D area, which probably takes a little bit more time. And then Glenn, you should comment on the portfolio.\nGlenn Richter: Yeah, a great question on portfolio, as I mentioned in my comments, and I think we've done a very, very good job of being thoughtful about non-core businesses. Non-Core those that basically are sort of diluted for our top line and bottom line, and just simply strategically don't have a great fit. As you know, we have sold through prep. We will be closing the second quarter on microbial controls. That's basically $1.4 billion gross. We have three or four other businesses that are being teed up. We will be going to market in the coming months quarters. We fully anticipate to have them executed. I need transactions close in the cash in within 18 months. We think that range is $1.5 billion to 1.7 billion relative to the three to four entities and very importantly, our goal is to use those proceeds to get us to the three times or lower laborer issues. So that actually been working very well; we had a dedicated set of teams to do nothing, but sort of focus on that to get that done markets have been good in relative to interest in, in certain properties. So we're very encouraged by that.\nOperator: And we have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to Andreas Fibig for any additional or closing remarks.\nAndreas Fibig: Yeah. Thank you very much for the participation and, and the good questions and taking preparation. That's my last IFF meeting here. Thank you for all the good and constructive work and have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful time -- wonderful day.",

            "name": "Andreas Fibig",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we dive into our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, I think it's important to acknowledge that this has been a transformational year for IFF. We continue to make tremendous progress amid the global -- the complex global operating environment. With a world-class team and an unmatched portfolio, IFF has become a global leader in high value ingredients and solutions for the global food, beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. IFF is a significantly larger, stronger and more diversified organization than when we begun our transformation several years ago. The enhanced scale gained through our combination with N&B makes us an even more powerful innovator and trusted partner to our customers. On a personal level, I must also reflect on what has been a tremendous and highly satisfying journey leading IFF. Together, we have taken a number of strategic actions that have transformed IFF into the category defining leader it is to day, and I'm also incredibly optimistic about IFF's future. The company's leadership team going forward has the right expertise to lead IFF's next chapter of growth and excellence in execution. I and the entire IFF team are pleased that Frank Clyburn will join IFF as our Chief Executive Officer effective, February 14. Frank brings extensive experience leading complex global businesses and overseeing large scale integrations. He is approved operate and will enhance the team's focus on execution to benefit our customers, teams and shareholders. It has been a privilege to lead such a talented global team and I know that was a recent appointment of both Frank and then IFF will be in good hands. We also recently announced the appointment of Barry Bruno to IFF's Board of Directors as an Independent Director. Barry is a welcome addition to our board as he has significant experience leading innovative consumer brands that will benefit all of IFF stakeholders as a company executes its strategic and operating priorities. Barry joins a board eight of which are new to the IFF board within the past year when Frank begins next week. That consists of proven executive with deep experience leading global organizations overseeing transformative merger integrations and executing business strategies across a diverse set of industries. On today's call, I will begin with providing an overview of IFF's full year 2021 performance and discussing the progress we have made so far on our integration. I will then turn the call over to Glenn who will provide a detailed look at our fourth quarter financial results. Before we conclude today's call with a question and answer session, then we'll also speak to our outlook for 2022. I'd like to begin on Slide six by reflecting on our strong performance for the full year 2021. IFF's financial results in 2021 reflect the strengths and durability of our extended portfolio and the exceptional dedication of our teams. Within the challenges of today's global operating environment, we delivered strong sales growth across our business divisions, including meaningful recoveries in the segments most affected by the pandemic. For the four year 2021, IFF delivered $11.7 billion in sales representing 10% growth or 8% on a currency basis consisting of very strong volume growth and modest pricing contributions. Like so many companies now persistent inflation and global supply chain challenges pressured our profitability margin. Yet, we achieve 3% growth in our combined adjusted operating EBITDA. Glenn will cover these topics in greater depths, but I want to note here that we are taking significant actions to best position the business amid evolving macroeconomic environment, including significant pricing actions. IFF continues to operate with a very strong financial foundation having delivered $1.04 billion in free cash flow or approximately 9% of our driven by robust cash generation. Given our strong financial position, we continue to make significant progress towards meeting our de leveraging target, having already reduced net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA to 4.1 times. We also delivered meaningful synergies in connection with our integration initiatives. Importantly, we have all performed our cost synergy targets for year one, post close of the N&B merger and our ongoing focus in execution positions as well to further drive synergy realization and productivity improvements. In 2021, we also made significant strides to optimize our portfolio, including the successful divestiture of food preparations business, and the announced sale of our microbial control business, which we expect will be completed in the second quarter of 2022. Once our microbial control sale is complete, the combination of all of these two transactions will generate approximately $1.4 billion in gross proceeds. Growing IFF to more rapidly de-lever the balance sheet as we continue to progress with our integration objectives, Frank and team will explore additional opportunities to optimize our portfolio driving greater focus on the core parts of the business and enhancing shareholder values through rapid eLeveraging. For IFF, 2021 was filled with exciting achievements and meaningful change that continue to propel us forward and solidify the importance of our business within the global supply chain. Our business is delivering strong growth as an indispensable partner to our customers and while we are operating in a challenging environment, our leadership team is taking the right action to position our business for the future. We are delivering on our commitment to boldly reinvent, deliver consistent execution and transform our ability to reach and partner with more customers around the world. 2021 was a foundational year and one that I have no doubt that the company will build on as it accelerates into the future. Now turning to Slide seven, I would like to walk through the regional sales dynamics underpinning our results for the of full year 2021. I'm pleased to share that we saw strong growth in all four of our key operating regions. In North America, we achieved 8% growth across nearly all segments led by high single digit growth in health and biosciences. In Asia, sales increased by 9% led by continued double digit in India and China, Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions all perform particularly well in Asia with strong growth and momentum throughout 2021. IFF achieved 11% growth in Latin America region with double-digit growth across nearly all countries. Our Nourish division delivered strong double digit growth with health and bioscience and Scent businesses growing in the high single digits. Our EMEA also delivered strong sales results with 9% sales growth driven by the double-digit growth in fine fragrance business. EMEA was also bolted by strengths in our Nourish business. We saw significant growth led by food service. Moving now to Slide eight, I would like to discuss our sales performance across IFF business segments that contributed to our overall storm growth for the year. For the full year, Nourish achieve currency neutral sales growth of 9% was broad based strengths in our flavors, ingredients and food design businesses. Health and Biosciences delivered 6% currency neutral growth in 2021, primarily driven by strong performance and home and personal care, animal attrition and culture and food enzymes. Scent also delivered strong 8% currency neutral growth led by fine fragrance, consumer fragrance and ingredients. Pharma solution achieved 2% currency neutral growth driven by demand in our industrial business, while we continue to see headwinds related to ongoing limited material availability and logistical constraints. Now on to Slide nine, I would like to focus on the underlying dynamics driving segment perform. For Nourish, consistent strong performance included double digit growth in ingredients while our margins were impacted by our costs of raw materials, EBITDA increased 8% from strong volume growth, pricing actions and a continued focus on cost management. In Health and Bioscience, strong growth and home and personal care aim processing and cultures and food en enzymes were key drivers. Higher costs for raw materials and logistic remain a challenge which is adjusted operating EBITDA margin of 26.8% in the segment. Our Scent division benefited by particular, strongly rebound from last year in fine fragrances. In addition to continued solar performance and consumer fragrances and double-digital growth across cosmetic actives. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew 11% as margin expanded 30 Bps led by volume growth, favorable mix and higher productivity and finally, in pharma solutions, we saw significant customer demand and double-digit growth in the segment's industrial business. Global supply chain issues however, remained an overhang for 2021 margin performance. Moving now to Slide 10, I'm very pleased to share that our full year sales result exceeded pre-COVID levels, which is particularly encouraging for the year ahead. As previously outlined, sales goals was consistent across our business segments, reflecting the strengths and resilience of our extended portfolio and IFF's position as an essential partner for customers in critical industries around the world. It is clear that IFF continues to deliver enhanced value to our customers as a result of our merger with N&B and the work we are doing to strategically integrate our businesses and focus on execution. Simply put, we are a stronger business today and our customers recognize the unique value we bring as a trusted innovation partner. Let's move to Slide 11. I would like to reiterate our strong progress to deliver synergies and connection with the N&B combination. In 2021, we exceeded our year one target of $45 million to deliver approximately $60 million in cost savings. This includes approximately $20 million in savings in the fourth quarter. Revenue synergies also were a modest contribution to top line performance with a projected pipeline continuing to develop. Execution and operating discipline remain the top priority for our leadership team and I'm pleased to see results that reflect this commitment. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn. Thank you, Glenn. IFF's transformation has been deeply personal to me, and I know that this company is stronger today than it has ever been. I am proud of the solid year we had in 2021 with significant year over year sales and profit growth, as well as steady progress towards our integration with N&B. So all my time at IFF, I've been consistently impressed by the thousands of employees who have dedicated their time and talent to make our company, the category defining leader it is today. I want to thank them for their contributions over this year and the time I have led the company and also for that passion about IFF and the commitment to our customers. The path ahead for the company and its new leadership team is clear. I'm confident that IFF enters its next chapter with the right team at best in class portfolio, innovative spirit, significant financial flexibility and a unified sense of purpose to drive long term growth and benefit our shareholders, employees, customers and communities. With that. I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Yeah. good morning, Gunther. Thanks for the question. Your two questions are highly related because relative to the top line, we'd say the variable that's likely to be the bigger indicator of the range is we're going to be more volume than price. If anything, frankly, we feel very good about what we've implemented from price what's coming through. If there's additional inflationary price pressures, we may in fact push additional pricing, but volume to some extent, I think is the bigger question mark for us. We had a 2% to 3% assumption relative to volumes. That's probably a point lower than historically the market from a standpoint and that will probably drive the difference in terms of the top line. To your second question, we've actually have not seen much elasticity. i.e. as you know yourself sort of amp  up on the consumer product companies have been releasing recently, those volumes generally have been sticking in the market. We have one month by the way, the month of January results, generally volumes are sort of holding  in their Q4. So we're not seeing sort of a drop yet. That being said, when we put the plan together, recognizing this is going to be a very abnormal year, given the sheer degree of pricing, we got it prudent to plan accordingly and we actually expect, and what we've seen from an awful lot of our competitors is everybody is basically implementing the same range of pricing in the market. Sure. Great question, Mark. The reality is we're well into midstream on pricing actions. We signal in our third quarter call with heavy inflation on the horizon, we react as a very quickly. So we spent the latter part of the fourth quarter and then sort of every working day this year of executing broad based pricing across the entire customer base. That actually has been quite effective. So based on the read of that i.e., we've implemented most of that pricing already, which will kick in largely over the first and second quarter. It appears to be sticking. We also know from observing our competitors, as they're under similar inflationary pressures, we're all sort of seeing the same thing and they're also are passing pricing through. So we feel like we're sort of neck to neck in terms of what we're doing in the market. We are being surgical. There are certain category is that are slightly more elastic or price competitive, if you will and are being thoughtful about sort of where we price and there are other areas that typically are less of elastic, they also are passing pricing through.  So we feel like we're sort of neck-to-neck in terms of what we're doing in the market. We are being surgical. There are certain categories that are slightly more elastic or price competitive, if you will and are being thoughtful about sort of where we price. And there are other areas that typically are less of elastic for a host of, and sort of making sure that we sort of price appropriate in those segments. But we do believe that -- actually more than believe, we've seen it. A lot of our pricing is in fact now and being implemented over the coming months. And, we have not seen, as I mentioned, a big significant change in terms of volumes and the amount of customers that we've lost has been relatively small, directly related to our pricing actions. We're relative to the longer term, as we mentioned on the script, we had about $400 million of inflation last year. We anticipated about $600 million, so in all, in a billion dollars, between the two years. We implemented $200 million last and we're planning on matching the $600 million this year. So we're still $200 million short. We do fully anticipate to capture that additional $200 million as we move into 2023. And very importantly, the market continues to ebb and flow. Although we haven't seen a lot of movement on raw materials recently, there's been some ups and downs, but are prepared to react. And if they're additional inflationary pressures, we're, we're positioned to go to the market very rapidly. I think it, it is a -- it is the question in some sense, how do we think about our longer term goals? Obviously Frank joins us next week and we will be working very aggressively over the coming months to review our longer term targets. That being said, I would say two things certainly going from '25, '26 to call it 32, 33; it's a big number for next year. As you pointed out, I think we have a clear line of sight to $200 million of incremental pricing at least another a hundred million of synergy productivity. I actually would hope for more, quite frankly, but we have a hundred million left on the extent synergy side that gets us directionally to 2285 to 29 range from the standpoint. So we're getting to close the gap, but there's still a gap there. And we have work to figure that out. I think on a qualitative basis I am optimistic there's lot year because of the operating environment has been very challenging. And again, he would, would've anticipated the level of inflation and what we had to deal with on top of that, the global supply chain issues, but we do feel a combination of the strength of the platform in terms of revenue opportunities for growth. And in addition, the more I time I spend here, the more I'm convinced that there are meaningful opportunities to enhance our overall performance in terms of productivity and operating margin. So I, until Frank has arrives and we sort of go through that very detailed process, we can't provide a number. But there's a clear line to call it 2829 next year, based on pricing and productivity. And I think we have additional opportunities on top of that. The basket has changed actually with the combination of NMB. It's actually slightly more U.S based. Then it is non-US based. Roughly around 50% of our revenues are U.S dollar denominated, about 25% are, are Euro, and then a, a range of currencies for the residual from a an earnings perspective while the Euro's 25% in revenues. It's about 20% in terms of our earnings. From a cash flow standpoint, because we have a higher cost base that European denominated. So, it is a significant portion. It's the one, that's what we focused on from a risk standpoint. As you know, the Euro dropped from circle 118 on average, last year, it's been in sort the 113, 114 range. We were planning a 113, so that's how we sort of think about the year. Yeah, sure. Adam, thanks. Thanks for the question. Relative to the synergies we identified as reminder, we did $60.21 million. Our commitment was to get to $180 million this year and to ramp up to $300 million. We're actually going to be short of that. We're actually posting another $90 million this year. I would note that our total productivity basket is $200 million. So we're thinking more broadly than just synergies, frankly, a year past the deal. It's important that we just figure out how to cut costs across the enterprise, as opposed to just focus on the narrow combination areas. Now of that shortfall, if you will, this year, it's all in the procurement arena, just given what's going on global supply chain. Wasn't realistic to sort of count on the synergy impact. So 60 plus -- plus the 90 gets us basically to the 150, and as I mentioned, I'm fully confident we're going to get the residual 150 and synergies to other areas and we'll continue to focus on productivity above that. So if you think about the carry over to next year between pricing of $200 million and then another 150 that's how you get to the 28 of the 29 from sort of a carryover standpoint into '23. Yeah. it's a great question. We have some more work to do to figure out sort of where we're going to be longer term relative to cash generation. We're going to be actually making slightly higher investments in two areas this year. I think net of these investments will be sort of about equal on a cash flow basis. One is we're going to be adding inventories building, I should say, inventories of about $300 million. As a reminder, when the deal was closed a year ago, we were at artificially low inventory levels, about 111 days. This historically the combined entity was in the 1 25 range. We built some of that back at the end of the year. We were, but we're still sort of short of where we need to be. The second thing is our CapEx spending will increase this year as well, relative to last year. Those increases are twofold. We ended the year less than $400 million. Some of the CapEx we were unable to implement last year that was a by-product of suppliers, basically being delayed in terms of supplying steel and other products. And in addition, just we operate in COVID environment. So the speed at which we're able to implement the load as well. So we're ramping up. We're also ramping up simply to address some capacity constraints, supply chain, which will actually achieve, help achieve higher demand levels as well as lower costs on the logistics side. So net, there is about a combination of $500 million increase between inventories and higher CapEx year-over-year, but the overall cash-flow apart from the business would be felt relatively neutral, after that's done. Longer term, as I mentioned previously, we, really have some work to do, to think about our longer term sort of goals relative to the cash generation of the enterprise. Sure. Thanks. Thanks for the question. In general, as I mentioned, we haven't seen much of volume drop off relative to our pricing action. So there are certain categories that are slightly more competitive, but in the environment where demand is still relatively high, we've been able to push through pricing. So there, there nowhere have we seen sort of great pockets of sort of softness across any of the businesses? That's point one. Point two, there is a lag, and that's why there, the $200 million will kick in late this year and roll into next year from an overlap standpoint. And there's too reason for that, that there's contractual relationships that despite actually in this environment, it's been easier to open up renegotiations to the level inflation. It takes time to renegotiate and put it in place. So just a timing element and then some of the contracts are more indices based or tied to certain indexes that certified as well. So recall we had $400 million last year, so we're, we're basically implementing all that. And then we have another $600 million to catch up. So at that billion, we will catch up $800 million of it within literally sort of five. And then we will kick into the residual into '23, which is right in that same window sort 18 months, thinking that sort of for implementation. I, think we have been appropriately prudent in our planning process, given the sheer level of pricing that we have in the plan. We didn't want to sort of sort of push the envelope if you will, from a volume standpoint. As I mentioned previously, it's going to depend upon the consumer certainly in the very, very early days of the year. That seems to be holding up. But we have a lot of year ahead of us, as well. From a capacity standpoint as we've mentioned in the past, we are making very meaningful investments, a combination of CapEx, as well as inventory, to allow us to address some of the legacy issues we had last year. Those issues were principally and legacy N&B businesses that will feel better about having the capacity to meet and if it continues. But it's largely a function of just being prudent in this sort of a very, very unprecedented market from the planning standpoint. Yeah, let me I'll answer the second question really, just to give you some perspective on margin, sort of the margin change year over year progression through the year. So that reflects sort of the combination of the inflation and the pricing, the action, interestingly, it enough because we've been in two years of COVID it's difficult to look at any of the businesses on a given quarter and it's better to look on a two year or normalized basis. And when you, that actually the range relative to the currency neutral results of our businesses actually tightened up quite a bit. And they come very close together. So as it relates to this year from our planning standpoint, we don't have big differences planned per se, across our different business units. There much more tighter distribution in volume in part because we have a two to 3% volume in general. And in part, because we think we're opinion more normalized environment, and some of the capacity issues are also being effectively addressed. So we don't expect to have a, a wide range of impact. A wide range of differences between the businesses as relates to volumes from a pro on the pricing actions and the inflation and how we're offsetting that we do expect that the first half principally the first quarter will be the most challenged. We expect that the first quarter is likely to have margin down year of year, a little over 300 basis points. We expect that that will soft into around 150ish in the second quarter. And then in the back half of the year, we'll basically be up to get to the full year. The full year guidance is sort of directionally down 80 basis points year over year from a combination. So that, basically is a reflection of how we see the, sort of the, the pricings, the pricing kicking in relative to the inflation. Yeah. Good question. So maybe Andres going to add a little bit more on the revenue synergy, right? We feel very good about the longer term prospects on revenue synergies. We admit that we're behind, we, we basically are not on the original plan relative to the timing and for the pace of the revenue synergies. That in our view is simply a function of how we spent the last year. The last year because of the nature of supply chain issues inflation issues. We ended up dedicating resources more to the here and now from the standpoint. It's actually also allowed this for our commercial teams, our R&D teams to basically spend more time working together and a byproduct of that. We do feel like there's a very strong pipeline of opportunities going forward. So I very -- you will see basically the majority of the opportunities within our no division because by the nature of the products and the customer, it just goes very nicely together. If you just take all the plant based protein products where basically can, can offer almost a total solution on in many, many cases, even a total solution to our customers, so that that's one example. The other example is, and we had just one of the big customer meetings on, on the American cleaning Institute, Congress, this this month's where you see that the enzyme business for household care products and the fragrance business are going hand in hand. So these are certainly the biggest opportunities for us going forward and then something which we should not underestimate is that we have opportunities on the R&D side as well. And I give you just one very concrete example. Everybody is looking now for these the capsules for you put the fragrance into detergent and to produce a green capsule. And now with our enhanced capabilities, we have many more programs running to come up with really good solutions. They're already in generation two and three, and that is a synergy by themselves as, as well on the R&D area, which probably takes a little bit more time. And then Glenn, you should comment on the portfolio. Yeah. Thank you very much for the participation and, and the good questions and taking preparation. That's my last IFF meeting here. Thank you for all the good and constructive work and have a good day. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you, Andreas and welcome everyone. Thank you again for being with us today. As Andreas highlighted, 2021 was a strong year for sales growth, including a strong fourth quarter finish. Looking more closely at our consolidated fourth quarter results, IFF generated greater than $3 billion in sales representing a 10% year over year increase on a currency mutual basis, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Health and Biosciences division, as well as high single digit growth across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma divisions. As with our full year results, our fourth quarter margin performance continued to face inflationary pressures, much like our entire industry, which offset positive volume growth, solid price increases, and the benefits of synergies and productivity. Early in the fourth quarter, we recognized a significant escalation in inflationary pressures and as a result, we quickly mobilized to prepare to implement significant pricing actions across all businesses to protect overall profitability. I'll discuss these actions as well as our efforts to accelerate productivity and operational excellence when I discuss our 2022 outlook. On the next several slides, I will briefly dive deeper into the fourth quarter financials of each of our core business segments. Turning to Slide 13, I'll begin with our Nourish segment, which experienced both a solid quarter and overall performance in 2021. In the fourth quarter, Nourish achieved 9% year-over-year sales growth on a currency neutral basis, driven by strong volume growth and price increases. Our Flavors business in particular realized strong growth with increased sales across all regions. Ingredients grew by strong double digits to increasing customer demand and both food design and food service also drove growth for Nourish in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating EBITDA declined slightly due to inflationary pressures. Pressure on profitability occured despite strong volume growth, increased productivity and strategic price increases in the segment. On Slide 14, our Health and Biosciences division delivered fourth quarter year-over-year sales growth of 13% on a currency neutral basis led by double digit growth in health, microbial control, animal nutrition and grain processing. Additionally, cultures and food enzymes and home and personal care each grew at a high single digits against strong year-over-year comparisons. Our adjusted operating EBITDA increased 4% due to volume growth and higher productivity, while margins faced pressure due to inflation and higher logistics cost. Turning now to Slide 15, our Scent division continued to perform well and achieved strong growth in the fourth quarter, delivering 6% year-over-year growth or 7% growth on a currency neutral basis. This performance was supported by a continued rebound in fine fragrances, which saw double digit growth driven by new wins and increased volume. Our Consumer Fragrances category delivered single digit growth against a strong high single digit year ago comparison. The ingredients business continues to contribute to the success of the overall segment with double digit growth in fragrance ingredients. Despite solid volume growth and favorable mix in the business, scent adjusted operating EBITDA growth was affected by higher cost of raw materials, which we continue to take action to mitigate. On Slide 16, our Performance Solutions segment delivered year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth of 9% from 2020 as a result of volume strength and price increases. Both our core pharma and industrial categories contribute to our strong performance in the quarter. Performance Solutions adjusted operating EBITDA and margin was also impacted by higher raw material and energy costs. We recognize the challenges the segment is experiencing due to the current market environment in macro supply chain constraints and are optimistic that as the global situation recovers, we will recognize the full potential of Pharma Solutions. Now on Slide 17, I would like to review our cash flow position and progress in de leveraging. For the full year 2021, we delivered strong cash of over $1 billion and our on track to meet our de leveraging goals. 2021, CapEx was $393 million or approximately 3.4% of sales as we made strategic investments in the most attractive segments of our portfolio. Overall, our capital expenditures were lower than originally planned in part due to slower implementation of projects due to some vendor delays and a continued of the COVID environment. We also paid out $667 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2021. From a leverage perspective, we continued to make substantial progress toward achieving our deleveraging target, finishing 2021 with $4.1, net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio. IFF reduced gross debt by $124 million to $11.4 billion versus Q3 and we finished 2021 with cash and cash equivalence of $716 million. We remain competent that IFF is on track to achieve our deleveraging target of three times net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA by year three, post close, further supported by additional divestitures that I will touch on in a moment. Turning to slide 18, I'd like to provide commentary on our business outlook for 2022. For fiscal year 2022, we expect revenue between $12.3 billion and $12.7 billion with adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We also are forecasting foreign exchange rates will be a headwind in 2022, approximately two percentage point headwind to our revenue and a four percentage point headwind to adjusted operating EBITDA in '22. As you are all well aware, we continue to operate in a complex market environment with ongoing uncertainties from pandemic, global political tensions and supply chain challenges, IFF, and our industry at large have been impacted by these issues and we expect and have planned for that these challenges will remain into 2022. As I shared on our third quarter call, we expect inflationary pressures to be significant in 2022, as we see large cost increases in raw materials, energy and logistics. As a result, we are taking significant pricing actions to fully offset our dollar cost exposure, which we expect will result in strong sales and profit growth, but will depress margin. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to recover margin to pre-inflation levels as we are focused on improving returns to generate strong value creation for our shareholders. We also remain intently focused on driving cost reductions through synergies and increased productivity efforts throughout our business. In addition, we are increasing CapEx in 2022 to approximately 5% of sales as a result of '21 CapEx carryover and increased investments to the passive expansion in key technologies, which will help support growth while also lowering logistics costs. Finally, we will also be increasing inventory by approximately $300 million to more appropriate levels to ensure we can continue to serve our customers. Now moving to Slide 19, I would like to focus more specifically on the cost inflation trends that we saw in '21 and now forecasts to see in '22. Heading into 2022, we expect certain costs, including raw materials, energy and logistics will continue to rise much as they did in '21. Overall, we expect '22 cost increases to be double digits, call it approximately 10%. We are seeing most of these increases related to inflation in raw materials with double digit increases in  oils, cellulose, pulp, turpentine, aroma chemicals, petrochemicals, fragrance specialty chemicals, savory ingredients, specialty chemicals, agriculture, grains and sweeteners. The inflationary pressures manifest themselves differently between the legacy N&B and IFF businesses. Most of the higher energy and logistics cost in '22 are related to legacy N&B. With added capacity coming online later this year, we hope to start to mitigate some of the logistics headwinds we have been facing due to an imbalance in supply and demand. If you look at legacy IFF portfolio, we are seeing high single digit raw material inflation similar to our flavor and fragrance peers. Recognizing these challenges, we have been aggressively pursuing broad based pricing actions and accelerating synergy and productivity efforts. Turning to Slide 20, I will provide a bit more insight into our sales guidance for 2022. Our $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion sales expectation represents continued momentum on top of our strong to 2021 results. To get a more comparable revenue basis, you must add back approximately $500 million of sales related to N&B in January of 2021 as N&B results were not part of IFF until February 01 of 2021. Our sales guidance also accounts for the removal of June to December '21 revenue results following the anticipated completed sale of our microbial control business, as well as the first nine months of '21 sales for their fruit prep divestiture which we closed in October of last year. That gets you to our comparable '21 revenue base of $11.85 billion as indicated on the slide. As I said earlier, we are significantly increasing our prices in order to fully offset the dollar cost exposure of our inflation for 2022. With that in mind, we anticipate pricing to be significantly larger contributor to the top line in '22. This pricing impact plus more months volume growth following a strong '21 will be central to our overall sales performance in '22, where we expect to grow approximately 6% to 9% year over year on a comparable currency neutral basis. Now, in terms of our guidance on the adjusted operating front, we also had to make adjustments for comparability. If you add that EBITDA related to N&B general results and subtract the EBITDA related to seven months of EBITDA as a result of the anticipated divetiture of our microbial control business, as well as the EBITDA related to the fruit prep business for the first nine months of '21, you get to a comparable '21 base of approximately $2.5 billion. As mentioned implementing broad base pricing actions to offset inflationary pressures is critical to our '22 plan. Over the last three plus month, each of our business has executed pricing actions across essentially our entire customer base. As a result, we anticipate to completely offset projected '22 install pressures with pricing actions. The majority of these actions will be implemented in the first and second quarter. I would also note that we anticipate that 2023 will benefit from an additional $200 million of net pricing benefit due to the full annualization of our pricing actions, which will be equal to a 100% capture of the combined 2021 and 2022 inflation impact on our business. Importantly, we also continue to closely monitor the global supply chain environment and will be prepared to execute additional price actions as appropriate. By adding anticipated volume leverage plus synergies and productivity, we expect comparable EBITDA growth in '22 to be strong, up approximately 4% to 8%. It should be noted that the synergy and productivity contribution here is a net number where it is a combination of the benefits of synergy and productivity, net of cost of living increases and reinvestments in the business. Our guidance implies that our adjusted operating EBITDA margin will be down modestly versus '21, principally due to our net dollar cost recovery, which equates to approximately 100 basis points. Over the course of '21 and '22, we will see more than $1 billion of total inflation and while we are working rapidly to cover the price increases, it has impacted margins significantly. To give you a perspective of the magnitude, our margin for full year '22 on an inflation adjusted basis will be approximately 300 basis points higher or approximately 23.5%. In terms of marching cadence throughout '22, we expect the first half to be down year over year with expansion coming in the second half. While sales are expected to be strong in the first quarter, year-over-year adjusted operating EBITDA margin performance will be the most challenged of the year down over 300 basis points versus our reported first quarter 2021 margin with each quarter after that concluding. Much of this will be driven by price to total inflation, where we expect to turn positive starting the third quarter. As I conclude, I want to highlight our four key areas of focus for '22 and provide further color into our detailed execution plans for each. First, we are committed to building on our strong '21 sales momentum. Our 6% to 9% targeted '22 currency neutral sales growth anticipates that we will continue to maintain volume growth consistent with overall industry growth rates. We believe that our exceptional R&D pipeline and scaled global commercial teams including targeted '22 investments will allow us to continue to deliver superior customer solutions and support strong growth. In addition, as I mentioned previously, we are making substantial investments to increase capacity across constrained portions of our portfolio and enhancing supply chain efficiencies. Lastly, we'll be sharpening our focus on our revenue synergy opportunities as we are behind our original planned pace, as much of last year was focused on addressing near term supply chain issues. That said, we are confident that the breadth and depth of our platform will allow us to build meaningful revenue synergies over time. Second, as previously outlined, we are intently focused on broad based pricing actions to offset inflation. And importantly, as the macro environment involves, we are prepared to quickly execute additional pricing actions throughout the year as needed. To enhance our ability to react more quickly to the dynamic environment over the last several months, we have undertaken a comprehensive end to end review of our procurement processes, implemented new pricing tools and established core pricing teams for each one of our businesses. Our focus has been to compress the time between inflation signals and customer pricing actions, ensuring we optimize product segment and customer specific pricing actions and closely monitor the level and pace of pricing utilization. Going forward, we are focused on further enhancing our procurement processes and pricing programs. Third, we are determined to accelerate our synergy realization and more broadly our productivity efforts in 2022. For your reference, included in our '22 guidance, we are targeting approximately $200 million of cost reductions from synergies, yield enhancements and reformulations, logistic efficiencies and other operational improvements. Net of wage inflationary pressures and targeted investments to help drive top line growth. we are targeting net cost efficiencies of approximately a $100 million for the year. While we feel this is good progress, we also recognize that there is more work to do. Consequently, in addition to the end to end review of procurement, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of our global manufacturing and logistics platform, constructing a plan to accelerate the scope and scale of our global shared service capabilities and developing a detailed technology and digital integrated roadmap all with the goal of driving meaningful efficiencies, while also ensuring we provide superior customer solutions and service. Fourth, we are actively working to accelerate our non-core divestitures. As we have discussed, we are on track to successfully complete the sale of our Microbial Control business, which will enhance the efficiency and profitability of our portfolio. We're also targeting additional portfolio optimization to further deliver our balance sheet and focus on core growth opportunities. Over the coming quarters, we will proceed with marketing a handful of nonstrategic businesses, call it three or four, where we believe that over the next 18 months, we can generate expected proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Similar to our fruit prep and Microbial Control business, these are non-strategic and the transactions will be accretive to our go-forward growth rate and margin profile. With this action plan together with our current sales momentum and strength, our leading portfolio, I am confident that IFF will deliver strong results in 2022. With that, I would like to turn the call back to Andreas. Yeah, a great question on portfolio, as I mentioned in my comments, and I think we've done a very, very good job of being thoughtful about non-core businesses. Non-Core those that basically are sort of diluted for our top line and bottom line, and just simply strategically don't have a great fit. As you know, we have sold through prep. We will be closing the second quarter on microbial controls. That's basically $1.4 billion gross. We have three or four other businesses that are being teed up. We will be going to market in the coming months quarters. We fully anticipate to have them executed. I need transactions close in the cash in within 18 months. We think that range is $1.5 billion to 1.7 billion relative to the three to four entities and very importantly, our goal is to use those proceeds to get us to the three times or lower laborer issues. So that actually been working very well; we had a dedicated set of teams to do nothing, but sort of focus on that to get that done markets have been good in relative to interest in, in certain properties. So we're very encouraged by that."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call.  . Participants will be announced by their name and Company. In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of 1 question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael Deveau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2021 conference call. Yesterday, we issued a press release announcing our third quarter financial results and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the Company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty.  For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in yesterday's press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our website. Please also note that we will be using combined historical results for the Third Quarter defined as 3 months of legacy IFF results, and 3 months N&B results.  And for 9 months year-to-date, defined as 9 months of legacy IFF, January to September, and 8 months of N&B, February to September in both the 2020 and 2021 periods to allow for comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1st, 2021. With me in the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig and our recently appointed Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin today's call with our prepared remarks, and then we'll take any questions that you may have at the end. I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. And I thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our performance results, I would like to take a moment to thank all of our dedicated colleagues throughout the world, who have continued to work tirelessly in a challenging environment to fuel the global consumer goods supply chain and meet our customer\u2019s needs. I can't thank each and every one of you enough for your hard work, dedication, and focus. I also want to take a moment and welcome Glenn Richter, who is joining us on today's call for the first time.  As you know, Glenn joined us a little over a month ago as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'm sure you will all find that his experience aligns perfectly with our strategic goals, making him an incredible asset to our team. I also want to thank Rustom for his leadership and contributions during his time as IFF's CFO. Rustom played an important role in our combination with  N&B, and for that we are immensely grateful. He has been important putting IFF in the strong position it is today. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors. On today's call, I will begin by providing an overview of year-to - date performance, including the progress we have made so far on our integration.  I will then turn it over to Glenn (ph) who will provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results. Before we conclude today's call with a question-and-answer session, Glenn (ph) will also speak to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Now, as I mentioned, I'd like to kick us off on Slide 6 by discussing our financial highlights for the first 9 months of 2021. Throughout the third quarter, we remained laser focused on extending the momentum IFF established in the first half of 2021. In the first 9 months of 2021, IFF achieved $8.6 billion in sales, representing 10% growth with 7% on currency-neutral basis.  A strong reflection of the strength of our market-leading platform, and the compelling position we have established with our customers as a combined Company. We delivered a 22% adjusted operating EBITDA margin and a combined EBITDA growth of 5%. As we will discuss in more detail, we continue to confirm meaningful inflationary pressure due to higher raw material, logistic, and energy costs. We have maintained our robust cost discipline efforts and are entering the fourth quarter with continued financial strengths, having achieved $884 million free cash flow or approximately 10% of our trailing 9 months sales, driven by strong cash generation.  This cash generation has enabled us to stay on track to meeting our deleveraging target. Finally, as I've mentioned in previous quarters, continued refinement and optimization of our portfolio is a critical component of our ongoing integration efforts. I am pleased to share that we have completed divestiture of our food preparation business, and are on track to complete the divestiture of all Microbial Control business in the second quarter of 2022. Together, these 2 important divestitures will create a more focused IFF, allowing us to hone in on the constraints of our core business segments and create a stronger, more-focused business.  We will continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio as we move forward with our integration, looking for opportunities to rapidly divest in other non-core businesses. We started this year with a simple commitment, to focus on execution and deliver on the potential of the new IFF. I'm pleased to say that even in a very challenging global environment, our team has met our integration objectives by delivering strong results with continued sales momentum and profit growth.  Now, turning to Slide 7, I'd like to walk you through some of the regional sales dynamics underpinning our results for the last 9 months. First, I'm excited to share that we continue to experience strong growth in all 4 of our key operating regions despite ongoing and unique market uncertainties that have persisted across each geography. In North America, we achieved 7% growth across all 4 of IFF's business divisions, led by high-single-digit growth in Nourish and Scent. These 2 divisions have continued to perform exceptionally well quarter after quarter.  In Asia, we experienced a 7% increase in sales led by continued double-digit growth in India, as well as a low single digit growth in China, even in it's particularly strong recent market complexities in the region. From a business unit perspective, Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions continued to carry the region's growth throughout the year to-date. Latin America continues to be our strongest performing region and sales growth leader, having achieved 12% growth largely fueled by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and continued local currency strengths.  Perhaps, most impressive is a 7% sales growth at our EMEA region achieved to date, which includes a robust double-digit increase in the third quarter and prices performance on our Scent and Norridge divisions stock. This encouraging rebound, with Scent delivering double-digit growth led by our client fragrance business, and Norridge delivering high single-digit growth, led by our food service business. We expect this momentum to continue through the remainder of the year and we will stay diligent to ensure our business remain nimble, positioned to perform against any new supply chain challenges that may arise.  Moving now to Slide 8, I'd like to take a closer look at our 9 months year-to-date sales performance across our key business segments. Our largest division, Nourish, has been a strong performer throughout the year, achieving currency-neutral sales growth of 9% with broad-based strength from all flavors, ingredients, and food design businesses. Scent has had a similar strong year delivering 8% in currency-neutral gross to date led by impressive double-digit growth in fine fragrance, as well as strong growth in Consumer Fragrance and ingredients. Health & Bioscience has seen strong demand in key focus areas, including Home and Personal Care, animal nutrition, and  food enzymes.  As you know, we are in the process of selling our microbial control unit, which has continued to experience headwinds through this year, but has rebounded from COVID impacted loss with growth in both Q2 and Q3. This divestiture should further enhance the performance of this important division. Pharma Solutions, despite significant challenges, is flat so far for the year. Supply chain challenges have had an outsized impact on this divisions throughout the year. While we have seen encouraging growth in our industrial business, the division still struggles to meet customer demand due to all mature availability challenges and logistics issues.  Now on slide 9, you will see that we have outlined some of the factors influencing the gross profitability of each of our 4 divisions so far this year. As I previously mentioned, Nourish had had a strong year with Flavors & Ingredients experiencing double-digit growth. We have been working hard in our execution to manage the volume and costs to limit margin impact from higher raw material costs, which continue to be a headwind on our profitability. While we have seen some margin impact of about 20 basis points in the year, we are proud of how our execution has mitigated much of the negative headwinds while delivering meaningful growth.  Our team has done an exceptional job increasing prices to combat inflationary pressures, something that will continue to be critical as we move forward. At Health & Biosciences, we mentioned broad-based growth across the markets. But here we are seeing significant margin impact from higher logistic costs. As shared on our second quarter call, part of this that freight rates have increased significantly, but also, we have -- having higher logistic costs to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth. Investing in R&D and Plant technology to increase output later this year and into 2022.  The Scent division is certainly realized the strongest all-around bounce back as consumer demand rises across end markets. Notably, Fine Fragrances alone as realized, 36% growth year-to-date was double-digit growth in cosmetic active, and continued solid performance in Consumer Fragrances. At the time, since profitability expansion of a 110 basis points has been led by higher volume, favorable mix, and higher productivity. As I mentioned, Pharma Solutions was the only division in which we did not experience sales growth due to continued global supply chain challenges that have impacted our ability to meet strong customer demands.  These challenges, including supply and logistic constraints and ongoing inflation, have in turn, significantly pressured our margin compared to the first 9 months of 2020. Moving through the fourth quarter and entering 2022, we will be closely tracking supply chain dynamics and will continue to prioritize returning our Pharma Solutions business to the profitability we know is achievable. And in the fourth quarter, we're expecting year-over-year, top and bottom-line performance to improve. As we have been talking about today, IFF is realizing very strong sales momentum across our business.  This is a reflection of a powerful new position we have created through our combination with the N&B business, and the compelling value proposition we can offer to our customers. While we are pleased to put many of the gross hesitance relates to the pandemic behind us, it is important to understand that our growth this year, is in fact meaningful above pre-pandemic results. If you look at the total business, you will see that on a comparable 9 months proforma basis, the new IFF has realized 9% sales growth over 2019 results. This strength is broad-based to each segment is realizing strong rose above pre-pandemic levels.  Nourish as a business that was particularly hard hits with the pandemic involves strongly growing with sales growth of 9% compared to performance 2019 in 9 months period. And for important, especially given that much of the integration work is coming from within this division. These results showcase how acquisition in the market has been fundamentally strengthened through the merger and how our teams are delivering the full potential of IFF to our customers. Moving to slide 11, I would like to discuss a strong progress we have made in terms of synergy realization.  For just 9 months since completing our merger with N&B, our synergy progress reaffirms the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us as a combined Company. Having received significant and highly encouraging positive feedback from our customers, along with persistent robust customer demands, we are confident in our ability to meet our revenue target. To date, revenue synergies have started to contribute to our top-line performance and we are pleased that our project pipeline is strong and growing. The first 9 months of 2021, we've achieved approximately $40 million in cost synergies, representing nearly 90% of our 2021 cost synergy target was 1 quarter to go.  This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings programs we have implemented, where we are leveraging our increased scale and optimizing on our organization. I'm confident that we will more than exceed our $45 million year-one synergy target. And I'm encouraged by the continued progress we're making towards achieving our three-year run rate of cost synergy target of $300 million. Now, before I turn the call over to Glenn (ph), I want to spend a second to really underscore what he brings to us here at IFF. His background is perfect, but there are 2 areas I think really standout.  First, he brings a tremendous  was private and public companies and leading finance teams to enhance discipline and built processes that drive towards a goal of shareholder value creation. He has time and time again shown an ability to help businesses accelerate top-line growth while driving margin expansion. In this way, he consistently implements productivity initiatives with lasting impact. Second, he has been through several large-scale M&A integrations with a track record of strong success. As we continue to execute on our multi-year transformational integration, this experience is invaluable. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn (ph).\nGlenn Richter: Thank you for the warm welcome, Andreas, and good morning, afternoon and evening to everyone. Since joining IFF in late September, I've had the opportunity to briefly meet many in our investor community. And the most common questions I've been asked is why did I join IFF? And what are my near-term priorities? Consequently, before I review our financial results, I thought it would be helpful to briefly provide these perspectives as an introduction. There were 3 very compelling reasons for me to join IFF. First and perhaps most importantly, IFF is a Company that is truly making a difference in helping solve some of the world's biggest challenges.  We're delivering reliable, innovative, and sustainable solutions that are directly helping address issues such as improved nutrition and wellness, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating a more sustainable environment. Second, the industry has very attractive organic growth characteristics benefitting from continued strong consumer tailwinds. From increased consumer focus on wellness and natural and sustainable products, increased demand in emerging markets, and new consumer needs presented by aging demographics in developed markets. I also believe that scale will become an important basis of competitive advantage. As customers demand leading ESG platforms, increased innovation and speed-to-market, global supply chain resiliency and help in navigating increasingly complex regulations.  Third, I firmly believe that the combination of IFF with DuPont's legacy N&B business has uniquely created an industry leading platform. And since joining IFF, I've tried to immersed myself in the business completely. Visiting sites, meeting with our business and operations teams, and spending time at our R&D in creative centers. I've also prioritized hearing from you, our investors and analysts and frankly, today I'm even more bullish on the strength of IFF 's global capabilities and the tremendous long-term potential we have to drive strong top and bottom-line growth.  Relative to my near-term priorities, I have 4 primary areas of focus. By far, our most pressing priority is to tackle the challenges from the global inflationary environment and to successfully execute broad-based pricing actions across all of our businesses. Second, I'm also focused on enhancing our core financial processes and metrics, including better forecasting, improved business-level return metrics, and tighter disciplines for our investment decisions, so that we're maximizing our growth potential and return on invested capital.  A third area of focus is ensuring we fully deliver on our merger synergies, while also accelerating our focus on sustainable productivity. And finally, while we have made very good progress to date on our portfolio optimization, there is significant opportunity remaining. In the days and months ahead, I look forward to learning even more about this organization and engaging with all of you. With that, I'd now like to provide an overview of our consolidated third quarter results.  In Q3, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 12% year-over-year increase, primarily driven by the continued double-digit growth in our Nourish division, and strong increases in both Scents and Health & Biosciences. In terms of contribution, volume performance was the primary driver of our growth. As pricing represented approximately 2% points in the quarter. So, our gross margin continued to be challenged by inflationary pressures.  It was somewhat offset by our strong cost management focus, which resulted in adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 4%. While we had solid year-over-year EBITDA growth, our gross margin was down by 210 basis points, as our pricing actions recovered only about 65% of our raw material increases, or approximately 50% in the third quarter when we include raw material, logistics, and energy, increases. As we move forward, we are squarely focused on improving this recovery rate relative to the total inflationary basis. But expect that in the short term, specifically the fourth quarter, we will see a similar pressure given the time lag of price realization.  Let me finish on this slide by saying that we achieved strong earnings per share, excluding amortization of a $1.47. On the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the third quarter financial results for each of our 4 divisions. Turning to slide 13, I'll start with our Nourish division, which had an exceptional quarter. In Q3, Nourish achieved 17% year-over-year sales growth, or 15% on a currency neutral basis. Driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors for the second consecutive quarter. Ingredients also grew double-digits with all subcategories, protein solutions, pectin and seaweed extracts, emulsifiers and sweeteners and cellulosic, LPG and food protection increasing double-digits.  Food Design also grew double-digits led by Food Service, where pandemic related restrictions continued to be lifted with away-from-home consumer behaviors returning to more typical levels. As a result of strong volume growth, price increases and our focus on cost management, Nourish achieved an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 19% and margin expansion of 30 basis points. On Slide 14, you'll see that our Health and Biosciences division saw year-over-year sales growth of 7% or 5% on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home & Personal Care and high single-digit growth in Cultures and Food Enzymes.  Our health category was soft this quarter due to a particularly strong double-digit year-ago comparison, so we are pleased with the results when we look at it on a two-year basis. As Andreas mentioned earlier, inflationary pressures and higher logistics, and energy costs to keep up with the robust customer demand has challenged our margins across our business with H&B particularly impacted, which drove an operating EBITDA decrease of 12%. Unpacking this a bit deeper, the bulk or 70% of our year-over-year EBITDA decline came from higher airfreight volumes, where we have increased inter-Company shipments to manage available capacity.  As we shared last quarter, we have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth and have also invested in R&D and plant technology to increase output. Until then, we will be incurring higher costs to support our customer demand, and this will impact our EBITDA margin. Turning now to Slide 15. Our Scent Division continues to perform extremely well and experience strong growth, achieving 10% year-over-year growth or 9% growth on a currency neutral basis. This performance was driven by Fine Fragrances continued rebound, which grew approximately 36%, led by new customer wins and improved volumes.  Our ingredients category also continues to perform well, and contributed to Scent's overall success, seeing double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter, led by strong performance in both cosmetic actives and Fragrance ingredients. While our consumer Fragrances business saw modest low single-digit growth against a strong double-digit year-ago comparison, this is a marked improvement from Q2 and we expect further growth as we move forward. On a 2-year average basis, Consumer Fragrance remains strong at 9% in the third quarter. Scent also experienced adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 10% driven by strong volume growth and favorable mix.  Margin was down modestly to the higher raw materials and logistics costs a trend we see continuing. I will provide what content shortly. Lastly, in our Pharma Solutions business, we saw a current seat neutral sales decrease of 2% due to continued supply chain challenges related to raw material availability and logistic disruptions, which have made it challenging to meet persistent and growing customer demand. While  has continued to recover from COVID-19 lows, our core Pharma business saw soft performance against its solid year-ago comparison.  The division's adjusted operating EBITDA margin also continue to be impacted by higher sourcing, logistics, and manufacturing costs. We also continue to see the impact of force materials and raw material shortages with suppliers and shutdowns due to Hurricane Ida, resulting in unplanned outages in some of our product lines. While we expect the current market environment and macro supply chain problems to continue challenging the segment, we remain optimistic. And as Andreas mentioned earlier, we remained focused on returning the division to profitability as these injured sheet conditions stabilize.  Now, on Slide 17, I would like to review our cash flow position, and leveraged dynamics for the first 9 months of 2021, both of which remain a top priority for us. So far this year, IFF has generated $884 million in free cash flow, with cash flow from operations totaling approximately $1.1 billion. As the team has mentioned in previous quarters, we are investing in our growth accretive businesses as well as integration activities. Year-to-date, we have spent $242 million or approximately 2.8% of sales on capex and expect a significant ramp-up in fourth quarter as our annual spend is traditionally more back-half weighted.  From a leverage perspective, we are continuing to make substantial progress toward achieving our deleveraging target with our cash and cash equivalents at finishing at $794 million, including $122 million restricted cash with gross debt reduced by $446 million versus the second quarter to $11.5 billion due to our debt maturity schedule as part of our deleverage plan. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.7 billion, with a 4.1 times net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA. With our continued strong cash flow generation, including proceeds from divested non-core businesses, we remain confident that IFF is on track to achieve our deleveraging target of less than 3 times Net Debt to EBITDA by within 20 to 36 months post transaction close.  Turning to slide 18, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the cost inflation trends that have impacted our business this year. As I mentioned earlier, IFF's and the industry at large has seen significant year-over-year inflation increases, which have been accelerating in the recent quarter. The inflationary pressures we are seeing today are significant. Just as examples, vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October. Price of wheat is up almost 40% in the last 12 months through October. Brent crude prices have more than doubled over the past 12 months to the highest level since October, 2018. In the U.S. natural grass prices are up 100% from a year ago.  And in the U.K., they're up about 500%. And transportation rates have increased significantly given the high demand and limited capacity to ship. Across the raw materials, logistics, and energy markets, like many industries around the world, we have seen cost accelerate each quarter, which has led to our margins being adversely impacted. For example, in the first half of 2021, gross margin was down about 150 basis points. Following the third quarter, we were down about 210 basis points. As we look ahead, we are being prudent in our planning as we expect these inflationary pressures will continue throughout the fourth quarter and over the course of 2022.  Consequently, this will require us to successfully implement significant pricing actions across each of our businesses, as well as improve our sourcing efficiencies, accelerate operational improvements, and capture targeted integration synergies to drive profit growth. Now moving to slide 19, I would like to share with this means for our consolidated financial outlook. For the full-year 2021, we are maintaining the increased total revenue forecast we announced in September to account for the strong demand. For the full year 2021, we are targeting $11.55 billion in total revenue, or approximately 8.5% growth up from the forecast of $11.4 billion or 7% growth that we disclosed in the second quarter.  We also expect our sales growth to continue in the fourth quarter as our Q4 quarter-to-date sales trend is solid. As mentioned, unprecedented macro supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures continued to impact our industry. And we do expect this to continue in the foreseeable future. While we are intently focused on offsetting these inflationary pressures through pricing actions, these are lagging the inflationary pressures. And as a result, we have further revised our adjusted EBITDA margin to be modestly below 21% down from approximately 21.5% that was forecasted in September. About half of this reduction is due to lower gross margin in the third quarter, and the other half stemming from higher cost trends we see in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we are targeting low single-digit EBITDA growth, a solid improvement in light of the external challenges. We also adjusted our capex spend outlook down, as we have been very thoughtful in balancing near-term operating priorities with the need to add capacity to support accretive growth across our businesses. Overall, we are pleased of the progress we've made to-date. Strong, top-line growth, and the commitment to meet near-term macro cost pressures. And we're confident that IFF is on the right path. Employees  continued success across our core business. I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Glenn. Before I wrap it up, I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of IFF and our thousands of employees around the world who have showcased a remarkable resilience toward an evolving and continuously uncertain industry environment. They have continued to deliver strong year-over-year sales and profit growth and I'm confident that with our top notch financial operational structure supported by Glenn's financial leadership, we will be able to maintain and bolster our strong financial profile by continuing to deliver for both our shareholders and our customers.  Q4 is off to a solid start, and I know that our momentum will propel us to achieve strong sales growth for the full year and bring us another step closer to achieving our synergy targets. In some, it is clear to me that IFF is in an incredible strong position. We knew entering this year that the new IFF was poised to change our industry. But to do so, we had to execute. As we look at industry-leading sales growth for the full year, I'm just so proud of how everyone here stepped up and executed on our vision and delivered against our potential. IFF is once again the clear leader of this field, creating another iconic chapter in this Company's 132-year legacy.  This core strength of the business is why I felt now was the perfect time to start to transition to find IFF's next CEO. I have every confidence that now is the right time to let the next chapter of IFF's legacy begin. As we announced, the search has begun for my successor, and we expect that person to be in place by early 2022. I'm fully committed to a seamless transition and look forward to talking to you all about this more in the near future. Thank you all for your support. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: . In order to give all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of 1 question per person. Our first question comes from Heidi Vesterinen, with Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\nHeidi Vesterinen : Good morning, everyone. I have a question for Glenn, actually, and thanks for the info on why you joined IFF. What do you think of IFF's long-term targets rate? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter : Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the question. I would have to break them down relative to component parts. First of all, relative to topline, as we mentioned, we're very pleased for tracking extremely well versus the long-term targets and then when you take a look at how we're tracking versus competition, which is another great indicator. We're actually very pleased in terms of yards. So, we check that we'd say relative to our deleveraging target, getting below 3 times by year 3. We are feeling very comfortable with that. Combination of the cash flow generation from the business remains strong.  And as you know, we've announced a couple of divestitures and we'll continue to look at other non-core businesses. So, I would check both that -- both the deleverage as well as our free cash flow. The area that really needs to work is around our long-term margin objective. As you know, we have a 26% EBITDA margin target that was easier when we started off with a higher number at the beginning of the year and versus the most recent guidance. We're now about 500 basis points off that relative to the guidance this year. So, as we approach our '22 plan, we're spending energy thinking about that multiyear target.  I think structurally, there are couple of factors that we think still play in the favor of not only increasing where we are from an EBITDA margin, but potentially getting us back to that. 1, is clearly the biggest impact this year unexpected, has been the inflationary environment. And  we thought would talk more about this, but we lost about 200 basis points this year at our margin, relative to inflation, net of what we expect to price, and in addition, we've had some pockets of higher use of freight costs in a couple of our business. So that's about 200 basis points.  We still feel very confident on achieving the long-term synergy objectives, the cost synergies. And I would submit there are probably additional productivity in the business. I believe we strip out the material side of our business. We have over $4 billion of costs between our manufacturing operations and then our S&A, and I think we just sort of begun to scratch the surface relative to that with our synergy targets. That being said, we are working very intently right now to sort of think about -- and actually -- our pricing initiatives and also think about a longer-term productivity as well.\nHeidi Vesterinen : Thank you.\nGlenn Richter : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMatthew Deyoe : Good morning. I appreciate all the added detail in the slides on the cost side, but just trying to understand better the margin contraction a bit, and how we got to the point where we're cutting the guidance again. If I look at 3Q and then moving into 4Q, could you talk a little bit about how costs are coming in versus where you had budgeted them. And on that end, can you push price to offset logistics costs for businesses that you've just won recently, or is this just a cost of doing business in that margin component is going to come down or improve when cost and capacity come out.\nGlenn Richter : Yes. So good morning, Matthew. This is Glenn. I'll start with answering and maybe turn it over to Andreas. In general, the biggest hit as I just mentioned, on our business this year has basically been material costs, broadly impacting our business. Of the 200 basis points, it has impacted us and anticipated impact is about 200 basis points in terms of margin. About 2/3 of that is related to rate increases. So that's a combination of our raw materials, our energy, and our logistics costs. What's happening relative to each of those buckets is earlier in the year, we were thinking mid-single-digit relative to inflation and raw materials.  It's now high-single-digit approaching 10% in terms of the annual inflation. We're seeing logistics costs continue to accelerate that to the mid-teens. And then energy, as everyone is well aware, has been extremely volatile, and it's been trending up about 30% year-over-year. By the way, the planning posture for '21 is we really had relatively flat inflationary pressure, so we didn't expect at any of our material costs to go up. So, we have a much, much more significant impact relative to what we'd anticipated just a couple of quarters ago.  I would say the rest of our cost structure is working quite well. We have actually delivered strong results against our R&D sales, and administrative expenses were actually exceeding plan relative to our costs, so we're actually lower at that point. In general, manufacturing is working on productivity, although constraints in our system have limited some of the capacity gains, we can get and some of the efficiencies out of the system. The pricing dynamics that we are working very, very aggressively on capturing the pricing.  But today, we're capturing and expect to capture only about $0.50 on the dollar from inflation this year. And that's simply a lag factor relative to our ability to go to market and implement. I will note that as we look out in '22, we are anticipating those inflationary trends to continue into next year, and we are basically planning our pricing actions accordingly. I.e., each of our businesses are thinking about not only what has hit this year, but what we anticipate to hit next year, and we're executing against that. To your last point on pace, that depends by business. We have some but not a lot of multiyear contracts. In a lot of most cases, we have annual contracts.  And in many, if not most of those cases, they tend to run on a fiscal cycle, so beginning of year forward. But my last comment I would make is, we're in, I'd say unprecedented environments given the level of inflation. So, it is affording us an opportunity to go back in almost all cases to our customers and discuss the inflationary environment this will be our pricing going forward, even when we have sort of contractual relationships in place. So, let me maybe turn it over to Andreas.\nAndreas Fibig : Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, I think it's very comprehensive. So just on 1 aspect, you asked Matt on the logistics. Obviously, we go back on logistics as well, either as price increases or surcharges, and it's a bit tough up for newly won contracts, obviously, but we try what we can do because that has a huge impact in all businesses, particularly on the Health & Biosciences business. But here, I think there's another element in it is -- we are working to increase capacity because there's a lot of demand for -- in particular for Enzyme business.  And we are building -- we just installed a new fermenters and . And there's more to come for the first half of next year which will help us to decrease logistic costs as well and pull through when we get in terms of demand from our customers. We're very optimistic on this one because the technology is superior and then certainly good growth driver for us going forward.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks. And good morning, everyone. I guess just building on the last question, Glenn, maybe specifically, if you're willing to talk about it, and obviously you're early in the process, but how do you currently see inflation for '22? And how should we think about when you expect to have enough pricing implemented to cover inflation? Obviously, you talked about $0.50 on the dollar, but what's the timeline for more pricing to be in place? And also, how do you think about offsets in terms of dollars versus margin recovery in the timing they're in?\nGlenn Richter : Hey, thanks for the question, Mark (ph). You semi answered it with the intro is -- we're in the early phases of locking down a '22 plan. We desire to go out early in the year with it as much as we can, relative to our pricing actions. However, the pace at which we're able to implement that vis -a - vis the pace of inflation, we're not sure if you will when the curves will cross over from a standpoint. It's likely to be sort of late second quarter into the second half of the year, but I would say stay tuned. We're really still working on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAdam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess first, Andreas, you talked through some of the regional and business sales trends a little more on a year-to-date basis. Hoping you could frame that from the third quarter and into the fourth, where some of the pluses and minuses are. And specifically, with that organic sales guidance, where pricing was in the third quarter and where you think it's going to be in the fourth as we evaluate what the tailwind in 2022 could be, as you go back to customers on price.  And if I could just sneak a quick other one in on synergy realization and just help us think about the cadence of cost and revenue synergy realization in '22, especially on the cost side, where would seem like an inflationary environment makes it harder to risk to achieve some of the procurement savings that had been previously targeted. Thanks.\nAndreas Fibig : Yeah, thank you, Adam, for the question. So, what we have seeing in Q2 and Q3 is that we have grown about percent price. The risk was for volume going forward. We might see a little bit more in the fourth quarter in terms of price. But as you said, we had a good start sales wise into the fourth quarter. So, October can come in. Good that we don't have the final P&L here, so we can't talk about that. Synergy realization is going, actually, on the cost synergies extremely well. As you have seen, we have already realized the 40 million in the first 3 quarters of the 45-worth promised. So, it's very, very likely that we will over-achieve. On the sales synergies, we are very much on track.  And I see, when I visit our facilities and I was basically out in the field, the last week in Europe, but the teams are working very nicely and very, very well together. So, we see that more sales synergies are coming in. And that shows that we are building a very, very strong position for the Company going forward. In terms of the different categories as well, we see still a good performance on the Fine Fragrance side, which is very, very helpful. So just a good recovery, but its growth -- with growth rate here as well. And that's helping the whole results for the Company going forward. I think that's what we can say about the fourth quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nGunther Zechmann : Hi, thanks for taking my question and welcome, Glenn. The photo on the flight looks very youthful so it must be an active ingredients from Lucas Meyer Cosmetics. Thanks for sharing the percentage change in raw materials. Can I just check if the numbers you gave earlier, Glenn are what you include in the full-year guidance, or current run rate. And then pricing is up to 2% of sales in Q3. Can you share the exit run rate out of Q3 or and October if you have it? And what further increases you expect to push through, please.\nGlenn Richter : Maybe, yeah. Good morning or good afternoon, Gunther. Good to hear from you. I'll answer the second question first. Q4 pricing  rate from Q3 is going to be very consistent with Q3, so it's about 2 points. It's slightly higher in Q4 versus Q3. And as a result of that, actually the inflation pressures are going to slightly outpace once again within the quarter, just given the cost increases from the standpoint, just as a follow-up to that, really we are focused on aggressively implementing late this year into '22 on that front.  Of the full-year margin guidance and relative to the freight impact, we have about 200 basis points associated with cost. About 2/3 of that is pure rate and about 1/3 of that, or about 60 basis points is related to higher usages of freight, principally air and principally to support our H&D business because of capacity limitation, so that piece as Andreas had mentioned, will take us some time to work out through '22 as we address some of the capacity constraints.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts : Thank you. And best wishes, Andreas, for the future, and welcome, Glenn. Andreas, your customers are seeing a lot of bulk raw material cost increases, so they're probably feeling even more cost pressure than you are. Do you see more reformulation going on? And is that providing any opportunities for more wins if your customers are reformulating their products a little bit more frequently here, because of their cost pressures?\nAndreas Fibig : So, I'm saying -- first of all, thank you for the question. It's -- we see reformulation. Is it massively more than what we have seen before? Probably not. But what we see in general, what comes in terms of projects, are bigger projects -- less projects, but bigger projects, which is actually good for us. Taking into consideration that we will win more of these projects, the cost for us is reducing in terms of the average projects, so that's what we see it at the moment. Indeed, many of our customers see good balance increases.  But the discussion with the procurement people on the customer side is going okay and well because they know what's happening on the raw material front here. So, I think that's where we are, what we see is still that we have really good strong demand from most of our customers. And that's very helpful in terms of the business and also in terms of the momentum we have as a business growing going forward because we have to take into consideration, we are still in the integrational phase, and we're gaining share. That's what we see or some comparison to our competitors. And we are making good, good progress in the integration as well. So that's all what I am to.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In your initial remarks, Glenn, you said that there remains significant opportunities for portfolio optimization. Does that mean that there's another, I don't know, $500 million to $1 billion in revenues that can be monetized? And second, can you describe or articulate your capital expenditures for 2022 and '23. And what's the arc of capital expenditures? And what are the priorities to spend on?\nAndreas Fibig : Good morning, Jeff (ph). This is Andreas. On the portfolio, as we said, we own about 5% of sales. That's what it is, and we are working on it. More will come probably early next year and then we can be more transparent around it. But we're very happy with the moves we have made on the portfolio and there's more to come. On the capex, I hand it over to Glenn (ph).\nGlenn Richter : Sure. Good morning. So, as you recognize, we updated our guidance for this year relative to our full-year capex spend at 4%. And that's in part because of just the ability to execute our capital programs well. given all of the different priorities we have in the business and far that is just continuing to be more surgical I'll say, relative to our investing capital. We do anticipate that that will ramp up next year as we're putting together our '22 plans, largely focused on our higher margin and higher growth businesses.  And a big piece of that actually is really the bottlenecking and enhancing our capacity situation into next year. So, I'll say more to come around the plan standpoint. We had -- I think previously guided to having spent a little bit more capex around the business playing forward for capacity reasons. And then the other area I would just note although it's a much smaller portion around IT. So, IT through an integration activity. We have some additional activities as we go into next year as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I had two questions. First, was the generally operating expenses in the quarter, both SG&A and then R&D specifically, were down quite a bit. And I was curious if you could comment on how sustainable those changes were. If it reflects maybe incentive compensation again or more tactical reductions given the gross margin pressures. I was curious about that piece. And then the second thing unrelated, was on Pharma.  You've given the capacity constraints that you've seen and demand outstripping supply, which is great. The question is, what -- where is that demand going? What's the risk that rebuilding, if you call it relative market share, when you do get capacity up is a challenge? I mean, where is that business going, and how confident can we be that that will come back when you get the capacity up? Thank you.\nAndreas Fibig : Thank you, Lauren, for the question. The first keys, Glenn will take and then take the follow one.\nGlenn Richter : Good morning, Lauren. As a relative to our R&D sales and administrative expenses, as I mentioned, we are favorable to plan and down from prior year, but that is not R&D. Actually, R&D is trending right on plan. And by the way, of our roughly 2.1 billion of annual spend for RS&A, about 30% is, R&D, and the residual is fairly equally split between sales, our commercial team, and an administrative.  We're seeing actually more efficiencies in the commercial teams as they come together post-integration and the back-office. So, the administrative teams as well. So that's really where we're seeing and are pushing more of the productivity, not R&D, we're always looking for ways to more efficiently spend our R&D budget, but we sort of directionally want to make sure that we continue to stay within the guidance we provided relative to our ongoing R&D spend.\nAndreas Fibig : On the former part of the question. They're seem to be about the Pharma recipients, businesses, is such as a very stable business. And it's predictable in the sense because you know, when you're in the product or in the pharmaceutical that you stay in because everything else would execute require a change that with the FDA that means that our customer base is very stable. So, there's probably no big groups that if we increase our capacity, that we have too much capacity in place.  We see as I said, good and stable demand. And despite the capacity on our manufacturing side, we had some issues with CB harvesting, which goes into one of the products of our big, big customers, which is -- I can give you,  are all one-to-one. And harvesting now is going better because we have new fields in front of Norway, which we're discovering right now and using much to increase our manufacturing on the side. So just to give you a bit of detail around the Pharma business but there's certainly no danger that the overbooking.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with BaGird, your line is open.\nMark : Hi, good morning. This is actually Mark Kreuer (ph) here, sitting in for Ghansham. Sorry to belabor the point a little bit here, but can you talk about where we are at from a price cost perspective across both the legacy IFF businesses and then the legacy Du Pont businesses, maybe on a dollar basis. That would be helpful. And then what's the historical price costs catch-up period for the 2 legacy businesses? Is there any meaningful difference in catch-up period across your various segments or regions?\nGlenn Richter : Yeah, relative to -- good set of questions. It's relatively inflation, we're seeing higher rates in legacy N&B then IFF, although we're seeing inflation across all businesses. But generally, we're in mid-single-digit range for legacy IFF and then low double-digit relative to legacy N&B. Catch-up period, generally 3 to 6 months. Certain businesses like H&B may have slightly larger percentage that are either an annual contract or a multi-year, so they might be  slower.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nChris Parkinson : Great. Thank you very much. Just based on the growth outlook for certain pieces of the acquired N&B assets, are there any parallels which may require additional capacity in the coming years just giving healthy outlooks? The legacy owner used to speak about some recent expansions already essentially being sold out, so just trying to gauge where the portfolio stands. Thank you.\nAndreas Fibig : No. Thank you for the question. So, you will see probably the biggest expansion on our side on capacity in the health and bioscience area, in particular, on the enzyme business, where we believe that our technology is really top notch, and we see a huge demand from our customers as well. So, most of the investments goes into that area. We've seen some capacity increases, as we said on the Pharma business, but not to the same degree as on the IFF's Health & Biosciences business. The rest is basically a business that's usually on Scent and on Nourish, which is partly legacy N&B as well. But more, let's say, maintain than it is investment into new plans.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Your line is open.\nJonathan Feeney : Hi. Thanks very much for getting me in. Just a quick one. As the pricing process and your assessment of how easy that is to do, the dialogue, is there any significant difference in the acquired N&B businesses in the legacy businesses that you're running into? Because I did notice that it seems like the lag is a little bit greater in the segments that are heavier on acquired revenue, but there may be other ex-plant nations for that. So just curious about the general nature of the business. Is it tougher to take pricing there?\nGlenn Richter : Well, I think one thing we have to consider is the legacy N&B businesses just has a higher ramp. So, the inflationary pressures are more significant in that side. So basically, it just requires, if you will, a bigger lift relative to the implementation from that standpoint.\nAndreas Fibig : Absolutely.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. It is now my pleasure to hand the program back to A - Andreas Fibig for closing reQ - Marks.\nAndreas Fibig : Thank you very much for participation. I hope that it helped to explain where we are. We are very pleased where we are in the integration process, and certainly with the volume performance we're doing as a Company, which is good. Thank you very much, and have a good day.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Andreas Fibig",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. And I thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our performance results, I would like to take a moment to thank all of our dedicated colleagues throughout the world, who have continued to work tirelessly in a challenging environment to fuel the global consumer goods supply chain and meet our customer's needs. I can't thank each and every one of you enough for your hard work, dedication, and focus. I also want to take a moment and welcome Glenn Richter, who is joining us on today's call for the first time.  As you know, Glenn joined us a little over a month ago as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'm sure you will all find that his experience aligns perfectly with our strategic goals, making him an incredible asset to our team. I also want to thank Rustom for his leadership and contributions during his time as IFF's CFO. Rustom played an important role in our combination with  N&B, and for that we are immensely grateful. He has been important putting IFF in the strong position it is today. We wish him all the best in his future endeavors. On today's call, I will begin by providing an overview of year-to - date performance, including the progress we have made so far on our integration.  I will then turn it over to Glenn (ph) who will provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results. Before we conclude today's call with a question-and-answer session, Glenn (ph) will also speak to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Now, as I mentioned, I'd like to kick us off on Slide 6 by discussing our financial highlights for the first 9 months of 2021. Throughout the third quarter, we remained laser focused on extending the momentum IFF established in the first half of 2021. In the first 9 months of 2021, IFF achieved $8.6 billion in sales, representing 10% growth with 7% on currency-neutral basis.  A strong reflection of the strength of our market-leading platform, and the compelling position we have established with our customers as a combined Company. We delivered a 22% adjusted operating EBITDA margin and a combined EBITDA growth of 5%. As we will discuss in more detail, we continue to confirm meaningful inflationary pressure due to higher raw material, logistic, and energy costs. We have maintained our robust cost discipline efforts and are entering the fourth quarter with continued financial strengths, having achieved $884 million free cash flow or approximately 10% of our trailing 9 months sales, driven by strong cash generation.  This cash generation has enabled us to stay on track to meeting our deleveraging target. Finally, as I've mentioned in previous quarters, continued refinement and optimization of our portfolio is a critical component of our ongoing integration efforts. I am pleased to share that we have completed divestiture of our food preparation business, and are on track to complete the divestiture of all Microbial Control business in the second quarter of 2022. Together, these 2 important divestitures will create a more focused IFF, allowing us to hone in on the constraints of our core business segments and create a stronger, more-focused business.  We will continue to evaluate and optimize our portfolio as we move forward with our integration, looking for opportunities to rapidly divest in other non-core businesses. We started this year with a simple commitment, to focus on execution and deliver on the potential of the new IFF. I'm pleased to say that even in a very challenging global environment, our team has met our integration objectives by delivering strong results with continued sales momentum and profit growth.  Now, turning to Slide 7, I'd like to walk you through some of the regional sales dynamics underpinning our results for the last 9 months. First, I'm excited to share that we continue to experience strong growth in all 4 of our key operating regions despite ongoing and unique market uncertainties that have persisted across each geography. In North America, we achieved 7% growth across all 4 of IFF's business divisions, led by high-single-digit growth in Nourish and Scent. These 2 divisions have continued to perform exceptionally well quarter after quarter.  In Asia, we experienced a 7% increase in sales led by continued double-digit growth in India, as well as a low single digit growth in China, even in it's particularly strong recent market complexities in the region. From a business unit perspective, Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions continued to carry the region's growth throughout the year to-date. Latin America continues to be our strongest performing region and sales growth leader, having achieved 12% growth largely fueled by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and continued local currency strengths.  Perhaps, most impressive is a 7% sales growth at our EMEA region achieved to date, which includes a robust double-digit increase in the third quarter and prices performance on our Scent and Norridge divisions stock. This encouraging rebound, with Scent delivering double-digit growth led by our client fragrance business, and Norridge delivering high single-digit growth, led by our food service business. We expect this momentum to continue through the remainder of the year and we will stay diligent to ensure our business remain nimble, positioned to perform against any new supply chain challenges that may arise.  Moving now to Slide 8, I'd like to take a closer look at our 9 months year-to-date sales performance across our key business segments. Our largest division, Nourish, has been a strong performer throughout the year, achieving currency-neutral sales growth of 9% with broad-based strength from all flavors, ingredients, and food design businesses. Scent has had a similar strong year delivering 8% in currency-neutral gross to date led by impressive double-digit growth in fine fragrance, as well as strong growth in Consumer Fragrance and ingredients. Health & Bioscience has seen strong demand in key focus areas, including Home and Personal Care, animal nutrition, and  food enzymes.  As you know, we are in the process of selling our microbial control unit, which has continued to experience headwinds through this year, but has rebounded from COVID impacted loss with growth in both Q2 and Q3. This divestiture should further enhance the performance of this important division. Pharma Solutions, despite significant challenges, is flat so far for the year. Supply chain challenges have had an outsized impact on this divisions throughout the year. While we have seen encouraging growth in our industrial business, the division still struggles to meet customer demand due to all mature availability challenges and logistics issues.  Now on slide 9, you will see that we have outlined some of the factors influencing the gross profitability of each of our 4 divisions so far this year. As I previously mentioned, Nourish had had a strong year with Flavors & Ingredients experiencing double-digit growth. We have been working hard in our execution to manage the volume and costs to limit margin impact from higher raw material costs, which continue to be a headwind on our profitability. While we have seen some margin impact of about 20 basis points in the year, we are proud of how our execution has mitigated much of the negative headwinds while delivering meaningful growth.  Our team has done an exceptional job increasing prices to combat inflationary pressures, something that will continue to be critical as we move forward. At Health & Biosciences, we mentioned broad-based growth across the markets. But here we are seeing significant margin impact from higher logistic costs. As shared on our second quarter call, part of this that freight rates have increased significantly, but also, we have -- having higher logistic costs to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth. Investing in R&D and Plant technology to increase output later this year and into 2022.  The Scent division is certainly realized the strongest all-around bounce back as consumer demand rises across end markets. Notably, Fine Fragrances alone as realized, 36% growth year-to-date was double-digit growth in cosmetic active, and continued solid performance in Consumer Fragrances. At the time, since profitability expansion of a 110 basis points has been led by higher volume, favorable mix, and higher productivity. As I mentioned, Pharma Solutions was the only division in which we did not experience sales growth due to continued global supply chain challenges that have impacted our ability to meet strong customer demands.  These challenges, including supply and logistic constraints and ongoing inflation, have in turn, significantly pressured our margin compared to the first 9 months of 2020. Moving through the fourth quarter and entering 2022, we will be closely tracking supply chain dynamics and will continue to prioritize returning our Pharma Solutions business to the profitability we know is achievable. And in the fourth quarter, we're expecting year-over-year, top and bottom-line performance to improve. As we have been talking about today, IFF is realizing very strong sales momentum across our business.  This is a reflection of a powerful new position we have created through our combination with the N&B business, and the compelling value proposition we can offer to our customers. While we are pleased to put many of the gross hesitance relates to the pandemic behind us, it is important to understand that our growth this year, is in fact meaningful above pre-pandemic results. If you look at the total business, you will see that on a comparable 9 months proforma basis, the new IFF has realized 9% sales growth over 2019 results. This strength is broad-based to each segment is realizing strong rose above pre-pandemic levels.  Nourish as a business that was particularly hard hits with the pandemic involves strongly growing with sales growth of 9% compared to performance 2019 in 9 months period. And for important, especially given that much of the integration work is coming from within this division. These results showcase how acquisition in the market has been fundamentally strengthened through the merger and how our teams are delivering the full potential of IFF to our customers. Moving to slide 11, I would like to discuss a strong progress we have made in terms of synergy realization.  For just 9 months since completing our merger with N&B, our synergy progress reaffirms the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us as a combined Company. Having received significant and highly encouraging positive feedback from our customers, along with persistent robust customer demands, we are confident in our ability to meet our revenue target. To date, revenue synergies have started to contribute to our top-line performance and we are pleased that our project pipeline is strong and growing. The first 9 months of 2021, we've achieved approximately $40 million in cost synergies, representing nearly 90% of our 2021 cost synergy target was 1 quarter to go.  This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings programs we have implemented, where we are leveraging our increased scale and optimizing on our organization. I'm confident that we will more than exceed our $45 million year-one synergy target. And I'm encouraged by the continued progress we're making towards achieving our three-year run rate of cost synergy target of $300 million. Now, before I turn the call over to Glenn (ph), I want to spend a second to really underscore what he brings to us here at IFF. His background is perfect, but there are 2 areas I think really standout.  First, he brings a tremendous  was private and public companies and leading finance teams to enhance discipline and built processes that drive towards a goal of shareholder value creation. He has time and time again shown an ability to help businesses accelerate top-line growth while driving margin expansion. In this way, he consistently implements productivity initiatives with lasting impact. Second, he has been through several large-scale M&A integrations with a track record of strong success. As we continue to execute on our multi-year transformational integration, this experience is invaluable. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn (ph). Thank you, Glenn. Before I wrap it up, I'd like to reiterate how proud I am of IFF and our thousands of employees around the world who have showcased a remarkable resilience toward an evolving and continuously uncertain industry environment. They have continued to deliver strong year-over-year sales and profit growth and I'm confident that with our top notch financial operational structure supported by Glenn's financial leadership, we will be able to maintain and bolster our strong financial profile by continuing to deliver for both our shareholders and our customers.  Q4 is off to a solid start, and I know that our momentum will propel us to achieve strong sales growth for the full year and bring us another step closer to achieving our synergy targets. In some, it is clear to me that IFF is in an incredible strong position. We knew entering this year that the new IFF was poised to change our industry. But to do so, we had to execute. As we look at industry-leading sales growth for the full year, I'm just so proud of how everyone here stepped up and executed on our vision and delivered against our potential. IFF is once again the clear leader of this field, creating another iconic chapter in this Company's 132-year legacy.  This core strength of the business is why I felt now was the perfect time to start to transition to find IFF's next CEO. I have every confidence that now is the right time to let the next chapter of IFF's legacy begin. As we announced, the search has begun for my successor, and we expect that person to be in place by early 2022. I'm fully committed to a seamless transition and look forward to talking to you all about this more in the near future. Thank you all for your support. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, I think it's very comprehensive. So just on 1 aspect, you asked Matt on the logistics. Obviously, we go back on logistics as well, either as price increases or surcharges, and it's a bit tough up for newly won contracts, obviously, but we try what we can do because that has a huge impact in all businesses, particularly on the Health & Biosciences business. But here, I think there's another element in it is -- we are working to increase capacity because there's a lot of demand for -- in particular for Enzyme business.  And we are building -- we just installed a new fermenters and . And there's more to come for the first half of next year which will help us to decrease logistic costs as well and pull through when we get in terms of demand from our customers. We're very optimistic on this one because the technology is superior and then certainly good growth driver for us going forward. Yeah, thank you, Adam, for the question. So, what we have seeing in Q2 and Q3 is that we have grown about percent price. The risk was for volume going forward. We might see a little bit more in the fourth quarter in terms of price. But as you said, we had a good start sales wise into the fourth quarter. So, October can come in. Good that we don't have the final P&L here, so we can't talk about that. Synergy realization is going, actually, on the cost synergies extremely well. As you have seen, we have already realized the 40 million in the first 3 quarters of the 45-worth promised. So, it's very, very likely that we will over-achieve. On the sales synergies, we are very much on track.  And I see, when I visit our facilities and I was basically out in the field, the last week in Europe, but the teams are working very nicely and very, very well together. So, we see that more sales synergies are coming in. And that shows that we are building a very, very strong position for the Company going forward. In terms of the different categories as well, we see still a good performance on the Fine Fragrance side, which is very, very helpful. So just a good recovery, but its growth -- with growth rate here as well. And that's helping the whole results for the Company going forward. I think that's what we can say about the fourth quarter. So, I'm saying -- first of all, thank you for the question. It's -- we see reformulation. Is it massively more than what we have seen before? Probably not. But what we see in general, what comes in terms of projects, are bigger projects -- less projects, but bigger projects, which is actually good for us. Taking into consideration that we will win more of these projects, the cost for us is reducing in terms of the average projects, so that's what we see it at the moment. Indeed, many of our customers see good balance increases.  But the discussion with the procurement people on the customer side is going okay and well because they know what's happening on the raw material front here. So, I think that's where we are, what we see is still that we have really good strong demand from most of our customers. And that's very helpful in terms of the business and also in terms of the momentum we have as a business growing going forward because we have to take into consideration, we are still in the integrational phase, and we're gaining share. That's what we see or some comparison to our competitors. And we are making good, good progress in the integration as well. So that's all what I am to. Good morning, Jeff (ph). This is Andreas. On the portfolio, as we said, we own about 5% of sales. That's what it is, and we are working on it. More will come probably early next year and then we can be more transparent around it. But we're very happy with the moves we have made on the portfolio and there's more to come. On the capex, I hand it over to Glenn (ph). Thank you, Lauren, for the question. The first keys, Glenn will take and then take the follow one. On the former part of the question. They're seem to be about the Pharma recipients, businesses, is such as a very stable business. And it's predictable in the sense because you know, when you're in the product or in the pharmaceutical that you stay in because everything else would execute require a change that with the FDA that means that our customer base is very stable. So, there's probably no big groups that if we increase our capacity, that we have too much capacity in place.  We see as I said, good and stable demand. And despite the capacity on our manufacturing side, we had some issues with CB harvesting, which goes into one of the products of our big, big customers, which is -- I can give you,  are all one-to-one. And harvesting now is going better because we have new fields in front of Norway, which we're discovering right now and using much to increase our manufacturing on the side. So just to give you a bit of detail around the Pharma business but there's certainly no danger that the overbooking. No. Thank you for the question. So, you will see probably the biggest expansion on our side on capacity in the health and bioscience area, in particular, on the enzyme business, where we believe that our technology is really top notch, and we see a huge demand from our customers as well. So, most of the investments goes into that area. We've seen some capacity increases, as we said on the Pharma business, but not to the same degree as on the IFF's Health & Biosciences business. The rest is basically a business that's usually on Scent and on Nourish, which is partly legacy N&B as well. But more, let's say, maintain than it is investment into new plans. Absolutely. Thank you very much for participation. I hope that it helped to explain where we are. We are very pleased where we are in the integration process, and certainly with the volume performance we're doing as a Company, which is good. Thank you very much, and have a good day."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you for the warm welcome, Andreas, and good morning, afternoon and evening to everyone. Since joining IFF in late September, I've had the opportunity to briefly meet many in our investor community. And the most common questions I've been asked is why did I join IFF? And what are my near-term priorities? Consequently, before I review our financial results, I thought it would be helpful to briefly provide these perspectives as an introduction. There were 3 very compelling reasons for me to join IFF. First and perhaps most importantly, IFF is a Company that is truly making a difference in helping solve some of the world's biggest challenges.  We're delivering reliable, innovative, and sustainable solutions that are directly helping address issues such as improved nutrition and wellness, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating a more sustainable environment. Second, the industry has very attractive organic growth characteristics benefitting from continued strong consumer tailwinds. From increased consumer focus on wellness and natural and sustainable products, increased demand in emerging markets, and new consumer needs presented by aging demographics in developed markets. I also believe that scale will become an important basis of competitive advantage. As customers demand leading ESG platforms, increased innovation and speed-to-market, global supply chain resiliency and help in navigating increasingly complex regulations.  Third, I firmly believe that the combination of IFF with DuPont's legacy N&B business has uniquely created an industry leading platform. And since joining IFF, I've tried to immersed myself in the business completely. Visiting sites, meeting with our business and operations teams, and spending time at our R&D in creative centers. I've also prioritized hearing from you, our investors and analysts and frankly, today I'm even more bullish on the strength of IFF 's global capabilities and the tremendous long-term potential we have to drive strong top and bottom-line growth.  Relative to my near-term priorities, I have 4 primary areas of focus. By far, our most pressing priority is to tackle the challenges from the global inflationary environment and to successfully execute broad-based pricing actions across all of our businesses. Second, I'm also focused on enhancing our core financial processes and metrics, including better forecasting, improved business-level return metrics, and tighter disciplines for our investment decisions, so that we're maximizing our growth potential and return on invested capital.  A third area of focus is ensuring we fully deliver on our merger synergies, while also accelerating our focus on sustainable productivity. And finally, while we have made very good progress to date on our portfolio optimization, there is significant opportunity remaining. In the days and months ahead, I look forward to learning even more about this organization and engaging with all of you. With that, I'd now like to provide an overview of our consolidated third quarter results.  In Q3, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing a 12% year-over-year increase, primarily driven by the continued double-digit growth in our Nourish division, and strong increases in both Scents and Health & Biosciences. In terms of contribution, volume performance was the primary driver of our growth. As pricing represented approximately 2% points in the quarter. So, our gross margin continued to be challenged by inflationary pressures.  It was somewhat offset by our strong cost management focus, which resulted in adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 4%. While we had solid year-over-year EBITDA growth, our gross margin was down by 210 basis points, as our pricing actions recovered only about 65% of our raw material increases, or approximately 50% in the third quarter when we include raw material, logistics, and energy, increases. As we move forward, we are squarely focused on improving this recovery rate relative to the total inflationary basis. But expect that in the short term, specifically the fourth quarter, we will see a similar pressure given the time lag of price realization.  Let me finish on this slide by saying that we achieved strong earnings per share, excluding amortization of a $1.47. On the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the third quarter financial results for each of our 4 divisions. Turning to slide 13, I'll start with our Nourish division, which had an exceptional quarter. In Q3, Nourish achieved 17% year-over-year sales growth, or 15% on a currency neutral basis. Driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors for the second consecutive quarter. Ingredients also grew double-digits with all subcategories, protein solutions, pectin and seaweed extracts, emulsifiers and sweeteners and cellulosic, LPG and food protection increasing double-digits.  Food Design also grew double-digits led by Food Service, where pandemic related restrictions continued to be lifted with away-from-home consumer behaviors returning to more typical levels. As a result of strong volume growth, price increases and our focus on cost management, Nourish achieved an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 19% and margin expansion of 30 basis points. On Slide 14, you'll see that our Health and Biosciences division saw year-over-year sales growth of 7% or 5% on a currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home & Personal Care and high single-digit growth in Cultures and Food Enzymes.  Our health category was soft this quarter due to a particularly strong double-digit year-ago comparison, so we are pleased with the results when we look at it on a two-year basis. As Andreas mentioned earlier, inflationary pressures and higher logistics, and energy costs to keep up with the robust customer demand has challenged our margins across our business with H&B particularly impacted, which drove an operating EBITDA decrease of 12%. Unpacking this a bit deeper, the bulk or 70% of our year-over-year EBITDA decline came from higher airfreight volumes, where we have increased inter-Company shipments to manage available capacity.  As we shared last quarter, we have increased capacity investments in this business to support long-term growth and have also invested in R&D and plant technology to increase output. Until then, we will be incurring higher costs to support our customer demand, and this will impact our EBITDA margin. Turning now to Slide 15. Our Scent Division continues to perform extremely well and experience strong growth, achieving 10% year-over-year growth or 9% growth on a currency neutral basis. This performance was driven by Fine Fragrances continued rebound, which grew approximately 36%, led by new customer wins and improved volumes.  Our ingredients category also continues to perform well, and contributed to Scent's overall success, seeing double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter, led by strong performance in both cosmetic actives and Fragrance ingredients. While our consumer Fragrances business saw modest low single-digit growth against a strong double-digit year-ago comparison, this is a marked improvement from Q2 and we expect further growth as we move forward. On a 2-year average basis, Consumer Fragrance remains strong at 9% in the third quarter. Scent also experienced adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 10% driven by strong volume growth and favorable mix.  Margin was down modestly to the higher raw materials and logistics costs a trend we see continuing. I will provide what content shortly. Lastly, in our Pharma Solutions business, we saw a current seat neutral sales decrease of 2% due to continued supply chain challenges related to raw material availability and logistic disruptions, which have made it challenging to meet persistent and growing customer demand. While  has continued to recover from COVID-19 lows, our core Pharma business saw soft performance against its solid year-ago comparison.  The division's adjusted operating EBITDA margin also continue to be impacted by higher sourcing, logistics, and manufacturing costs. We also continue to see the impact of force materials and raw material shortages with suppliers and shutdowns due to Hurricane Ida, resulting in unplanned outages in some of our product lines. While we expect the current market environment and macro supply chain problems to continue challenging the segment, we remain optimistic. And as Andreas mentioned earlier, we remained focused on returning the division to profitability as these injured sheet conditions stabilize.  Now, on Slide 17, I would like to review our cash flow position, and leveraged dynamics for the first 9 months of 2021, both of which remain a top priority for us. So far this year, IFF has generated $884 million in free cash flow, with cash flow from operations totaling approximately $1.1 billion. As the team has mentioned in previous quarters, we are investing in our growth accretive businesses as well as integration activities. Year-to-date, we have spent $242 million or approximately 2.8% of sales on capex and expect a significant ramp-up in fourth quarter as our annual spend is traditionally more back-half weighted.  From a leverage perspective, we are continuing to make substantial progress toward achieving our deleveraging target with our cash and cash equivalents at finishing at $794 million, including $122 million restricted cash with gross debt reduced by $446 million versus the second quarter to $11.5 billion due to our debt maturity schedule as part of our deleverage plan. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.7 billion, with a 4.1 times net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA. With our continued strong cash flow generation, including proceeds from divested non-core businesses, we remain confident that IFF is on track to achieve our deleveraging target of less than 3 times Net Debt to EBITDA by within 20 to 36 months post transaction close.  Turning to slide 18, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the cost inflation trends that have impacted our business this year. As I mentioned earlier, IFF's and the industry at large has seen significant year-over-year inflation increases, which have been accelerating in the recent quarter. The inflationary pressures we are seeing today are significant. Just as examples, vegetable oil prices hit a record high after rising by almost 10% in October. Price of wheat is up almost 40% in the last 12 months through October. Brent crude prices have more than doubled over the past 12 months to the highest level since October, 2018. In the U.S. natural grass prices are up 100% from a year ago.  And in the U.K., they're up about 500%. And transportation rates have increased significantly given the high demand and limited capacity to ship. Across the raw materials, logistics, and energy markets, like many industries around the world, we have seen cost accelerate each quarter, which has led to our margins being adversely impacted. For example, in the first half of 2021, gross margin was down about 150 basis points. Following the third quarter, we were down about 210 basis points. As we look ahead, we are being prudent in our planning as we expect these inflationary pressures will continue throughout the fourth quarter and over the course of 2022.  Consequently, this will require us to successfully implement significant pricing actions across each of our businesses, as well as improve our sourcing efficiencies, accelerate operational improvements, and capture targeted integration synergies to drive profit growth. Now moving to slide 19, I would like to share with this means for our consolidated financial outlook. For the full-year 2021, we are maintaining the increased total revenue forecast we announced in September to account for the strong demand. For the full year 2021, we are targeting $11.55 billion in total revenue, or approximately 8.5% growth up from the forecast of $11.4 billion or 7% growth that we disclosed in the second quarter.  We also expect our sales growth to continue in the fourth quarter as our Q4 quarter-to-date sales trend is solid. As mentioned, unprecedented macro supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures continued to impact our industry. And we do expect this to continue in the foreseeable future. While we are intently focused on offsetting these inflationary pressures through pricing actions, these are lagging the inflationary pressures. And as a result, we have further revised our adjusted EBITDA margin to be modestly below 21% down from approximately 21.5% that was forecasted in September. About half of this reduction is due to lower gross margin in the third quarter, and the other half stemming from higher cost trends we see in the fourth quarter.  For the full year, we are targeting low single-digit EBITDA growth, a solid improvement in light of the external challenges. We also adjusted our capex spend outlook down, as we have been very thoughtful in balancing near-term operating priorities with the need to add capacity to support accretive growth across our businesses. Overall, we are pleased of the progress we've made to-date. Strong, top-line growth, and the commitment to meet near-term macro cost pressures. And we're confident that IFF is on the right path. Employees  continued success across our core business. I'll now turn the call back over to Andreas for some closing remarks. Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the question. I would have to break them down relative to component parts. First of all, relative to topline, as we mentioned, we're very pleased for tracking extremely well versus the long-term targets and then when you take a look at how we're tracking versus competition, which is another great indicator. We're actually very pleased in terms of yards. So, we check that we'd say relative to our deleveraging target, getting below 3 times by year 3. We are feeling very comfortable with that. Combination of the cash flow generation from the business remains strong.  And as you know, we've announced a couple of divestitures and we'll continue to look at other non-core businesses. So, I would check both that -- both the deleverage as well as our free cash flow. The area that really needs to work is around our long-term margin objective. As you know, we have a 26% EBITDA margin target that was easier when we started off with a higher number at the beginning of the year and versus the most recent guidance. We're now about 500 basis points off that relative to the guidance this year. So, as we approach our '22 plan, we're spending energy thinking about that multiyear target.  I think structurally, there are couple of factors that we think still play in the favor of not only increasing where we are from an EBITDA margin, but potentially getting us back to that. 1, is clearly the biggest impact this year unexpected, has been the inflationary environment. And  we thought would talk more about this, but we lost about 200 basis points this year at our margin, relative to inflation, net of what we expect to price, and in addition, we've had some pockets of higher use of freight costs in a couple of our business. So that's about 200 basis points.  We still feel very confident on achieving the long-term synergy objectives, the cost synergies. And I would submit there are probably additional productivity in the business. I believe we strip out the material side of our business. We have over $4 billion of costs between our manufacturing operations and then our S&A, and I think we just sort of begun to scratch the surface relative to that with our synergy targets. That being said, we are working very intently right now to sort of think about -- and actually -- our pricing initiatives and also think about a longer-term productivity as well. Thank you. Yes. So good morning, Matthew. This is Glenn. I'll start with answering and maybe turn it over to Andreas. In general, the biggest hit as I just mentioned, on our business this year has basically been material costs, broadly impacting our business. Of the 200 basis points, it has impacted us and anticipated impact is about 200 basis points in terms of margin. About 2/3 of that is related to rate increases. So that's a combination of our raw materials, our energy, and our logistics costs. What's happening relative to each of those buckets is earlier in the year, we were thinking mid-single-digit relative to inflation and raw materials.  It's now high-single-digit approaching 10% in terms of the annual inflation. We're seeing logistics costs continue to accelerate that to the mid-teens. And then energy, as everyone is well aware, has been extremely volatile, and it's been trending up about 30% year-over-year. By the way, the planning posture for '21 is we really had relatively flat inflationary pressure, so we didn't expect at any of our material costs to go up. So, we have a much, much more significant impact relative to what we'd anticipated just a couple of quarters ago.  I would say the rest of our cost structure is working quite well. We have actually delivered strong results against our R&D sales, and administrative expenses were actually exceeding plan relative to our costs, so we're actually lower at that point. In general, manufacturing is working on productivity, although constraints in our system have limited some of the capacity gains, we can get and some of the efficiencies out of the system. The pricing dynamics that we are working very, very aggressively on capturing the pricing.  But today, we're capturing and expect to capture only about $0.50 on the dollar from inflation this year. And that's simply a lag factor relative to our ability to go to market and implement. I will note that as we look out in '22, we are anticipating those inflationary trends to continue into next year, and we are basically planning our pricing actions accordingly. I.e., each of our businesses are thinking about not only what has hit this year, but what we anticipate to hit next year, and we're executing against that. To your last point on pace, that depends by business. We have some but not a lot of multiyear contracts. In a lot of most cases, we have annual contracts.  And in many, if not most of those cases, they tend to run on a fiscal cycle, so beginning of year forward. But my last comment I would make is, we're in, I'd say unprecedented environments given the level of inflation. So, it is affording us an opportunity to go back in almost all cases to our customers and discuss the inflationary environment this will be our pricing going forward, even when we have sort of contractual relationships in place. So, let me maybe turn it over to Andreas. Hey, thanks for the question, Mark (ph). You semi answered it with the intro is -- we're in the early phases of locking down a '22 plan. We desire to go out early in the year with it as much as we can, relative to our pricing actions. However, the pace at which we're able to implement that vis -a - vis the pace of inflation, we're not sure if you will when the curves will cross over from a standpoint. It's likely to be sort of late second quarter into the second half of the year, but I would say stay tuned. We're really still working on that. Maybe, yeah. Good morning or good afternoon, Gunther. Good to hear from you. I'll answer the second question first. Q4 pricing  rate from Q3 is going to be very consistent with Q3, so it's about 2 points. It's slightly higher in Q4 versus Q3. And as a result of that, actually the inflation pressures are going to slightly outpace once again within the quarter, just given the cost increases from the standpoint, just as a follow-up to that, really we are focused on aggressively implementing late this year into '22 on that front.  Of the full-year margin guidance and relative to the freight impact, we have about 200 basis points associated with cost. About 2/3 of that is pure rate and about 1/3 of that, or about 60 basis points is related to higher usages of freight, principally air and principally to support our H&D business because of capacity limitation, so that piece as Andreas had mentioned, will take us some time to work out through '22 as we address some of the capacity constraints. Sure. Good morning. So, as you recognize, we updated our guidance for this year relative to our full-year capex spend at 4%. And that's in part because of just the ability to execute our capital programs well. given all of the different priorities we have in the business and far that is just continuing to be more surgical I'll say, relative to our investing capital. We do anticipate that that will ramp up next year as we're putting together our '22 plans, largely focused on our higher margin and higher growth businesses.  And a big piece of that actually is really the bottlenecking and enhancing our capacity situation into next year. So, I'll say more to come around the plan standpoint. We had -- I think previously guided to having spent a little bit more capex around the business playing forward for capacity reasons. And then the other area I would just note although it's a much smaller portion around IT. So, IT through an integration activity. We have some additional activities as we go into next year as well. Good morning, Lauren. As a relative to our R&D sales and administrative expenses, as I mentioned, we are favorable to plan and down from prior year, but that is not R&D. Actually, R&D is trending right on plan. And by the way, of our roughly 2.1 billion of annual spend for RS&A, about 30% is, R&D, and the residual is fairly equally split between sales, our commercial team, and an administrative.  We're seeing actually more efficiencies in the commercial teams as they come together post-integration and the back-office. So, the administrative teams as well. So that's really where we're seeing and are pushing more of the productivity, not R&D, we're always looking for ways to more efficiently spend our R&D budget, but we sort of directionally want to make sure that we continue to stay within the guidance we provided relative to our ongoing R&D spend. Yeah, relative to -- good set of questions. It's relatively inflation, we're seeing higher rates in legacy N&B then IFF, although we're seeing inflation across all businesses. But generally, we're in mid-single-digit range for legacy IFF and then low double-digit relative to legacy N&B. Catch-up period, generally 3 to 6 months. Certain businesses like H&B may have slightly larger percentage that are either an annual contract or a multi-year, so they might be  slower. Well, I think one thing we have to consider is the legacy N&B businesses just has a higher ramp. So, the inflationary pressures are more significant in that side. So basically, it just requires, if you will, a bigger lift relative to the implementation from that standpoint."

I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter financial results and outlook for 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR Web site at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors stated in yesterday's press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is available on our Web site. Please note that we'll be using combined historical results for the second quarter, defined as three months of legacy IFF results and three months of legacy N&B results. And for the first half 2021, defined as six months of legacy IFF, January to June and five months of legacy N&B, February to June, in both the 2020 and '21 periods to allow comparability in light of the merger completion on February 1, 2021.  With me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Andreas Fibig; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Rustom Jilla. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have at the end. I would now like to turn the call over to Andreas.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our performance during the first half of 2021, followed by an update regarding our ongoing efforts to fully integrate the N&B business following the completion of the transaction in the first quarter of the year. Rustom will then provide a detailed review of our second quarter financials, highlighting segment level business performance and the market dynamics we saw in the quarter. Before we jump into the question-and-answer session, Rustom will also conclude with an overview of our expectations for the remainder of 2021. Now beginning with Slide 6, I would like to review our business highlights for the first half of the year. I'm pleased to report that IFF has delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, which is a robust acceleration versus our combined Q1 growth and through the first half of the year. As I've said before, execution is everything and IFS has delivered strong financial results, while advancing our ongoing integration efforts, following the completion of the N&B merger in February. In the first half of 2021, IFF achieved $5.6 billion in sales, representing 8% growth or 5% on a currency-neutral base. For comparable purposes and to reflect the portfolio differences between our peers, I want also to highlight that both businesses performed well with legacy IFF achieving a very strong high single digit growth rate with nearly 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and legacy N&B growing in mid single digits. At the same time, we continue to operate in a challenging global environment, with significant headwinds in material cost and supply chain logistics. In the first half, combined EBITDA growth was a solid 6% and a combined EBITDA margin of 22.5%. Importantly, our strong free cash flow of $533 million enables IFF to maintain significant financial flexibility, including our efforts to de-lever. We remain on track to achieve our deleveraging targets of under 3 times by year three post transaction close, and we improved our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA leverage from 4.3 times in the first quarter to 4.2 times in the second quarter. Finally, we are also well on track with integrating the N&B business and continue to realize synergies in line with our expectation for the transaction. As we sharpen the IFF portfolio, we continue to progress on the divestiture of our food preparation business, which we expect to be completed late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, the divestiture of this non-core business will create a more efficient IFF with an enhanced ability to grow and innovate across the key business segments. We are committed to ongoing active portfolio management and will continue to seek ways to increase value creation. Stepping back to reflect on the first half of the year. I'm very pleased with what we have been able to accomplish. We delivered strong sales growth, which is an acceleration versus historical performance for both legacy IFF and legacy N&B, in the midst of a transformational integration as well as a global pandemic. This is a validation of our strategy, motivates our team to continue defying industry expectations as we continue to see the benefits of our expanded product offering and capabilities. Long-term growth prospects of our business are strong, and we are making investments in capacity, R&D and plant technologies, as well as increasing inventory levels and incurring higher logistic costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim, specifically in the N&B business, as we maximize our growth opportunities going forward. As we look to the third quarter and second half of 2021, our objectives are clear, build on this momentum while executing on our integration plans, allowing IFF to fully leverage our new capabilities and achieve our long-term expectations. Turning to Slide 7. I would like to briefly discuss the regional sales dynamics that influenced our results for the first half. Despite persisting global challenges and varied economic recoveries, we are pleased to report growth in each of our four key operating regions. In North America, we achieved growth in all of our business segments, led by a single digit growth in Scent, Nourish and H&B. Similar to the first quarter, our Asian markets continue to perform well, achieving a 5% increase in sales led by double digit growth in India and a mid-single-digit performance in China. While we had anticipated that growth would have been impacted in India due to COVID in the second quarter, the business was resilient and finished higher than we expected with strong double-digit growth in Q2. From a segment perspective, in Asia, strong increases across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses all contributed to this sustained growth in this key region. Latin America, our strongest performing region, we achieved 12% sales growth, driven by double digit performance in nearly all of IFF business segments and underpinned by favorable currency movements and the impact in Brazil, Mexico and South Cone all achieved growth in the first half. We are particularly pleased to report that our EMEA region has impressively rebounded in the second quarter up to high single digits. We achieved a 2% increase in sales in the first half as COVID-19 related restrictions eased. Our Scent and Nourish business performed particularly well in Q2, both achieving double digit growth. Bearing any newly emerging COVID-19 challenges, we expect this growth to continue through the remainder of the year as global vaccination rates increase and Western and Central Europe continue to recover. Now turning to Slide 8. I will provide a more detailed look at our sales performance across IFF's key business segments through the first half of 2021, particularly those that significantly contributed to our overall 8% sales growth or 5% growth on a currency-neutral basis that I mentioned earlier. We are pleased to report solid growth across all of our four core divisions, Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Nourish achieved currency neutral growth of 6%, driven by a strong performance in flavors, ingredients and food design. Similar to the first quarter, Scent remains our largest sales driver on a year-to-date basis, achieving 8% in currency neutral growth led by a strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance. Our Health & Biosciences business has returned to solid growth in the second quarter, following a challenging first quarter where sales were affected by COVID-19 pressures in microbial control and grain processing. While microbial control continues to be challenged, for the first half, we saw growth in grain processing, which showed a recovery in the second quarter as well as home and personal care cultures and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Finally, our Pharma Solutions business also delivered growth to the first half of 2021 against a strong year ago comparison. On Slide 9, I would like to discuss the underlying dynamics influencing each of our four segments in the first half. As I mentioned, we saw broad based growth in all Nourish categories, led by robust performance in flavors. Despite strong volume and continued cost discipline, higher raw material costs continue to affect margin when compared to the first half of 2020. However, on a year-over-year basis, EBITDA grew about 7%. Our Health & Biosciences businesses delivered growth in the first half, led by strong performance in Home & Personal Care and grain processing. This growth offsets COVID-19 related pressures in microbial control and a strong year ago comparable in health. Higher logistic costs related to capacity and strong demand impacted our margin. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by this performance and expect continued improvement as we move into Q3. Our leading growth and profitability driver, Scent, achieved an operating EBITDA margin increase of 170 basis points and absolute EBITDA grew nearly 20%. This was driven by a strong rebound in Fine Fragrances as retail channels continue to recover, continued strength in Consumer Fragrances and double digit growth in Cosmetic Actives. Scent also delivered strong profitability led by higher volumes, favorable mix and higher productivity, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year. Lastly, in Pharma Solutions, the segment's 1% growth was driven primarily by improvements in industrials. So our margin was significantly challenged due to higher energy costs, lower manufacturing utilization and result in a weather related raw material shortages. Now on Slide 10 and 11, I would like to discuss our continued synergy progress in connection with our merger with N&B. From a revenue synergy perspective, we remain on track to meet our $20 million revenue synergy target this year. Coupled with continued demand and positive feedback from our customers, we are also confident in our ability to meet our 2024 run rate revenue synergy target of approximately $400 million. I would like to spend a moment highlighting how we realized this significant opportunity and share additional context on some of our recent wins. In only six months since completing the merger, we are already seeing strong affirmation in the opportunity before us. Our Home Care segment is a perfect example of how our expanded portfolio and combined capabilities with N&B delivers creative solutions for our customers and creates new opportunities for our business. Recently, our Health & Biosciences division saw an opportunity to collaborate with our Scent division, a global Scent customer expressed a need for enzyme technology and IFS capabilities across divisions allowed us to deliver an integrated solution and ultimately create a superior dishwashing detergent. Together with IFF's leading fragrance capabilities, our enzyme technology ensures fit-for-purpose delivery and performance, which creates a differentiated product for our customers. This opportunity represents more than $5 million in annual sales potential. At the same time, we're actively working with other customers across our IFF network to develop solutions that require capabilities across our four divisions. The food and beverage category, we continue to see demand for plant based meat alternatives that showcase the best of our expanded portfolio. For low sugar, low fat yogurt, we are introducing new flavor technologies with improved texture and speed to market, which are key advantages for our customers. Lastly, in our health category, we are developing an integrated solution for fiber gummy that leverages our unmatched scientific and technical expertise combined with our best-in-class flavor offering. These are just a few examples of the cross selling opportunities that we are seeing customers increasingly demand and differentiator for our business over the long term. We made significant strides in the second quarter from an integration perspective, ramping up our cost synergies from a few million dollars in the first quarter to a total of approximately $15 million on the first half basis. This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings program we have implemented in the second quarter, which allowed us to leverage our increased scale to reduce our indirect spend, benefit from various office consolidations and renegotiations and rightsize our organization. Additionally, because of our operational strengths and commitment to the integration process, early on, we were all able to accelerate exiting our various transition service agreements with DuPont. I'm very encouraged by the continued progress on this front, and we are on track to deliver at least $45 million cost synergies for the full year and ultimately, our three year run rate cost synergy target of $300 million. And now I will hand it over to Rustom.\nRustom Jilla: Thank you, Andreas. I will begin with an overview of our consolidated second quarter results on Slide 12. In Q2, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing 13% year-over-year increase or 9% on a combined currency neutral basis, primarily driven by double digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and a strong Health & Biosciences performance. Though our gross margin was pressured by higher input costs, raw materials and logistics inflation and higher air freight volumes, this was partly offset by our disciplined cost management practices, administrative expense reductions and cost synergies. This enabled us to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.50 for the second quarter. On Slide 13, I want to provide a perspective on sales performance in Q2 versus pre-COVID. There is no doubt that 2020 was an extraordinary year due to COVID-19, so it makes more sense to also evaluate our performance relative to 2019\u2019s levels. And as you can see, all four divisions in the second quarter delivered strong sales growth as compared to the space period. Total company sales were up 8% on a two year basis with double digit growth in Nourish and Pharma Solutions, a high single digit increase in Scent and mid single digit growth in H&B. With the exception of a handful, all of our subcategories have grown relative to their pre-COVID levels. Most notably, we are pleased to report that those categories most impacted by COVID-19 are ahead of their respective Q2 2019 levels, including Cosmetic Active, which is up double digits; Fine Fragrance, which is up high single digits; and Grain Processing, which is up low single digits. Foodservice and microbial control, while we had strong growth in the second quarter of 2021, remain below Q2 2019 levels but we expect will continue to improve as we move forward. This performance underscores the strength and diversity of our portfolio as well as our position as an essential partner to our customers. Now on the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the second quarter financials of each of our four divisions. Beginning with Nourish on Slide 14. Sales for the division increased by 15% year-over-year or 11% on a currency neutral basis, driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors, with Frutarom contributing to growth and a strong ingredients performance, particularly from our protein solutions, cellulosic, locus bean gum and food protection categories. Nourish also saw a strong rebound in food design, including a very strong 24% growth in foodservice as pandemic related restrictions continue to ease and consumer behavior in away from home channels continue to normalize. As I mentioned in the previous slide, higher raw material costs put relatively modest pressure on the margins at most of our individual segments, although we are pleased to have delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. Pricing continued to accelerate in Q2 and contributed over a percent of growth in the second quarter. As we will discuss later, we expect this will increase significantly in the third and fourth quarter as more of our pricing actions take hold. Turning to Slide 15. Our Health & Biosciences division saw year-over-year growth of 9% or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home and Personal Care. As Andreas mentioned earlier, we are particularly encouraged by Health & Biosciences return to growth this quarter, led by our microbial control and grain processing categories strong recoveries and from the industrial and supply chain challenges related to COVID-19. Performance in our health category was challenged based on the particularly strong double digit probiotics year-over-year comparison, although this did not offset the rest to the segment's growth, and we remain confident in the health category\u2019s trajectory moving forward. Health & Biosciences also delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5%. While you see that the division's margin was down this quarter, this was due to higher logistics costs in order to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long term growth and invest in R&D and plant technology to increase output later this year. We are incurring significantly higher airfreight costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim and this is impacting our EBITDA margin. Now turning to Slide 16 to discuss the results of our Scent division, which continued to be a standout growth contributor this quarter. Our Scent division generated $550 million in total sales, representing year-over-year growth of 16% or 13% on a currency neutral basis. Scent also achieved adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 34% with margin expansion of 300 basis points, driven by robust volume mix and productivity, which did offset some inflationary pressures. While Consumer Fragrances was down slightly this quarter against a very strong double digit year ago comparison, a significant rebound in Fine Fragrances, which grew by approximately 85%, led by new wins and improved volumes, more than offset Consumer Fragrance\u2019s more modest performance due to last year's double digit growth. Our ingredients category also contributed to the division's strong performance, growing double digits, led by strong performance in Cosmetic Active and Fragrance Ingredients. Overall, we are extremely pleased with Scent's continued strong performance. Lastly, turning to Slide 17 to discuss Pharma Solutions. Currency neutral sales were flat against a strong year ago comparison with industrial Pharma the most significant performance driver for this division, led by Global Specialty Solutions. Core Pharma's performance was challenged against a very strong year ago comparison. On a two year basis, growth was solid at about 3.5%. Adjusted operating EBITDA was pressured this quarter with the margin decline due to higher energy costs and lower manufacturing utilization due to a couple of plant shutdowns as a result of weather related raw material shortages. Specifically, we had raw material availability issues related to the Midwest storm in the US earlier this year, which meant we were not able to run production and absorb our fixed costs. Going forward, the supply chain is improving, which we expect will lead to stronger margins in Pharma Solutions for the balance of the year. Now turning to Slide 18. I'd like to review our cash flow position, leverage dynamics for the first half of 2021, which remain a top priority as we continue to navigate a recovering global market. As you will see in the first half, IFF generated $533 million in free cash flow with free cash flow from operations totaling $698 million, driven by an improvement in core working capital. CapEx for the first half totaled $165 million or approximately 3% of sales as we continue to invest in growth accretive areas that we believe will ultimately prove rewarding over the long term as well as integration related activities. In the first half, we also delivered $274 million in dividends to our shareholders. As we look ahead, we are confident that our cash generation will remain robust, and have announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend, marking the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases. From a leverage perspective, our cash and cash equivalents finished at $935 million with gross debt holding steady at $12 billion. Our trailing 12 month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.61 billion and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.2 times. We are slightly better than we expect to be at this point in time and we are still expecting to de-lever to below 3x net debt to EBITDA in the first three years post the transaction close. Now moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on our financial outlook for the full year 2021. IFF has built a solid foundation in the first half of the year and delivered particularly strong second quarter performance. And we expect strong growth will continue through the rest of the year. For the full year 2021, we are once again increasing our forecast for total revenues with an expectation to achieve 2021 total revenues of approximately $11.4 billion, which equates to about 7% growth. This is up from our previous $11.25 billion or 6% growth as we have confidence in our sales momentum continuing into Q3 and through the rest of the year. Breaking down the contributors of growth, we expect currency neutral sales to be about 5% and FX benefits to be approximately 2%. While pandemic related uncertainties persist, we are encouraged by the strong performance and important recoveries we are seeing across the business, which we believe position us well to capture continued strong sales growth in Q3 and Q4. At the same time, we now see full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin at about 22.5% versus approximately 23% previously. A part of this reduction is related to our margin performance in Q2 for all the reasons I explained earlier. We also continue to see inflationary pressures across the supply chain. From a raw material perspective, we have seen raw material costs continue to increase over the course of the year. In the first half, we are successful in raising our prices to recover a portion of the cost increases and continue to expect close to full cost recovery in the second half. It should be noted that we're also seeing more broad based non-raw material inflation, such as higher energy costs that we are managing through. Our expectations for airfreight has also increased significantly as rates are higher but mostly higher volumes to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We are absorbing higher logistics costs to grow the business in the short term and expect this is only temporary until our capacity expansion projects are complete. The combination of unfavorable price to raw material costs and higher logistics costs are negatively impacting operating margin in 2021 by more than 100 basis points. However, through higher sales, strong cost discipline and our focus on unlocking additional cost synergies, we believe we will end up only about 50 basis points lower than our previous expectations with higher revenues and a roughly similar dollar EBITDA level. For modeling purposes, please note that depreciation and amortization, interest expense, CapEx as a percentage of sales, adjusted effective tax rate, excluding amortization and weighted average diluted share counts, all remain the same as what we shared in Q1. Overall, we are confident that we are well placed to continue capturing additional growth over the next two quarters and beyond, while maintaining our focus on execution, continued financial discipline and leveraging our significantly bolstered resources and expertise as a stronger, more diversified company. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Andreas who will provide some closing remarks before we open the line for our question-and-answer session.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Rustom, and thanks again to all of joining us today. Before I wrap up today's call, I would like to first recognize our thousands of employees around the world who continue to display their unwavering commitment to serve our customers, unify our teams together with N&B and deliver for our communities. Despite the uncertain environment that we have continued to navigate, IFF's first half and Q2 results showcased the strengths of our combined portfolio and our ability to execute our ambitious business objectives. And I'm incredibly proud to lead such a talented and passionate group of IFF-ers. We have much to be proud of this quarter as we move ahead. I'm confident that we have built the financial and operational structures needed for our combined company to reach even greater heights. As Rustom and I have mentioned, we are targeting a strong full year performance, indicative of our post pandemic aspirations and I know we are exceptionally positioned to achieve this. And we are seeing the strong top line momentum continue in the early days of the third quarter. Together, we will further our mission to be an innovative force for good and redefine what it means to be a leader in a global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator:  And we'll take our first question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: I guess the question is more around sales guidance. So I guess, why not raise more considering the strong second quarter result? Obviously, comparisons remain favorable over the back half of the year. Rustom talked about incremental pricing. So maybe if you could just talk about that generally? And then related to that, was there any borrowing in 2Q from the back half of the year? Is that something that we should listen for watch for kind of thing and how do you think about that? And then on pricing, how do you think about the increase in pricing, which seems to be much more around the DB portfolio and thinking about the elasticity there relative to the legacy business?\nAndreas Fibig: Let me get started on it, and then Rustom is talking about the pricing. So first of all, your second question, there's no borrowing from the third quarter for the second quarter. I think that's important. Number two is what is driving us and the strong performance in the second quarter and also the start into the third quarter, because July we had the sales already. So it's a strong win rate. It's a very robust demand we are seeing. In some areas, it is also a superior technology, in particular in parts of the enzyme business and a really good R&D pipeline here as well. So the question now is why we are not going higher. Look, it's a  environment for us right now and as for everybody else. So we have now the COVID Delta variant. And we said, look, let's be careful here what we do, we\u2019re not getting ahead of our skis here and make sure that we have a very realistic target on the sales side. And Rustom, if you could talk a bit about volume and pricing that would be probably helpful.\nRustom Jilla: Look, our focus on the second half is on ensuring that we achieve the pricing needed to recover raw material and logistics costs. We do recognize we had very strong growth in Q2, predominantly volume driven. But also, I mean, there is uncertainty out there with Delta COVID, as you heard. So we've calibrated our guidance. We think appropriately to manage performance, risk and the need for pricing. And the composition is a bit different of our first half and second half growth. I mean in the second half, we're expecting that, on average, pricing will contribute close to 2.5 points of growth with volumes at a similar level. So this is all without FX of course.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Andreas, just curious, you sounded pretty positive on the sales synergy momentum that the teams are putting together. Any thoughts or any changes in the contribution potential in '22 and maybe even the second half of this year?\nAndreas Fibig: Mike, so we are very, very confident that we achieved what we have set for this year. Second year, we will see how the run rate turns out. I'm very impressed actually what the teams are doing. I'll give you a couple of examples. I did know since we are going a little bit lighter on the pandemic. I did a good trip in the US and in Europe actually twice. And I saw what the power is combining, let\u2019s say, an ingredient sale with a flavor sale. So I'm really optimistic that we are, let's say, are moving in the right direction. But it's probably too early to raise the forecast already for next year. That might be in the next call where we can take a very detailed look. The most important thing for me is how natural the teams are already combining ingredients at Flavors, for example, and what kind of opportunities we have in areas like the Home Care with superior edition washing detergents, for example, and in the health area as well, which were not so much on our forefront when we started this all endeavor. And that's really good. So I'm optimistic but it's probably too early to raise it right now. Okay, Mike?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: So I wanted to ask a little bit more about Health & Biosciences. I know you had previously talked about capacity constraints in that business due to elevated demand. So maybe I was expecting higher growth in that segment because of this, but I wonder if your capacity constraints sort of limited the growth potential this particular quarter? And if you think growth should accelerate in the back half or if there's any other color you can provide sort of within the various subsegments within Health & Biosciences to help us think about the business going forward?\nAndreas Fibig: Absolutely, Faiza, and that's a very core part of our portfolio. And we see for almost all the enzyme categories, we see a really robust demand and in some areas, really our superiority in technology as well. So answering your question, we had probably more demand than we could satisfy. And our priority right now in this business is actually to debottleneck some of our manufacturing parts, investing in more, let's say, manufacturing lines and making sure that in the next, let's say, 12 to 15 months, we are really able to deliver the strong demand here. So indeed, we had more demand than we could deliver and we are working now really 24/7 to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity. I don't know, Rustom, whether you want to add anything?\nRustom Jilla: I mean, look, strong demand in enzymes has led to the tight capacity in the short term. But to be clear, capacity is not a medium or long term constraint. And Andreas covered everything else.\nFaiza Alwy: Just to be clear then \u2026\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from\u2026\nAndreas Fibig: Operator, Faiza, if you want to jump back on the line that would be great, you cut out .\nFaiza Alwy: I thought you guys were moving on to the next question. But I just wanted to clarify the capacity constraints aren't going to be listed in the back half, it's more of a longer term solution. So more thinking ahead to 2022. Is that the right way to think about it?\nAndreas Fibig: Yes, some of it in the fourth quarter but most the bulk of it in 2022. Yes, absolutely.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to John Roberts with UBS.\nJohn Roberts: You mentioned active portfolio management. Do you anticipate any more significant divestments to accelerate debt reduction?\nAndreas Fibig: I would say, at the moment, we're working hard to look at what we do with our portfolio. It's probably too early to say something more in detail. Yes, that's probably, and I don't know Rustom, if you want to say anything?\nRustom Jilla: No, I wouldn't add anything.\nJohn Roberts: Secondly, there's continued to be some turnover among the senior management team. How concerned should we be about that?\nAndreas Fibig: Look, we are always concerned if we have a turnover on the management team. So far, I think we keep it in a way that we make sure that we are really firing on all cylinders and that we find the right people. Because it's a big task we have here right now on one hand, delivering on our numbers, integrating the businesses and then we are still in the pandemic, which makes it not easier. But in general, I think we have it very well under control. And as you can see, most of these units are performing actually very, very, very well and we expect the same actually for the third quarter as well.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein.\nGunther Zechmann: A couple of questions, please. Firstly, on raw materials. You continue to guide for 5% for this year. Is that sort of time of the year where you start supply negotiations for next year as well? How should we think about that more like a two year stack of 5% each, or what do you see in those negotiations, please? And then secondly, on the Nourish and the strong growth there. It's quite remarkable, not just the growth in itself but also versus Sivanto and Symrise that you outperformed. And I appreciate there's been one extra working day in that, but that still outperformed. So can you talk about the sustainability of growth versus peers going forward and what's driven the outperformance in the quarter? How much of that is just food services and portfolio mix and how much is win rates, please?\nRustom Jilla: Andreas, you want to take that and then I'll \u2026\nAndreas Fibig: Let me get started. So yes, we are very optimistic on the Nourish right now, also in comparison to some of our peers. And there's a lot of good wins coming in, very strong wins, particularly on the flavor side, and it's really good for what we see the pipeline is pretty filled. We see as well that now having the ingredients helps us to open up customers for flavors, because you do always with the CPGs, first, the ingredient sales and then the flavor sales. And the dynamic right now is if we see an ingredient sales, we try to cross sell already the flavors, which is working actually quite nicely. So win rates are really good and strong. The demand is very, very robust, what we see as well. And we started being very short term, strong because Nourish as well, actually super strong into the third quarter. And Rustom, if you could talk about the raw mats, that will be really good.\nRustom Jilla: Actually, we're looking at closer to about 5.5% now. We've seen continued inflation in logistics and in raw materials. So yes, we have started the Nigerias getting close to starting negotiations and working on all of that. But Gunther, at this point in time, we are not seeing any deceleration in inflation. In fact, if anything, we're seeing it continuing and exacerbating, in general. It actually has a -- there's another impact to this as well, because even when we recover 100% of the cost increases, I mean that does push down our operating margin. And you can actually go and take the -- just do the math, anyone interested. You go back and pick a number, even add like $225 million of cost and $225 million of price recovery to our 2020 results and keep everything else unchanged, and that alone takes about 50 basis points of our operating margin, that's just pure math. So I mean there's different factors in here.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: So I was hoping maybe it kind of ties off the last question, but maybe thinking a little bit longer term. How do we think about the cost pressures and inflation this year? You're going after pricing aggressively to recover that. How do we think about that impacting some of the -- or the trajectory impacting the medium term targets around revenue growth, around EBITDA margins by 2023? Did it have any impact in terms of the timing of synergy capture over the next 12 to 24 months? Because I know procurement was a big part, a big bucket in terms of the targeted cost synergies. I'm just trying to think about how the experience this year and some of the market dynamics at play impact the forward trajectory?\nAndreas Fibig: And I have to say that was a big focus for our team right now to look because we didn't get the procurement savings in the second quarter we wanted, and probably not in the third. So we shifted actually pretty agile, the way how we deliver the synergies. So it was more cost out in particular in terms of headcount in other areas as well. And we are now planning for next year getting more of the synergies from procurement and then certainly in 2023 because, at some point in time, it will ease. So I think we did a good job to just, let's say, reachc shift where we get it from. On the revenue growth, before I hand it over to Rustom on EBITDA, it is certainly positive because you will see also carryover effect into next year on the sales line if you have raised the prices, which is good and good to see for us. But I guess everybody in that marketplace is doing it right now. But Rustom, if you can talk about the cost pressures, in general? How you see it and the EBITDA margin.\nRustom Jilla: Like I said, I mean, the impact of the -- even with full recovery, it depresses our operating margin. If you look at some of the other factors we're getting this year, it's not so bad, like capacity expansion projects as we talked about with Pfizer, they come online in 2022. So the negative air freight impact that we are seeing will go away when you think by the time you come into 2023. And yes, so we recognize the 26% numbers a little further away from where it is right now compared to when we are there. But as we started, it's three year number and we are committed to it. And what we're looking at is so far this year we've got stronger sales. And as you can see, slightly lower op margin than we expected.\nAndreas Fibig: Actually a good point Rustom is making, because a big portion of it is driven by airfreight. And as soon as we have enough capacity available, we will reduce the airfreight quite significantly, which is super helpful on the cost side as well.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.\nJeff Zekauskas: Why were Scent margins up year-over-year and Nourish margins down? Was it that Scent had a better pricing dynamic or is there some other factor, and how large is the fruit preparations business?\nRustom Jilla: So let me take the part of that. So most of the cost increases that the raw material draft cost increases that we've seen coming through and are still coming through are impacting Nourish. I mean if you think about $220 million-ish sort of cost hit that we're having right now, a part of which is freight rates, not the freight volume that Andreas and I talked about, but freights. Probably close to 80% is impacting Nourish. And it's a few specific areas, it's soy meal, soy protein, that's the biggest one that we see there. There's LBK, lotus bean kernel that's very close behind. And then there's also like vegetable oils, propylene glycol, stuff like that. I mean the Scent business, the impact turpentine cedarwood, it's there, and it's coming in, but it's coming in more in the back half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year, and it was smaller compared to Nourish. Nourish is where we had the biggest impact. So that's what you're really seeing driving the business there.\nJeff Zekauskas: And the fruit preparation business, how big is that?\nRustom Jilla: That's a small business. I don't know if we've -- the seller wanted us to disclose that, so I won't. But we have been talking, it's a very small and sub-$100 million. How is that\u2026\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I guess first thing was just with the comments that you expect legacy IFF to be up double digits for the balance of the year, which is really impressive set of expectations. I think it would imply that the N&B side of the house would be decelerating pretty considerably. I mean it sounds like that might be due to the capacity constraints. But I was just curious if you could comment on that first?\nAndreas Fibig: Rustom, you want to take it?\nRustom Jilla: Actually, the comment is that in Q2, heritage IFF currency neutral growth was low double digits and in Q2, N&B's current leg heritage N&B\u2019s currency neutral growth was mid single digits. I mean I think that's -- so I mean I thought perhaps it was it, Andreas?\nAndreas Fibig: No, actually, look, what we see is we'll recover in the second half in pharma, because we are recovering some of it through all the cold snap we had in the Midwest. So that will come back but probably not to the degree we have to demand. And on the Health & Bioscience piece, it's certainly driven by our manufacturing capacity, which is limited but also with higher comps we will see for the last two quarters. So we will see how it goes. We are very careful here on this side but it will be more positive than what we have seen in the first quarter. Certainly, we saw already an acceleration in the second quarter and it will go in the right direction. So we are observing it quite carefully. What I can tell you also in the third quarter, the legacy N&B businesses had a pretty strong start. And then certainly, part of it is in the Nourish business as well and reflected in the Nourish numbers, in particular, the Ingredients business, we should not underestimate that. And by the way, having you on, I hope you have seen the really strong performance of Fine Fragrances, which are really going in the right direction, helping with the mix on the Scent side quite significantly.\nLauren Lieberman: Yes, absolutely. And I also know that IFF has had a number of the big new launches in the industry or IFF perfumer work. So I've definitely seen that. I had one more question, though, on the capacity additions and that you're still going a little bit about so far. I was curious to the degree as you've now gotten further in with the N&B business, if it feels like perhaps that's been a bit underinvested and whether it was in the 12 to 15 months prior to deal close or even before that, because the need to be investing in CapEx, the call out of higher than expected logistics separate from rate. But just again, because of these capacity airfreight and so on suggests that there's something there. So just curious about that. Are you yet to a point where this could be a multiyear period of investment in capacity, not just one year you've got the cash flow but just curious about that.\nAndreas Fibig: No, it's a good point, Lauren. And I would say there are two things which come together. One is the very robust demand and a lot of wins we had in particular on the enzyme piece and that came a bit of a surprise to the unit. So that's where we need some investment here to deliver on it. I would not say it was underinvested but it was probably also through the pandemic, not on the real time horizon. We could have had some of the expansion already probably six months earlier than we would be in a better position. But it is as it is. And we have now adapted our CapEx plan going forward that we can deal with these, let's say, shortages quite nicely over the next, I would say, 15 months. The positive for me is that demand is very robust. And the other positive is that we see some superiority of our products in that market, which is really good. And there's something which we haven't talked too much because it might be more midterm but the R&D pipeline, in particular, what comes from N&B is super strong and it will help us with our wins going forward. I don't know, Rustom, do you have anything to add?\nRustom Jilla: I guess, Andreas, I mean just think -- Lauren, it is a little bit of multiyear. I mean we're probably going to spend about another $450 million in total, but it's actually good. We can use more. We've got good strong business. I mean, I view this as a positive and we have the cash flow and so we're going to use it.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi: Andreas, just kind of thinking about your portfolio at this point. Obviously, mobility is starting to directionally improve globally and you're seeing the impact on Food Service and Fine Fragrances and some other businesses. On the same token, you're seeing CPG companies talk about moderation at volumes, whether it's food or just consumer products more broadly. So how do you see those dynamics sort of netting out for IFF as we progress over the next couple of quarters? Do you see categories that are starting to moderate? And if so, would that affect the sales growth that you're anticipating at this point?\nAndreas Fibig: I would say if I go to the different categories, we see still strong demand for Fine Fragrances. And this is not just driven by the robust demand right now but also by our win rate. We are winning more than our fair share and that's very, very helpful. Consumer Fragrance, here, I would say, in general, for the market, you see a moderation and that's what you hear in the market from the big CPGs as well. But again, we are in the good position or lucky position that we are on all the core lists we wanted to be. And then we talked over the last couple of quarters about the street callers we made a year and half ago and they are really contributing. So that's helpful for us. But in general, we see some moderation. Another one is active cosmetics. We see a big, big and strong growth going forward. On Health & Bioscience, I would say, very strong in Home and Personal Care, but more driven by our wins and our technology than by the whole market. So that's what I would say. And then grain processing and microbial control are coming back out of, let's say, modest performance in last year. And animal nutrition is pretty good as well. On the Nourish side, I would say we haven't seen any slowing down of demand. And that might be also driven because we are now in a unique position that we can offer from the ingredient, to the flavor, to the total solution that we are in a different position than many of our competitors and that helps us actually to position us in the right way. So answering your question is we see some markets, we see the market's moderation, but not too much for us because of the position where we're in right now. So that will be my overall comment.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc.\nMark Connelly: Andreas, when you think about COVID reopening, what are the big opportunities if we continue to move along? And what are the risks if we all start to mask up and away from home dining gets hit. I'm just trying to get a sense of where you are ex health and wellness, because as you just point out, you're in a very different position than you were when we went into COVID?\nAndreas Fibig: I would say, if we're starting to close down, again, if the delta variants really proving dangerous for us. I would say the food service is the only business I could think of right now, which could be impacted, maybe fine fragrance. But what we have seen is much more online usage but these are the two categories where I see an impact, or a negative impact. On the other hand, if the close down comes, I would say that Consumer Fragrances, in particular, in terms of the health and the hygiene products, are going up. And as you said, on the health side as well because people are trying to fortify their food, trying to be healthy, getting more probiotics in. And so I would say we have at least as many opportunities as we have risk to another close down. So that's how I would describe it for now.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question  with Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just quickly, you had good growth in Scent, particularly 85% growth in Fine Fragrance. Are you back to pre-pandemic levels in Fine Fragrance? And was there any inventory building in the Fine Fragrance channel that we should think about?\nAndreas Fibig: We are even outperforming our 2019 number. And this quarter will show whether there's an inventory building or not because now they're starting to order for the Christmas business. And so far, it's a strong start into the third quarter. So I would say not so much inventory building and then there's an extra effect on our side for Fine Fragrances that we are winning really a lot of business and a lot of good fragrances as well, which are very nicely marketed. So that's how I would describe it. I don't know, Rustom, anything to add from your side?\nRustom Jilla: No, that covered it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America.\nMatthew DeYoe: So questions for you on the margin and margin outlook. I guess, first, what happened to pharma cost? Can you dig in a little bit more on that? It seems like you're blaming, Yuri, but that was mid-February. And so how do you improve from there going forward, at what rate do we climb out of this hole? And then if I look at the 100 basis points of margin hit you mentioned, Rustom. Can you break that down a little bit between what would be raw material energy inflation type stuff that the whole industry would be experiencing? And maybe what percent of that 100 basis points is unique to IFF given air freighting capacity issues, outages, et cetera?\nRustom Jilla: So let me do the first one. I mean, yes, it came from the February outages but there's still been problems with the suppliers and the force majeure type situations, with methachloride. And it shut down two of our plants temporarily during the period, which meant that it's a pity because we could have sold every single thing we produced, obviously, and then we also had underutilization. So that's what came through there. If I was to roughly look at the break in general, at the percentages in general between raw material and freight about, call it, 85% or so of the total comes from raw material increases and about 15% from freight. But interestingly, freight is a much smaller portion. If you break up that 5.5% that we talked about, the material cost impact is probably about 5% inflation we're seeing. I'm rounding all these numbers. And the freight rate increase is probably about 8% and may even be slightly higher with the way that's going. I mean containers are 3 times to 4 times sea freight as high as they've been. And also, there's one more complication even when we have contracted rates we and many others experienced, there's lots of delays going on and stuff. So we sometimes book -- we can't get the stuff on the contracted rate still much later and have to pick spot rates. And we\u2019re also forced sometimes to look at different modes of transport from a reliability perspective. So a lot's going on there.\nOperator: And there appears to be one last question. We'll take our final question from Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley.\nLisa De Neve: Two questions from me, and then follow-up. So back to the Scents and care business, I mean, you delivered very strong margins. Can you share to which extent this was related to favorable product mix towards Fine Fragrance and Active, and how we expect this to trend in second half given raw materials were kicking in a little bit more meaningfully? But at the same time, you did mention you were still going to see relatively good demand for Fine Fragrance. That's my first question. The second one, early in the presentation, you mentioned that in the second half, you may see a fairly similar contribution from pricing, about 2.5% and 2.5% from volumes. And I'm just trying to understand why you're being so cautious on the volume side, or maybe I just misunderstood this.\nAndreas Fibig: Rustom, can you take it?\nRustom Jilla: I mean on the volume side, I mean, our focus in the second half is on ensuring that we get pricing to recover raw material costs. We're trying to recover close to 100%, and that is really important to being able to the EBITDA and the numbers there. And we did have very strong growth in Q2, predominantly volume driven. And so what we've -- our guidance, Lisa, in the second half is sort of we're trying to guide to manage performance, risk and the need for pricing again. So that's really what you're seeing over there. And on the first part of your question, I mean, yes, for the Scent business, the margin expansion was really driven by the mix for sure. I mean, for sure. I mean when you have Fine Fragrances going up 85%, that's tremendous. So it was mixed but there's also volume growth, in general. I mean you've seen Cosmetic Active was super as well and then productivity, and that offset inflationary pressures and costs which you're seeing there as well. And in the second half, we'll see more costs coming the way of the Scent business, not on the scale of nourishing what we've seen. Anything to add there, Andreas?\nAndreas Fibig: No, I think you captured it very, very well. I just want to make a general remark on mix. Obviously, we try for all businesses now to push basically all the parts of the portfolio, which have the higher profitability and the higher growth areas, which over time should really help us with mix. And I think what you see with Scent, it's something which is a very positive driver for our profitability going forward.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Andreas for any closing remarks.\nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Thank you. We are incredibly proud on the second quarter because, again, as we said, first of all, we delivered strong growth, even in comparison to 2019, which is real good parameter here. Secondly, we\u2019re integrating well with the N&B business and we do it in time of a pandemic. And I think, again, I would like to use the time to congratulate all of our teams around the globe for what they have accomplished. And I think it\u2019s not an easy task and everybody did really as best and that\u2019s where IFF stands for. Thank you for that, and talk to most of you later. Thank you guys. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rustom Jilla",
            "content": "Thank you, Andreas. I will begin with an overview of our consolidated second quarter results on Slide 12. In Q2, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing 13% year-over-year increase or 9% on a combined currency neutral basis, primarily driven by double digit growth in our Nourish and Scent divisions and a strong Health & Biosciences performance. Though our gross margin was pressured by higher input costs, raw materials and logistics inflation and higher air freight volumes, this was partly offset by our disciplined cost management practices, administrative expense reductions and cost synergies. This enabled us to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.50 for the second quarter. On Slide 13, I want to provide a perspective on sales performance in Q2 versus pre-COVID. There is no doubt that 2020 was an extraordinary year due to COVID-19, so it makes more sense to also evaluate our performance relative to 2019's levels. And as you can see, all four divisions in the second quarter delivered strong sales growth as compared to the space period. Total company sales were up 8% on a two year basis with double digit growth in Nourish and Pharma Solutions, a high single digit increase in Scent and mid single digit growth in H&B. With the exception of a handful, all of our subcategories have grown relative to their pre-COVID levels. Most notably, we are pleased to report that those categories most impacted by COVID-19 are ahead of their respective Q2 2019 levels, including Cosmetic Active, which is up double digits; Fine Fragrance, which is up high single digits; and Grain Processing, which is up low single digits. Foodservice and microbial control, while we had strong growth in the second quarter of 2021, remain below Q2 2019 levels but we expect will continue to improve as we move forward. This performance underscores the strength and diversity of our portfolio as well as our position as an essential partner to our customers. Now on the next few slides, I will dive deeper into the second quarter financials of each of our four divisions. Beginning with Nourish on Slide 14. Sales for the division increased by 15% year-over-year or 11% on a currency neutral basis, driven by robust double-digit growth in Flavors, with Frutarom contributing to growth and a strong ingredients performance, particularly from our protein solutions, cellulosic, locus bean gum and food protection categories. Nourish also saw a strong rebound in food design, including a very strong 24% growth in foodservice as pandemic related restrictions continue to ease and consumer behavior in away from home channels continue to normalize. As I mentioned in the previous slide, higher raw material costs put relatively modest pressure on the margins at most of our individual segments, although we are pleased to have delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7%. Pricing continued to accelerate in Q2 and contributed over a percent of growth in the second quarter. As we will discuss later, we expect this will increase significantly in the third and fourth quarter as more of our pricing actions take hold. Turning to Slide 15. Our Health & Biosciences division saw year-over-year growth of 9% or 5% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in Home and Personal Care. As Andreas mentioned earlier, we are particularly encouraged by Health & Biosciences return to growth this quarter, led by our microbial control and grain processing categories strong recoveries and from the industrial and supply chain challenges related to COVID-19. Performance in our health category was challenged based on the particularly strong double digit probiotics year-over-year comparison, although this did not offset the rest to the segment's growth, and we remain confident in the health category's trajectory moving forward. Health & Biosciences also delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5%. While you see that the division's margin was down this quarter, this was due to higher logistics costs in order to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We have increased capacity investments in this business to support long term growth and invest in R&D and plant technology to increase output later this year. We are incurring significantly higher airfreight costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim and this is impacting our EBITDA margin. Now turning to Slide 16 to discuss the results of our Scent division, which continued to be a standout growth contributor this quarter. Our Scent division generated $550 million in total sales, representing year-over-year growth of 16% or 13% on a currency neutral basis. Scent also achieved adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 34% with margin expansion of 300 basis points, driven by robust volume mix and productivity, which did offset some inflationary pressures. While Consumer Fragrances was down slightly this quarter against a very strong double digit year ago comparison, a significant rebound in Fine Fragrances, which grew by approximately 85%, led by new wins and improved volumes, more than offset Consumer Fragrance's more modest performance due to last year's double digit growth. Our ingredients category also contributed to the division's strong performance, growing double digits, led by strong performance in Cosmetic Active and Fragrance Ingredients. Overall, we are extremely pleased with Scent's continued strong performance. Lastly, turning to Slide 17 to discuss Pharma Solutions. Currency neutral sales were flat against a strong year ago comparison with industrial Pharma the most significant performance driver for this division, led by Global Specialty Solutions. Core Pharma's performance was challenged against a very strong year ago comparison. On a two year basis, growth was solid at about 3.5%. Adjusted operating EBITDA was pressured this quarter with the margin decline due to higher energy costs and lower manufacturing utilization due to a couple of plant shutdowns as a result of weather related raw material shortages. Specifically, we had raw material availability issues related to the Midwest storm in the US earlier this year, which meant we were not able to run production and absorb our fixed costs. Going forward, the supply chain is improving, which we expect will lead to stronger margins in Pharma Solutions for the balance of the year. Now turning to Slide 18. I'd like to review our cash flow position, leverage dynamics for the first half of 2021, which remain a top priority as we continue to navigate a recovering global market. As you will see in the first half, IFF generated $533 million in free cash flow with free cash flow from operations totaling $698 million, driven by an improvement in core working capital. CapEx for the first half totaled $165 million or approximately 3% of sales as we continue to invest in growth accretive areas that we believe will ultimately prove rewarding over the long term as well as integration related activities. In the first half, we also delivered $274 million in dividends to our shareholders. As we look ahead, we are confident that our cash generation will remain robust, and have announced that we are raising our quarterly dividend, marking the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases. From a leverage perspective, our cash and cash equivalents finished at $935 million with gross debt holding steady at $12 billion. Our trailing 12 month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.61 billion and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.2 times. We are slightly better than we expect to be at this point in time and we are still expecting to de-lever to below 3x net debt to EBITDA in the first three years post the transaction close. Now moving to Slide 19. I'd like to provide an update on our financial outlook for the full year 2021. IFF has built a solid foundation in the first half of the year and delivered particularly strong second quarter performance. And we expect strong growth will continue through the rest of the year. For the full year 2021, we are once again increasing our forecast for total revenues with an expectation to achieve 2021 total revenues of approximately $11.4 billion, which equates to about 7% growth. This is up from our previous $11.25 billion or 6% growth as we have confidence in our sales momentum continuing into Q3 and through the rest of the year. Breaking down the contributors of growth, we expect currency neutral sales to be about 5% and FX benefits to be approximately 2%. While pandemic related uncertainties persist, we are encouraged by the strong performance and important recoveries we are seeing across the business, which we believe position us well to capture continued strong sales growth in Q3 and Q4. At the same time, we now see full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin at about 22.5% versus approximately 23% previously. A part of this reduction is related to our margin performance in Q2 for all the reasons I explained earlier. We also continue to see inflationary pressures across the supply chain. From a raw material perspective, we have seen raw material costs continue to increase over the course of the year. In the first half, we are successful in raising our prices to recover a portion of the cost increases and continue to expect close to full cost recovery in the second half. It should be noted that we're also seeing more broad based non-raw material inflation, such as higher energy costs that we are managing through. Our expectations for airfreight has also increased significantly as rates are higher but mostly higher volumes to balance robust customer demand and available capacity. We are absorbing higher logistics costs to grow the business in the short term and expect this is only temporary until our capacity expansion projects are complete. The combination of unfavorable price to raw material costs and higher logistics costs are negatively impacting operating margin in 2021 by more than 100 basis points. However, through higher sales, strong cost discipline and our focus on unlocking additional cost synergies, we believe we will end up only about 50 basis points lower than our previous expectations with higher revenues and a roughly similar dollar EBITDA level. For modeling purposes, please note that depreciation and amortization, interest expense, CapEx as a percentage of sales, adjusted effective tax rate, excluding amortization and weighted average diluted share counts, all remain the same as what we shared in Q1. Overall, we are confident that we are well placed to continue capturing additional growth over the next two quarters and beyond, while maintaining our focus on execution, continued financial discipline and leveraging our significantly bolstered resources and expertise as a stronger, more diversified company. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Andreas who will provide some closing remarks before we open the line for our question-and-answer session. Look, our focus on the second half is on ensuring that we achieve the pricing needed to recover raw material and logistics costs. We do recognize we had very strong growth in Q2, predominantly volume driven. But also, I mean, there is uncertainty out there with Delta COVID, as you heard. So we've calibrated our guidance. We think appropriately to manage performance, risk and the need for pricing. And the composition is a bit different of our first half and second half growth. I mean in the second half, we're expecting that, on average, pricing will contribute close to 2.5 points of growth with volumes at a similar level. So this is all without FX of course. I mean, look, strong demand in enzymes has led to the tight capacity in the short term. But to be clear, capacity is not a medium or long term constraint. And Andreas covered everything else. No, I wouldn't add anything. Andreas, you want to take that and then I'll ... Actually, we're looking at closer to about 5.5% now. We've seen continued inflation in logistics and in raw materials. So yes, we have started the Nigerias getting close to starting negotiations and working on all of that. But Gunther, at this point in time, we are not seeing any deceleration in inflation. In fact, if anything, we're seeing it continuing and exacerbating, in general. It actually has a -- there's another impact to this as well, because even when we recover 100% of the cost increases, I mean that does push down our operating margin. And you can actually go and take the -- just do the math, anyone interested. You go back and pick a number, even add like $225 million of cost and $225 million of price recovery to our 2020 results and keep everything else unchanged, and that alone takes about 50 basis points of our operating margin, that's just pure math. So I mean there's different factors in here. Like I said, I mean, the impact of the -- even with full recovery, it depresses our operating margin. If you look at some of the other factors we're getting this year, it's not so bad, like capacity expansion projects as we talked about with Pfizer, they come online in 2022. So the negative air freight impact that we are seeing will go away when you think by the time you come into 2023. And yes, so we recognize the 26% numbers a little further away from where it is right now compared to when we are there. But as we started, it's three year number and we are committed to it. And what we're looking at is so far this year we've got stronger sales. And as you can see, slightly lower op margin than we expected. So let me take the part of that. So most of the cost increases that the raw material draft cost increases that we've seen coming through and are still coming through are impacting Nourish. I mean if you think about $220 million-ish sort of cost hit that we're having right now, a part of which is freight rates, not the freight volume that Andreas and I talked about, but freights. Probably close to 80% is impacting Nourish. And it's a few specific areas, it's soy meal, soy protein, that's the biggest one that we see there. There's LBK, lotus bean kernel that's very close behind. And then there's also like vegetable oils, propylene glycol, stuff like that. I mean the Scent business, the impact turpentine cedarwood, it's there, and it's coming in, but it's coming in more in the back half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year, and it was smaller compared to Nourish. Nourish is where we had the biggest impact. So that's what you're really seeing driving the business there. That's a small business. I don't know if we've -- the seller wanted us to disclose that, so I won't. But we have been talking, it's a very small and sub-$100 million. How is that... Actually, the comment is that in Q2, heritage IFF currency neutral growth was low double digits and in Q2, N&B's current leg heritage N&B's currency neutral growth was mid single digits. I mean I think that's -- so I mean I thought perhaps it was it, Andreas? I guess, Andreas, I mean just think -- Lauren, it is a little bit of multiyear. I mean we're probably going to spend about another $450 million in total, but it's actually good. We can use more. We've got good strong business. I mean, I view this as a positive and we have the cash flow and so we're going to use it. No, that covered it. So let me do the first one. I mean, yes, it came from the February outages but there's still been problems with the suppliers and the force majeure type situations, with methachloride. And it shut down two of our plants temporarily during the period, which meant that it's a pity because we could have sold every single thing we produced, obviously, and then we also had underutilization. So that's what came through there. If I was to roughly look at the break in general, at the percentages in general between raw material and freight about, call it, 85% or so of the total comes from raw material increases and about 15% from freight. But interestingly, freight is a much smaller portion. If you break up that 5.5% that we talked about, the material cost impact is probably about 5% inflation we're seeing. I'm rounding all these numbers. And the freight rate increase is probably about 8% and may even be slightly higher with the way that's going. I mean containers are 3 times to 4 times sea freight as high as they've been. And also, there's one more complication even when we have contracted rates we and many others experienced, there's lots of delays going on and stuff. So we sometimes book -- we can't get the stuff on the contracted rate still much later and have to pick spot rates. And we're also forced sometimes to look at different modes of transport from a reliability perspective. So a lot's going on there. I mean on the volume side, I mean, our focus in the second half is on ensuring that we get pricing to recover raw material costs. We're trying to recover close to 100%, and that is really important to being able to the EBITDA and the numbers there. And we did have very strong growth in Q2, predominantly volume driven. And so what we've -- our guidance, Lisa, in the second half is sort of we're trying to guide to manage performance, risk and the need for pricing again. So that's really what you're seeing over there. And on the first part of your question, I mean, yes, for the Scent business, the margin expansion was really driven by the mix for sure. I mean, for sure. I mean when you have Fine Fragrances going up 85%, that's tremendous. So it was mixed but there's also volume growth, in general. I mean you've seen Cosmetic Active was super as well and then productivity, and that offset inflationary pressures and costs which you're seeing there as well. And in the second half, we'll see more costs coming the way of the Scent business, not on the scale of nourishing what we've seen. Anything to add there, Andreas?"

            "name": "Andreas Fibig",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our performance during the first half of 2021, followed by an update regarding our ongoing efforts to fully integrate the N&B business following the completion of the transaction in the first quarter of the year. Rustom will then provide a detailed review of our second quarter financials, highlighting segment level business performance and the market dynamics we saw in the quarter. Before we jump into the question-and-answer session, Rustom will also conclude with an overview of our expectations for the remainder of 2021. Now beginning with Slide 6, I would like to review our business highlights for the first half of the year. I'm pleased to report that IFF has delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, which is a robust acceleration versus our combined Q1 growth and through the first half of the year. As I've said before, execution is everything and IFS has delivered strong financial results, while advancing our ongoing integration efforts, following the completion of the N&B merger in February. In the first half of 2021, IFF achieved $5.6 billion in sales, representing 8% growth or 5% on a currency-neutral base. For comparable purposes and to reflect the portfolio differences between our peers, I want also to highlight that both businesses performed well with legacy IFF achieving a very strong high single digit growth rate with nearly 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and legacy N&B growing in mid single digits. At the same time, we continue to operate in a challenging global environment, with significant headwinds in material cost and supply chain logistics. In the first half, combined EBITDA growth was a solid 6% and a combined EBITDA margin of 22.5%. Importantly, our strong free cash flow of $533 million enables IFF to maintain significant financial flexibility, including our efforts to de-lever. We remain on track to achieve our deleveraging targets of under 3 times by year three post transaction close, and we improved our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA leverage from 4.3 times in the first quarter to 4.2 times in the second quarter. Finally, we are also well on track with integrating the N&B business and continue to realize synergies in line with our expectation for the transaction. As we sharpen the IFF portfolio, we continue to progress on the divestiture of our food preparation business, which we expect to be completed late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, the divestiture of this non-core business will create a more efficient IFF with an enhanced ability to grow and innovate across the key business segments. We are committed to ongoing active portfolio management and will continue to seek ways to increase value creation. Stepping back to reflect on the first half of the year. I'm very pleased with what we have been able to accomplish. We delivered strong sales growth, which is an acceleration versus historical performance for both legacy IFF and legacy N&B, in the midst of a transformational integration as well as a global pandemic. This is a validation of our strategy, motivates our team to continue defying industry expectations as we continue to see the benefits of our expanded product offering and capabilities. Long-term growth prospects of our business are strong, and we are making investments in capacity, R&D and plant technologies, as well as increasing inventory levels and incurring higher logistic costs to maintain our growth momentum in the interim, specifically in the N&B business, as we maximize our growth opportunities going forward. As we look to the third quarter and second half of 2021, our objectives are clear, build on this momentum while executing on our integration plans, allowing IFF to fully leverage our new capabilities and achieve our long-term expectations. Turning to Slide 7. I would like to briefly discuss the regional sales dynamics that influenced our results for the first half. Despite persisting global challenges and varied economic recoveries, we are pleased to report growth in each of our four key operating regions. In North America, we achieved growth in all of our business segments, led by a single digit growth in Scent, Nourish and H&B. Similar to the first quarter, our Asian markets continue to perform well, achieving a 5% increase in sales led by double digit growth in India and a mid-single-digit performance in China. While we had anticipated that growth would have been impacted in India due to COVID in the second quarter, the business was resilient and finished higher than we expected with strong double-digit growth in Q2. From a segment perspective, in Asia, strong increases across our Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses all contributed to this sustained growth in this key region. Latin America, our strongest performing region, we achieved 12% sales growth, driven by double digit performance in nearly all of IFF business segments and underpinned by favorable currency movements and the impact in Brazil, Mexico and South Cone all achieved growth in the first half. We are particularly pleased to report that our EMEA region has impressively rebounded in the second quarter up to high single digits. We achieved a 2% increase in sales in the first half as COVID-19 related restrictions eased. Our Scent and Nourish business performed particularly well in Q2, both achieving double digit growth. Bearing any newly emerging COVID-19 challenges, we expect this growth to continue through the remainder of the year as global vaccination rates increase and Western and Central Europe continue to recover. Now turning to Slide 8. I will provide a more detailed look at our sales performance across IFF's key business segments through the first half of 2021, particularly those that significantly contributed to our overall 8% sales growth or 5% growth on a currency-neutral basis that I mentioned earlier. We are pleased to report solid growth across all of our four core divisions, Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Nourish achieved currency neutral growth of 6%, driven by a strong performance in flavors, ingredients and food design. Similar to the first quarter, Scent remains our largest sales driver on a year-to-date basis, achieving 8% in currency neutral growth led by a strong performance in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance. Our Health & Biosciences business has returned to solid growth in the second quarter, following a challenging first quarter where sales were affected by COVID-19 pressures in microbial control and grain processing. While microbial control continues to be challenged, for the first half, we saw growth in grain processing, which showed a recovery in the second quarter as well as home and personal care cultures and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Finally, our Pharma Solutions business also delivered growth to the first half of 2021 against a strong year ago comparison. On Slide 9, I would like to discuss the underlying dynamics influencing each of our four segments in the first half. As I mentioned, we saw broad based growth in all Nourish categories, led by robust performance in flavors. Despite strong volume and continued cost discipline, higher raw material costs continue to affect margin when compared to the first half of 2020. However, on a year-over-year basis, EBITDA grew about 7%. Our Health & Biosciences businesses delivered growth in the first half, led by strong performance in Home & Personal Care and grain processing. This growth offsets COVID-19 related pressures in microbial control and a strong year ago comparable in health. Higher logistic costs related to capacity and strong demand impacted our margin. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by this performance and expect continued improvement as we move into Q3. Our leading growth and profitability driver, Scent, achieved an operating EBITDA margin increase of 170 basis points and absolute EBITDA grew nearly 20%. This was driven by a strong rebound in Fine Fragrances as retail channels continue to recover, continued strength in Consumer Fragrances and double digit growth in Cosmetic Actives. Scent also delivered strong profitability led by higher volumes, favorable mix and higher productivity, which we expect to continue through the remainder of the year. Lastly, in Pharma Solutions, the segment's 1% growth was driven primarily by improvements in industrials. So our margin was significantly challenged due to higher energy costs, lower manufacturing utilization and result in a weather related raw material shortages. Now on Slide 10 and 11, I would like to discuss our continued synergy progress in connection with our merger with N&B. From a revenue synergy perspective, we remain on track to meet our $20 million revenue synergy target this year. Coupled with continued demand and positive feedback from our customers, we are also confident in our ability to meet our 2024 run rate revenue synergy target of approximately $400 million. I would like to spend a moment highlighting how we realized this significant opportunity and share additional context on some of our recent wins. In only six months since completing the merger, we are already seeing strong affirmation in the opportunity before us. Our Home Care segment is a perfect example of how our expanded portfolio and combined capabilities with N&B delivers creative solutions for our customers and creates new opportunities for our business. Recently, our Health & Biosciences division saw an opportunity to collaborate with our Scent division, a global Scent customer expressed a need for enzyme technology and IFS capabilities across divisions allowed us to deliver an integrated solution and ultimately create a superior dishwashing detergent. Together with IFF's leading fragrance capabilities, our enzyme technology ensures fit-for-purpose delivery and performance, which creates a differentiated product for our customers. This opportunity represents more than $5 million in annual sales potential. At the same time, we're actively working with other customers across our IFF network to develop solutions that require capabilities across our four divisions. The food and beverage category, we continue to see demand for plant based meat alternatives that showcase the best of our expanded portfolio. For low sugar, low fat yogurt, we are introducing new flavor technologies with improved texture and speed to market, which are key advantages for our customers. Lastly, in our health category, we are developing an integrated solution for fiber gummy that leverages our unmatched scientific and technical expertise combined with our best-in-class flavor offering. These are just a few examples of the cross selling opportunities that we are seeing customers increasingly demand and differentiator for our business over the long term. We made significant strides in the second quarter from an integration perspective, ramping up our cost synergies from a few million dollars in the first quarter to a total of approximately $15 million on the first half basis. This was largely a result of the comprehensive savings program we have implemented in the second quarter, which allowed us to leverage our increased scale to reduce our indirect spend, benefit from various office consolidations and renegotiations and rightsize our organization. Additionally, because of our operational strengths and commitment to the integration process, early on, we were all able to accelerate exiting our various transition service agreements with DuPont. I'm very encouraged by the continued progress on this front, and we are on track to deliver at least $45 million cost synergies for the full year and ultimately, our three year run rate cost synergy target of $300 million. And now I will hand it over to Rustom. Thank you, Rustom, and thanks again to all of joining us today. Before I wrap up today's call, I would like to first recognize our thousands of employees around the world who continue to display their unwavering commitment to serve our customers, unify our teams together with N&B and deliver for our communities. Despite the uncertain environment that we have continued to navigate, IFF's first half and Q2 results showcased the strengths of our combined portfolio and our ability to execute our ambitious business objectives. And I'm incredibly proud to lead such a talented and passionate group of IFF-ers. We have much to be proud of this quarter as we move ahead. I'm confident that we have built the financial and operational structures needed for our combined company to reach even greater heights. As Rustom and I have mentioned, we are targeting a strong full year performance, indicative of our post pandemic aspirations and I know we are exceptionally positioned to achieve this. And we are seeing the strong top line momentum continue in the early days of the third quarter. Together, we will further our mission to be an innovative force for good and redefine what it means to be a leader in a global value chain for consumer goods and commercial products. With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Let me get started on it, and then Rustom is talking about the pricing. So first of all, your second question, there's no borrowing from the third quarter for the second quarter. I think that's important. Number two is what is driving us and the strong performance in the second quarter and also the start into the third quarter, because July we had the sales already. So it's a strong win rate. It's a very robust demand we are seeing. In some areas, it is also a superior technology, in particular in parts of the enzyme business and a really good R&D pipeline here as well. So the question now is why we are not going higher. Look, it's a  environment for us right now and as for everybody else. So we have now the COVID Delta variant. And we said, look, let's be careful here what we do, we're not getting ahead of our skis here and make sure that we have a very realistic target on the sales side. And Rustom, if you could talk a bit about volume and pricing that would be probably helpful. Mike, so we are very, very confident that we achieved what we have set for this year. Second year, we will see how the run rate turns out. I'm very impressed actually what the teams are doing. I'll give you a couple of examples. I did know since we are going a little bit lighter on the pandemic. I did a good trip in the US and in Europe actually twice. And I saw what the power is combining, let's say, an ingredient sale with a flavor sale. So I'm really optimistic that we are, let's say, are moving in the right direction. But it's probably too early to raise the forecast already for next year. That might be in the next call where we can take a very detailed look. The most important thing for me is how natural the teams are already combining ingredients at Flavors, for example, and what kind of opportunities we have in areas like the Home Care with superior edition washing detergents, for example, and in the health area as well, which were not so much on our forefront when we started this all endeavor. And that's really good. So I'm optimistic but it's probably too early to raise it right now. Okay, Mike? Absolutely, Faiza, and that's a very core part of our portfolio. And we see for almost all the enzyme categories, we see a really robust demand and in some areas, really our superiority in technology as well. So answering your question, we had probably more demand than we could satisfy. And our priority right now in this business is actually to debottleneck some of our manufacturing parts, investing in more, let's say, manufacturing lines and making sure that in the next, let's say, 12 to 15 months, we are really able to deliver the strong demand here. So indeed, we had more demand than we could deliver and we are working now really 24/7 to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity. I don't know, Rustom, whether you want to add anything? Operator, Faiza, if you want to jump back on the line that would be great, you cut out . Yes, some of it in the fourth quarter but most the bulk of it in 2022. Yes, absolutely. I would say, at the moment, we're working hard to look at what we do with our portfolio. It's probably too early to say something more in detail. Yes, that's probably, and I don't know Rustom, if you want to say anything? Look, we are always concerned if we have a turnover on the management team. So far, I think we keep it in a way that we make sure that we are really firing on all cylinders and that we find the right people. Because it's a big task we have here right now on one hand, delivering on our numbers, integrating the businesses and then we are still in the pandemic, which makes it not easier. But in general, I think we have it very well under control. And as you can see, most of these units are performing actually very, very, very well and we expect the same actually for the third quarter as well. Let me get started. So yes, we are very optimistic on the Nourish right now, also in comparison to some of our peers. And there's a lot of good wins coming in, very strong wins, particularly on the flavor side, and it's really good for what we see the pipeline is pretty filled. We see as well that now having the ingredients helps us to open up customers for flavors, because you do always with the CPGs, first, the ingredient sales and then the flavor sales. And the dynamic right now is if we see an ingredient sales, we try to cross sell already the flavors, which is working actually quite nicely. So win rates are really good and strong. The demand is very, very robust, what we see as well. And we started being very short term, strong because Nourish as well, actually super strong into the third quarter. And Rustom, if you could talk about the raw mats, that will be really good. And I have to say that was a big focus for our team right now to look because we didn't get the procurement savings in the second quarter we wanted, and probably not in the third. So we shifted actually pretty agile, the way how we deliver the synergies. So it was more cost out in particular in terms of headcount in other areas as well. And we are now planning for next year getting more of the synergies from procurement and then certainly in 2023 because, at some point in time, it will ease. So I think we did a good job to just, let's say, reachc shift where we get it from. On the revenue growth, before I hand it over to Rustom on EBITDA, it is certainly positive because you will see also carryover effect into next year on the sales line if you have raised the prices, which is good and good to see for us. But I guess everybody in that marketplace is doing it right now. But Rustom, if you can talk about the cost pressures, in general? How you see it and the EBITDA margin. Actually a good point Rustom is making, because a big portion of it is driven by airfreight. And as soon as we have enough capacity available, we will reduce the airfreight quite significantly, which is super helpful on the cost side as well. Rustom, you want to take it? No, actually, look, what we see is we'll recover in the second half in pharma, because we are recovering some of it through all the cold snap we had in the Midwest. So that will come back but probably not to the degree we have to demand. And on the Health & Bioscience piece, it's certainly driven by our manufacturing capacity, which is limited but also with higher comps we will see for the last two quarters. So we will see how it goes. We are very careful here on this side but it will be more positive than what we have seen in the first quarter. Certainly, we saw already an acceleration in the second quarter and it will go in the right direction. So we are observing it quite carefully. What I can tell you also in the third quarter, the legacy N&B businesses had a pretty strong start. And then certainly, part of it is in the Nourish business as well and reflected in the Nourish numbers, in particular, the Ingredients business, we should not underestimate that. And by the way, having you on, I hope you have seen the really strong performance of Fine Fragrances, which are really going in the right direction, helping with the mix on the Scent side quite significantly. No, it's a good point, Lauren. And I would say there are two things which come together. One is the very robust demand and a lot of wins we had in particular on the enzyme piece and that came a bit of a surprise to the unit. So that's where we need some investment here to deliver on it. I would not say it was underinvested but it was probably also through the pandemic, not on the real time horizon. We could have had some of the expansion already probably six months earlier than we would be in a better position. But it is as it is. And we have now adapted our CapEx plan going forward that we can deal with these, let's say, shortages quite nicely over the next, I would say, 15 months. The positive for me is that demand is very robust. And the other positive is that we see some superiority of our products in that market, which is really good. And there's something which we haven't talked too much because it might be more midterm but the R&D pipeline, in particular, what comes from N&B is super strong and it will help us with our wins going forward. I don't know, Rustom, do you have anything to add? I would say if I go to the different categories, we see still strong demand for Fine Fragrances. And this is not just driven by the robust demand right now but also by our win rate. We are winning more than our fair share and that's very, very helpful. Consumer Fragrance, here, I would say, in general, for the market, you see a moderation and that's what you hear in the market from the big CPGs as well. But again, we are in the good position or lucky position that we are on all the core lists we wanted to be. And then we talked over the last couple of quarters about the street callers we made a year and half ago and they are really contributing. So that's helpful for us. But in general, we see some moderation. Another one is active cosmetics. We see a big, big and strong growth going forward. On Health & Bioscience, I would say, very strong in Home and Personal Care, but more driven by our wins and our technology than by the whole market. So that's what I would say. And then grain processing and microbial control are coming back out of, let's say, modest performance in last year. And animal nutrition is pretty good as well. On the Nourish side, I would say we haven't seen any slowing down of demand. And that might be also driven because we are now in a unique position that we can offer from the ingredient, to the flavor, to the total solution that we are in a different position than many of our competitors and that helps us actually to position us in the right way. So answering your question is we see some markets, we see the market's moderation, but not too much for us because of the position where we're in right now. So that will be my overall comment. I would say, if we're starting to close down, again, if the delta variants really proving dangerous for us. I would say the food service is the only business I could think of right now, which could be impacted, maybe fine fragrance. But what we have seen is much more online usage but these are the two categories where I see an impact, or a negative impact. On the other hand, if the close down comes, I would say that Consumer Fragrances, in particular, in terms of the health and the hygiene products, are going up. And as you said, on the health side as well because people are trying to fortify their food, trying to be healthy, getting more probiotics in. And so I would say we have at least as many opportunities as we have risk to another close down. So that's how I would describe it for now. We are even outperforming our 2019 number. And this quarter will show whether there's an inventory building or not because now they're starting to order for the Christmas business. And so far, it's a strong start into the third quarter. So I would say not so much inventory building and then there's an extra effect on our side for Fine Fragrances that we are winning really a lot of business and a lot of good fragrances as well, which are very nicely marketed. So that's how I would describe it. I don't know, Rustom, anything to add from your side? Rustom, can you take it? No, I think you captured it very, very well. I just want to make a general remark on mix. Obviously, we try for all businesses now to push basically all the parts of the portfolio, which have the higher profitability and the higher growth areas, which over time should really help us with mix. And I think what you see with Scent, it's something which is a very positive driver for our profitability going forward. Yes. Thank you. We are incredibly proud on the second quarter because, again, as we said, first of all, we delivered strong growth, even in comparison to 2019, which is real good parameter here. Secondly, we're integrating well with the N&B business and we do it in time of a pandemic. And I think, again, I would like to use the time to congratulate all of our teams around the globe for what they have accomplished. And I think it's not an easy task and everybody did really as best and that's where IFF stands for. Thank you for that, and talk to most of you later. Thank you guys. Bye-bye."

Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter 2021 conference call. Yesterday evening, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the first quarter as well as our outlook for the full 2021. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. I ask that you please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements.\n.:\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you, Mike and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will begin today's call by providing an overview of our first quarter results including a review of our performance by region and segment. I would also like to share with you an update regarding our efforts to integrate DuPont N&B business, which continues to progress well, following the completion of our transaction in February. Rustom will then provide a more detailed financial review of the business highlighting segment level business dynamics and performance and cover cash flow and leverage as well. IFF is off to a strong start in 2021, and I'm confident that the momentum we have built will continue for the remainder of the year and beyond.  Now beginning with slide 6, I would like to review our performance and notable developments in the first quarter. We achieved 3% and combined sales growth or 1% on currency neutral basis compared to the first quarter of 2020. Also, because of our change to a fiscal calendar, rather than a traditional 445 calendar, we have had less two days less in first quarter. If we were to normalize for that our combined currency neutral growth in the first quarter would also have been approximately 3%. And on a two year average basis to factor in our strong 7% year ago comparison growth would be strong at approximately 5%. \nRustom Jilla: Thank you, Andreas. First, let me go a bit deeper into our consolidated financial results. In the first quarter IFF generated 2.5 billion in sales, a 3% combined year-over-year increase including foreign exchange benefits, or up 1% on a currency neutral basis, primarily led by strong performances in our scent and pharma solutions division. As you may recollect from 2021 onwards, we are applying prior year average FX rates to our currency or non-US dollar revenues to derive currency neutral growth rates. This is the more common practice and makes us more comparable to our competitors.\nAndreas Fibig: Thank you Rustom and thanks again to all for joining us today. I would like to wrap up today's call by first giving an enormous thank you to our 1000s of employees around the world who have worked tirelessly over the last quarter to successfully execute our business initiatives, deliver for our customers and achieve solid top and bottom line business results. All while making exceptional strides integrating and envy to the IFF family. It has truly been a busy quarter and we all have much to be proud of especially as this all was accomplished during a global pandemic. Looking beyond our solid Q1 financial results, I want to re emphasize the important first step that we took in tightening our business and optimizing our portfolio strategy by agreeing to diversify our food preparation business. By diversifying this non core business IFF will be more efficient organization with a great capacity to focus on growth and innovation across our key businesses, ultimately generating greater value for our shareholders. As we enter Q2 together, we're confident that we have the right team and the right structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet all financial operational goals. As I mentioned, we are targeting strong year-over-year financial improvements with accelerated test scores over the coming quarters backed by our commitment to delivering industry leading innovative products and services to our customers around the world. And as Rustom stated, we are pleased that we have started Q2 strong and optimistic that our full second quarter sales growth should be in a highest single digit range. I'm tremendously proud of all we have accomplished and I firmly believe that the best is yet to come by taking each and every learning from the N&B integration process to create a stronger, more agile and diversified company that defines the future of our industry and showcase what it means to be a leading ingredients and solutions partner.  With that I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator:  We will take our first question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sison: Nice start to the year. In slide 8, I thought that was really helpful. You do show some businesses at that 4% to 5% sales growth range. If you think about you have owned the business for about three months now. Can you maybe talk about what needs to happen to the other businesses below that 4% to 5% and your confidence since you've owned the business now that you can get each of these product lines sort of in that range over the next couple years?\nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Thank you Mike for the question. Yes, first of all I think that we really expect that the growth will accelerate over the course of the year. And that's driven as Rustom said as well was a good start into the second quarter, which was actually the first quarter was our toughest comparison. So that's the reason why we raised our sales expectations for the year. I think that's important. So now coming to the different parts of the business. I would say first of all we see if you look at the scent business unit, the real good recovery on fine fragrances which is really fantastic in the first quarter and also starting the second quarter which is good. We see still a great growth on cosmetic actives. So that's basically super important for us as well and the consumer fragrances stay on elevated level. If you go to the health and bioscience business, you see a couple of elements. You see that health and the conscious and food enzyme business should grow mid single digits. And you will see a recovery of the microbial control business, which was very much hurt by the situation last year. So that's important as well. And then on the Nourish side, very solid performance on taste, in particular, the legacy flavors doing very well. But on the new parts, protein solutions, via alternative proteins are doing going very well. And then you will see a turnaround in the food service as well in the countries and economies are opening up. And that's probably a general remark. We have seen good growth as you've seen in the presentation and most of the regions but in Europe, and Europe will turn around as soon as these economies are opening up after the pandemic as well. So I hope, Mike, that gives you a bit more color here.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. \nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks. And morning, everyone. \nAndreas Fibig: Morning.\nMark Astrachan: I guess, broader question. It's something that we hear probably most frequently from folks out there asking about your company is why what gives confidence that IFF can sustain the share gains implied by the 4% to 5% currency neutral, long term targets that you have when growth has been below peers in recent years even adjusting for FX changes and I guess related to that first quarter growth was below peers who also had tough comparisons not as tough as yours, but still tougher comparison. So what gives confidence that you can see an acceleration applied by the guidance over balance of the year as well as long term? And I want to just kind of squeeze in a related question which is just how do we measure or how do you measure maybe your peer performance? What does the group did you use to measure your fair performance versus peers and traditionally, it's been summarized now, who should we all be paying attention to? Thank you. \nAndreas Fibig: So let me start with the last question first. I think you are basically named all the companies which are relevant for us, maybe you should put carry in the mix as well, in particular for food service and some of the ingredients. And then you have actually a very nice peer group together. So what we want to do on the midterm is actually what we are doing, we have done completely a strategic assessment of all the categories where we believe that we have gross and margin potential. We certainly will emphasize in terms of our resources behind these categories. Some of these categories are just for example, on health, like the probiotics business, for example, where we put good resources behind to make sure that we can outgrow the competition here. And I think if you look at the start of into the year it's 3% of gross, if you adjust for the days, and there was a very strong comparison with 7% in the last year. So we are actually quite happy with the start and we have seen some of the portfolio pieces are performing very well. Like the flavors business is coming well. You see it in the everything which is plant based and protein related, and we see some that's a turnaround as well. And I mentioned before when Mike Sison asked on the microbial control which is coming back. We see the food service business are coming back. These are all good signals that we own a really solid track now to accelerate our growth and that's the reason why we said we raised our expectation for the rest of the year. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone.\nAndreas Fibig: Morning. \nAdam Samuelson: So I was hoping to ask about some of the color on raw materials and costs trends. Obviously, a very dynamic raw material environment the note the increases in trade are noted. Just trying to make sure I understand kind of the magnitude of how much that has increased relative to your initial look at the year provided a few months ago? How much incremental price you're calling for or expecting and reformulation and how we think we end the year on that kind of price cost balance?\nRustom Jilla: Right. Adam its Rustom. Let me take that question. So we started 2021 expecting our inflation to be low single digits, okay, with some modest increases, mostly offset by cost declines. But since then we've seen some large increases in raw materials. We've talked about them soy, bean on a whole bunch of them. Also higher freight costs due to sharply increased rates, plus higher air freight volume in specific areas where we have strong demand in a couple of inventory and supply chain challenges. But in any case, to answer your last part of your question we do not expect raw material and logistics inflation combined to be in the mid single digits this year. And obviously this requires us to go back to our customers. \nOperator: And we will move next with John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, this is Lucas on for John. Thanks for the lining on the website for the four segments the extra details, they were quite helpful. So on the fifth one on R&D could you provide some breakdowns of the new R&D budget? Do you spend roughly the same percent of sales for each segment? And how much of the R&D is centralized versus how much is in control of the four segments? Thanks.\nAndreas Fibig: Lucas thank you for the question. So the combined company budget for R&D is approximately $620 million is about 5.5% of our annual sales. And we are certainly a leader in terms of R&D within the industry. What we have done is we went through all the different categories and technologies and look where we can put actually the best R&D dollars behind. So we\u2019re vitalizing our investment towards the highest return opportunities. And that means that we spend actually a fair amount of money on health and bioscience. I think that's very-very important. So the biotech area is one of the main investment areas for example, probiotics, enzymes, and cultures just to name one. And then we have certainly a centralized R&D approach and we have probably at least half of it on the centralized R&D and the rest goes into application and application lapse. But as I said, the big piece of our investment goes into the biotech area, which I think is super important for our customers and certainly for the development of some of our technologies going forward. I hope that helps.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about we're in a time when a lot of CPG companies are looking to reduce their COGs . And I know for legacy flavors and fragrances business these only comprise about 2% to 5% of COGs. So often we've seen customers leaning in on these ingredients to differentiate their products while cutting some more expensive items or more expensive, maybe active ingredients. But how should we think about the sort of in context of the combined business, can be used to lower other more expensive ingredients, but just would be great to get some more color from you on this. And if there are any sort of early examples of how IFF is being impacted so far by your customers need to lower costs, and if there are any sort of areas of the business that stand to benefit versus those that stand to get hurt. Thanks.\nAndreas Fibig: Faiza, good question. And it ties very well with the R&D question previously. So certainly we are not just offering, let's say the flavors and fragrances. So we have now a much broader set of technologies and innovative solutions. So we can play with it. And that can first of all differentiators in the marketplace, but also can help to reduce costs. For example, on the legacy IFF side we can partner with our customers. We formulate allowing to reduce the cost for example we can use our modulation technology for that to reduce costs for sweeteners in their products. But also in terms of our new platforms we have now really the leading biotech platform. And that gives us really endless opportunities to use fermentation technology, reduce input costs, and basically create some of the ingredients via biotech pathways. So actually bringing everything together gives us a very synergistic approach to help our customers not just to find super innovative solutions which are helping them to win their own clients and customers but also reduce costs. I think we are in a very-very good spot and position here.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Matthew Deyoe with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Deyoe: Hi, yes. So I made some comments about India exposure and the legacy NMB business on its 1Q earnings call. Just kind of wondering if you could walk through what your exposure is to India and what you're seeing there. Is it the commentary made it seem like there was some elevated exposure perhaps it's relative to their current portfolio, but we did receive a number of questions it into the quarter. \nAndreas Fibig: Yes, Matt, thank you for the question on India. We're probably 1% to 5% of our business in India. Actually, the Q1 was up double digit. So it was a very good performance. And it's interesting that you're asking it because it's such a desperate situation in terms of the pandemic right now. So I talk on a regular basis with our country manager and we haven't seen any slowdown of the business which is kind of interesting, but we are cautious with India. So far we haven't seen any negative impact on the business. But we are cautious and the business has won about 5% of our total business. \nOperator: We will move next with Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. \nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Andreas as vaccines get deployed and mobilities improved in regions such as the U.S. and China, are you seeing a related increase in new product development at the customer level as they sort of position for perhaps a broader recovery? And then also separately to clarify, in the early question raw material cost inflation what are the positive offsets as it relates to the updated EBITDA guidance, given your cost inflation has been raised from the low to mid single digits? Thanks so much.\nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Let me get started and then I hand it over to Rustom for the raw material part. So we see more demands coming in from all our customers which is really good. So new product development is happening. And we don't see it just with our big customers. We see it with some of the small customers coming back as well which is I think it's a good and excellent sign. And we see it in many of our categories, even on the fine fragrance side, which has shown actually very strong development in the first quarter, and a good start or excellent start into the second quarter as well. So short answer, yes, we see an uptick our second part of it, and we see it all with smaller customers as well. Rustom if you go on the raw material.\nRustom Jilla: Yes. Absolutely. So we do expect negative pressure on our gross margin this year. And that's because it takes a stain to go back to our customers. So students have the additional pricing discussions and all the rest of it. So we do not expect to be able to in this fiscal year to be able to recover the full extent of the raw material increases that we're seeing and we envisage okay. However, I mean, we do have positives. We do have positives coming from FX coming through. We do have positives from higher sales volumes. And we do have the positives from lower RSA as a percentage of sales. So on a operating margin perspective that reduces the negative down quite a bit. And at the end of the day, your EBITDA, I mean, combined with our focus on everything we've talked about the cost reduction or the rest of it, we're confident that we can achieve our full year adjusted operating EBITDA goal on a combined basis, the dollars. \nAndreas Fibig: I think that's an important point what Rustom was just saying, because we have now with the integration, good flexibility on the RSA side basically to buffer these developments. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nGunther Zechmann: Hi, good morning Andreas, Rustom and Mike. Can I just ask on your organic sales growth outlook? You have in the slide, a page 17, 6%, I believe that reported sales growth. Can you first of all split out how much of that is like for like please and then coming back to Rustom to the discussion around raw material. How much of that will be pricing? Because I believe when you last gave guidance still with a 12 months, you gave a 3% organic sales growth guidance. But most if not all of that would have been volumes. Thank you. \nAndreas Fibig: So look maybe I can start and then as usual Rustom can comment on the raw materials. The organic sales growth will be 4%. That's what, currency neutral. That's what we are planning. Rustom? \nRustom Jilla: Okay, so I mean, that was the I mean, I was going to say the same thing that effectively FX is helping us as well in the 6% number as we see for the whole year. So on the, Gunther the other part of your question was just in terms of recovery, right. And we do expect to recover path but not all, we haven't quantified that yet, hasn't specified that path, but not all of the increase in material costs. Does that clarify?\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I was wondering what's the magnitude of the divestitures that you contemplate? Is it 500 million in sales or 700 million in sales or a billion? What's the scale? And secondly, in looking at your global sales review, it seems that the issue was Western and Central Europe which contracted 5%. What is it about your business in Europe that's so different than your businesses in the other region, such that you have a negative growth rate and how does that region look for the remainder of the year? \nAndreas Fibig: Yes, let me, Jeff thank you for the questions. The magnitude of the divestitures for the non-core businesses might be around about 5% of sales growth. That's what we are targeting right now. And in terms of Europe I think what is really important that you see the COVID impact on Europe. And that's probably the biggest impact we see right now. Because the composition of the business has a lot of food service in, for example, we have at least up to end of last year fine fragrance was impacted because a lot of it comes out of Europe as well. And that was probably the main impact. And now with the hopefully opening up of the economies in Europe and increasing vaccination rates we expect actually a good turnaround on with our European business. And actually we have seen the first signs already in April which is really-really good for us. I hope it helps to answer the question here.\nOperator: We will move next with PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. \nPJ Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning. Andreas you've talked about food service, business and fine fragrances to businesses that cannot take a hit during the pandemic. As the economy opens up and people start going out, how quickly can they get to pre-pandemic level? And then one question for Rustom you mentioned sort of your top raw materials, rattle them off. Can you talk about sort of your top five or six rank order them so we understand what is the raw material exposure of the combined company? Thank you. \nAndreas Fibig: Okay, let me get started first. I would say on the fine fragrance side, faster than we had expected. I believe we expected end of last year still that it takes us until 22 to get back to pre-pandemic levels. But now I will be more optimistic in what we are seeing right now which is really good. Food service might take a little longer, and particularly out of Europe to get back to the pre-pandemic levels, I think we will hit it probably next year. But I would say it's very-very dependent what's happening now in a second and then in the third quarter. But as we said, fine more optimistic than the end of last year. Food service we will see and the focus here is on Europe. Rustom?\nRustom Jilla: Yes, I would say that soy and locust bean kernels do standout as two of the largest in there. And the vegetable oil is much smaller and several of them. And then I mean, turpentine is something we have as well, but much smaller dimension. And of the last one that we mentioned, propylene glycol that one is fundamentally it was force majeure related and will work its way back.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Tomkins with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tomkins: Thanks very much. Hello, everyone. Yes, I'm just wondering if you could give an idea now that you've secured your first invoice for core selling and solution selling or what you might think the profile of the customer will be or who you're getting better traction with maybe in terms of size, geography products, any information will be interesting there. And then there's more of a housekeeping one. I noticed since Q4, the D&A guide has gone up a little bit, and it looks like the tax rate guiding for is quite a bit higher than what was implied in Q1. So whether we could just have a comment about that that would be appreciated. Thank you very much. \nAndreas Fibig: Sure, absolutely. I\u2019ll take the first one, Rustom takes the second one. So the first thing we are seeing in cross selling is that we had to first big win with a big customer. And it was actually a cross sell in between our scent business and our health and bioscience business. So it's a combination where basically we get something on the enzyme side, because we have good access through our scent business. So bigger customer, European global customer. And I think on the product side, as I said, it's in the detergent area, which I think is very-very good and very promising because we see a good pipeline. Now also on the food side coming in also for our Nourish division. So it's going actually very-very well. And I think we can make the 20 million we promised for this year, actually quite-quite nicely in 21. And now I hand it over to Rustom.\nRustom Jilla: Thanks Andreas. Yes. There is no change really, I mean, we had never before actually specifically guided to the P&L ex-amount, we thought that would be more useful, because as people have pointed out to us that when doing the modeling, I mean, we are talking about our EPS, EBITDA, all the rest of that. So that's really what we did. I mean, if you look at 2020, to clarify, I mean, the adjusted P&L numbers that we had for the whole year was 17.5% and the P&L ex- 18.5 right. And so the number this year, we're going to add 21.5 is just like the roughly about 100 basis points and the difference between those two, and then the and then the rest of it is just the fact that an N&B came with a higher tax profile, which we had communicated and expected.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nMark Connelly: Thanks, Rustom if we look past the nice progress on working capital, do you think that the normal progression of working capital has changed very meaningfully leaving out any discrete benefits you continue to get from the merger integration? \nRustom Jilla: No, look for the rest of the year, I wouldn't be looking working capital to improve the same way at all. I mean, we had a very-very strong first quarter. I mean, we had roughly an eight day improvement in working capital days and that was driven by HIF&F inventory. That legacy IFF inventory and legacy N&B payables driving performance. As we go forward in the year we'll actually be building inventory at legacy N&B to satisfy demand and lessen the strain on our supply chain and also, the raw material cost increases we're talking about are going to increase the dollars on hand. I mean, DSO pretty stable through the rest of the year. And so we haven't specifically forecast core working capital. But basically, by the end of the year, I would think we'd expect it to go up a little bit. And that's all factored in. We are still pretty much able to deliver the 1 billion of free cash flow that we have in mind for the year as well. And that's with the working capital with the CapEx with everything.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley.\nLisa De Neve: Hi, guys, just two from my side. So far, we've talked about the segments where you expect sales to return back to growth. So talking about the other side of the coin, I mean, which segments should we perhaps consider to normalize as we're going through the coming quarters especially as it relates to for example, the consumer fragrance, immunity exposed sales, which some categories have done incredibly well. But as well, some of your peers have flagged quite a level of stocking in some categories in the first quarter. So it would be very helpful to sort of get your view on this. Thank you. \nAndreas Fibig: Sure Lisa. Absolutely. If I look at the different categories here the good news is, if we look at our forecast actually almost all of the categories will see some growth going forward, which is actually a great situation where we are being in. I agree with you on the consumer fragrance side where we had double digit developments in the last year we might see a bit of a normalization, but we still expect good growth and maybe single digit growth in that very important category. Another category where we have very strong comparables is probiotics. You might have seen this for a couple of months, it was for legacy N&B double digit growth last year. So we will see a normalization here, but still grows in the mid single digit range going forward. So these are the two categories which I would call out all the others are looking actually quite strong going forward in terms of growth. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from James Targett with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nJames Targett: Hello. Good afternoon. I just wanted to go back to pricing and just ask about is there anything about the new N&B business, which makes past price through harder or easier than legacy IFF thinking in terms of how long pricing input cost may take a pass on that? And just to follow up on the I think on the last question we just did in the health and bioscience division, you're taking stock growth and health and negative in cultures and food enzymes. Is that just down to the top comp? Or is there anything sort of underlying in terms of market demand there? Thank you.\nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Let me take it and start with the second question first. It is basically tougher comparisons. That's what it is because last year or end of first quarter and into the second quarter, it was very-very-very strong, very double digit. And that was hard to, let's say, to make up this year. We have seen, let's say, in Q1, for example on the health and bioscience piece we did double digit growth. And as soon as that normalizes we will see good growth coming out of out of H&B as well because the underlying business is actually very-very good. And the demand is strong. On the pricing side on, it's basically a pass through as you were saying it's easier to raise prices compared with some of the legacy F&F businesses and so that the time like is not as long as it is for some of the F&F businesses. I hope that answers the question the first part.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I know you have covered a lot. One more thing I was curious about was the free cash flow guidance being at a billion for this year. It just strikes me as a bit low given that I think the IFF, the management case for N&B was originally calling for something closer to like 1.3 billion for 21. I know that's a 12 month number, we're only looking at 11. But that wouldn't really explain all the difference. So I was just curious kind of thoughts on why that lower free cash flow guidance for the year? Thanks. \nAndreas Fibig: Rustom?\nRustom Jilla: Yes. Lauren hi. The 12 months versus 11 is a factor, of course, coming through the number. We expect slightly higher CapEx than we originally envisaged as we invest in the business integration capacity, normal run, maintenance, all the rest of that. We're also building as we said, a little bit more inventory than we expected to and in the legacy N&B end of the business, and so that's going to add as well. And fundamentally I mean, the rest of it is a strong EBITDA, and then the business just flows through. \nOperator: And it shows that we have no further questions at this time. I would now I'd like to turn the call over to Andreas Fibig for any closing remarks. \nAndreas Fibig: Yes. Thank you for the participation. Certainly a very busy and good quarter for us because it was the first two months as the combined company and you've seen lots of moving parts also in the external environment. But I believe IFF handled that well and I would like to thank the employees again for that first quarter and then and also we see actually, a positive sales development and expectations for the rest of the year. With that I wish you a productive end of day and talk to you soon. Thank you. \nOperator: And this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and you may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Rustom Jilla",
            "content": "Thank you, Andreas. First, let me go a bit deeper into our consolidated financial results. In the first quarter IFF generated 2.5 billion in sales, a 3% combined year-over-year increase including foreign exchange benefits, or up 1% on a currency neutral basis, primarily led by strong performances in our scent and pharma solutions division. As you may recollect from 2021 onwards, we are applying prior year average FX rates to our currency or non-US dollar revenues to derive currency neutral growth rates. This is the more common practice and makes us more comparable to our competitors. Right. Adam its Rustom. Let me take that question. So we started 2021 expecting our inflation to be low single digits, okay, with some modest increases, mostly offset by cost declines. But since then we've seen some large increases in raw materials.

So on the, Gunther the other part of your question was just in terms of recovery, right. And we do expect to recover path but not all, we haven't quantified that yet, hasn't specified that path, but not all of the increase in material costs. Does that clarify?

We are still pretty much able to deliver the 1 billion of free cash flow that we have in mind for the year as well. And that's with the working capital with the CapEx with everything. Yes. Lauren hi.

            "content": "Thank you Rustom and thanks again to all for joining us today. I would like to wrap up today's call by first giving an enormous thank you to our 1000s of employees around the world who have worked tirelessly over the last quarter to successfully execute our business initiatives, deliver for our customers and achieve solid top and bottom line business results. All while making exceptional strides integrating and envy to the IFF family. It has truly been a busy quarter and we all have much to be proud of especially as this all was accomplished during a global pandemic. Looking beyond our solid Q1 financial results, I want to re emphasize the important first step that we took in tightening our business and optimizing our portfolio strategy by agreeing to diversify our food preparation business. By diversifying this non core business IFF will be more efficient organization with a great capacity to focus on growth and innovation across our key businesses, ultimately generating greater value for our shareholders. As we enter Q2 together, we're confident that we have the right team and the right structures in place to ensure that our newly combined company will meet all financial operational goals. As I mentioned, we are targeting strong year-over-year financial improvements with accelerated test scores over the coming quarters backed by our commitment to delivering industry leading innovative products and services to our customers around the world. And as Rustom stated, we are pleased that we have started Q2 strong and optimistic that our full second quarter sales growth should be in a highest single digit range. I'm tremendously proud of all we have accomplished and I firmly believe that the best is yet to come by taking each and every learning from the N&B integration process to create a stronger, more agile and diversified company that defines the future of our industry and showcase what it means to be a leading ingredients and solutions partner.  With that I would like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Yes. Thank you Mike for the question. Yes, first of all I think that we really expect that the growth will accelerate over the course of the year. And that's driven as Rustom said as well was a good start into the second quarter, which was actually the first quarter was our toughest comparison. So that's the reason why we raised our sales expectations for the year. I think that's important. So now coming to the different parts of the business. I would say first of all we see if you look at the scent business unit, the real good recovery on fine fragrances which is really fantastic in the first quarter and also starting the second quarter which is good. We see still a great growth on cosmetic actives. So that's basically super important for us as well and the consumer fragrances stay on elevated level. If you go to the health and bioscience business, you see a couple of elements. You see that health and the conscious and food enzyme business should grow mid single digits. And you will see a recovery of the microbial control business, which was very much hurt by the situation last year. So that's important as well. And then on the Nourish side, very solid performance on taste, in particular, the legacy flavors doing very well. But on the new parts, protein solutions, via alternative proteins are doing going very well. And then you will see a turnaround in the food service as well in the countries and economies are opening up. And that's probably a general remark. We have seen good growth as you've seen in the presentation and most of the regions but in Europe, and Europe will turn around as soon as these economies are opening up after the pandemic as well. So I hope, Mike, that gives you a bit more color here. Morning. So let me start with the last question first. I think you are basically named all the companies which are relevant for us, maybe you should put carry in the mix as well, in particular for food service and some of the ingredients. And then you have actually a very nice peer group together. So what we want to do on the midterm is actually what we are doing, we have done completely a strategic assessment of all the categories where we believe that we have gross and margin potential. We certainly will emphasize in terms of our resources behind these categories. Some of these categories are just for example, on health, like the probiotics business, for example, where we put good resources behind to make sure that we can outgrow the competition here. And I think if you look at the start of into the year it's 3% of gross, if you adjust for the days, and there was a very strong comparison with 7% in the last year. So we are actually quite happy with the start and we have seen some of the portfolio pieces are performing very well. Like the flavors business is coming well. You see it in the everything which is plant based and protein related, and we see some that's a turnaround as well. And I mentioned before when Mike Sison asked on the microbial control which is coming back. We see the food service business are coming back. These are all good signals that we own a really solid track now to accelerate our growth and that's the reason why we said we raised our expectation for the rest of the year. Morning. Lucas thank you for the question. So the combined company budget for R&D is approximately $620 million is about 5.5% of our annual sales. And we are certainly a leader in terms of R&D within the industry. What we have done is we went through all the different categories and technologies and look where we can put actually the best R&D dollars behind. So we're vitalizing our investment towards the highest return opportunities. And that means that we spend actually a fair amount of money on health and bioscience. I think that's very-very important. So the biotech area is one of the main investment areas for example, probiotics, enzymes, and cultures just to name one. And then we have certainly a centralized R&D approach and we have probably at least half of it on the centralized R&D and the rest goes into application and application lapse. But as I said, the big piece of our investment goes into the biotech area, which I think is super important for our customers and certainly for the development of some of our technologies going forward. I hope that helps. Faiza, good question. And it ties very well with the R&D question previously. So certainly we are not just offering, let's say the flavors and fragrances. So we have now a much broader set of technologies and innovative solutions. So we can play with it. And that can first of all differentiators in the marketplace, but also can help to reduce costs. For example, on the legacy IFF side we can partner with our customers. We formulate allowing to reduce the cost for example we can use our modulation technology for that to reduce costs for sweeteners in their products. But also in terms of our new platforms we have now really the leading biotech platform. And that gives us really endless opportunities to use fermentation technology, reduce input costs, and basically create some of the ingredients via biotech pathways. So actually bringing everything together gives us a very synergistic approach to help our customers not just to find super innovative solutions which are helping them to win their own clients and customers but also reduce costs. I think we are in a very-very good spot and position here. Yes, Matt, thank you for the question on India. We're probably 1% to 5% of our business in India. Actually, the Q1 was up double digit. So it was a very good performance. And it's interesting that you're asking it because it's such a desperate situation in terms of the pandemic right now. So I talk on a regular basis with our country manager and we haven't seen any slowdown of the business which is kind of interesting, but we are cautious with India. So far we haven't seen any negative impact on the business. But we are cautious and the business has won about 5% of our total business. Yes. Let me get started and then I hand it over to Rustom for the raw material part. So we see more demands coming in from all our customers which is really good. So new product development is happening. And we don't see it just with our big customers. We see it with some of the small customers coming back as well which is I think it's a good and excellent sign. And we see it in many of our categories, even on the fine fragrance side, which has shown actually very strong development in the first quarter, and a good start or excellent start into the second quarter as well. So short answer, yes, we see an uptick our second part of it, and we see it all with smaller customers as well. Rustom if you go on the raw material. I think that's an important point what Rustom was just saying, because we have now with the integration, good flexibility on the RSA side basically to buffer these developments. So look maybe I can start and then as usual Rustom can comment on the raw materials. The organic sales growth will be 4%. That's what, currency neutral. That's what we are planning. Rustom? Yes, let me, Jeff thank you for the questions. The magnitude of the divestitures for the non-core businesses might be around about 5% of sales growth. That's what we are targeting right now. And in terms of Europe I think what is really important that you see the COVID impact on Europe. And that's probably the biggest impact we see right now. Because the composition of the business has a lot of food service in, for example, we have at least up to end of last year fine fragrance was impacted because a lot of it comes out of Europe as well. And that was probably the main impact. And now with the hopefully opening up of the economies in Europe and increasing vaccination rates we expect actually a good turnaround on with our European business. And actually we have seen the first signs already in April which is really-really good for us. I hope it helps to answer the question here. Okay, let me get started first. I would say on the fine fragrance side, faster than we had expected. I believe we expected end of last year still that it takes us until 22 to get back to pre-pandemic levels. But now I will be more optimistic in what we are seeing right now which is really good. Food service might take a little longer, and particularly out of Europe to get back to the pre-pandemic levels, I think we will hit it probably next year. But I would say it's very-very dependent what's happening now in a second and then in the third quarter. But as we said, fine more optimistic than the end of last year. Food service we will see and the focus here is on Europe. Rustom? Sure, absolutely. I'll take the first one, Rustom takes the second one. So the first thing we are seeing in cross selling is that we had to first big win with a big customer. And it was actually a cross sell in between our scent business and our health and bioscience business. So it's a combination where basically we get something on the enzyme side, because we have good access through our scent business. So bigger customer, European global customer. And I think on the product side, as I said, it's in the detergent area, which I think is very-very good and very promising because we see a good pipeline. Now also on the food side coming in also for our Nourish division. So it's going actually very-very well. And I think we can make the 20 million we promised for this year, actually quite-quite nicely in 21. And now I hand it over to Rustom. Sure Lisa. Absolutely. If I look at the different categories here the good news is, if we look at our forecast actually almost all of the categories will see some growth going forward, which is actually a great situation where we are being in. I agree with you on the consumer fragrance side where we had double digit developments in the last year we might see a bit of a normalization, but we still expect good growth and maybe single digit growth in that very important category. Another category where we have very strong comparables is probiotics. You might have seen this for a couple of months, it was for legacy N&B double digit growth last year. So we will see a normalization here, but still grows in the mid single digit range going forward. So these are the two categories which I would call out all the others are looking actually quite strong going forward in terms of growth. Yes. Let me take it and start with the second question first. It is basically tougher comparisons. That's what it is because last year or end of first quarter and into the second quarter, it was very-very-very strong, very double digit. And that was hard to, let's say, to make up this year. We have seen, let's say, in Q1, for example on the health and bioscience piece we did double digit growth. And as soon as that normalizes we will see good growth coming out of out of H&B as well because the underlying business is actually very-very good. And the demand is strong. On the pricing side on, it's basically a pass through as you were saying it's easier to raise prices compared with some of the legacy F&F businesses and so that the time like is not as long as it is for some of the F&F businesses. I hope that answers the question the first part. Rustom? Yes. Thank you for the participation. Certainly a very busy and good quarter for us because it was the first two months as the combined company and you've seen lots of moving parts also in the external environment. But I believe IFF handled that well and I would like to thank the employees again for that first quarter and then and also we see actually, a positive sales development and expectations for the rest of the year. With that I wish you a productive end of day and talk to you soon. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode into the formal Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: [Audio Dip]\nFrank Clyburn: Good morning to everybody. I want to start today's call by recognizing our teams in the incredible work they've done throughout 2022 to bolster IFF's industry leadership and also to continue delivering innovative solutions for our customers amid the challenging operating environment. As part of our Investor Day in December, we unveiled the next phase of our strategic transformation including our strategic priorities and a refreshed operating model that will better position IFF to drive long-term profitable growth and capitalize on the market opportunities ahead of us. The plan seeks to maximize our competitive advantage and ensure that we are operating as an even more innovative, efficient and disciplined company. As we delivered solid 2022 result and 2023 is in full swing, I\u2019m pleased to share that we are advancing key elements of this plan and excited to update you on today's call. It is a true privilege to work along such talented and dedicated colleagues. Across our global platform, it is clear that our teams are committed to IFF's continued transformation as we delivered unmatched innovation, service and quality in the solutions that meet the needs of our customers, both today and tomorrow. Now on Slide 6, I'd like to reiterate the financial and strategic initiatives central to the strategic refresh that we were discussing during our Investor Day last December. Following an extensive assessment with our key stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders and key partners, we've identified several top priorities that will guide IFF's next chapter. First, we're focused on jump-starting even stronger growth across the business. There's no question that our robust portfolio provides a clear strategic advantage by doubling down on customer excellence and making strategic investments in the opportunities that will reap the greatest returns for our business will be better positioned to drive sustained profitable growth. We have many of the pieces in place to support future growth, a highly diversified offering, serving attractive end markets, global talent and a world-class R&D organization. Our long-term success requires a more disciplined approach to ensure that growth does not come at the cost of profitability. We must deliver on this objective, and we are laser-focused on doing so, particularly amid the macroeconomic pressures we are facing today, it is essential that we target enhanced cost and productivity initiatives. In 2022, we implemented several productivity and cost reduction efforts that have proven effective towards offsetting market challenges. Ultimately, our goal is to realize net annual savings of approximately $350 million to $400 million between 2023 and 2025, including the additional $100 million in run rate savings we announced at our Investor Day to support this reinvestment and increased profitability. Moving forward, we will be disciplined to focus on the areas of our business that will best support our profitable growth, investing in R&D to get projects to market more efficiently, enhancing end-to-end productivity to drive improved costs and processes and further improving our supply chain to be more efficient. An essential component of our value creation plan is our work to simplify our operating model to closely align with our three core end markets: food and beverage, home and personal care and health and become One IFF. This new model will be critical to achieve the goals I just outlined as we enhance our ability to grow profitably through a more customer-centric and market-backed approach. As a result of these efforts, we are building a stronger financial profile for IFF and are targeting sales growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 8% to 10% on a comparable currency-neutral basis over 2024, 2025 and 2026. We also remain committed to deleveraging our balance sheet below the 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA objective for 2024. Underpinning these efforts will be an intense focus on enhancing our ESG leadership and accelerating our efforts to contribute to a more sustainable world through our operations and initiatives. We will also continue efforts to optimize our portfolio, ensuring we have the offering needed to support future growth while pursuing noncore divestitures like our recent announced sale of our Savory Solutions business to improve our capital structure. Doing so, will allow IFF to reinvest in the high growth areas of our business while ensuring we are operating most efficiently as an organization. Lastly, we continue to take steps to evolve our Board in line with best-in-class governance standards, with plans to reduce the size of our board from 14 to a target of no more than 10 IFF directors and one icon capital designee director by the 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting. With this initiative, we are also focused on the composition of the Board and prioritizing the inclusion of senior executives with the most relevant skills, leadership experience and business expertise needed to support IFF's long-term vision. As you may have seen, we have some additional board changes since our Investor Day where we announced Mark Costa is joining us. I would like to welcome Dawn Willoughby and Gary Hu to our Board as well. I also want to take the opportunity to thank several Board members that have recently come off the board or has been announced and will do so at the annual meeting. We are grateful for the years of tremendous contribution and for all of their hard work and service to IFF. Thank you to Dale Morrison, Michael Ducker, Ilene Gordon and Kare Schultz. In addition, I would like to congratulate Roger Ferguson on his upcoming appointment to the Chair of the Board and look forward to continuing to work together. Moving to Slide 7. I would like to spend a moment highlighting our new strategic framework. This recently introduced framework will be guided by three key pillars: be the premier partner, build our future and become one IFF. Our recently introduced strategic framework is designed to support our mission to do what matters most and drive sustained profitable growth. With our refreshed approach, we have zeroed in on customer excellence, incremental cost reductions, consistent execution and disciplined investments to advance the opportunities with greatest potential returns. This strategy deeply embeds ESG+ priorities across our entire enterprise, strengthening IFF's commitment to positively impact our environmental footprint in the communities in which we operate. With this refreshed strategic framework, we are better positioned to meet evolving customer expectations. We're aligning even more powerfully with our customers while fulfilling our purpose of applying science and creativity for a better world. Now on Slide 8, there are eight key areas that underpin our strategy to advance our growth agenda and pursue cost reduction and enhance our operating plan. Our growth strategy will rely on improvements to our supply chain, enhanced commercial execution, geographic expansion and advantages from harnessing our innovation advantage. As I mentioned, our focus on driving greater productivity and efficiency are equally important to our sustained success. And finally, introducing our end market-driven operating model, strengthening our talent pipeline and culture and improving our digital capabilities will complement our ongoing growth and productivity initiatives to support our long-term strategy. Together, these focus areas will enable us to unlock incremental value for our stakeholders and pursue profitable growth in 2023 and beyond while staying nimble through macroeconomic conditions. Moving to Slide 9. I'd like to review IFF's performance for the full year in which we delivered solid top and bottom line performance despite a very volatile market environment. These results and the progress we've made toward our key operational priorities demonstrate the strength of our global teams, the demand for our offerings and the effectiveness of our productivity initiatives. In 2022, we delivered $12.4 billion in sales, a 9% growth over the previous year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA was approximately $2.5 billion, which equated to comparable currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% versus the prior year. While we were challenged by inflationary pressures over the year, our pricing actions and productivity initiatives helped us to offset and address these challenges over the course of the year. All-in, IFF recovered more than $1 billion in revenue through strategic price increases in 2022. This allowed us to fully offset our raw material, energy and logistics inflation seen throughout the year. We also continue to execute on our productivity agenda where our focus on greater efficiency and the optimization of our supply chain to reduce cost delivering nearly $150 million in productivity benefits in 2022. Aligned with our portfolio optimization initiative, we also successfully completed the sale of our Microbial Control business and announced the sale of our Savory Solutions business. Together, these transactions will contribute more than $2 billion in gross proceeds to strengthen our capital structure. We will continue to examine our business and explore additional noncore divestitures and other timely optimization opportunities to further reduce our debt and direct focus to our core parts of the business. At year-end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.1x. While we made progress against our deleveraging target, this will be a priority for us moving forward as we prioritize cash flow generation in 2023. Now on Slide 10, I\u2019m pleased to share that IFF delivered $12.4 billion in revenue for the full year, representing 9% growth in year-over-year currency-neutral sales. Our Nourish business was a major growth driver, though we saw growth across our four divisions in nearly all of our submarkets. I will cover this in a bit more detail in a minute. As expected, foreign currency impacted our results through the year given the significant volatility across the global markets in which we operate. Looking at our overall profitability in 2022 on Slide 11, despite the combination of inflation and global supply challenges, pressuring our profitability margin, IFF delivered 4% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. As I mentioned earlier, the strategic pricing actions taken throughout the year were essential in managing the significant inflation we face. The productivity initiatives we undertaken in 2022 more than offset volume weakness as we deliver nearly $150 million in operational efficiencies, which drove our full year profitability in the challenging operating environment. Moving forward, we'll continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and take the steps in the areas which we can control to ensure we deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our stakeholders. On Slide 12, now our strong performance across business segments showcased the resilience of our portfolio and the underlying dynamics contributing to our overall top line growth. For the full year, Nourish achieved currency-neutral sales growth of 11% compared to the previous year, with $6.8 billion in overall net sales. This was led by double-digit growth in food designs and ingredients as pricing actions and productivity initiatives led to a 5% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA. Although, impacted by lower volumes, price increases in Health and Bioscience enabled the business to deliver 4% currency-neutral sales growth in 2022, primarily driven by strong performance across all segments, particularly in culture and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Scent also delivered strong 8% currency neutral growth with total net sales totaling $2.3 billion, led by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and strong single-digit increase in Ingredients and Consumer segments. Pharma Solutions achieved 15% currency-neutral growth driven by demand in our pharma business and mid-single-digit growth in industrial. Due to volume growth and successful results from our pricing and productivity initiatives, Pharma Solutions enhanced profitability and achieved an impressive 25% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA. Before turning it over to Glenn, I want to provide a comment around fourth quarter performance. While we anticipated a challenging quarter, the combination of volume deterioration throughout the quarter accelerated in December, as well as its impact on our P&L and negative manufacturing absorption and higher inventories led to a shortfall relative to our expectations. Much of this can be attributed to customer destocking and also softening consumer demand, consistent with what many of our customers have already reported. Nevertheless, as an organization, we need to be better at driving volume growth with our customers, an imperative part of our go-forward strategy. In addition, we will enhance our demand management efforts, process and tools as it relates to inventory management to ensure we are maximizing cash flow generation. I am confident that the addition of new leadership, particularly in Nourish division when our new leaders named and in operations with the recent addition of Ralf Finzel. I have no doubt that through greater commercial execution and more defined processes, we have a lot of opportunity ahead to maximize value creation for our shareholders.  I'll now turn the call over to Glenn to provide you an update on fourth quarter results and an overview of business level performance.\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Frank. Greetings, everyone. Let me add my apologies for the technical issue. You should have seen we're both sweating. So I'll start off by just reiterating, as Frank mentioned, the financial and operational initiatives we implemented during the year, they have proven valuable in helping buffer the broader economic headwinds. But at the same time, we recognize, while we've taken some important steps, we have not fully delivered against our financial objectives. We recognize we have more room for improvement to realize our goals and create a more profitable organization, and I assure you we continue to be intently focused on this going forward. Looking at fourth quarter results, IFF generated $2.8 billion in sales revenue. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, sales were up 4% for the quarter with growth achieved across nearly all divisions. Our adjusted operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $441 million, and our comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 5%. As it was significantly impacted by lower volumes more than anticipated, which led to meaningful impact from negative manufacturing fixed cost absorption despite continued strong pricing and productivity gains. Because of this, we saw a year-over-year decline of approximately 200 basis points to our adjusted operating EBITDA margin. Despite being partially offset by lower effective tax rate, our Q4 EPS ex amortization was 12% lower due to lower adjusted operating profit. Currency headwinds also present a significant challenge in the quarter with a 7 point adverse impact on sales and an 11 point adverse impact on adjusted operating EBITDA versus the prior year. Encouraging recent trends within the currencies have been promising. Clearly, a difficult market environment has weighed on our performance in the fourth quarter. However, I am confident in the steps that IFF is taking as part of our strategic refresh to create a stronger, more resilient business moving forward. Urgency is key and controlling what we can control is our focus: enhancing sales execution disciplines, continuing to price surgically to offset ongoing inflationary pressures, accelerating and importantly, expanding our productivity efforts and more aggressively managing cash flow. On Slide 14, I want to provide more color on our sales performance in the quarter. In a very difficult operating environment, including strong currency headwinds, we realized 4% comparable currency-neutral sales growth. For the quarter, we saw growth in Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Health and Bioscience, which overlaps strong double-digit growth from prior year, experienced a revenue decline. Factoring the strong year ago comparison, H&B is up 5% on a two-year average in the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll go into more detail on the following slides. In the fourth quarter, we also saw a more pronounced slowdown in terms of volumes than we initially expected, down high-single-digits for the quarter, due mainly to consumer demand slowdowns and significant customer destocking actions. We estimate that about 75% of the drop in volume in Q4 is related to destocking, with the balance coming from softer consumer demand. Turning to Slide 15. The fourth quarter market challenges also significantly affected our margins. Comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA decreased by 5%, impacted by volume declines, including negative manufacturing fixed cost absorption and currency pressures. However, pricing actions allowed us to recover the total cost of inflation. Additionally, we delivered notable productivity gains and operational efficiencies, which helped offset some of the volume pressures we faced in the market. Now let\u2019s take a look at segment performance on Slide 16. Overall, we saw top line growth across most of our segments in the quarter. Nourish\u2019s solid comparable currency-neutral sales growth of roughly 4% year-over-year was driven by continued growth in Food Design & Ingredients. Health & Bioscience, which saw a 3% decrease in comparable currency-neutral sales delivered solid performance in Animal Nutrition and Cultures and Food Enzymes despite declines in health and grain processing. Both Nourish and Health & Bioscience saves profitability pressures with 11% decline in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA across both due to lower volumes. Our Scent division performed particularly well in the quarter, delivering 6% year-over-year sales growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis that was supported by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and mid-single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. We were also encouraged by since 25% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA due to a combination of favorable product mix, to catch up in pricing to raw material costs and productivity gains. Our Pharma Solutions segment again delivered excellent performance in the quarter, totaling $221 million in sales, a 15% increase on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in our core pharma business. However, like Nourish and H&B, price increases and productivity were more than offset by lower volumes and higher energy costs. Moving to Slide 17. I would like to provide some additional commentary on our free cash flow dynamics in the year and the progress towards our deleveraging targets. For the full year 2022, cash flow from operations totaled $345 million, while 2022 CapEx was $504 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. Our free cash flow for the full year was candidly disappointing at a negative $159 million. Our free cash flow included about $300 million of costs related to integration and transaction-related items. As we discussed in last quarter\u2019s call, our free cash flow for the year has been significantly impacted by growth in working capital, predominantly by higher inventories caused by inflation, demand slowdown and destocking by our customers. Our priority, as Frank mentioned in 2023 is to take significant actions to improve net working capital with a major focus on inventories to drive cash flow. Accordingly, we have initiated a number of actions across our business and supply chain teams, including systems and process enhancements to rapidly reduce our inventories over the course of the year. And while we understand that this will result in negative manufacturing absorption, adversely impacting the P&L in the short-term, we are prioritizing improved working capital to maximize cash flow results. To keep you with our commitment to return value to our shareholders, we also paid out $810 million in dividends in 2022. As I mentioned during our Investor Day, we are committed to continuing to grow the dividend and will balance dividend growth as we consider reinstituting our share repurchase program once we get debt below 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA. In terms of leverage, we remain focused on efforts to reduce our debt and finish 2022 at 4.1x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA ratio. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $535 million, including $52 million of assets currently in assets held for sale, while gross debt for the year totaled $11 billion. As part of our strategic priorities, we remain committed to achieving our deleveraging target of 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA by 2024, including through deploying proceeds from completed divestitures. Importantly, as Frank mentioned, we will be exploring further opportunities to streamline our portfolio while dedicating resources to our highest growth businesses. Turning to our consolidated outlook on Slide 18. For the fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $12.5 billion and adjusted operating EBITDA to be approximately $2.34 billion, representing comparable currency-neutral sales growth of approximately 6% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA flat versus prior year. We expect year-over-year foreign exchange to have no impact to sales growth and have a modest or approximately 1% negative impact to operating EBITDA growth. Let\u2019s move to Slide 19. Given the number of moving parts affecting our 2023 outlook, we thought it would be helpful to unpack each of the components impacting year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted portfolio, which includes the Health Wright Products acquisition, the 2022 sale of the Microbial Control business and the anticipated close of our Savory Solutions divestiture in May of this year, comparable 2022 EBITDA starts at $2.37 billion. As previously mentioned, we expect full year pricing to fully offset inflation with a net zero EBITDA impact in the year. In our plan, we\u2019ve assumed volume will be flat with high-single-digit negative volumes in Q1, modestly down in Q2 and volume growth in the second half. In addition, we are anticipating mix to be slightly unfavorable for the year as we expect some of our higher margin categories will experience volume pressure, particularly in the first half of 2023. In order to rebalance our inventories and with driving cash flow generation as an imperative for us this year, we anticipate negative manufacturing absorption will impact us significantly. Specifically, we expect that our actions to reduce inventory will adversely impact our adjusted EBITDA growth by several percentage points expressed in year-over-year growth terms. We anticipate that this will yield a strong improvement in inventories and be a core driver to our targeted 2023 adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion, excluding costs related to restructuring and deal-related items. In terms of cost savings, we plan to drive significant productivity by accelerating our previous launch programs, which focus on end-to-end operations improvements, supply chain efficiencies, procurement and demand management, we are also undertaking additional actions to cut costs across the organization and reduce our overall spend where possible, including in our D&A line. We anticipate that these additional actions to deliver an annualized run rate savings of $100 million. We will also be reinvesting some of our productivity to drive our top line through strategic growth initiatives, specifically in R&D, our commercial teams and technology as we begin executing our long-term strategy. Finally, we expect currency to have a modest year-over-year negative impact on EBITDA growth of approximately 1%. As mentioned in terms of the cadence throughout the year, we are anticipating the first half to be more challenging, particularly the first quarter, with a back half improvement. In particular, we expect first quarter comparable performance to be impacted by more challenging volume conditions offset by pricing benefits. For the quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.9 billion to $3 billion with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $470 million to $490 million. As I conclude on the next slide, I want to highlight our four key areas of focus for 2023 and provide further perspectives relative to our detailed execution plans for each. First, we are committed to accelerating sales growth as we move through 2023. While we do expect volumes to be under pressure from the items I discussed earlier, we are sharpening our sales execution discipline and continue to be more surgical with our pricing actions with the goal of progressively improving throughout the year. The build-out of the commercial excellence team, targeted growth investments and increasing our focus on revenue synergies will allow us to capture new wins. Second, as previously outlined, we are focused on enhancing our customer service levels and supply chain efficiencies. With this in mind, we will be setting more granular customer service and related inventory goals by business utilizing our ROIC framework to guide those goals. Supporting these efforts, we will be rolling out our redesigned sales, inventory and operations planning process. Third, as mentioned, we are determined to accelerate our synergy and productivity efforts this year as well. For your reference, included in our 2023 guidance, we are targeting more than $200 million of gross cost reductions from productivity and restructuring benefits. Fourth, and very importantly, we\u2019re intently focused on maximizing our cash flow and accelerating deleverage of our balance sheet. We are being extremely aggressive in managing our working capital through a heightened focus and improved processes and systems, and we are also actively working to complete our additional non-core divestitures and evaluating additional portfolio opportunities. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Frank.\nFrank Clyburn: Thank you, Glenn. Before I open the call for questions, I want to take a moment to reflect on what has continued to make IFF a strong, resilient organization and a category defined leader in our industry. I joined IFF almost a year ago and in an important moment in the company\u2019s transformation and while our global business sought to navigate an incredibly complex operating environment. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, what attracted me to IFF was its enterprise-wide purpose to apply science and creativity for a better world. Since then, I have seen this purpose serve as a guiding light as we have continued to build out our teams, expanded in new markets and strengthen our innovation portfolio and pipeline together. In 2022, we have executed tough pricing actions, rolled out new productivity initiatives and found successful ways to optimize and streamline our portfolio. So we\u2019re investing in areas that will generate growth, enhance our profits and reduce our debt. Most significantly, we have unveiled our refreshed growth strategy and our focus on carrying out those initiatives to ensure we are delivering for our customers while also creating strong returns and sustained profitable growth into the future. Our teams here at IFF have rallied to meet the challenges in front of us, and I\u2019m confident in our future heading into 2023 and beyond, especially based on the excellent reception from all of our stakeholders following the announcement of our strategic refresh in December. Although, we entered 2023 with a cautiously optimistic outlook, I am confident that we have the strategy and the people to address any challenge and deliver long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. IFF continues to play an essential role in the daily lives of so many people around the world, and I\u2019m energized by the unique opportunity in front of us. IFF has built an incredible foundation as a trusted partner with world-class talent, a robust R&D pipeline, broad portfolio, and I\u2019m confident that our refreshed strategic framework and new operating model will allow IFF to increase our customer centricity, more closely align with today\u2019s marketplace and deliver most efficiently for our customers around the world. With that, I would like to now open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas. You may proceed.\nHeidi Vesterinen: Good morning, everyone. So the first question, why should we believe your full year guidance if you\u2019re having to downgrade guidance by such a magnitude in a space of two months? And then I have a separate question on portfolio moves, if I can squeeze another. Are there now more options for you now that it\u2019s been two years since the DuPont merger? Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Heidi, it\u2019s Frank, and thanks for the question, and it\u2019s really an important one. One, we did provide in our Capital Markets Day a preliminary view into 2023. With that said, I think we all feel that we own some of which you\u2019ve mentioned maybe the change. And let me unpack what has happened and especially in Q4. As we went through Q4, Heidi, we had assumed that we would have mid-single-digit volume decline. And as you saw now our full quarter four results, we ended up having growth of 4% overall, but we saw high-single-digit volume decline. We saw that change really accelerate the decline in the month of December, in particular, Heidi. I had spoken about what we were seeing in the Health North America Probiotic business, also parts of our Nourish business, Ingredients and Protein Solutions. And in fact, in the month of December, we did see many of those businesses have double-digit volume decline primarily due to destocking. There is some end market demand impact as well. So when we saw the volume changes in particular that came through in December as well as the impact that it had on our manufacturing cost and absorption, we felt as though we had to really take a look into 2023, obviously, as we\u2019re coming out now to guide. As I look at the trends in January, they are continuing to be very similar, Heidi, to what we saw in December. So when we think of the first quarter, especially against our first quarter comparison where we grew last year 5%, we have made the assumption that this is going to be a challenging first quarter, similar trends as what we have seen in Q4. And then as we get into the first half of the year, we also continue to see challenges from inflation and other pressures. We do see growth in the back half of the year. But when we look at it overall, we see the year having pretty much flattish volume year-over-year, Heidi, but we also feel good about our 6% overall sales growth. When we look at the entirety of the P&L, we also feel it\u2019s really important as you heard from Glenn to focus on cash flow. So one of the things that we\u2019re going to be doing is focusing on reducing our inventory to improve cash flow that is going to have a several percentage point impact on our EBITDA profit growth. We think that\u2019s the right thing to do. And then also as we continue to look at the volume dynamics, we clearly are going to continue to focus on everything we can to control our cost. We have announced accelerating our productivity program, and you heard that from Glenn, and we talked about that at Capital Markets Day. In addition to that, we are instituting a much stronger S&OP process that\u2019s going to be co-led with Ralf Finzel, our new Head of Operations. We have a new Head of Procurement that\u2019s come in, and Glenn\u2019s going to help to co-lead that team, and that team is going to meet on a weekly basis. Also, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on our customers by improving our key account management activity and also continuing to invest in R&D to make sure that we have the innovation needed as things improve as we get in particular towards the back half of the year and as we head into 2024. So we feel confident in the guidance, Heidi, we think it\u2019s prudent and we felt as though it was the right thing to do based on what we saw the trends in the fourth quarter, in particular in the month of December. Your second question, I\u2019m sorry, real quick. Yes, Heidi. The Reverse Morris Trust now in February is \u2013 allows us to look at the entire portfolio that work is underway, Heidi, and we will, as we discussed on Capital Markets Day, continue to look at the entire portfolio to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing for our shareholders as well as making strategic decisions to benefit our customers and to drive profitable growth.\nHeidi Vesterinen: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nGunther Zechmann: Hi. Good morning. I\u2019ve got one for Glenn please, if I can. Glenn, could you help us reconcile what the difference is between the $600 million of the adjusted free cash that you disclosed? And we actually ended up, which is essentially flat. And then going on from that, can you talk us through the drivers for improvement in 2023? How confident are you? And I\u2019m thinking about the $1.5 billion free cash that you outlined at the CMD in December last year, please?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Thanks, Gunther. So first of all, to reconcile for 2022, our GAAP free cash flow was negative $160 million. We had approximately $300 million of deal-related integration restructure. So on a like-for-like adjusted basis, that\u2019s roughly $150 million positive versus the $600 million. So the $450 million difference we had communicated last year \u2013 the largest by far is working capital. We were $300 million higher on working capital for the year. The inventory of that driven by higher inventories, the total increase in working capital was nearly $1.1 billion for the full year. So it was a significant drain on our cash flow. We also \u2013 the earnings were shorter than we had anticipated, and there were some miscellaneous items, but the largest by far is working capital, which then goes to your question regarding 2023. The big swing for 2023 is largely going to be driven by the working capital area of focus where it was a use of $1 billion plus last year. We expect it to be neutral to slightly positive. The biggest focus there is obviously within the inventories, which is the biggest component of our working capital, and that decision to focus on generating $1 billion plus of adjusted free cash flow will put some pressure on the P&L. So we\u2019re taking a hit for some negative absorption and fixed costs because volumes actually will be lower than sales. So we actually can have a decline of year-over-year production volumes, negative absorption. But basically, that is the big driver. Cash interest, cash taxes, CapEx largely will be flattish year-over-year, but the biggest difference by far is the focus on our working capital and namely inventories.\nGunther Zechmann: Got it. If I could just follow up a quick one. How much of the inventory reduction would be driven by lower pricing from raw materials? And how much room left to participate?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Good question. We\u2019re anticipating $350 million to $400 million of reduction from volume and about $150 million increase in price. So think about that as basically, I\u2019ll call it roughly $200 million-ish of reduction of absolute inventory, which is $150 million increase in price and about a $300 million increase \u2013 or decrease or so driven by volumes.\nGunther Zechmann: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Mike, your line is now open.\nMike Sison: Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?\nGlenn Richter: We can.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, Mike.\nMike Sison: Yes. Sorry about that. Given recent commentary from consumer products companies, your peers, any insight into your performance in North America and China, both look notably weak relative to some of these comments. Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, Mike, I\u2019ll take this one. It\u2019s Frank. For China, for the quarter, we did see sales down approximately 4%, Mike. So you\u2019re absolutely right. It was another tough quarter in China as we continue to manage overall the lockdowns and then the reopenings and then some of the COVID impacts that we\u2019re seeing throughout China. So China is still, for us, is a cautious, I would say, market. And as you are well aware, that is our second largest market. So that\u2019s something that we are really continuing to work with our teams there. If you look at North America, you see a little bit of a tail of a couple of different stories. Mike, for the full year, we did grow 5% in North America, but we did see an impact in Q4 of 4% decline versus prior year. And that really speaks to what we saw overall of the impact it\u2019s had in particular in Nourish, which was down approximately 4%. And then also, we saw the significant reduction in North America in the Health Probiotic business that I\u2019ve mentioned, and that actually had H&B down in North America as well. So those are the two, I would say, dynamics in both China and in North America and in particular, North America, I would say more to destocking as we saw a big hit as we\u2019ve been discussing here in Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. You may proceed.\nJosh Spector: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just thinking about raw material inflation specifically, I guess, first, what\u2019s your assumption on the percent increase for this year? And I guess if I look at fourth quarter and how you\u2019re talking about first quarter, your top line is kind of the same. So your pricing is better. Fourth quarter, you saw some positive price cost dynamics. I guess why aren\u2019t we seeing that in 2023? And what are the things we need to watch for in terms of better or worse inflation? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Josh, good question. So let me unpack the roughly 6% inflation expectation for this year. That\u2019s about 70% raws and zero logistics and the residual 30% energy. Energy, by the way, is highly volatile. So that generally is moving more favorable than when we put the plan together, although an awful lot of our energy pricing is now through surcharges. So we\u2019re sort of hedged one way or the other relative to that. So I\u2019ll focus on the 70%. The other thing I would note that remember the first quarter will be impacted by the inventories from last year. So sort of what hits relative to our cost structure is really already baked into sort of what\u2019s sitting in the plants to some extent. We are expecting actually fairly ratable i.e. price equals costs pretty much quarter-to-quarter relatively neutral. So we\u2019re not expecting any sort of big upside or downside. And part of that\u2019s the pacing of the inventories as well. I would say that we are seeing some early signs of deflation on the raw side. However, there are certain commodities that actually have seen more increases, but I would say that you could maybe be a little cautiously optimistic that we probably have seen the peak of inflation in raws and the back half of the year may be experiencing maybe some deflation, which will be favorable for the business. In general, our pricing is pretty much locked in for the year. Most of our pricing is beginning of the year or contractually based on indices that are tracked. So I think the pricing dynamic, the pricing risk is not as significant relative to what\u2019s locked in. Of course, if there\u2019s a rapid level of deflation in the second half of the year, we would adopt relative to our customer dialogues and pricing actions against that. But I would say I\u2019d have a slight lean towards a little more optimism in terms of the price/cost dynamic this year versus last year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. You may proceed.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Given that it\u2019s clear that consumer is exhibiting greater elasticity, just given the extent of price increases, a lot of your CPG customers have been instituting. Frank, just based on your direct conversations with customers, do you sense that there will be a change in their price or volume strategy as we push further into 2023? And just your sense as to how the elasticity dynamic varies globally?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Ghansham, thanks for the question. We do anticipate just as you think about what we saw in Q4 to continue as I mentioned, in Q1. The elasticity question is a really important one. I would say that most of what we are seeing and in discussions with customers, you\u2019re seeing some trade down with regards to quantities. You are seeing some trade down to private label, but it\u2019s not significant. I mean it\u2019s in different parts of the world. I think you\u2019re seeing more price elasticity honestly, in some of the Asian markets, where clearly, you\u2019re seeing some trade-offs there. But overall, we\u2019re not seeing significant trade-offs at this time. With that said, many of our customers are expecting, and I think you\u2019ve seen some of them announce that it\u2019s going to be likely a continued challenging first half of the year from a volume perspective. They are continuing to increase prices and I think that\u2019s going to continue as well for the foreseeable future. So that\u2019s at least at this point in time, how I kind of see the elasticity question. We\u2019re seeing some in Europe, one last geography I would mention, but nothing significant to really point to in other geographies.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.\nJohn Roberts: This is probably for Glenn, so I\u2019ll just ask them together. Frank, I assume you\u2019re still interim head of Nourish. Can we get an update on that process? And did less new wins or a slowdown in new products contribute to the lower volume in Nourish? And then, Glenn, I have in my notes that there were two other small divestments expected to be announced by the end of this quarter, I think, totaling about $300 million in gross proceeds. Is that still the case? And you didn\u2019t provide EPS guidance. So could you talk about how EPS dilution or accretion could play out as the deals close through the year?\nFrank Clyburn: John, it\u2019s Frank. I\u2019ll get started. So one, no, we do not think that the volume declines are specific to any transition in Nourish. I think they\u2019re much more market-driven as we\u2019ve been discussing around destocking. And in fact, in our Flavors business, which is one of our most important businesses. I think we\u2019ve honing very well versus competition. As far as the process, I am working very urgently, John, to get that position filled and my hope is to be able to announce something very shortly on who will be leading theirs going forward. Glenn?\nGlenn Richter: Thanks. Good morning, John. So just a reminder, a year ago, we had talked about four transactions in total with a probability of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in gross proceeds. We announced the largest of those transactions in Savory Solutions, which will be over $900 million of gross proceeds in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ve mentioned we have two other sort of in the near window. We do believe one of them circa $200 million more likely than that. It\u2019s not final will be announced within the quarter. The other two deals, which are relatively small, we are putting on hold. The reason is we are, at this point, actually taking a more comprehensive review of our portfolio and want to focus on sort of what makes sense sort of longer term relative to the overall portfolio. So our efforts are really against the larger portfolio opportunities at this point versus the residual. But I do anticipate between the Savory Solutions and the latest probably $1.1 billion-ish or more of gross proceeds. Relative to full year EPS ex amor, it\u2019s likely to be down circa 15% that\u2019s really driven by the dynamics of the first quarter versus prior year. For the balance of the year, it will be flat to modestly up for the last three quarters of the year. Thanks, John.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nDavid Begleiter: Frank, with the change in the 2023 guidance relative to the IR Day, does this change your expectations the 2024 to 2026 period in terms of 4% to 6% sales growth and 8% to 10% EBITDA growth. And just on the productivity program, I know you\u2019re looking to accelerate it. Any plans potentially to expand it as well? Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, David, thanks for the question. So the answer is we\u2019re still sticking with what we talked about at Capital Markets Day, the 4% to 6% top line growth, 8% to 10% EBITDA growth over the 2024 to 2026 time frame. If you take actually a two-year look back, David, which I did \u2013 our business grew approximately volume about 3%. So if you recall, we're in a market that is 2% to 3% in more normal conditions, which obviously, we're all looking forward to those coming back. But we still believe that profile that we put forward at this point in time is achievable for Capital Markets Day. And we are accelerating productivity, as we've mentioned, we are bringing forward cost reductions this year. Nothing else additional to announce at this point in time. But obviously, myself, the management team, especially during some of the challenging macro environment we talked about, we're going to continue to look for ways to drive additional productivity as we go forward, but nothing additional than what we've already shared.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. You may proceed.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to follow up on an earlier question and ask a related question. So it just seems from the outside perhaps that this business could be too big an unwieldly to run effectively and efficiently. What would you have to see and by when would you consider a more larger scale divestiture \u2013 divestitures to essentially shrink and deemphasize some of the acquisitions, which have been made. And related to that, recent volume trends have been pretty consistently below peers last year, year before, et cetera. So what is that attributable, and when should investors expect IFF to at least grow in line with the peer group? And how do we measure that?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, I'll get started, Mark. I think the volume question is a fair one, but let me look at the portfolio from a couple of different lenses. In our Scent business, we feel as though our volumes are very comparable to peers and the competitors. In fact, there are some instances, I think where we're even gaining share in parts of the Scent business, and we saw very strong volume growth in Fine Fragrance as an example. In Health and Biosciences, Mark, we clearly see good performance in food and culture enzymes. We feel as though we're very competitive in home and personal care. What you're really seeing is the dynamic and the impact on that business is really within health. And we've talked a lot about the shift and change in market demand as well as destocking, but we think overall, our H&B business is very important for the future, but there are some clear volume challenges in that one segment with good growth in other parts of that business. If you come to Nourish, in Nourish we are very competitive. If you look on a two-year basis, Mark, because you have to take into account, we had a very strong volume growth in 2021. But two-year basis, Flavors is growing approximately 5%. So we feel as though we're in very good position within that business. I think the question really volume-wise is within the ingredients business, and we've spoken about. We were capacity constrained in some of those businesses, which impacted some of our volume opportunities. And then we were very aggressive on pricing and made some trade-offs to preserve margin in that business, and we did probably see some share loss within the Ingredient segment, in particular Protein Solutions. So I think overall, Mark, to your broader question, we feel as though the portfolio is the right one. We hear from our customers and in fact, many of our team was down at ACI, just this \u2013 or last week a lot of excitement about the innovation, a lot of excitement about our portfolio. But the proof will be we've got to execute against it, like I mentioned at Capital Markets Day, and that is our focus. We are going to continue to obviously, as Glenn mentioned, we'll get the entirety of the portfolio to make sure that it works strategically and also achieves our other objectives of driving profitable growth. But we feel as though the portfolio overall is the right one. And now we're focused on executing as we've been discussing.\nGlenn Richter: And Mark, I'd add a couple of other items to the Frank's point is, lots of benefits across the portfolio. A lot of our work is on aligning and integrating and maximizing the portfolio. So aligning against three divisions, customer-backed, making sure that we have all the sales and operating teams focusing on the revenue synergies across the how systems work relative to advancing that is important. And then on the simplification of the portfolio, Microbial Controls exit, Savory Solutions. These are businesses that add a lot of complexity. Savory as an example, is a business that has 16,000 customers, 8 different businesses for the ERPs. And to Frank's point, we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and what they may be less core to the overall portfolio as we go forward to continue to simplify as well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nAdam Samuelson: Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to \u2013 Frank, you referenced in an earlier response kind of 2024 kind of still thinking growth could get back in that high single-digit range. I just want to maybe unpack that a little bit in the context of 2023, where it would seem like one of the bigger deltas obviously, volume is not growing, but there's a pretty significant cost under absorption issue as you worked on inventories and presumably, that's weighted in the P&L in the first half of the year. If you're going to 2024, and we presume that there's some growth in the underlying market and your working capital inventories are in a better position, why would we not have faster growth in 2024 on an earnings basis if we're lapping pretty significant under-absorption charges this year.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. And I'll just start. I think I will hold any additional comments on 2024. I think you're right. It's a short-term impact that will be on the P&L, as you've mentioned, as we work down our inventories and have additional absorption, I think we need to really focus right now on 2023. Like I said, we have a guidance that's out there for 2024 to 2026 and in that 8% to 10% range. I think at this point in time, I'd like to hold it there for now and let us work through 2023 and come back to you, okay?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. You may proceed.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning and thank you. So it seems like over the past decade, IFF enjoyed this ability to price and have good visibility regardless of the cost cycle. And it just seems lately \u2013 and when there were problems that was internal, it was getting the disciplines in place and awareness in place. You look at some of these more recently acquired businesses, it just feels like maybe they were always less sustainable margins and more volatility in terms of just they're more opaque, particularly some of the businesses that saw the volume variances this quarter. So how would you comment on that? And is this kind of volatility in both margins and volume maybe more of a new normal? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Yes, this is Glenn, Jonathan. Relative to the first part of your question, clearly, in the last now 18 months, we have significantly improved the discipline, awareness and processes relative to pricing from tools and cross-training to best practices, to much, much surgical application by customer geography, et cetera. And I think that is here to stay in terms of optimizing the business going forward. Not all segments and regions are created equal. Some have greater ability to price than others and some geographies such as Greater Asia, in general, are more competitive, particularly in this environment. So we're being very, very thoughtful. In general, I would say that the N&B portfolio is about equivalency to the F&F portfolio relative to pricing capabilities or ability to pass through pricing, some of the ingredients portfolio are a little more difficult just given slightly more commoditized nature of this businesses. But I do not think there's really a significant difference in what we've seen from an execution standpoint between the legacy IFF and the legacy DuPont businesses and would again iterate that we've done a lot to actually tremendously sort of advance our capabilities to basically be much, much smarter and surgical in our pricing capabilities.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. You may proceed.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Just going back to the portfolio optimization comment a couple of questions ago, you had a very helpful slide in your Analyst Day, I think Slide 12 of Frank's presentation about optimizing some of the underperformers. You mentioned Protein Solutions. I would love to get a little bit more color there on how you see that progressing throughout the year and what's embedded in your assumptions and then perhaps multipliers as well. And then on the positives, any update on Food Design ex Savory? Thank you so much.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Thanks for the question. And as we go in \u2013 as we were communicating on that framework, and remember, it is a framework. What sits in that 20% is really we're going to look at it from two different lenses. One, and you mentioned Protein Solutions and you have some of your specialty proteins, your value proteins that are going into meat alternative products. We're going to continue to look at that business right now. We see it as an important part of our overall offering that we bring to customers because that's oftentimes an entry point in the customers for driving some of our flavor opportunity and other opportunities in the portfolio. With that said, from an ROIC lens, we'll continue to look at it and look at ways to improve the profile of that business. Food designs ex Savory, we see also as an important part of the portfolio going forward. This is all like I said, aligned around our whole Nourish offerings. And if you think about where we're going to really shift to more of an end market focus, in particular around food and beverage, we think that business can really help us to bring a lot of integrated solutions and opportunities to customers going forward. So that's how I would answer it. And we are, though, continuing to stare our portfolio in its entirety through that ROIC lens to make sure we're making the right portfolio choices and putting our resources against the winners that you see on that slide as well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I think during 2022, when you thought about raw materials and price, what you thought is that raw materials were worse than price in 2021 by $200 million, you'd be roughly even in 2023 \u2013 in 2022. And then in 2023, you would be $200 million to the good in the price raw material balance. And now you think that you'll be about flat with inflation. So what happened? That is why did you think you'd make $200 million, but you didn't \u2013 what happened to, I assume, price conditions? And second, what are the cash restructuring outlays \u2013 outflows that you expect in 2023?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey, thanks, Jeff. Good morning. Good question. So you already harken back a year ago, which seems like a decade ago, we originally had $600 million of inflation, pricing/inflation embedded. What happened is two additional rounds of inflation. So we had another $400 million last year, and we have circa $600 million-ish plus in this year. So there's a lag effect. So we're sort of kind of just running through the cycle from a kind of a timing standpoint and standpoint. We haven't sort of talked about sort of how this flows through the 2024, but I think it's reasonable to assume either a combination of stabilization and some deflation in the environment. On the back end, we will pick it up. So I think that's still a very reasonable assumption over the time horizon. The horizons just extended because there's been more sort of systemic inflation over the last few years than we anticipated at that point in time. Relative, we have \u2013 as Frank had mentioned, we have an incremental cost productivity program of $100 million targeted. We expect to get probably circa $70 million of that to hit the P&L this year. We're estimating around $70 million-ish to $75 million of onetime expenses associated with that restructuring.\nOperator: Thank you. The final question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. You may proceed. \nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks so much. We covered a lot. So I guess I have a couple of questions still. But I guess, primarily, when we think about 2023, I think, Frank, Glenn, the three of us have discussed it being a transition year, and there's a lot of things that you laid out on kind of what you want the business to look like as you hit 2024. But now you're talking about not just the curtailing production, but also accelerating cost savings going after G&A and so on. So to what degree do you think \u2013 should we worry about you being able to manage through the cash flow situation kind of shoring up working capital and making these short-term changes you need to make, but still being able to fully execute and get to where you need to be so that this can be the transition year that you discussed it being?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, Lauren, I'll \u2013 good start. Thanks for that question. I think \u2013 it's a really great question, an important one. What we've done on is we're really focused on really prioritizing our activities across the company and the management team. First priority, Lauren, is clearly doing everything we can to make sure that we do have the right investments in the innovation that we deliver, in R&D and also making sure we can accelerate our sales performance, and we are spending a lot of time with our commercial teams, working on ensuring good capability build and making sure that we are ready to enhance our pipeline as well as our win rate going forward. So that's priority one, Lauren, and that's a big focus for us. On the cash flow and inventory work, I think we're in a good position. We brought in a new team. Glenn is going to be very intimately involved with our new Head of Operations and our business leaders. We are going to build that into our incentive system, cash conversion this year, Lauren, and we feel as though there is a very good path forward to deliver the short-term because we have to improve our cash flow, and we have to reduce our inventory, and we have a laser focus on making that happen. And I feel like we've got the right team and we're putting in place the right processes to execute against that. That's pretty much number two. And then number three, we are working towards, as you mentioned, getting the organization aligned to more of an end market back view. We are starting that work. We'll have more to communicate here as we go throughout the year. But I feel good by the end of this year, that alignment will be in place and we have the right people, right teams align with our customers. Just one anecdote. Many of our customers that I've spoken to as well as that we've engaged with really like the way we're thinking about operating and aligning IFF to how they're organized. So we think that is something we will focus on. So while there are a lot of activities, think of it three laser-focused priorities the team are aligning behind, Lauren, to execute to your point, to make sure that we can deliver on the future profitable growth agenda that we have, okay. So thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: With that, I want first \u2013 I want to \u2013 yes. Just a couple of last comments, I want to first, thank everyone for joining. Our apologies again on our start. We appreciate everyone hanging in with us. We know this went a little bit longer because of that and we look forward to seeing you here and speaking to you very soon. Thank you, everybody. Have a good rest of the day.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Frank Clyburn",
            "content": "Good morning to everybody. I want to start today's call by recognizing our teams in the incredible work they've done throughout 2022 to bolster IFF's industry leadership and also to continue delivering innovative solutions for our customers amid the challenging operating environment. As part of our Investor Day in December, we unveiled the next phase of our strategic transformation including our strategic priorities and a refreshed operating model that will better position IFF to drive long-term profitable growth and capitalize on the market opportunities ahead of us. The plan seeks to maximize our competitive advantage and ensure that we are operating as an even more innovative, efficient and disciplined company. As we delivered solid 2022 result and 2023 is in full swing, I'm pleased to share that we are advancing key elements of this plan and excited to update you on today's call. It is a true privilege to work along such talented and dedicated colleagues. Across our global platform, it is clear that our teams are committed to IFF's continued transformation as we delivered unmatched innovation, service and quality in the solutions that meet the needs of our customers, both today and tomorrow. Now on Slide 6, I'd like to reiterate the financial and strategic initiatives central to the strategic refresh that we were discussing during our Investor Day last December. Following an extensive assessment with our key stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders and key partners, we've identified several top priorities that will guide IFF's next chapter. First, we're focused on jump-starting even stronger growth across the business. There's no question that our robust portfolio provides a clear strategic advantage by doubling down on customer excellence and making strategic investments in the opportunities that will reap the greatest returns for our business will be better positioned to drive sustained profitable growth. We have many of the pieces in place to support future growth, a highly diversified offering, serving attractive end markets, global talent and a world-class R&D organization. Our long-term success requires a more disciplined approach to ensure that growth does not come at the cost of profitability. We must deliver on this objective, and we are laser-focused on doing so, particularly amid the macroeconomic pressures we are facing today, it is essential that we target enhanced cost and productivity initiatives. In 2022, we implemented several productivity and cost reduction efforts that have proven effective towards offsetting market challenges. Ultimately, our goal is to realize net annual savings of approximately $350 million to $400 million between 2023 and 2025, including the additional $100 million in run rate savings we announced at our Investor Day to support this reinvestment and increased profitability. Moving forward, we will be disciplined to focus on the areas of our business that will best support our profitable growth, investing in R&D to get projects to market more efficiently, enhancing end-to-end productivity to drive improved costs and processes and further improving our supply chain to be more efficient. An essential component of our value creation plan is our work to simplify our operating model to closely align with our three core end markets: food and beverage, home and personal care and health and become One IFF. This new model will be critical to achieve the goals I just outlined as we enhance our ability to grow profitably through a more customer-centric and market-backed approach. As a result of these efforts, we are building a stronger financial profile for IFF and are targeting sales growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 8% to 10% on a comparable currency-neutral basis over 2024, 2025 and 2026. We also remain committed to deleveraging our balance sheet below the 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA objective for 2024. Underpinning these efforts will be an intense focus on enhancing our ESG leadership and accelerating our efforts to contribute to a more sustainable world through our operations and initiatives. We will also continue efforts to optimize our portfolio, ensuring we have the offering needed to support future growth while pursuing noncore divestitures like our recent announced sale of our Savory Solutions business to improve our capital structure. Doing so, will allow IFF to reinvest in the high growth areas of our business while ensuring we are operating most efficiently as an organization. Lastly, we continue to take steps to evolve our Board in line with best-in-class governance standards, with plans to reduce the size of our board from 14 to a target of no more than 10 IFF directors and one icon capital designee director by the 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting. With this initiative, we are also focused on the composition of the Board and prioritizing the inclusion of senior executives with the most relevant skills, leadership experience and business expertise needed to support IFF's long-term vision. As you may have seen, we have some additional board changes since our Investor Day where we announced Mark Costa is joining us. I would like to welcome Dawn Willoughby and Gary Hu to our Board as well. I also want to take the opportunity to thank several Board members that have recently come off the board or has been announced and will do so at the annual meeting. We are grateful for the years of tremendous contribution and for all of their hard work and service to IFF. Thank you to Dale Morrison, Michael Ducker, Ilene Gordon and Kare Schultz. In addition, I would like to congratulate Roger Ferguson on his upcoming appointment to the Chair of the Board and look forward to continuing to work together. Moving to Slide 7. I would like to spend a moment highlighting our new strategic framework. This recently introduced framework will be guided by three key pillars: be the premier partner, build our future and become one IFF. Our recently introduced strategic framework is designed to support our mission to do what matters most and drive sustained profitable growth. With our refreshed approach, we have zeroed in on customer excellence, incremental cost reductions, consistent execution and disciplined investments to advance the opportunities with greatest potential returns. This strategy deeply embeds ESG+ priorities across our entire enterprise, strengthening IFF's commitment to positively impact our environmental footprint in the communities in which we operate. With this refreshed strategic framework, we are better positioned to meet evolving customer expectations. We're aligning even more powerfully with our customers while fulfilling our purpose of applying science and creativity for a better world. Now on Slide 8, there are eight key areas that underpin our strategy to advance our growth agenda and pursue cost reduction and enhance our operating plan. Our growth strategy will rely on improvements to our supply chain, enhanced commercial execution, geographic expansion and advantages from harnessing our innovation advantage. As I mentioned, our focus on driving greater productivity and efficiency are equally important to our sustained success. And finally, introducing our end market-driven operating model, strengthening our talent pipeline and culture and improving our digital capabilities will complement our ongoing growth and productivity initiatives to support our long-term strategy. Together, these focus areas will enable us to unlock incremental value for our stakeholders and pursue profitable growth in 2023 and beyond while staying nimble through macroeconomic conditions. Moving to Slide 9. I'd like to review IFF's performance for the full year in which we delivered solid top and bottom line performance despite a very volatile market environment. These results and the progress we've made toward our key operational priorities demonstrate the strength of our global teams, the demand for our offerings and the effectiveness of our productivity initiatives. In 2022, we delivered $12.4 billion in sales, a 9% growth over the previous year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Adjusted operating EBITDA was approximately $2.5 billion, which equated to comparable currency-neutral adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% versus the prior year. While we were challenged by inflationary pressures over the year, our pricing actions and productivity initiatives helped us to offset and address these challenges over the course of the year. All-in, IFF recovered more than $1 billion in revenue through strategic price increases in 2022. This allowed us to fully offset our raw material, energy and logistics inflation seen throughout the year. We also continue to execute on our productivity agenda where our focus on greater efficiency and the optimization of our supply chain to reduce cost delivering nearly $150 million in productivity benefits in 2022. Aligned with our portfolio optimization initiative, we also successfully completed the sale of our Microbial Control business and announced the sale of our Savory Solutions business. Together, these transactions will contribute more than $2 billion in gross proceeds to strengthen our capital structure. We will continue to examine our business and explore additional noncore divestitures and other timely optimization opportunities to further reduce our debt and direct focus to our core parts of the business. At year-end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.1x. While we made progress against our deleveraging target, this will be a priority for us moving forward as we prioritize cash flow generation in 2023. Now on Slide 10, I'm pleased to share that IFF delivered $12.4 billion in revenue for the full year, representing 9% growth in year-over-year currency-neutral sales. Our Nourish business was a major growth driver, though we saw growth across our four divisions in nearly all of our submarkets. I will cover this in a bit more detail in a minute. As expected, foreign currency impacted our results through the year given the significant volatility across the global markets in which we operate. Looking at our overall profitability in 2022 on Slide 11, despite the combination of inflation and global supply challenges, pressuring our profitability margin, IFF delivered 4% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. As I mentioned earlier, the strategic pricing actions taken throughout the year were essential in managing the significant inflation we face. The productivity initiatives we undertaken in 2022 more than offset volume weakness as we deliver nearly $150 million in operational efficiencies, which drove our full year profitability in the challenging operating environment. Moving forward, we'll continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and take the steps in the areas which we can control to ensure we deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our stakeholders. On Slide 12, now our strong performance across business segments showcased the resilience of our portfolio and the underlying dynamics contributing to our overall top line growth. For the full year, Nourish achieved currency-neutral sales growth of 11% compared to the previous year, with $6.8 billion in overall net sales. This was led by double-digit growth in food designs and ingredients as pricing actions and productivity initiatives led to a 5% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA. Although, impacted by lower volumes, price increases in Health and Bioscience enabled the business to deliver 4% currency-neutral sales growth in 2022, primarily driven by strong performance across all segments, particularly in culture and food enzymes and animal nutrition. Scent also delivered strong 8% currency neutral growth with total net sales totaling $2.3 billion, led by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and strong single-digit increase in Ingredients and Consumer segments. Pharma Solutions achieved 15% currency-neutral growth driven by demand in our pharma business and mid-single-digit growth in industrial. Due to volume growth and successful results from our pricing and productivity initiatives, Pharma Solutions enhanced profitability and achieved an impressive 25% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA. Before turning it over to Glenn, I want to provide a comment around fourth quarter performance. While we anticipated a challenging quarter, the combination of volume deterioration throughout the quarter accelerated in December, as well as its impact on our P&L and negative manufacturing absorption and higher inventories led to a shortfall relative to our expectations. Much of this can be attributed to customer destocking and also softening consumer demand, consistent with what many of our customers have already reported. Nevertheless, as an organization, we need to be better at driving volume growth with our customers, an imperative part of our go-forward strategy. In addition, we will enhance our demand management efforts, process and tools as it relates to inventory management to ensure we are maximizing cash flow generation. I am confident that the addition of new leadership, particularly in Nourish division when our new leaders named and in operations with the recent addition of Ralf Finzel. I have no doubt that through greater commercial execution and more defined processes, we have a lot of opportunity ahead to maximize value creation for our shareholders.  I'll now turn the call over to Glenn to provide you an update on fourth quarter results and an overview of business level performance. Thank you, Glenn. Before I open the call for questions, I want to take a moment to reflect on what has continued to make IFF a strong, resilient organization and a category defined leader in our industry. I joined IFF almost a year ago and in an important moment in the company's transformation and while our global business sought to navigate an incredibly complex operating environment. As I've mentioned before, what attracted me to IFF was its enterprise-wide purpose to apply science and creativity for a better world. Since then, I have seen this purpose serve as a guiding light as we have continued to build out our teams, expanded in new markets and strengthen our innovation portfolio and pipeline together. In 2022, we have executed tough pricing actions, rolled out new productivity initiatives and found successful ways to optimize and streamline our portfolio. So we're investing in areas that will generate growth, enhance our profits and reduce our debt. Most significantly, we have unveiled our refreshed growth strategy and our focus on carrying out those initiatives to ensure we are delivering for our customers while also creating strong returns and sustained profitable growth into the future. Our teams here at IFF have rallied to meet the challenges in front of us, and I'm confident in our future heading into 2023 and beyond, especially based on the excellent reception from all of our stakeholders following the announcement of our strategic refresh in December. Although, we entered 2023 with a cautiously optimistic outlook, I am confident that we have the strategy and the people to address any challenge and deliver long-term value for shareholders and other stakeholders. IFF continues to play an essential role in the daily lives of so many people around the world, and I'm energized by the unique opportunity in front of us. IFF has built an incredible foundation as a trusted partner with world-class talent, a robust R&D pipeline, broad portfolio, and I'm confident that our refreshed strategic framework and new operating model will allow IFF to increase our customer centricity, more closely align with today's marketplace and deliver most efficiently for our customers around the world. With that, I would like to now open the call up for questions. Heidi, it's Frank, and thanks for the question, and it's really an important one. One, we did provide in our Capital Markets Day a preliminary view into 2023. With that said, I think we all feel that we own some of which you've mentioned maybe the change. And let me unpack what has happened and especially in Q4. As we went through Q4, Heidi, we had assumed that we would have mid-single-digit volume decline. And as you saw now our full quarter four results, we ended up having growth of 4% overall, but we saw high-single-digit volume decline. We saw that change really accelerate the decline in the month of December, in particular, Heidi. I had spoken about what we were seeing in the Health North America Probiotic business, also parts of our Nourish business, Ingredients and Protein Solutions. And in fact, in the month of December, we did see many of those businesses have double-digit volume decline primarily due to destocking. There is some end market demand impact as well. So when we saw the volume changes in particular that came through in December as well as the impact that it had on our manufacturing cost and absorption, we felt as though we had to really take a look into 2023, obviously, as we're coming out now to guide. As I look at the trends in January, they are continuing to be very similar, Heidi, to what we saw in December. So when we think of the first quarter, especially against our first quarter comparison where we grew last year 5%, we have made the assumption that this is going to be a challenging first quarter, similar trends as what we have seen in Q4. And then as we get into the first half of the year, we also continue to see challenges from inflation and other pressures. We do see growth in the back half of the year. But when we look at it overall, we see the year having pretty much flattish volume year-over-year, Heidi, but we also feel good about our 6% overall sales growth. When we look at the entirety of the P&L, we also feel it's really important as you heard from Glenn to focus on cash flow. So one of the things that we're going to be doing is focusing on reducing our inventory to improve cash flow that is going to have a several percentage point impact on our EBITDA profit growth. We think that's the right thing to do. And then also as we continue to look at the volume dynamics, we clearly are going to continue to focus on everything we can to control our cost. We have announced accelerating our productivity program, and you heard that from Glenn, and we talked about that at Capital Markets Day. In addition to that, we are instituting a much stronger S&OP process that's going to be co-led with Ralf Finzel, our new Head of Operations. We have a new Head of Procurement that's come in, and Glenn's going to help to co-lead that team, and that team is going to meet on a weekly basis. Also, we're going to continue to focus on our customers by improving our key account management activity and also continuing to invest in R&D to make sure that we have the innovation needed as things improve as we get in particular towards the back half of the year and as we head into 2024. So we feel confident in the guidance, Heidi, we think it's prudent and we felt as though it was the right thing to do based on what we saw the trends in the fourth quarter, in particular in the month of December. Your second question, I'm sorry, real quick. Yes, Heidi. The Reverse Morris Trust now in February is \u2013 allows us to look at the entire portfolio that work is underway, Heidi, and we will, as we discussed on Capital Markets Day, continue to look at the entire portfolio to make sure that we're maximizing for our shareholders as well as making strategic decisions to benefit our customers and to drive profitable growth. Yes, Mike. Yes, Mike, I'll take this one. It's Frank. For China, for the quarter, we did see sales down approximately 4%, Mike. So you're absolutely right. It was another tough quarter in China as we continue to manage overall the lockdowns and then the reopenings and then some of the COVID impacts that we're seeing throughout China. So China is still, for us, is a cautious, I would say, market. And as you are well aware, that is our second largest market. So that's something that we are really continuing to work with our teams there. If you look at North America, you see a little bit of a tail of a couple of different stories. Mike, for the full year, we did grow 5% in North America, but we did see an impact in Q4 of 4% decline versus prior year. And that really speaks to what we saw overall of the impact it's had in particular in Nourish, which was down approximately 4%. And then also, we saw the significant reduction in North America in the Health Probiotic business that I've mentioned, and that actually had H&B down in North America as well. So those are the two, I would say, dynamics in both China and in North America and in particular, North America, I would say more to destocking as we saw a big hit as we've been discussing here in Q4. Yes. Ghansham, thanks for the question. We do anticipate just as you think about what we saw in Q4 to continue as I mentioned, in Q1. The elasticity question is a really important one. I would say that most of what we are seeing and in discussions with customers, you're seeing some trade down with regards to quantities. You are seeing some trade down to private label, but it's not significant. I mean it's in different parts of the world. I think you're seeing more price elasticity honestly, in some of the Asian markets, where clearly, you're seeing some trade-offs there. But overall, we're not seeing significant trade-offs at this time. With that said, many of our customers are expecting, and I think you've seen some of them announce that it's going to be likely a continued challenging first half of the year from a volume perspective. They are continuing to increase prices and I think that's going to continue as well for the foreseeable future. So that's at least at this point in time, how I kind of see the elasticity question. We're seeing some in Europe, one last geography I would mention, but nothing significant to really point to in other geographies. John, it's Frank. I'll get started. So one, no, we do not think that the volume declines are specific to any transition in Nourish. I think they're much more market-driven as we've been discussing around destocking. And in fact, in our Flavors business, which is one of our most important businesses. I think we've honing very well versus competition. As far as the process, I am working very urgently, John, to get that position filled and my hope is to be able to announce something very shortly on who will be leading theirs going forward. Glenn? Yes, David, thanks for the question. So the answer is we're still sticking with what we talked about at Capital Markets Day, the 4% to 6% top line growth, 8% to 10% EBITDA growth over the 2024 to 2026 time frame. If you take actually a two-year look back, David, which I did \u2013 our business grew approximately volume about 3%. So if you recall, we're in a market that is 2% to 3% in more normal conditions, which obviously, we're all looking forward to those coming back. But we still believe that profile that we put forward at this point in time is achievable for Capital Markets Day. And we are accelerating productivity, as we've mentioned, we are bringing forward cost reductions this year. Nothing else additional to announce at this point in time. But obviously, myself, the management team, especially during some of the challenging macro environment we talked about, we're going to continue to look for ways to drive additional productivity as we go forward, but nothing additional than what we've already shared. Yes, I'll get started, Mark. I think the volume question is a fair one, but let me look at the portfolio from a couple of different lenses. In our Scent business, we feel as though our volumes are very comparable to peers and the competitors. In fact, there are some instances, I think where we're even gaining share in parts of the Scent business, and we saw very strong volume growth in Fine Fragrance as an example. In Health and Biosciences, Mark, we clearly see good performance in food and culture enzymes. We feel as though we're very competitive in home and personal care. What you're really seeing is the dynamic and the impact on that business is really within health. And we've talked a lot about the shift and change in market demand as well as destocking, but we think overall, our H&B business is very important for the future, but there are some clear volume challenges in that one segment with good growth in other parts of that business. If you come to Nourish, in Nourish we are very competitive. If you look on a two-year basis, Mark, because you have to take into account, we had a very strong volume growth in 2021. But two-year basis, Flavors is growing approximately 5%. So we feel as though we're in very good position within that business. I think the question really volume-wise is within the ingredients business, and we've spoken about. We were capacity constrained in some of those businesses, which impacted some of our volume opportunities. And then we were very aggressive on pricing and made some trade-offs to preserve margin in that business, and we did probably see some share loss within the Ingredient segment, in particular Protein Solutions. So I think overall, Mark, to your broader question, we feel as though the portfolio is the right one. We hear from our customers and in fact, many of our team was down at ACI, just this \u2013 or last week a lot of excitement about the innovation, a lot of excitement about our portfolio. But the proof will be we've got to execute against it, like I mentioned at Capital Markets Day, and that is our focus. We are going to continue to obviously, as Glenn mentioned, we'll get the entirety of the portfolio to make sure that it works strategically and also achieves our other objectives of driving profitable growth. But we feel as though the portfolio overall is the right one. And now we're focused on executing as we've been discussing. Yes. And I'll just start. I think I will hold any additional comments on 2024. I think you're right. It's a short-term impact that will be on the P&L, as you've mentioned, as we work down our inventories and have additional absorption, I think we need to really focus right now on 2023. Like I said, we have a guidance that's out there for 2024 to 2026 and in that 8% to 10% range. I think at this point in time, I'd like to hold it there for now and let us work through 2023 and come back to you, okay? Yes. Thanks for the question. And as we go in \u2013 as we were communicating on that framework, and remember, it is a framework. What sits in that 20% is really we're going to look at it from two different lenses. One, and you mentioned Protein Solutions and you have some of your specialty proteins, your value proteins that are going into meat alternative products. We're going to continue to look at that business right now. We see it as an important part of our overall offering that we bring to customers because that's oftentimes an entry point in the customers for driving some of our flavor opportunity and other opportunities in the portfolio. With that said, from an ROIC lens, we'll continue to look at it and look at ways to improve the profile of that business. Food designs ex Savory, we see also as an important part of the portfolio going forward. This is all like I said, aligned around our whole Nourish offerings. And if you think about where we're going to really shift to more of an end market focus, in particular around food and beverage, we think that business can really help us to bring a lot of integrated solutions and opportunities to customers going forward. So that's how I would answer it. And we are, though, continuing to stare our portfolio in its entirety through that ROIC lens to make sure we're making the right portfolio choices and putting our resources against the winners that you see on that slide as well. Yes, Lauren, I'll \u2013 good start. Thanks for that question. I think \u2013 it's a really great question, an important one. What we've done on is we're really focused on really prioritizing our activities across the company and the management team. First priority, Lauren, is clearly doing everything we can to make sure that we do have the right investments in the innovation that we deliver, in R&D and also making sure we can accelerate our sales performance, and we are spending a lot of time with our commercial teams, working on ensuring good capability build and making sure that we are ready to enhance our pipeline as well as our win rate going forward. So that's priority one, Lauren, and that's a big focus for us. On the cash flow and inventory work, I think we're in a good position. We brought in a new team. Glenn is going to be very intimately involved with our new Head of Operations and our business leaders. We are going to build that into our incentive system, cash conversion this year, Lauren, and we feel as though there is a very good path forward to deliver the short-term because we have to improve our cash flow, and we have to reduce our inventory, and we have a laser focus on making that happen. And I feel like we've got the right team and we're putting in place the right processes to execute against that. That's pretty much number two. And then number three, we are working towards, as you mentioned, getting the organization aligned to more of an end market back view. We are starting that work. We'll have more to communicate here as we go throughout the year. But I feel good by the end of this year, that alignment will be in place and we have the right people, right teams align with our customers. Just one anecdote. Many of our customers that I've spoken to as well as that we've engaged with really like the way we're thinking about operating and aligning IFF to how they're organized. So we think that is something we will focus on. So while there are a lot of activities, think of it three laser-focused priorities the team are aligning behind, Lauren, to execute to your point, to make sure that we can deliver on the future profitable growth agenda that we have, okay. So thank you. With that, I want first \u2013 I want to \u2013 yes. Just a couple of last comments, I want to first, thank everyone for joining. Our apologies again on our start. We appreciate everyone hanging in with us. We know this went a little bit longer because of that and we look forward to seeing you here and speaking to you very soon. Thank you, everybody. Have a good rest of the day."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Greetings, everyone. Let me add my apologies for the technical issue. You should have seen we're both sweating. So I'll start off by just reiterating, as Frank mentioned, the financial and operational initiatives we implemented during the year, they have proven valuable in helping buffer the broader economic headwinds. But at the same time, we recognize, while we've taken some important steps, we have not fully delivered against our financial objectives. We recognize we have more room for improvement to realize our goals and create a more profitable organization, and I assure you we continue to be intently focused on this going forward. Looking at fourth quarter results, IFF generated $2.8 billion in sales revenue. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, sales were up 4% for the quarter with growth achieved across nearly all divisions. Our adjusted operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $441 million, and our comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 5%. As it was significantly impacted by lower volumes more than anticipated, which led to meaningful impact from negative manufacturing fixed cost absorption despite continued strong pricing and productivity gains. Because of this, we saw a year-over-year decline of approximately 200 basis points to our adjusted operating EBITDA margin. Despite being partially offset by lower effective tax rate, our Q4 EPS ex amortization was 12% lower due to lower adjusted operating profit. Currency headwinds also present a significant challenge in the quarter with a 7 point adverse impact on sales and an 11 point adverse impact on adjusted operating EBITDA versus the prior year. Encouraging recent trends within the currencies have been promising. Clearly, a difficult market environment has weighed on our performance in the fourth quarter. However, I am confident in the steps that IFF is taking as part of our strategic refresh to create a stronger, more resilient business moving forward. Urgency is key and controlling what we can control is our focus: enhancing sales execution disciplines, continuing to price surgically to offset ongoing inflationary pressures, accelerating and importantly, expanding our productivity efforts and more aggressively managing cash flow. On Slide 14, I want to provide more color on our sales performance in the quarter. In a very difficult operating environment, including strong currency headwinds, we realized 4% comparable currency-neutral sales growth. For the quarter, we saw growth in Nourish, Scent and Pharma Solutions. Health and Bioscience, which overlaps strong double-digit growth from prior year, experienced a revenue decline. Factoring the strong year ago comparison, H&B is up 5% on a two-year average in the fourth quarter. I'll go into more detail on the following slides. In the fourth quarter, we also saw a more pronounced slowdown in terms of volumes than we initially expected, down high-single-digits for the quarter, due mainly to consumer demand slowdowns and significant customer destocking actions. We estimate that about 75% of the drop in volume in Q4 is related to destocking, with the balance coming from softer consumer demand. Turning to Slide 15. The fourth quarter market challenges also significantly affected our margins. Comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA decreased by 5%, impacted by volume declines, including negative manufacturing fixed cost absorption and currency pressures. However, pricing actions allowed us to recover the total cost of inflation. Additionally, we delivered notable productivity gains and operational efficiencies, which helped offset some of the volume pressures we faced in the market. Now let's take a look at segment performance on Slide 16. Overall, we saw top line growth across most of our segments in the quarter. Nourish's solid comparable currency-neutral sales growth of roughly 4% year-over-year was driven by continued growth in Food Design & Ingredients. Health & Bioscience, which saw a 3% decrease in comparable currency-neutral sales delivered solid performance in Animal Nutrition and Cultures and Food Enzymes despite declines in health and grain processing. Both Nourish and Health & Bioscience saves profitability pressures with 11% decline in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA across both due to lower volumes. Our Scent division performed particularly well in the quarter, delivering 6% year-over-year sales growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis that was supported by double-digit growth in Fine Fragrance and mid-single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. We were also encouraged by since 25% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA due to a combination of favorable product mix, to catch up in pricing to raw material costs and productivity gains. Our Pharma Solutions segment again delivered excellent performance in the quarter, totaling $221 million in sales, a 15% increase on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in our core pharma business. However, like Nourish and H&B, price increases and productivity were more than offset by lower volumes and higher energy costs. Moving to Slide 17. I would like to provide some additional commentary on our free cash flow dynamics in the year and the progress towards our deleveraging targets. For the full year 2022, cash flow from operations totaled $345 million, while 2022 CapEx was $504 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. Our free cash flow for the full year was candidly disappointing at a negative $159 million. Our free cash flow included about $300 million of costs related to integration and transaction-related items. As we discussed in last quarter's call, our free cash flow for the year has been significantly impacted by growth in working capital, predominantly by higher inventories caused by inflation, demand slowdown and destocking by our customers. Our priority, as Frank mentioned in 2023 is to take significant actions to improve net working capital with a major focus on inventories to drive cash flow. Accordingly, we have initiated a number of actions across our business and supply chain teams, including systems and process enhancements to rapidly reduce our inventories over the course of the year. And while we understand that this will result in negative manufacturing absorption, adversely impacting the P&L in the short-term, we are prioritizing improved working capital to maximize cash flow results. To keep you with our commitment to return value to our shareholders, we also paid out $810 million in dividends in 2022. As I mentioned during our Investor Day, we are committed to continuing to grow the dividend and will balance dividend growth as we consider reinstituting our share repurchase program once we get debt below 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA. In terms of leverage, we remain focused on efforts to reduce our debt and finish 2022 at 4.1x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA ratio. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $535 million, including $52 million of assets currently in assets held for sale, while gross debt for the year totaled $11 billion. As part of our strategic priorities, we remain committed to achieving our deleveraging target of 3x net debt-to-credit adjusted EBITDA by 2024, including through deploying proceeds from completed divestitures. Importantly, as Frank mentioned, we will be exploring further opportunities to streamline our portfolio while dedicating resources to our highest growth businesses. Turning to our consolidated outlook on Slide 18. For the fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $12.5 billion and adjusted operating EBITDA to be approximately $2.34 billion, representing comparable currency-neutral sales growth of approximately 6% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA flat versus prior year. We expect year-over-year foreign exchange to have no impact to sales growth and have a modest or approximately 1% negative impact to operating EBITDA growth. Let's move to Slide 19. Given the number of moving parts affecting our 2023 outlook, we thought it would be helpful to unpack each of the components impacting year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted portfolio, which includes the Health Wright Products acquisition, the 2022 sale of the Microbial Control business and the anticipated close of our Savory Solutions divestiture in May of this year, comparable 2022 EBITDA starts at $2.37 billion. As previously mentioned, we expect full year pricing to fully offset inflation with a net zero EBITDA impact in the year. In our plan, we've assumed volume will be flat with high-single-digit negative volumes in Q1, modestly down in Q2 and volume growth in the second half. In addition, we are anticipating mix to be slightly unfavorable for the year as we expect some of our higher margin categories will experience volume pressure, particularly in the first half of 2023. In order to rebalance our inventories and with driving cash flow generation as an imperative for us this year, we anticipate negative manufacturing absorption will impact us significantly. Specifically, we expect that our actions to reduce inventory will adversely impact our adjusted EBITDA growth by several percentage points expressed in year-over-year growth terms. We anticipate that this will yield a strong improvement in inventories and be a core driver to our targeted 2023 adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion, excluding costs related to restructuring and deal-related items. In terms of cost savings, we plan to drive significant productivity by accelerating our previous launch programs, which focus on end-to-end operations improvements, supply chain efficiencies, procurement and demand management, we are also undertaking additional actions to cut costs across the organization and reduce our overall spend where possible, including in our D&A line. We anticipate that these additional actions to deliver an annualized run rate savings of $100 million. We will also be reinvesting some of our productivity to drive our top line through strategic growth initiatives, specifically in R&D, our commercial teams and technology as we begin executing our long-term strategy. Finally, we expect currency to have a modest year-over-year negative impact on EBITDA growth of approximately 1%. As mentioned in terms of the cadence throughout the year, we are anticipating the first half to be more challenging, particularly the first quarter, with a back half improvement. In particular, we expect first quarter comparable performance to be impacted by more challenging volume conditions offset by pricing benefits. For the quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.9 billion to $3 billion with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $470 million to $490 million. As I conclude on the next slide, I want to highlight our four key areas of focus for 2023 and provide further perspectives relative to our detailed execution plans for each. First, we are committed to accelerating sales growth as we move through 2023. While we do expect volumes to be under pressure from the items I discussed earlier, we are sharpening our sales execution discipline and continue to be more surgical with our pricing actions with the goal of progressively improving throughout the year. The build-out of the commercial excellence team, targeted growth investments and increasing our focus on revenue synergies will allow us to capture new wins. Second, as previously outlined, we are focused on enhancing our customer service levels and supply chain efficiencies. With this in mind, we will be setting more granular customer service and related inventory goals by business utilizing our ROIC framework to guide those goals. Supporting these efforts, we will be rolling out our redesigned sales, inventory and operations planning process. Third, as mentioned, we are determined to accelerate our synergy and productivity efforts this year as well. For your reference, included in our 2023 guidance, we are targeting more than $200 million of gross cost reductions from productivity and restructuring benefits. Fourth, and very importantly, we're intently focused on maximizing our cash flow and accelerating deleverage of our balance sheet. We are being extremely aggressive in managing our working capital through a heightened focus and improved processes and systems, and we are also actively working to complete our additional non-core divestitures and evaluating additional portfolio opportunities. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Frank. Yes. Thanks, Gunther. So first of all, to reconcile for 2022, our GAAP free cash flow was negative $160 million. We had approximately $300 million of deal-related integration restructure. So on a like-for-like adjusted basis, that's roughly $150 million positive versus the $600 million. So the $450 million difference we had communicated last year \u2013 the largest by far is working capital. We were $300 million higher on working capital for the year. The inventory of that driven by higher inventories, the total increase in working capital was nearly $1.1 billion for the full year. So it was a significant drain on our cash flow. We also \u2013 the earnings were shorter than we had anticipated, and there were some miscellaneous items, but the largest by far is working capital, which then goes to your question regarding 2023. The big swing for 2023 is largely going to be driven by the working capital area of focus where it was a use of $1 billion plus last year. We expect it to be neutral to slightly positive. The biggest focus there is obviously within the inventories, which is the biggest component of our working capital, and that decision to focus on generating $1 billion plus of adjusted free cash flow will put some pressure on the P&L. So we're taking a hit for some negative absorption and fixed costs because volumes actually will be lower than sales. So we actually can have a decline of year-over-year production volumes, negative absorption. But basically, that is the big driver. Cash interest, cash taxes, CapEx largely will be flattish year-over-year, but the biggest difference by far is the focus on our working capital and namely inventories. Yes. Good question. We're anticipating $350 million to $400 million of reduction from volume and about $150 million increase in price. So think about that as basically, I'll call it roughly $200 million-ish of reduction of absolute inventory, which is $150 million increase in price and about a $300 million increase \u2013 or decrease or so driven by volumes. Thank you. We can. Yes. Josh, good question. So let me unpack the roughly 6% inflation expectation for this year. That's about 70% raws and zero logistics and the residual 30% energy. Energy, by the way, is highly volatile. So that generally is moving more favorable than when we put the plan together, although an awful lot of our energy pricing is now through surcharges. So we're sort of hedged one way or the other relative to that. So I'll focus on the 70%. The other thing I would note that remember the first quarter will be impacted by the inventories from last year. So sort of what hits relative to our cost structure is really already baked into sort of what's sitting in the plants to some extent. We are expecting actually fairly ratable i.e. price equals costs pretty much quarter-to-quarter relatively neutral. So we're not expecting any sort of big upside or downside. And part of that's the pacing of the inventories as well. I would say that we are seeing some early signs of deflation on the raw side. However, there are certain commodities that actually have seen more increases, but I would say that you could maybe be a little cautiously optimistic that we probably have seen the peak of inflation in raws and the back half of the year may be experiencing maybe some deflation, which will be favorable for the business. In general, our pricing is pretty much locked in for the year. Most of our pricing is beginning of the year or contractually based on indices that are tracked. So I think the pricing dynamic, the pricing risk is not as significant relative to what's locked in. Of course, if there's a rapid level of deflation in the second half of the year, we would adopt relative to our customer dialogues and pricing actions against that. But I would say I'd have a slight lean towards a little more optimism in terms of the price/cost dynamic this year versus last year. Thanks. Good morning, John. So just a reminder, a year ago, we had talked about four transactions in total with a probability of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in gross proceeds. We announced the largest of those transactions in Savory Solutions, which will be over $900 million of gross proceeds in the fourth quarter. And we've mentioned we have two other sort of in the near window. We do believe one of them circa $200 million more likely than that. It's not final will be announced within the quarter. The other two deals, which are relatively small, we are putting on hold. The reason is we are, at this point, actually taking a more comprehensive review of our portfolio and want to focus on sort of what makes sense sort of longer term relative to the overall portfolio. So our efforts are really against the larger portfolio opportunities at this point versus the residual. But I do anticipate between the Savory Solutions and the latest probably $1.1 billion-ish or more of gross proceeds. Relative to full year EPS ex amor, it's likely to be down circa 15% that's really driven by the dynamics of the first quarter versus prior year. For the balance of the year, it will be flat to modestly up for the last three quarters of the year. Thanks, John. And Mark, I'd add a couple of other items to the Frank's point is, lots of benefits across the portfolio. A lot of our work is on aligning and integrating and maximizing the portfolio. So aligning against three divisions, customer-backed, making sure that we have all the sales and operating teams focusing on the revenue synergies across the how systems work relative to advancing that is important. And then on the simplification of the portfolio, Microbial Controls exit, Savory Solutions. These are businesses that add a lot of complexity. Savory as an example, is a business that has 16,000 customers, 8 different businesses for the ERPs. And to Frank's point, we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and what they may be less core to the overall portfolio as we go forward to continue to simplify as well. Yes, this is Glenn, Jonathan. Relative to the first part of your question, clearly, in the last now 18 months, we have significantly improved the discipline, awareness and processes relative to pricing from tools and cross-training to best practices, to much, much surgical application by customer geography, et cetera. And I think that is here to stay in terms of optimizing the business going forward. Not all segments and regions are created equal. Some have greater ability to price than others and some geographies such as Greater Asia, in general, are more competitive, particularly in this environment. So we're being very, very thoughtful. In general, I would say that the N&B portfolio is about equivalency to the F&F portfolio relative to pricing capabilities or ability to pass through pricing, some of the ingredients portfolio are a little more difficult just given slightly more commoditized nature of this businesses. But I do not think there's really a significant difference in what we've seen from an execution standpoint between the legacy IFF and the legacy DuPont businesses and would again iterate that we've done a lot to actually tremendously sort of advance our capabilities to basically be much, much smarter and surgical in our pricing capabilities. Yes. Hey, thanks, Jeff. Good morning. Good question. So you already harken back a year ago, which seems like a decade ago, we originally had $600 million of inflation, pricing/inflation embedded. What happened is two additional rounds of inflation. So we had another $400 million last year, and we have circa $600 million-ish plus in this year. So there's a lag effect. So we're sort of kind of just running through the cycle from a kind of a timing standpoint and standpoint. We haven't sort of talked about sort of how this flows through the 2024, but I think it's reasonable to assume either a combination of stabilization and some deflation in the environment. On the back end, we will pick it up. So I think that's still a very reasonable assumption over the time horizon. The horizons just extended because there's been more sort of systemic inflation over the last few years than we anticipated at that point in time. Relative, we have \u2013 as Frank had mentioned, we have an incremental cost productivity program of $100 million targeted. We expect to get probably circa $70 million of that to hit the P&L this year. We're estimating around $70 million-ish to $75 million of onetime expenses associated with that restructuring."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Mr. Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. \nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening everyone. Welcome to IFF's third quarter 2022 conference call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a minute to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Frank. \nFrank Clyburn: Thank you, Mike and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. On today's call, I will begin by providing an update on the strong progress we continue to make in reviewing and implementing our refreshed operating strategy. We are focused as ever on enhancing our operational plan and are making great progress towards completing the strategic refresh process and sharing this with you on December 7th at our Investor Day. I will then share our year-to-date performance and then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a detailed look at our third quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Once complete, we will then open the call up for any questions. Before we move ahead, I do want to take a moment, as I always do to thank our dedicated colleagues around the world. It continues to be an unpredictable year and our colleagues continue to work tirelessly to deliver for our customers. Our global IFF team members are truly committed to servicing our customers and I continue to be so inspired by our team's determination and ingenuity. Now beginning with Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update regarding our progress to complete our strategic refresh and begin putting this enhanced plan into action. We are now working diligently to operationalize our new divisional strategies and begin executing these focused, integrated and value-additive strategies with our customers and in the marketplace. This next chapter in our company's transformation is intended to ensure we are going to market as the most effective and innovative IFF we can be to extend our position as a trusted partner to our customers and maximize value for them, employees and shareholders both in the near and long-term. Let me review what we focused on and what we've accomplished through this comprehensive enterprise-wide review process. This review of our portfolio and our business is designed to ensure we are able to defend and extend our industry leadership in key markets, geographies and grow our business with key accounts and new customers. This has included evaluating our portfolio through a return on invested capital lens, identifying portfolio optimization and divestiture opportunities. This discipline will enable us to reduce debt and reinvest in our high-performing businesses as well as identify additional growth opportunities in attractive end markets and geographies that will allow us to foster long-term growth even amid ongoing external headwinds. It has been an important endeavor, not only to help us streamline the business but also ensure that we are focusing on only the highest value opportunities and maximizing our return profile across the entire business. We are in the process of refining our operating model and organizational structure to ensure better commercial engagement enhance One IFF's company culture, strengthen talent in key roles and realign incentives to ensure accountability and ownership. We are also finalizing our financial aspirations for full year 2023 as well as what we believe the business should deliver longer term under more normalized conditions, and the capital allocation strategies necessary to achieve them all while prioritizing accelerated growth of our high-performing businesses. With this collective foundational planning, I am confident that IFF will fully capitalize on our clear portfolio advantage and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day on December 7. Moving to slide 7. I'd like to provide highlights of IFF's performance year-to-date. Despite a volatile market environment over the last nine months, IFF has continued to execute on our operational priorities to achieve strong top and bottom line results. Year-to-date we have delivered $9.6 billion in sales, which translates to 11% comparable currency-neutral growth and our comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 6% to $2 billion. Through the first nine months, we continued to take strategic pricing actions as necessary to offset inflationary pressures and as a result have fully recovered total inflation cost to-date. Turning to productivity by focusing on efficiency in our manufacturing processes and optimizing our supply chain and procurement, we captured over $125 million in extremely valuable operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies through the first nine months of 2022. Accelerating productivity represents one of our top priorities and is increasingly important given the more challenging economic environment heading into the fourth quarter and full year 2023. To this end, we are accelerating and expanding our efforts beyond our existing supply chain end-to-end manufacturing economic profit and global shared services platform initiatives we outlined on our second quarter conference call. We are now looking at our total cost structure to ensure we are optimized around go-forward strategic priorities to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness. These initiatives will be critical to support our growth strategy, all while positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. To support our continuous improvement efforts within operations, I am pleased to welcome Ralf Finzel to our executive team as Executive Vice President and Global Operations Officer. He joined us from Honeywell International Performance Materials & Technologies business group where he most recently served as Vice President of Integrated Supply Chain. Ralf brings decades of leadership experience and his focus on operational excellence, sustainable continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction ensures he will be a key contributor to IFF's success moving forward as he will be accountable to deliver on our net productivity goals. In addition, I am pleased to announce that we've hired a new Chief Procurement Officer, Alex Turolla who will be responsible for leading all of IFF's procurement efforts globally with the goal to move from procurement to strategic sourcing. Alex who joins from Mondel\u0113z International where he served most recently as Senior Vice President, Sourcing Global Direct Materials, managing $11 billion globally, brings significant experience in end-to-end supply chain operations and procurement. We also continue to progress against our portfolio optimization efforts now having successfully completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business at the beginning of the third quarter. The proceeds were used to reduce our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.9 times from 4.4 times at the end of the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we continue to assess the profitability and potential of each of our businesses and explore additional non-core divestitures and other timely optimization opportunities to improve our capital structure and achieve our deleveraging target. Now, I'll turn it over to Glenn to provide a deeper dive into our third quarter as well as an overview of the performance of each of our businesses. \nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Frank and welcome everyone. Starting on slide eight, I would like to provide an overview of our third quarter performance. In Q3, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing 10% year-over-year growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Pharma Solutions divisions. Pricing was a strong contributor to growth and as expected, volumes were down marginally in the quarter. It should be noted that on a two-year average basis, which factors our strong 8% year ago comparison, volume growth is running at about 4%. And while we have seen strong volume growth across most parts of our Pharma and Scent businesses in the third quarter, Nourish and H&B volumes were challenged. To provide some more color, nearly two-thirds of our volume decline in the quarter came in Protein Solutions, which is part of the Nourish business, where we have seen customer destocking to address higher inventory levels in response to sluggish end consumer demand. In H&B, our held volumes were also challenged in the third quarter, a direct result from weakening market demand in the US and Europe reflected in public market data. Gross margin was negatively affected by the significant inflationary pressures we faced across our markets. Yet through strategic pricing and productivity gains, IFF delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. We also delivered solid adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of $1.36. The strong dollar continued to be a headwind to our business. In the third quarter, we saw an approximately 7% impact on sales, an 8% adverse impact on EBITDA due to foreign exchange. Before moving on, I want to share that we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.25 billion for the third quarter related to our Health & Biosciences business. The primary drivers of the goodwill impairment are related to increases in interest rates and lower business projections due to adverse macroeconomic impacts on volume, continued cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange rate variations. Now moving to slide 9, I will provide a brief overview of the performance across our business segments. In the third quarter, we achieved year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth of 10% driven by broad-based sales growth across all of our business segments and nearly all of our sub-business units. Nourish had another strong quarter with double-digit growth and particularly encouraging performance from Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design. Health & Biosciences also saw strong single-digit growth despite pressure in our Grain Processing business. Scent again saw continued currency-neutral sales growth in the high single-digits, thanks to our Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients businesses. Pharma Solutions rebound continues with an impressive 28% increase in sales driven by continued strength in both industrial and pharma. Turning to slide 10 and looking at our profitability for the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $612 million. Comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 3% year-over-year due to the disciplined pricing actions to fully recover total inflation. We also achieved meaningful productivity gains and operational efficiencies from our productivity program, which have helped offset volume headwinds. As discussed last quarter, while we are clearly seeing signs of raw material inflation easing, we will continue taking appropriate targeted actions to offset inflation to maintain profitability. Now on slide 11, I'd like to discuss the underlying dynamics impacting the third quarter performance of each of our business segments. Nourish delivered another strong top-line quarter. Nourish's 10% year-over-year sales growth on a currency-neutral basis was driven by double-digit growth in Food Design and Ingredients, and sustained growth in our Flavors business.  Health & Biosciences also maintain strong performance delivering 3% in comparable currency-neutral sales growth driven by mid single-digit growth in our Culture & Food Enzymes, Health, Home & Personal Care and Animal Nutrition offerings. However, for each of these segments we saw 4% and 1% year-over-year decreases, respectively in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA as our price increases and productivity gains we discussed earlier were offset by lower volumes. Our Scent division once again delivered a strong performance with 9% currency-neutral sales growth this quarter, driven by mid-teen growth in Fine Fragrance and Fragrance Ingredients and high single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. The division also saw 3% growth in currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA due to volume growth, our price increases and productivity gains. Pharma Solutions contributed very strong performance, with 28% growth in currency-neutral sales, led by strong double-digit growth in pharma and industrial. Similar to Scent, Pharma Solutions also benefited from strong volume, our pricing actions and the productivity gains we achieved in the quarter leading to an impressive 76% growth in currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Turning now to Slide 12, I would like to cover our cash flow and leverage position. Through the first nine months, we generated $189 million in cash from operations, with CapEx finishing at $344 million or approximately 3.6% of sales. The net result is that our free cash flow through nine months was a negative $155 million. Our free cash flow has been significantly impacted by much higher inventories due to a combination of inflation, strategic increases and improved customer service levels and to slowing volumes. In addition, included in our free cash flow numbers are one-time deal and integration-related costs. As a result, we are implementing a series of initiatives to improve our cash flow with an intense focus on managing inventories down. Much of this will be driven by leveraging new S&OP processes and tools in concert with specific targets for each business unit, which we believe will improve our inventory efficiency across all parts of the business while continuing to maintain high service levels to our customers. In addition, we will be taking targeted actions to reduce CapEx spend and improve other working capital metrics to further improve our cash position. Importantly, we continue to make progress towards achieving our deleveraging target. As Frank mentioned earlier, we improved our net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.9 times from 4.4 times, which was supported by proceeds from our recent Microbial Control divestiture. We finished the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $538 million, while gross debt for the quarter totaled $10.8 billion. Turning to our consolidated outlook on Slide 13, I want to provide some update on our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our business and broader industry continues to face challenging operational conditions with persistent foreign exchange, inflationary and other economic pressures. These challenges have only increased since last quarter. We are certainly encouraged by the consistent sales growth achieved across each of our businesses this quarter, especially in this environment. However, we are adjusting our sales expectations for Q4, as we expect volume to further decelerate due to lower end-market demand and we expect foreign exchange to remain a significant headwind. These factors will also present challenges to adjusted operating EBITDA. In light of these factors, we are adjusting our full year guidance and now expect full year sales between $12.4 billion and $12.5 billion and comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 9% to 10%. We are reconfirming our adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, though we anticipate results to be at the bottom end of this range as we maintain strong cost discipline and accelerate productivity to offset persistent headwinds and softer volumes. Looking into 2023, the current macroeconomic environment makes us cautious. And as a result, we anticipate that we will be in a low-volume growth environment, particularly in the first half of next year. In addition, while we see raw material inflation easing, we do anticipate some year-over-year increases in raw materials and continued volatile energy markets, which will require additional pricing actions. As a result, we will continue to examine and refine our resource allocation to focus on strong cost discipline and accelerating our productivity across our business. We will also continue to implement pricing actions surgically, to support our profitability ensure our business remains resilient. And while it's still early in our planning process, we are targeting strong comparable currency-neutral sales growth in 2023, to be driven more predominantly by price with more modest EBITDA growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis, as we reinvest in the business to accelerate sales momentum and drive long-term profitable growth. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, as we roll forward current spot rates. We will spend more time on 2023 at our Investor Day, in a few weeks. I'll now turn it back to Frank, for closing comments. \nFrank Clyburn: Thank you, Glenn. I am tremendously proud of the work our teams at IFF have accomplished in the last quarter, as we remain laser-focused on developing innovative solutions and exceeding the expectations of our customers around the world. As you can see from our outlook, though we are moving into Q4 with caution, I am confident as we have demonstrated time and again and our global team's ability, to navigate even the most complex environments. As Glenn said, we are closely monitoring shifts in the market to effectively address any emerging challenge. We remain intensely focused on controlling the controllable, through the year-end and we continue to work with our customers to surgically implement pricing actions, meet or accelerate our productivity and portfolio optimization objectives, continue to delever our balance sheet and focus on driving profitable growth. As you know, we have made significant progress this year to strengthen our business and become more efficient. By leveraging our strong foundation and being laser-focused on our growth initiatives, I am confident in IFF's ability to be resilient and drive long-term value creation regardless of the market environment. Before I open the call up to questions, I would like to share official details about our upcoming Investor Day, which will be held on Wednesday, December 7 in New York City. We are excited to host this event and share more about the opportunities ahead for IFF including how we will capitalize on our leadership position, innovate for our customers, generate strong productivity and grow our business for the future. We hope you will all join us, and we look forward to seeing you there for what promises to be an engaging interactive and informative experience. Registration links for the in-person live event, have been sent out, but if you have not received one or have questions, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations department. This will also be webcasted broadly for those that cannot travel to New York City. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Frank. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam, your line is now open.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess a question on cash flow, which year-to-date has been more challenged. I think, Glenn, previously there's been a target of $800 million or so of free cash flow this year. Can you provide an update on what that might ultimately shake out to be? And just more broadly, what's the plan on improving the cash conversion as we go into 2023 and beyond? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey, good morning, Adam. Thanks very much for the question. Clearly, it has been more challenging than expected this year and that's principally been driven by our inventory balances. So, maybe, if I can actually even start back in the first of the year, you cited the $800 million. We began the year at $1 billion target. And since that, it's been a combination of incremental pricing/inflation that was outside of plan. That's costing us about $125 million. And in addition, there's another $200 million of additional inventories we expect to be at year-end. By the way, that's a reduction of about $100 million from where we are. We ended the third quarter with inventories up $600 million from the start of the year. That was a large -- about $200 million of that is basically based on raw material inflation. About $400 million is basically based on, as Frank had mentioned, building inventories for service levels. But importantly, basically demand has slowed down and we've ended up with higher inventory. So, again, that's about $200 million delta from our original target. We are fully confident, we're going to get that $200 million back. We expect to get that back targeted in the first half of next year and even targeting more. On top of that our business has slowed down and there's been some differences in terms of our tax payments, really a timing element for us. That's collectively about $150 million. So those adjustments get us to sort of north of $500 million. So its $1 billion, minus $200 million higher volume-related inventories about another $125 million related to inflation, about $150 million slightly softer earnings than previous outlook and in addition some timing on tax. So that's a little over $500 million. I would note as we mentioned in our script, within our free cash flow that reported, its a GAAP basis in terms of free cash flow, so take it directly from our cash flow statement. That includes deal-related and integration costs. That's very material for us this year, given the sale of our Microbial Control business. So all the transaction-related costs, number of items for the standup at set were basically paid for as part of the deal and some integration-related costs. So there's about $225 million this year, that's sort of in -- it will be netted against that $525 million. So on it's a reported basis, if you will. That's more than $300 million. But frankly the $200 million is really a charge against operating cash flow when it's really related to sales of businesses. It's a little bit of an apples and oranges. So I'd sort of point to maybe $500 million as the true sort of operating cash flow this year. Of the gaps this year, clearly, $200 million inventory will get back. I'd say taxes clearly timing of another $100 million. That gets us to north of a little bit $800 million. And over time, we would expect the incremental raw materials that are sitting in our inventory this year, we'd expect to get that back over time. And again, that's over $250 million from the start of the year. So over time, we expect that to reverse as well. So hopefully, that was helpful.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Samuelson. The next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark, your line is now open.\nMark Astrachan: Yeah. Thanks and morning, everyone. I guess just to start I wanted to follow-up on the last question. So thinking about free cash flow more broadly, you wrote down the H&B business. I assume that implies incremental investment for that. So the question maybe sort of broadly is, how do you fund that? Obviously, you just talked about free cash flow improvement kind of over the next 12, 18 months with other sort of underlying drivers. But can you comment on what a reasonable rate of free cash flow productivity for the business would look like kind of 2024 and beyond? Certainly, in the context of some of your competitors having targets out there, are those reasonable levels? And then second question is just on volumes. You're implying the volumes will be down mid single-digits in the fourth quarter. Which categories are driving that? And then how do you think about those trends through at least the first half of 2023 I would guess are challenged before comparisons get easier? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Hey, Mark, it's Glenn. Good morning. Relative to our longer-term objectives on cash flow, we're going to hold that to our Capital Markets Day. So we're less than a month away from that. We'll have a chance to actually discuss more specifically our longer-term targets. And then I'll turn it over to Frank to talk about some of the flow trends.\nFrank Clyburn: Hey, Mark, good morning. A couple of things that I wanted to highlight. You are correct. We are in the fourth quarter assuming volumes do decelerate versus the Q3 number that we just posted. And it's really two factors and I'll give you where the areas that are a focus for us right now what we're seeing. I'll start with our health business under the Health & Biosciences division, Mark. In health and I signaled this I think even earlier in the quarter, we are seeing both end-market demand slow as consumers are making choices between probiotics dietary supplements. So we are seeing some slowing end-market use in health and we are also seeing destocking in that business in particular in North America. And we expect that to continue through the fourth quarter as also well in Europe. So that's what we're seeing in our health businesses. And we went through the quarter, Mark. We did see July down. We saw August come back. September was down. And as we now started to see in October, we're seeing a similar trend of the deceleration I mentioned in that business. In Ingredients under Nourish and we highlighted this on our prepared remarks, Mark, we are also seeing more inventory destocking is the primary aspect of what we're assuming will continue as we go into the fourth quarter. We also within the Ingredients business did make some trade-offs from a pricing perspective. We had some of our Protein Solutions business that was capacity-constrained, where we did increase price made some volume trade-offs to preserve some margin, but it's primarily destocking. So that is the main reason and we're also assuming in that business that will continue in the fourth quarter. As we go into '23, we're expecting at least in the first half moderate volume growth. We'll explain a lot more of what we're anticipating for '23 as we get to Capital Markets Day, Mark, but that's what hopefully gives you some color on what we're seeing in the business. The other thing, I would highlight though and I think it's an important reminder for us that, if you do take a step back over the two-year time period and we mentioned this through Q3, we are growing our volumes 4%. And we are still seeing good growth in particular in Scent and Pharma that we highlighted as well. So, the isolation that I highlighted is really primarily in those two areas, which is where we're anticipating seeing the deceleration continues as mentioned.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. John, your line is now open.\nJohn Roberts: Great. Thank you. The goodwill write-downs seem to only affect Health & Bioscience, but I assume the higher discount rate would have affected goodwill on the other segments as well. So, the difference must be in the longer-term assumptions for Health & Bioscience relative to the macro assumptions for the other segments. Could you discuss a little bit why the longer-term macro assumptions for Health & Bioscience appear to be worsening relative to the other segments?\nGlenn Richter: Yes, John, thanks for the question. Actually it's more related to the amount of goodwill and intangibles that are allocated to the business. So let me -- just by way of background as I'm sure you're well aware, we prior to the end of the quarter had about $25 million of goodwill and intangibles on our books. They were assigned to each of the four divisions. They're directly related to the acquisitions. And by definition, the majority of that is from the N&B acquisition. So that allocation is concentrated in H&B Pharma and somewhat Nourish, but Nourish obviously has legacy IFF business as well. H&B and Pharma do not, right? So, if you will, it's a heavy sort of burden in terms of the goodwill intangibles against those two businesses. For context about 45% prior to the write-down of goodwill and intangibles was sitting on the books of H&B. So that's point one. Point two is, you're required to do an annual test or if there's an event that suggests there may be an impairment have to do it within the year. The event largely is attributable to the interest rate environment. So the way you basically run the calculation is you basically do a discounted cash flow for each of the businesses, you do forward projections. The forward projections on the H&B business were brought down. Those were in part because of exchange rates. So, all the businesses actually have lower earnings because we have to use the current exchange rates. Part of it is slightly lower operating performance, but exchange rates played a meaningful role. But the most significant variable is the discount rate. As everyone's well aware, the interest rates are going up rapidly. So the discount rate we were required to use for the cash flow was materially higher than a year ago and that's what resulted in the $2.25 billion. We do note in our disclosures that we have about 10% cushion on Pharma. As you would expect that will be the second business that would be under scrutiny, just given the amount of goodwill intangibles sign to the business. It is less significant on a relative basis for Scent and Nourish, because you have the legacy IFF businesses, that don't carry the goodwill and the other intangible impact as much. So it's really -- to some extent, I'd say it's a minor reflection on the outlook of the business and more reflective of the interest rate environment and what we're experiencing from the exchange rate.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Gunther, your line is now open.\nGunther Zechmann : Thank you. Good morning, Frank, Glenn and Mike. Now your Q4 guidance also from what you just said on volumes implies around 10% pricing. That's pretty similar to Q3. We know that peers reported pricing getting harder in a weakening demand environment, which is what you're flagging as well and new price rounds getting even tougher. So how do you see this develop into 2023 then? What are your expectations for the raw material cost into next year as well? And also how much of the lower volumes that you indicated, do you think are due to stronger price increases that you pushed through as opposed to consumer demand down-trading or destocking please?\nGlenn Richter : Good afternoon, Gunther. I'll actually start by talking about the inflationary environment. I think then Frank will probably pick it up to talk about pricing dynamics relative to volume. First of all, we are clearly seeing a deceleration environment relative to raw materials in the marketplace. So that's happening in certain commodities going forward. But let me kind of step back and talk about our overall outlook for 2023 in terms of three components. One logistics is actually looking very favorable flat to maybe slightly down. We are encouraged by an ease up of the supply chain, which is helping not only in terms of cost for freight, but in addition just making sure that we're able to deliver on time to our customers. So that's a plus. Energy is incredibly volatile as everybody knows. And it's very difficult to call that. What we have been doing with our customers as many have been doing is implementing direct surcharges or variable pricing that's tied to energy prices. So that will ebb and flow depending upon the market dynamic. And again, that's fairly consistent with what's happening with many players. That tends to be as you're well aware more concentrated in the European market globally in terms of the impact. And then as it relates to raws, we are seeing -- we're still seeing inflationary pressure. I would basically put that in three buckets where there are certain commodity groups that are impacted by the energy environment and/or supply chain so synthetics; chemicals as an example; pulp as an example. Secondarily, we're clearly seeing some roll-off on contractual pricing we had or hedging this year. So that's actually impacting. And while there are certain price commodity categories that are beginning to decline year-over-year, they represent some modest increases for us, such as soybean, palm oil, et cetera. And related to that, we are expecting next year's raw inflation to be about half of what we had this year, so call it, high single digits in terms of the impact. You are correct in pricing environment continues to tighten up. By definition with a slowdown in consumer, everyone's trying to be a little bit more thoughtful in terms of commodity prices would be passed through. We are about to go to market for 2023 pricing. We have spent a lot of energy being very surgical relative to what makes sense or customer in terms of pricing tied directly to what we're seeing in the marketplace. So we are -- again, it will be a much lower number versus what we have, but we are expecting another round of 2023 pricing actions to offset the residual raw materials. \nFrank Clyburn: And Gunther, this is Frank. With regards to the second part of your question about the lower volumes and strong price increases, we do not see it broadly, Gunther, that our pricing actions have impacted volume. In fact if you look at what's happening in the market, many of our peers are also increasing pricing. So we do not see that as an impact. In fact, we've also reached out to many of our customers and we've been doing this in concert obviously with them. And they have clearly signaled that we have not seen any share losses per se, Gunther because of our pricing actions. The one area that I did highlight is where we made a conscious trade-off was within our Ingredients business where we were capacity-constrained. We did increase price and made some volume trade-offs to preserve margins. So that is the one area that I would highlight. The other thing is with regards to what is the driver, primarily as mentioned, it is destocking for our business is what we're seeing Gunther. And that is -- the main driver is our customers are looking at year-end their inventory levels and wanting to obviously manage their working capital appropriately. So, that's really the driver. The last thing I will say though, with all of that, one of the things and we'll spend more time on the Capital Markets Day is we are looking at ways to really continue to build our commercial execution. How do we work with our customers to really bring the full portfolio of IFF forward increasing our market share with our key customers, regional customers and global customers as well as new customer acquisition? And I'll be spending some more time here at Capital Markets Day really talking about our plans in that area to focus on our aspirations for growth, Gunther. So, much more to come.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Zechmann. Our next question today is from the line of Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas. Heidi, your line is now open.\nHeidi Vesterinen: Morning. So, I have another question on your outlook please. We noticed that your peers aren't calling out a volume decline or any major destocking in Q4, although I do appreciate that many of them reported much earlier than you have. Have market trends weakened significantly in recent weeks, or is your cautious outlook driven more by IFF-specific factors? Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Heidi, it's Frank. And as I highlighted, as we went through the quarter and in particular in September, Heidi, we did start to really see the destocking that I mentioned. And also, we are seeing that in the month of October. So, as we look at now for our forecast for this fourth quarter, we're obviously taking those most recent data points into consideration. And that is why we feel as though appropriately so we have guided to the top line sales that we've mentioned in our prepared remarks. The one thing I do want to take a step back though Heidi and do highlight though is we still are confident that for the full year growing the business, 9% to 10%, if you were excluding exchange, we feel as though is a very good overall performance. Like I said clearly, the fourth quarter is where we're seeing some challenges, and this is primarily due to our customers wanting to manage the inventory. And we think it's the prudent approach to take based on what we're seeing in the last couple of months end of Q3 and then as I mentioned in October.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David, your line is open.\nAnthony Mercandetti: Good morning. This is Anthony Mercandetti on for David. You touched on it a bit throughout the call, but I was wondering if you can maybe elaborate on how much more destocking you're expecting into 2023 will be a headwind in Q4. And then maybe what particular end markets and regions you expect the destocking to be more pronounced in regards to maybe the first half of 2023?\nGlenn Richter: Hey, Anthony this is Glenn. Thanks for joining us. I'd say it's really difficult for us to predict. We do track very closely end-consumer demand. So what information we get from largely the scanner data; secondarily, obviously, in very extensive dialogues with our customers in terms of what they're doing. And as a byproduct, we do believe that destocking in addition to declining the end-consumer demand are the key contributors to what we're seeing. And of note as Frank had mentioned, we see it most pronounced in a couple of categories: one in protein solutions; second, in probiotics. And as you follow the end market and look at what some of the major CPG firms are reporting, they're double-digit drops in terms of the end market. And particularly as you think about probiotics, which had a big, big booms related to COVID and the value of these things it's understandable why we would see the decline. So point one is we believe that this is destocking end consumer. Point two relative to how long this will run, we really don't know. A number of our customers have communicated to us that they believe by year-end, they will have their inventories in place. That, of course, assumes they have a good crystal ball relative to where the consumer is going. Others have indicated that they believe that this may extend into the first and second quarter of next year. So we'll be providing more perspective at our Investor Day relative to our outlook on 2023, but we do -- we will ultimately be factoring potentially further destocking and slow down the consumer as we think about the outlook for our financial performance for next year. So appreciate the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Mike, your line is open.\nMike Sison: Hi guys, nice quarter. Frank, when you think about the portfolio now, and it does seem like folks think we're heading into a downturn in 2023, how do you think each of those segments should perform if the recession unfolds? And maybe give us a little bit of color what you've learned on those businesses as we head into 2023.\nFrank Clyburn: Yeah. So thanks Mike for the question. A couple of things. As I look at the total portfolio, one would say that overall we feel as though -- and going into a recession, we are very resilient when you look at our portfolio overall. If I start with Nourish, Mike clearly if you think about ingredients in the end markets of food and beverage, we should be very resilient there. Our Flavors segment is a resilient business and then also Food Design. So if you were to exclude some of the near-term challenges that we're talking about from an inventory destocking perspective, we think that our nearest division would be overall very resilient in recessionary times. If I look at the Scent business what is really interesting Mike is that the one area that we have thought would be more of a challenge in a recession would be Fine Fragrance. However, we are seeing really good growth in our Fine Fragrance business this year and our Scent business overall has continued to hang in there very well with overall good strong volume growth. As I look at Health & Biosciences, clearly, we think that holds up very well, also Mike. In particular, if you think about Cultures & Food Enzymes or Home & Personal Care business within Health & Biosciences, we think is a really good business and holds up during a recession. Obviously we've highlighted on this call, the challenges we're seeing in that health segment in the probiotic marketplace, but overall fairly resistant. And then clearly we see pharma as being very resilient in a recessionary period of time. With all of that said, as you mentioned, we do see some challenging headwinds on the horizon. That's something that we are obviously spending time as a team. We'll share much more on our 2023 outlook. But think of the overall business we feel very resilient across our different businesses Mark -- or Mike I should say, and it's something we will clearly spend a lot of time here at Capital Markets Day unpacking even more for you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Sison. The next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham, your line is now open.\nMatt Krueger: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. So I was hoping that we could touch on some of your own internal initiatives here. So what are some of the internal offsets across the business that can counter the tougher macroeconomic backdrop as we cycle into 2023 and into the back half of this year? And what are some of the primary concerns when entering a downturn for the business? Are you already taking actions to offset this? And if so what might those be?\nFrank Clyburn: Hi. This is Frank. I'll start. And we've highlighted our significant focus this year on our productivity initiatives which have primarily been in our operations group where we focused on our supply chain. We're focusing on really looking at economic profit as a key driver of our choices and decisions in our manufacturing operations group or logistics costs. So I would first start, that we have made really good progress in improved productivity. And I think Glenn highlighted that in his prepared remarks. With that said, as you go into an additional -- or a downturn one of the things that we are now looking at is our total cost base for IFF. So we are looking at ways to think about accelerating productivity beyond our manufacturing operations focus that you've heard us talk about and we highlighted on our second call. That's something that we are going to share much more Capital Markets Day. We do think there are ways to reduce our cost base and accelerate productivity, while also preserving two things. One our investment in innovation and two really also making sure we're continuing to focus on working with our customers to drive growth. So more to come at Capital Markets Day, but we do think we will be able to accelerate productivity as we head into 2023.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Mr. Spector, your line is open.\nJosh Spector: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you'd discuss the margins in Scent in the quarter. You previously talked about that segment taking much longer to catch-up on price/cost. I believe, prior calls you talked about maybe later next year. I mean, it appears you made a pretty big step-change improvement this quarter. So what happened in third quarter? And does that change any of your expectations for the forward few quarters from here? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Hey, Josh. Good morning. Yeah. We're very pleased by the progress that our Scent business is making. Two things are exhibited in the third quarter trend versus the first half of the year. One is, we are beginning to sort of normalize for price versus inflation. So there was another round of pricing year to sort of catch-up for what's been happening with raw materials. That has been implemented. So it's been extremely helpful relative to the gross margin performance, and we expect that to normalize into the first half of next year. But then secondarily, the team has also undertaken actions to continue to manage their costs very tightly. So you'll notice that their RSNA expenses, also showed improvement from the first half to the third quarter as well. So the team is smartly and on a paced manner implemented pricing maintaining volumes quite well and on top of that taking additional productivity actions to make sure they manage the bottom line, and had a nice currency-neutral year-over-year growth as a result of that. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Mr. Parkinson, your line is now open.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great. Thanks so much. You kind of hit on a few of these just tangentially your other remarks. I just want to circle back to it. Despite the 3Q result it being solid, it still appears the cost backdrop is still challenging. I understand you want to save a lot for your Analyst Day, but just can you currently just highlight what you're seeing in raws transportation and logistics, and then just also general operating costs just how we should be considering those at least on a preliminary basis entering 2023? Thank you so much.\nGlenn Richter: Hey, Chris, yeah, relative to logistics costs year-over-year pretty flattish to slightly down. So we've actually seen nice improvement in the global supply chain. As I mentioned previously, raws we still have pressure about half of what we've seen this year. So think about it as sort of high single digit on our total raw material cost. And that's a function of contracts rolling off. It's also a function of certain categories those driven by energy prices continue to see escalation in areas that are being affected by continued war in Ukraine and other global supply chain issues. So call it half of the rate of this year, still meaningful for us to basically go capture. And as a byproduct of that, not only do we need to be smart on our next round of pricing actions, but everything Frank had mentioned around managing our cost structure as a way to sort of offset those pressures as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan, your line is now open.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks very much. I think, I've got a pretty good handle on how your customers \u2013 primary customers are dealing with trade-down among consumers. But specifically, to your business other than -- you mentioned taking pricing in some cases prioritizing pricing over volume presumably to protect margins is what you meant. How do your customers trade down within your portfolio, sort of not innovating or going to a competitor? Are there signs of trade-down? And how is that different in the legacy DuPont businesses, the businesses that are newer to IFF? Because I felt we had a pretty good handle, on how all that worked before 2021. Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Well, let me attempt to answer it in a couple of dimensions, Jonathan. Obviously, with the consumer under pressure from inflation, there is a visible movement from branded to private label. So that's happening both in Europe and the US, although more pronounced in Europe. We play across the customers that play in both spaces. So we serve both markets. In general, not all cases, but in general our margins are fairly consistent between branded and private label from the standpoint. So from that standpoint, while the consumer is moving across branded to private label generally, we hold up well relative to the shift of our business. The customer also will look at formulations and how do they think about saving money through reformulations, it's very constant. It actually happens in all environments, but it's more pronounced in this type of environment. So we work very closely with them in terms of helping them, reformulate products basically to take cost out and deliver the same solution for the consumer. The third thing, I would say relative to the behavior of consumer is and this is clearly happening in the marketplace is, while the consumer may still actually stay within branded oftentimes they will reduce dosage. So think about that as sort of less home and personal care products usage, or less fabric softener as an example. So that is another factor that's happening that affects our business, as well as the customers' business. But it may in essence, also result in sort of lower volumes in the marketplace as well. So, hopefully, that's helpful. \nFrank Clyburn: Yes. The only thing I would add, Jonathan, I think it's important though that we do still continue to see our customers seeing, how important innovation is for the future. So as we engage with them and as Glenn mentioned, some of what we're seeing, some down-trading near-term, et cetera. But the fact is, we are still seeing very high engagement from our customers wanting to work with us, with regards to our pipeline new projects innovation, which we think is going to be very important for the future for us and going forward. So that's something that I just wanted to also make sure that is reinforced. We're not seeing a pullback of customers not wanting to innovate for their future growth. And that's something that we're focused on really helping them to deliver on. \nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Feeney. Our last question today comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Matthew, your line is now open.\nMatthew DeYoe: Yes. Excuse me. So I wanted to ask a question on Nourish. Basically -- like basically every $1 you gain in revenue you lost $1 on EBITDA. And that's a fairly sharp downshift in decremental margins from 3Q and maybe a little at odds with the price offsetting raw commentary. So what happened there? And how does that, kind of, set-up for margin progression into 4Q?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Matt, one underlying factor relative to the quarter is how we're trying to correct manufacturing volumes to offset the decline in demand in order to address our cash flow and inventory problems. So as a result of that the production volumes in the third quarter for Nourish were dropped even more so than demand. So there's an absorption issue relative to that's hitting the business. So that does affect sort of the marginal flow-through of the dollar if you will. Also quarter-to-quarter there was some inflationary pressures like energy and some other things that were, sort of, not outside of the period per se in terms of kind of the effects. So it's a little bit hard to, sort of, normalize one quarter to another as being, sort of, an apples-to-apples. But the reduction in volumes in order to get our inventories down is a factor that's hitting our business collectively in Q3 and also in Q2. And it's more pronounced in Nourish and H&B we've seen a more pronounced volume decline. So that's a factor in that calculus you cited. \nMatthew DeYoe: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions waiting at this time. So it's my pleasure to turn the call back over to Frank Clyburn, for closing remarks. \nFrank Clyburn: So thank you everyone for joining our call. Hopefully, you can see and hear despite some of the near-term challenges, we are extremely excited about the future in front of us with IFF. We look forward to December 7 in our Investor Day in the next couple of weeks where we'll really spend time sharing with you our growth our aspiration from an innovation perspective, how we'll continue to drive productivity to be able to reinvest in the business and why I'm very excited about the future of IFF going forward. So look forward to seeing many of you in New York City on the 7th, and thank you for joining our call. \nOperator: That concludes the IFF third quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mike and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. On today's call, I will begin by providing an update on the strong progress we continue to make in reviewing and implementing our refreshed operating strategy. We are focused as ever on enhancing our operational plan and are making great progress towards completing the strategic refresh process and sharing this with you on December 7th at our Investor Day. I will then share our year-to-date performance and then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a detailed look at our third quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Once complete, we will then open the call up for any questions. Before we move ahead, I do want to take a moment, as I always do to thank our dedicated colleagues around the world. It continues to be an unpredictable year and our colleagues continue to work tirelessly to deliver for our customers. Our global IFF team members are truly committed to servicing our customers and I continue to be so inspired by our team's determination and ingenuity. Now beginning with Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update regarding our progress to complete our strategic refresh and begin putting this enhanced plan into action. We are now working diligently to operationalize our new divisional strategies and begin executing these focused, integrated and value-additive strategies with our customers and in the marketplace. This next chapter in our company's transformation is intended to ensure we are going to market as the most effective and innovative IFF we can be to extend our position as a trusted partner to our customers and maximize value for them, employees and shareholders both in the near and long-term. Let me review what we focused on and what we've accomplished through this comprehensive enterprise-wide review process. This review of our portfolio and our business is designed to ensure we are able to defend and extend our industry leadership in key markets, geographies and grow our business with key accounts and new customers. This has included evaluating our portfolio through a return on invested capital lens, identifying portfolio optimization and divestiture opportunities. This discipline will enable us to reduce debt and reinvest in our high-performing businesses as well as identify additional growth opportunities in attractive end markets and geographies that will allow us to foster long-term growth even amid ongoing external headwinds. It has been an important endeavor, not only to help us streamline the business but also ensure that we are focusing on only the highest value opportunities and maximizing our return profile across the entire business. We are in the process of refining our operating model and organizational structure to ensure better commercial engagement enhance One IFF's company culture, strengthen talent in key roles and realign incentives to ensure accountability and ownership. We are also finalizing our financial aspirations for full year 2023 as well as what we believe the business should deliver longer term under more normalized conditions, and the capital allocation strategies necessary to achieve them all while prioritizing accelerated growth of our high-performing businesses. With this collective foundational planning, I am confident that IFF will fully capitalize on our clear portfolio advantage and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day on December 7. Moving to slide 7. I'd like to provide highlights of IFF's performance year-to-date. Despite a volatile market environment over the last nine months, IFF has continued to execute on our operational priorities to achieve strong top and bottom line results. Year-to-date we have delivered $9.6 billion in sales, which translates to 11% comparable currency-neutral growth and our comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 6% to $2 billion. Through the first nine months, we continued to take strategic pricing actions as necessary to offset inflationary pressures and as a result have fully recovered total inflation cost to-date. Turning to productivity by focusing on efficiency in our manufacturing processes and optimizing our supply chain and procurement, we captured over $125 million in extremely valuable operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies through the first nine months of 2022. Accelerating productivity represents one of our top priorities and is increasingly important given the more challenging economic environment heading into the fourth quarter and full year 2023. To this end, we are accelerating and expanding our efforts beyond our existing supply chain end-to-end manufacturing economic profit and global shared services platform initiatives we outlined on our second quarter conference call. We are now looking at our total cost structure to ensure we are optimized around go-forward strategic priorities to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness. These initiatives will be critical to support our growth strategy, all while positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. To support our continuous improvement efforts within operations, I am pleased to welcome Ralf Finzel to our executive team as Executive Vice President and Global Operations Officer. He joined us from Honeywell International Performance Materials & Technologies business group where he most recently served as Vice President of Integrated Supply Chain. Ralf brings decades of leadership experience and his focus on operational excellence, sustainable continuous improvement, and customer satisfaction ensures he will be a key contributor to IFF's success moving forward as he will be accountable to deliver on our net productivity goals. In addition, I am pleased to announce that we've hired a new Chief Procurement Officer, Alex Turolla who will be responsible for leading all of IFF's procurement efforts globally with the goal to move from procurement to strategic sourcing. Alex who joins from Mondele\u0304z International where he served most recently as Senior Vice President, Sourcing Global Direct Materials, managing $11 billion globally, brings significant experience in end-to-end supply chain operations and procurement. We also continue to progress against our portfolio optimization efforts now having successfully completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business at the beginning of the third quarter. The proceeds were used to reduce our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.9 times from 4.4 times at the end of the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we continue to assess the profitability and potential of each of our businesses and explore additional non-core divestitures and other timely optimization opportunities to improve our capital structure and achieve our deleveraging target. Now, I'll turn it over to Glenn to provide a deeper dive into our third quarter as well as an overview of the performance of each of our businesses. Thank you, Glenn. I am tremendously proud of the work our teams at IFF have accomplished in the last quarter, as we remain laser-focused on developing innovative solutions and exceeding the expectations of our customers around the world. As you can see from our outlook, though we are moving into Q4 with caution, I am confident as we have demonstrated time and again and our global team's ability, to navigate even the most complex environments. As Glenn said, we are closely monitoring shifts in the market to effectively address any emerging challenge. We remain intensely focused on controlling the controllable, through the year-end and we continue to work with our customers to surgically implement pricing actions, meet or accelerate our productivity and portfolio optimization objectives, continue to delever our balance sheet and focus on driving profitable growth. As you know, we have made significant progress this year to strengthen our business and become more efficient. By leveraging our strong foundation and being laser-focused on our growth initiatives, I am confident in IFF's ability to be resilient and drive long-term value creation regardless of the market environment. Before I open the call up to questions, I would like to share official details about our upcoming Investor Day, which will be held on Wednesday, December 7 in New York City. We are excited to host this event and share more about the opportunities ahead for IFF including how we will capitalize on our leadership position, innovate for our customers, generate strong productivity and grow our business for the future. We hope you will all join us, and we look forward to seeing you there for what promises to be an engaging interactive and informative experience. Registration links for the in-person live event, have been sent out, but if you have not received one or have questions, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations department. This will also be webcasted broadly for those that cannot travel to New York City. With that, I would like to open up the call for questions. Hey, Mark, good morning. A couple of things that I wanted to highlight. You are correct. We are in the fourth quarter assuming volumes do decelerate versus the Q3 number that we just posted. And it's really two factors and I'll give you where the areas that are a focus for us right now what we're seeing. I'll start with our health business under the Health & Biosciences division, Mark. In health and I signaled this I think even earlier in the quarter, we are seeing both end-market demand slow as consumers are making choices between probiotics dietary supplements. So we are seeing some slowing end-market use in health and we are also seeing destocking in that business in particular in North America. And we expect that to continue through the fourth quarter as also well in Europe. So that's what we're seeing in our health businesses. And we went through the quarter, Mark. We did see July down. We saw August come back. September was down. And as we now started to see in October, we're seeing a similar trend of the deceleration I mentioned in that business. In Ingredients under Nourish and we highlighted this on our prepared remarks, Mark, we are also seeing more inventory destocking is the primary aspect of what we're assuming will continue as we go into the fourth quarter. We also within the Ingredients business did make some trade-offs from a pricing perspective. We had some of our Protein Solutions business that was capacity-constrained, where we did increase price made some volume trade-offs to preserve some margin, but it's primarily destocking. So that is the main reason and we're also assuming in that business that will continue in the fourth quarter. As we go into '23, we're expecting at least in the first half moderate volume growth. We'll explain a lot more of what we're anticipating for '23 as we get to Capital Markets Day, Mark, but that's what hopefully gives you some color on what we're seeing in the business. The other thing, I would highlight though and I think it's an important reminder for us that, if you do take a step back over the two-year time period and we mentioned this through Q3, we are growing our volumes 4%. And we are still seeing good growth in particular in Scent and Pharma that we highlighted as well. So, the isolation that I highlighted is really primarily in those two areas, which is where we're anticipating seeing the deceleration continues as mentioned. And Gunther, this is Frank. With regards to the second part of your question about the lower volumes and strong price increases, we do not see it broadly, Gunther, that our pricing actions have impacted volume. In fact if you look at what's happening in the market, many of our peers are also increasing pricing. So we do not see that as an impact. In fact, we've also reached out to many of our customers and we've been doing this in concert obviously with them. And they have clearly signaled that we have not seen any share losses per se, Gunther because of our pricing actions. The one area that I did highlight is where we made a conscious trade-off was within our Ingredients business where we were capacity-constrained. We did increase price and made some volume trade-offs to preserve margins. So that is the one area that I would highlight. The other thing is with regards to what is the driver, primarily as mentioned, it is destocking for our business is what we're seeing Gunther. And that is -- the main driver is our customers are looking at year-end their inventory levels and wanting to obviously manage their working capital appropriately. So, that's really the driver. The last thing I will say though, with all of that, one of the things and we'll spend more time on the Capital Markets Day is we are looking at ways to really continue to build our commercial execution. How do we work with our customers to really bring the full portfolio of IFF forward increasing our market share with our key customers, regional customers and global customers as well as new customer acquisition? And I'll be spending some more time here at Capital Markets Day really talking about our plans in that area to focus on our aspirations for growth, Gunther. So, much more to come. Yes. Heidi, it's Frank. And as I highlighted, as we went through the quarter and in particular in September, Heidi, we did start to really see the destocking that I mentioned. And also, we are seeing that in the month of October. So, as we look at now for our forecast for this fourth quarter, we're obviously taking those most recent data points into consideration. And that is why we feel as though appropriately so we have guided to the top line sales that we've mentioned in our prepared remarks. The one thing I do want to take a step back though Heidi and do highlight though is we still are confident that for the full year growing the business, 9% to 10%, if you were excluding exchange, we feel as though is a very good overall performance. Like I said clearly, the fourth quarter is where we're seeing some challenges, and this is primarily due to our customers wanting to manage the inventory. And we think it's the prudent approach to take based on what we're seeing in the last couple of months end of Q3 and then as I mentioned in October. Yeah. So thanks Mike for the question. A couple of things. As I look at the total portfolio, one would say that overall we feel as though -- and going into a recession, we are very resilient when you look at our portfolio overall. If I start with Nourish, Mike clearly if you think about ingredients in the end markets of food and beverage, we should be very resilient there. Our Flavors segment is a resilient business and then also Food Design. So if you were to exclude some of the near-term challenges that we're talking about from an inventory destocking perspective, we think that our nearest division would be overall very resilient in recessionary times. If I look at the Scent business what is really interesting Mike is that the one area that we have thought would be more of a challenge in a recession would be Fine Fragrance. However, we are seeing really good growth in our Fine Fragrance business this year and our Scent business overall has continued to hang in there very well with overall good strong volume growth. As I look at Health & Biosciences, clearly, we think that holds up very well, also Mike. In particular, if you think about Cultures & Food Enzymes or Home & Personal Care business within Health & Biosciences, we think is a really good business and holds up during a recession. Obviously we've highlighted on this call, the challenges we're seeing in that health segment in the probiotic marketplace, but overall fairly resistant. And then clearly we see pharma as being very resilient in a recessionary period of time. With all of that said, as you mentioned, we do see some challenging headwinds on the horizon. That's something that we are obviously spending time as a team. We'll share much more on our 2023 outlook. But think of the overall business we feel very resilient across our different businesses Mark -- or Mike I should say, and it's something we will clearly spend a lot of time here at Capital Markets Day unpacking even more for you. Hi. This is Frank. I'll start. And we've highlighted our significant focus this year on our productivity initiatives which have primarily been in our operations group where we focused on our supply chain. We're focusing on really looking at economic profit as a key driver of our choices and decisions in our manufacturing operations group or logistics costs. So I would first start, that we have made really good progress in improved productivity. And I think Glenn highlighted that in his prepared remarks. With that said, as you go into an additional -- or a downturn one of the things that we are now looking at is our total cost base for IFF. So we are looking at ways to think about accelerating productivity beyond our manufacturing operations focus that you've heard us talk about and we highlighted on our second call. That's something that we are going to share much more Capital Markets Day. We do think there are ways to reduce our cost base and accelerate productivity, while also preserving two things. One our investment in innovation and two really also making sure we're continuing to focus on working with our customers to drive growth. So more to come at Capital Markets Day, but we do think we will be able to accelerate productivity as we head into 2023. Yes. The only thing I would add, Jonathan, I think it's important though that we do still continue to see our customers seeing, how important innovation is for the future. So as we engage with them and as Glenn mentioned, some of what we're seeing, some down-trading near-term, et cetera. But the fact is, we are still seeing very high engagement from our customers wanting to work with us, with regards to our pipeline new projects innovation, which we think is going to be very important for the future for us and going forward. So that's something that I just wanted to also make sure that is reinforced. We're not seeing a pullback of customers not wanting to innovate for their future growth. And that's something that we're focused on really helping them to deliver on. So thank you everyone for joining our call. Hopefully, you can see and hear despite some of the near-term challenges, we are extremely excited about the future in front of us with IFF. We look forward to December 7 in our Investor Day in the next couple of weeks where we'll really spend time sharing with you our growth our aspiration from an innovation perspective, how we'll continue to drive productivity to be able to reinvest in the business and why I'm very excited about the future of IFF going forward. So look forward to seeing many of you in New York City on the 7th, and thank you for joining our call."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank and welcome everyone. Starting on slide eight, I would like to provide an overview of our third quarter performance. In Q3, IFF generated approximately $3.1 billion in sales, representing 10% year-over-year growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in our Nourish and Pharma Solutions divisions. Pricing was a strong contributor to growth and as expected, volumes were down marginally in the quarter. It should be noted that on a two-year average basis, which factors our strong 8% year ago comparison, volume growth is running at about 4%. And while we have seen strong volume growth across most parts of our Pharma and Scent businesses in the third quarter, Nourish and H&B volumes were challenged. To provide some more color, nearly two-thirds of our volume decline in the quarter came in Protein Solutions, which is part of the Nourish business, where we have seen customer destocking to address higher inventory levels in response to sluggish end consumer demand. In H&B, our held volumes were also challenged in the third quarter, a direct result from weakening market demand in the US and Europe reflected in public market data. Gross margin was negatively affected by the significant inflationary pressures we faced across our markets. Yet through strategic pricing and productivity gains, IFF delivered adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. We also delivered solid adjusted earnings per share excluding amortization of $1.36. The strong dollar continued to be a headwind to our business. In the third quarter, we saw an approximately 7% impact on sales, an 8% adverse impact on EBITDA due to foreign exchange. Before moving on, I want to share that we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.25 billion for the third quarter related to our Health & Biosciences business. The primary drivers of the goodwill impairment are related to increases in interest rates and lower business projections due to adverse macroeconomic impacts on volume, continued cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange rate variations. Now moving to slide 9, I will provide a brief overview of the performance across our business segments. In the third quarter, we achieved year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth of 10% driven by broad-based sales growth across all of our business segments and nearly all of our sub-business units. Nourish had another strong quarter with double-digit growth and particularly encouraging performance from Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design. Health & Biosciences also saw strong single-digit growth despite pressure in our Grain Processing business. Scent again saw continued currency-neutral sales growth in the high single-digits, thanks to our Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients businesses. Pharma Solutions rebound continues with an impressive 28% increase in sales driven by continued strength in both industrial and pharma. Turning to slide 10 and looking at our profitability for the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $612 million. Comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 3% year-over-year due to the disciplined pricing actions to fully recover total inflation. We also achieved meaningful productivity gains and operational efficiencies from our productivity program, which have helped offset volume headwinds. As discussed last quarter, while we are clearly seeing signs of raw material inflation easing, we will continue taking appropriate targeted actions to offset inflation to maintain profitability. Now on slide 11, I'd like to discuss the underlying dynamics impacting the third quarter performance of each of our business segments. Nourish delivered another strong top-line quarter. Nourish's 10% year-over-year sales growth on a currency-neutral basis was driven by double-digit growth in Food Design and Ingredients, and sustained growth in our Flavors business.  Health & Biosciences also maintain strong performance delivering 3% in comparable currency-neutral sales growth driven by mid single-digit growth in our Culture & Food Enzymes, Health, Home & Personal Care and Animal Nutrition offerings. However, for each of these segments we saw 4% and 1% year-over-year decreases, respectively in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA as our price increases and productivity gains we discussed earlier were offset by lower volumes. Our Scent division once again delivered a strong performance with 9% currency-neutral sales growth this quarter, driven by mid-teen growth in Fine Fragrance and Fragrance Ingredients and high single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. The division also saw 3% growth in currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA due to volume growth, our price increases and productivity gains. Pharma Solutions contributed very strong performance, with 28% growth in currency-neutral sales, led by strong double-digit growth in pharma and industrial. Similar to Scent, Pharma Solutions also benefited from strong volume, our pricing actions and the productivity gains we achieved in the quarter leading to an impressive 76% growth in currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Turning now to Slide 12, I would like to cover our cash flow and leverage position. Through the first nine months, we generated $189 million in cash from operations, with CapEx finishing at $344 million or approximately 3.6% of sales. The net result is that our free cash flow through nine months was a negative $155 million. Our free cash flow has been significantly impacted by much higher inventories due to a combination of inflation, strategic increases and improved customer service levels and to slowing volumes. In addition, included in our free cash flow numbers are one-time deal and integration-related costs. As a result, we are implementing a series of initiatives to improve our cash flow with an intense focus on managing inventories down. Much of this will be driven by leveraging new S&OP processes and tools in concert with specific targets for each business unit, which we believe will improve our inventory efficiency across all parts of the business while continuing to maintain high service levels to our customers. In addition, we will be taking targeted actions to reduce CapEx spend and improve other working capital metrics to further improve our cash position. Importantly, we continue to make progress towards achieving our deleveraging target. As Frank mentioned earlier, we improved our net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 3.9 times from 4.4 times, which was supported by proceeds from our recent Microbial Control divestiture. We finished the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $538 million, while gross debt for the quarter totaled $10.8 billion. Turning to our consolidated outlook on Slide 13, I want to provide some update on our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our business and broader industry continues to face challenging operational conditions with persistent foreign exchange, inflationary and other economic pressures. These challenges have only increased since last quarter. We are certainly encouraged by the consistent sales growth achieved across each of our businesses this quarter, especially in this environment. However, we are adjusting our sales expectations for Q4, as we expect volume to further decelerate due to lower end-market demand and we expect foreign exchange to remain a significant headwind. These factors will also present challenges to adjusted operating EBITDA. In light of these factors, we are adjusting our full year guidance and now expect full year sales between $12.4 billion and $12.5 billion and comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 9% to 10%. We are reconfirming our adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, though we anticipate results to be at the bottom end of this range as we maintain strong cost discipline and accelerate productivity to offset persistent headwinds and softer volumes. Looking into 2023, the current macroeconomic environment makes us cautious. And as a result, we anticipate that we will be in a low-volume growth environment, particularly in the first half of next year. In addition, while we see raw material inflation easing, we do anticipate some year-over-year increases in raw materials and continued volatile energy markets, which will require additional pricing actions. As a result, we will continue to examine and refine our resource allocation to focus on strong cost discipline and accelerating our productivity across our business. We will also continue to implement pricing actions surgically, to support our profitability ensure our business remains resilient. And while it's still early in our planning process, we are targeting strong comparable currency-neutral sales growth in 2023, to be driven more predominantly by price with more modest EBITDA growth on a comparable currency-neutral basis, as we reinvest in the business to accelerate sales momentum and drive long-term profitable growth. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, as we roll forward current spot rates. We will spend more time on 2023 at our Investor Day, in a few weeks. I'll now turn it back to Frank, for closing comments. Yes. Hey, good morning, Adam. Thanks very much for the question. Clearly, it has been more challenging than expected this year and that's principally been driven by our inventory balances. So, maybe, if I can actually even start back in the first of the year, you cited the $800 million. We began the year at $1 billion target. And since that, it's been a combination of incremental pricing/inflation that was outside of plan. That's costing us about $125 million. And in addition, there's another $200 million of additional inventories we expect to be at year-end. By the way, that's a reduction of about $100 million from where we are. We ended the third quarter with inventories up $600 million from the start of the year. That was a large -- about $200 million of that is basically based on raw material inflation. About $400 million is basically based on, as Frank had mentioned, building inventories for service levels. But importantly, basically demand has slowed down and we've ended up with higher inventory. So, again, that's about $200 million delta from our original target. We are fully confident, we're going to get that $200 million back. We expect to get that back targeted in the first half of next year and even targeting more. On top of that our business has slowed down and there's been some differences in terms of our tax payments, really a timing element for us. That's collectively about $150 million. So those adjustments get us to sort of north of $500 million. So its $1 billion, minus $200 million higher volume-related inventories about another $125 million related to inflation, about $150 million slightly softer earnings than previous outlook and in addition some timing on tax. So that's a little over $500 million. I would note as we mentioned in our script, within our free cash flow that reported, its a GAAP basis in terms of free cash flow, so take it directly from our cash flow statement. That includes deal-related and integration costs. That's very material for us this year, given the sale of our Microbial Control business. So all the transaction-related costs, number of items for the standup at set were basically paid for as part of the deal and some integration-related costs. So there's about $225 million this year, that's sort of in -- it will be netted against that $525 million. So on it's a reported basis, if you will. That's more than $300 million. But frankly the $200 million is really a charge against operating cash flow when it's really related to sales of businesses. It's a little bit of an apples and oranges. So I'd sort of point to maybe $500 million as the true sort of operating cash flow this year. Of the gaps this year, clearly, $200 million inventory will get back. I'd say taxes clearly timing of another $100 million. That gets us to north of a little bit $800 million. And over time, we would expect the incremental raw materials that are sitting in our inventory this year, we'd expect to get that back over time. And again, that's over $250 million from the start of the year. So over time, we expect that to reverse as well. So hopefully, that was helpful. Hey, Mark, it's Glenn. Good morning. Relative to our longer-term objectives on cash flow, we're going to hold that to our Capital Markets Day. So we're less than a month away from that. We'll have a chance to actually discuss more specifically our longer-term targets. And then I'll turn it over to Frank to talk about some of the flow trends. Yes, John, thanks for the question. Actually it's more related to the amount of goodwill and intangibles that are allocated to the business. So let me -- just by way of background as I'm sure you're well aware, we prior to the end of the quarter had about $25 million of goodwill and intangibles on our books. They were assigned to each of the four divisions. They're directly related to the acquisitions. And by definition, the majority of that is from the N&B acquisition. So that allocation is concentrated in H&B Pharma and somewhat Nourish, but Nourish obviously has legacy IFF business as well. H&B and Pharma do not, right? So, if you will, it's a heavy sort of burden in terms of the goodwill intangibles against those two businesses. For context about 45% prior to the write-down of goodwill and intangibles was sitting on the books of H&B. So that's point one. Point two is, you're required to do an annual test or if there's an event that suggests there may be an impairment have to do it within the year. The event largely is attributable to the interest rate environment. So the way you basically run the calculation is you basically do a discounted cash flow for each of the businesses, you do forward projections. The forward projections on the H&B business were brought down. Those were in part because of exchange rates. So, all the businesses actually have lower earnings because we have to use the current exchange rates. Part of it is slightly lower operating performance, but exchange rates played a meaningful role. But the most significant variable is the discount rate. As everyone's well aware, the interest rates are going up rapidly. So the discount rate we were required to use for the cash flow was materially higher than a year ago and that's what resulted in the $2.25 billion. We do note in our disclosures that we have about 10% cushion on Pharma. As you would expect that will be the second business that would be under scrutiny, just given the amount of goodwill intangibles sign to the business. It is less significant on a relative basis for Scent and Nourish, because you have the legacy IFF businesses, that don't carry the goodwill and the other intangible impact as much. So it's really -- to some extent, I'd say it's a minor reflection on the outlook of the business and more reflective of the interest rate environment and what we're experiencing from the exchange rate. Good afternoon, Gunther. I'll actually start by talking about the inflationary environment. I think then Frank will probably pick it up to talk about pricing dynamics relative to volume. First of all, we are clearly seeing a deceleration environment relative to raw materials in the marketplace. So that's happening in certain commodities going forward. But let me kind of step back and talk about our overall outlook for 2023 in terms of three components. One logistics is actually looking very favorable flat to maybe slightly down. We are encouraged by an ease up of the supply chain, which is helping not only in terms of cost for freight, but in addition just making sure that we're able to deliver on time to our customers. So that's a plus. Energy is incredibly volatile as everybody knows. And it's very difficult to call that. What we have been doing with our customers as many have been doing is implementing direct surcharges or variable pricing that's tied to energy prices. So that will ebb and flow depending upon the market dynamic. And again, that's fairly consistent with what's happening with many players. That tends to be as you're well aware more concentrated in the European market globally in terms of the impact. And then as it relates to raws, we are seeing -- we're still seeing inflationary pressure. I would basically put that in three buckets where there are certain commodity groups that are impacted by the energy environment and/or supply chain so synthetics; chemicals as an example; pulp as an example. Secondarily, we're clearly seeing some roll-off on contractual pricing we had or hedging this year. So that's actually impacting. And while there are certain price commodity categories that are beginning to decline year-over-year, they represent some modest increases for us, such as soybean, palm oil, et cetera. And related to that, we are expecting next year's raw inflation to be about half of what we had this year, so call it, high single digits in terms of the impact. You are correct in pricing environment continues to tighten up. By definition with a slowdown in consumer, everyone's trying to be a little bit more thoughtful in terms of commodity prices would be passed through. We are about to go to market for 2023 pricing. We have spent a lot of energy being very surgical relative to what makes sense or customer in terms of pricing tied directly to what we're seeing in the marketplace. So we are -- again, it will be a much lower number versus what we have, but we are expecting another round of 2023 pricing actions to offset the residual raw materials. Hey, Anthony this is Glenn. Thanks for joining us. I'd say it's really difficult for us to predict. We do track very closely end-consumer demand. So what information we get from largely the scanner data; secondarily, obviously, in very extensive dialogues with our customers in terms of what they're doing. And as a byproduct, we do believe that destocking in addition to declining the end-consumer demand are the key contributors to what we're seeing. And of note as Frank had mentioned, we see it most pronounced in a couple of categories: one in protein solutions; second, in probiotics. And as you follow the end market and look at what some of the major CPG firms are reporting, they're double-digit drops in terms of the end market. And particularly as you think about probiotics, which had a big, big booms related to COVID and the value of these things it's understandable why we would see the decline. So point one is we believe that this is destocking end consumer. Point two relative to how long this will run, we really don't know. A number of our customers have communicated to us that they believe by year-end, they will have their inventories in place. That, of course, assumes they have a good crystal ball relative to where the consumer is going. Others have indicated that they believe that this may extend into the first and second quarter of next year. So we'll be providing more perspective at our Investor Day relative to our outlook on 2023, but we do -- we will ultimately be factoring potentially further destocking and slow down the consumer as we think about the outlook for our financial performance for next year. So appreciate the question. Hey, Josh. Good morning. Yeah. We're very pleased by the progress that our Scent business is making. Two things are exhibited in the third quarter trend versus the first half of the year. One is, we are beginning to sort of normalize for price versus inflation. So there was another round of pricing year to sort of catch-up for what's been happening with raw materials. That has been implemented. So it's been extremely helpful relative to the gross margin performance, and we expect that to normalize into the first half of next year. But then secondarily, the team has also undertaken actions to continue to manage their costs very tightly. So you'll notice that their RSNA expenses, also showed improvement from the first half to the third quarter as well. So the team is smartly and on a paced manner implemented pricing maintaining volumes quite well and on top of that taking additional productivity actions to make sure they manage the bottom line, and had a nice currency-neutral year-over-year growth as a result of that. Hey, Chris, yeah, relative to logistics costs year-over-year pretty flattish to slightly down. So we've actually seen nice improvement in the global supply chain. As I mentioned previously, raws we still have pressure about half of what we've seen this year. So think about it as sort of high single digit on our total raw material cost. And that's a function of contracts rolling off. It's also a function of certain categories those driven by energy prices continue to see escalation in areas that are being affected by continued war in Ukraine and other global supply chain issues. So call it half of the rate of this year, still meaningful for us to basically go capture. And as a byproduct of that, not only do we need to be smart on our next round of pricing actions, but everything Frank had mentioned around managing our cost structure as a way to sort of offset those pressures as well. Well, let me attempt to answer it in a couple of dimensions, Jonathan. Obviously, with the consumer under pressure from inflation, there is a visible movement from branded to private label. So that's happening both in Europe and the US, although more pronounced in Europe. We play across the customers that play in both spaces. So we serve both markets. In general, not all cases, but in general our margins are fairly consistent between branded and private label from the standpoint. So from that standpoint, while the consumer is moving across branded to private label generally, we hold up well relative to the shift of our business. The customer also will look at formulations and how do they think about saving money through reformulations, it's very constant. It actually happens in all environments, but it's more pronounced in this type of environment. So we work very closely with them in terms of helping them, reformulate products basically to take cost out and deliver the same solution for the consumer. The third thing, I would say relative to the behavior of consumer is and this is clearly happening in the marketplace is, while the consumer may still actually stay within branded oftentimes they will reduce dosage. So think about that as sort of less home and personal care products usage, or less fabric softener as an example. So that is another factor that's happening that affects our business, as well as the customers' business. But it may in essence, also result in sort of lower volumes in the marketplace as well. So, hopefully, that's helpful. Yes. Matt, one underlying factor relative to the quarter is how we're trying to correct manufacturing volumes to offset the decline in demand in order to address our cash flow and inventory problems. So as a result of that the production volumes in the third quarter for Nourish were dropped even more so than demand. So there's an absorption issue relative to that's hitting the business. So that does affect sort of the marginal flow-through of the dollar if you will. Also quarter-to-quarter there was some inflationary pressures like energy and some other things that were, sort of, not outside of the period per se in terms of kind of the effects. So it's a little bit hard to, sort of, normalize one quarter to another as being, sort of, an apples-to-apples. But the reduction in volumes in order to get our inventories down is a factor that's hitting our business collectively in Q3 and also in Q2. And it's more pronounced in Nourish and H&B we've seen a more pronounced volume decline. So that's a factor in that calculus you cited."

I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call.  Yesterday afternoon, we distributed a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live, and will be available for replay.  Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we're making forward-looking statements about the company's performance, particularly with regard to the outlook for the second half and full year 2022. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release, both of which can be found on our website.  Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release.  With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFranklin Clyburn: Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our first half results, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous progress we have made over the last 3 months. Under a challenging operating environment, our global teams continued to display their steadfast commitment to our customers and passion for innovative discoveries as IFF delivered profitable growth. Since joining IFF, I have consistently been impressed by the caliber of the work, innovation and expertise our people deliver as well as the creative culture that underpins our success.  I once again thank our teams around the world for their hard work. I will begin today's call with an update on our strategy refresh process and value creation opportunities we are focusing on for the near and long term, as well as IFF's recent accomplishments as we execute on our operational priorities. This includes delivering $70 million of cost savings in the first half of the year, taking swift and aggressive pricing action to cover inflation, exiting our Microbial Control business and ensuring that we have the right talent in the right roles. I will then turn the call over to Glenn to provide a detailed look at our second quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the rest of 2022. We will then open the call up for questions.  Beginning with Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update on our efforts to refresh our long-term strategic plan. While we are pleased that IFF holds strong positions across many of our business segments today, we are committed to evaluating and fine-tuning both our strategy and execution to best position the business for long-term profitable growth. I am pleased to share that we are making meaningful progress in moving quickly to map out an exciting and ambitious path forward.  In Q2, we continued to advance our enterprise-wide review of our business and portfolio to ensure we are well equipped to successfully navigate current and future market conditions while capturing long-term value. Our goal for this comprehensive evaluation is to further develop the refined operating plan to generate sustainable sales growth by ensuring lasting competitive differentiation through innovation, product superiority and provide a clear road map where we can execute our priorities to create significant value to all of our stakeholders.  Already, we have successfully completed the foundational phases of the plan. We have identified meaningful opportunities to capture additional profitable growth in attractive end markets, geographies and cross-platform synergies, while also identifying internal opportunities in near-term external pressures that must be navigated to achieve this. Now, we are working to finalize refreshed operating plans that we will align our operating model, talent and incentives as well as finalize our long-term financial targets and capital allocation strategy that prioritizes sustainable long-term growth. In addition, we are strengthening our culture, one that embodies collaboration and accountability to ensure strong execution of our commitments.  We will continue to move rapidly and with urgency over the coming months to finalize our refreshed strategy, and look forward to sharing more on this with you at our Capital Markets Day to be held Wednesday, December 7 in New York City.  Moving to Slide 7, I'd like to give a brief snapshot on where we are focusing as we advance our strategic refresh. There are 5 core areas of focus. First, we are prioritizing a more thoughtful and data-driven approach to our resource allocation strategy. Investment is essential to our future growth, but it is critical that our spending decisions optimize returns and reflect the unique roles that each of our businesses serve in our broader portfolio. I will explain this in more details in a moment. Similarly, we are also making strategic decisions to support our research and development efforts. By focusing on the highest return projects and identifying ways we can leverage our cross-platform offerings we will be even better positioned to accelerate top line growth and extend our industry leadership in key categories. Shortly, we will introduce an enhanced productivity program designed to help us improve profitability and unlock additional opportunities to finance our growth initiatives.  At the same time, we continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensure that our offerings closely align to the markets in which we operate, the evolving expectations of our customers and with our long-term objectives. We successfully completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business, and we will continue to assess the portfolio as we explore additional non-core divestitures to reduce debt and improve our capital structure.  Lastly, we are reviewing our operating model to ensure that our structure, talent and incentives to maximize our unmatched portfolio and go-to-market strategy with our customers. Attracting and supporting the industry's best talent and aligning incentives is critical to drive continued collaboration and accountability across the organization.  I am focused on making sure we have the right talent to execute our strategic plan, and I'm pleased that we recently announced Deb Borg, who will join us as our Chief Human Resource and Diversity and Inclusion Officer on August 29, 2022. With her deep experience connecting HR, culture, employee engagement and business as well as our change management expertise, she has the right skill set for IFF and our people as we strengthen our execution-driven culture. She brings an extensive track record of building world-class talent and helping the business execute and drive value for all stakeholders. Our success with these initiatives will be supported by our ongoing work to modernize our foundation on data and technology capabilities as we strengthen our internal operations to help ensure best-in-class execution.  On Slide 8, I would like to share a bit more about the deliberate choices we are making, specifically how a more strategic and disciplined approach to resource allocation will create exciting opportunities for profitable growth. Across the board, we are focused on driving margin improvements, but to do so effectively, we're pursuing differential management strategy across key areas.  Last quarter, I shared an ROIC chart, which was a first glimpse into the lens that we are viewing the company through. To move forward with this plan, we have developed a comprehensive playbook that segments our business into 3 distinct archetypes with unique strategic imperatives. When we look at our portfolio, we would consider whether to invest to grow, maximize to drive efficiencies or optimize to rapidly improve performance. Using this model, we remain intensely focused on achieving above-market growth, strengthening our competitive global position, increasing our return on invested capital and analyzing the most valuable use of our existing assets.  For example, in a category like Flavors, we see meaningful opportunities to drive above-market revenue growth, primarily through reinvesting in innovation and commercial initiatives. We are prioritizing above-market revenue expansion in this category as opposed to margin improvement alone as we're focusing on large, profitable and faster-growing subcategories like Beverages or Dairy to drive strong value creation. Here, it is more about reinvesting margin upside to ensure we are bringing the best innovation to our customers to drive dollar profit growth.  On the other hand, in a market like Animal Nutrition, we are focused on maintaining the consistent growth we've delivered, with an emphasis on driving further productivity. By identifying certain segments in which to reinvest while strategically reducing R&D expenses in others, we will focus on margin improvement and create opportunities to invest in the highest value offerings.  We are taking a stronger approach within our optimized businesses, for example, our pectin business, a popular clean-label natural stabilizer, to quickly drive near-term earnings through pricing and cost initiatives while maintaining our market competitiveness and reallocating upside to invest to growth categories like Flavors. I will also say, for those optimized businesses where we do not have a strong improvement plan, we will accelerate divestitures and exit the category, with work already well underway.  I am excited about this initiative and the progress we are seeing already. Make no mistake, we are running IFF quite differently in bringing enhanced rigor to our operations across every business and function. Earlier this year, we spent time reviewing our key priorities, including pricing and portfolio optimization.  Moving to Slide 9. I would now like to focus on the multi-year productivity and reinvestment program I mentioned earlier, which I believe is key to achieving our long-term growth expectations and our profitability goals. Since joining IFF, I have spent time analyzing our cost profile and believe, as an organization, we have a significant opportunity to optimize our cost structure. I am fully committed to unlocking this value and have asked the team to accelerate our efforts to ensure we are well positioned to execute as we move into the second half of the year.  For more details, I would like to ask Glenn to comment.\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Frank, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Accelerating our productivity and expense synergy efforts represents one of our top priorities, and is increasingly important in a more challenging economic environment in order to maximize financial performance. To this end, we want to provide additional transparency to our multi-year productivity program and the expected results.  First of all, let me describe the scope of our efforts. Overall, we have established 4 productivity efforts that cover approximately 85% of IFF's total cost structure, focused primarily on operations and overhead expenses. The 4 teams include supply chain, which includes our procurement and global logistics operations. Opportunities include driving additional efficiencies in direct and indirect material spending through enhanced procurement strategies and demand management, particularly for indirect spend and reduced logistics costs driven by improved global S&OP processes.  The second team is focused on end-to-end manufacturing operations and includes a broad-based set of initiatives, including accelerating our digital manufacturing efforts, driving yield improvements, system-wide best practices and energy savings programs.  The third initiative is our economic profit team that is focused on leveraging improved technology and disciplined processes to optimize product mix, rationalize SKUs and enhance make versus buy decisions.  And our fourth team is focused on building out our global shared service platform in with technology, to drive increased centralization and process standardization to drive efficiencies across our administrative and business support functions.  In total, the combined programs are targeting a preliminary net annualized P&L impact of $250 million to $300 million that we expect to be achieved between 2023 and 2025.  Two important notes. First, this $250 million to $300 million annual impact is net of reinvestments that are targeted to strengthen our innovation pipeline, expand our commercial efforts across key products, customers and regions, deepen our technology and digital capabilities and strengthen our talent. Secondly, the net savings will be slightly more skewed to 2024 and 2025. We look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in December.  With that, I'll turn it back to Frank.\nFranklin Clyburn: Thank you, Glenn. As I said, we will provide more specifics on this program at our Investor Day in December, but wanted to share an early indication with you as we committed to provide more details on this topic during our Q1 earnings call. More importantly, at our Investor Day, we will also provide you with a clear and more detailed road map for growth, including our incremental revenue opportunities from our combination with N&B. We remain confident that we have significant opportunities ahead, confirmed by our initial commercial wins and positive customer feedback as well as our competitors following our lead.  I know that realization of these benefits have been slower than expected due to external factors, including COVID, supply chain disruption, customer bandwidth, pricing initiatives and constrained capacity. However, since joining, I have launched a focused initiative to reinforce our emphasis and address existing gaps.  Specifically, we are developing a set of prioritized opportunities, each with clear financial impact, owner and time line to provide confidence in our ability to deliver. This will be a significant focus for me going forward as I'm committed to delivering the value proposition of our combined portfolio and will be personally involved, dedicating significant time and engagement with the business to drive performance.  I am pleased to say that we continue to see steady wins across our portfolio. Recently, we co-collaborated with a leading alternative protein producer to improve commercial and technical collaboration, essentially upstreaming the incorporation of Heritage IFF flavors into Heritage N&B Protein-Based, exceeding our customers' expectation for plant-based burgers. This resulted in IFF being awarded as a core supplier, one of three, increasing our market share and enjoying a long-term relationship. In addition, we are seeing the value of integrated solutions between our Nourish and H&B divisions.  The Dairy category is showing very good collaboration opportunities, thanks in large part to early technical support and a better, together approach with customers. In this win, we were a step ahead of the competition due to early engagement with a dairy customer during culture development phase and showing the best flavor collaboration.  These are just 2 examples, but strong proof points that we are moving in the right direction and delivering a better value proposition to our customers.  Now turning to Slide 10, I'd like to provide an overview of our performance for the first half of the year. Our strong first half results are once again a testament to the strength of our portfolio and the dedication of our talented global teams who have continued to go above and beyond in a complex market. Despite the macroeconomic challenges of the last 6 months, sales grew by a strong 18% or 12% on a currency-neutral basis to $6.5 billion. Comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 8% to $1.4 billion.  I am proud to report that we increased our quarterly dividend by approximately 3%, the 13th consecutive year of increased payouts to our shareholders, which underscores our belief in our business and IFF's strong future cash flow generation. We also continue to work on deleveraging objectives, where we remain committed to our deleverage target of reducing net debt to EBITDA to less than 3x 36 months post the transaction, which is February 1, 2024. At the same time, we prudently and proactively amended the covenants on our existing credit agreements given the market volatility and uncertainty. Glenn will discuss in more detail.  As I mentioned a bit earlier, we also completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business on July 1 and continuing to evaluate additional divestiture opportunities for our non-core assets as we move ahead based on our category management approach I described earlier.  Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Glenn to provide a closer look into our second quarter financials.\nGlenn Richter: Thanks again, Frank. Turning first to our consolidated second quarter results. IFF generated more than $3 billion in sales, representing 11% year-over-year increase on comparable currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Nourish and Pharma solutions. In terms of our growth contribution, pricing represented the majority, with volumes up modestly.  Our focus coming into 2022 was to fully recover inflation through pricing actions, and for the full year, we are on track to recover approximately $1 billion in cost inflation. We are doing so in a very thoughtful and strategic manner, over on lower margin and capacity-constrained businesses.  While foreign exchange rates have had an adverse impact on our sales and EBITDA in the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that adjusted operating EBITDA grew 3% year-over-year on a reported basis or 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis driven by productivity gains and pricing actions we implemented in the quarter. We also achieved solid year-over-year earnings per share growth of 3%, excluding amortization.  Before moving on, I wanted to share that during the second quarter of '22, we took an impairment charge of $120 million within certain entities in Russia due to a number of factors, including reduced business focus as we have restricted our operations to essential consumer products that include food, hygiene and medicine, supply chain issues, reduced product demand and exchange rate volatility, all as the result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It was determined that such declines in operating performance were not expected to reverse in the near future, and future expected growth is expected to be limited given the operating conditions in Russia. This non-cash impairment charge was allocated pro rata to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment within the asset group in the amount of approximately $92 million and $28 million, respectively.  Moving now to Slide 12, I'll provide a brief overview of the underlying performance across our business segments. As I mentioned, sales growth across each of our business segments, including Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scents and Pharma Solutions contribute to IFF's year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 11%.  Nourish was once again our largest growth driver, with a significant broad-based growth across our Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design businesses. Scent had another strong quarter, with currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits led by Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients. Health & Biosciences delivered mid-single-digit growth due to consistent performance in Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes and Animal Nutrition, as well as Microbial Control prior to the official divestiture completed in July. Both Home & Personal Care and Grain Processing were negative in the second quarter as each business had very strong double-digit comparison in the prior year period.  Lastly, we are pleased by Pharma Solutions continued rebound, having achieved double-digit growth driven by continued strength in our Industrial and Pharma businesses.  Turning to Slide 13, I'd like to provide a review of our profitability for the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $700 million, exceeding our expectations and representing 7% in year-over-year comparable currency-neutral growth driven by the pricing actions and productivity gains that I mentioned earlier. Our comparable adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 21.3%, and on an inflation-adjusted basis would have been approximately 220 basis higher or approximately 23.5%, if we normalize for the impact of pricing contribution to sales. This compares to an EBITDA margin of 22% in Q2 of 2021.  As a result of our strategic pricing actions, we have fully recovered total inflation cost to date, and we are optimistic that we will achieve full dollar cost recovery for the full fiscal year. As we continue navigating this uncertain market, we will continue to closely monitor raw materials and logistics costs in the quarters ahead and take appropriate action to offset additional inflationary pressures and maintain profitability.  On Slide 14 is an overview of our second quarter performance by business segment. Nourish, which delivered year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 15% and 18% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, saw strong demand, particularly in Food Design and Flavors. In Health and Biosciences, high single-digit increases in Health and Cultures & Food Enzymes, and mid-single-digit growth in Animal Nutrition drove 4% comparable currency neutral sales growth for the division. While we implemented strategic pricing actions and saw notable productivity gains similar to Nourish this quarter, lower volumes and an unfavorable mix led to 2% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA.  In Scent, Fine Fragrances continue to lead the way with double-digit growth, followed by high single-digit growth in Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. Collectively, Scent achieved year-over-year comparable currency neutral sales growth of 9%, though inflationary pressures outpaced our strategic pricing actions, which led to a 17% decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Our teams are continuing to work with our customers to address these ongoing inflationary pressures, and we fully anticipate to recover all inflationary costs over time.  Lastly, Pharma Solutions was one of our strongest performers this quarter, achieving 10% in year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth and an exceptional 25% increase in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, driven by double-digit growth in Industrial and high single-digit growth in Pharma. The division's profitability was further supported by pricing actions and productivity gains.  Turning to Slide 15, I would like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position for the first half results. In our first 6 months, our free cash flow position was impacted by higher inventory values. This was a result of a combination of continued inflationary pressures and rebuilding inventories to support customer service levels. million in the first half, representing approximately 3.6% of sales, as we continue to make necessary investments in our business. In addition, IFF delivered $402 million in dividends to our shareholders.  From a leverage perspective, we remain well positioned as we advance our strategic refresh. We finished the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $569 million while gross debt for the quarter totaled $12.15 billion. Note that we received the $1.3 billion gross proceeds from the sale of our Microbial Control business in July. At the end of Q2, we maintained a 4.4x net debt credit adjusted EBITDA ratio.  In addition, just last week, we proactively amended our existing term loan credit agreement and revolving credit agreement in order to ensure we maintain adequate flexibility to navigate near-term market uncertainties. The associated amendment fee was approximately $800,000. The amended agreements delayed certain step-downs from maximum permitted leverage ratio of 4.5:1, stepping down to 3.5:1 over time, with the first step down now occurring at the end of the third quarter 2023 versus the end of the fourth quarter 2022 previously. Trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.644 billion.  As Frank mentioned, on August 3, our Board of Directors authorized a 3% or $0.02 increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.81 per share of the company's common stock. The quarterly dividend is payable on October 5, 2022 to shareholders of record as of September 23. Including this authorization, we increased our quarterly dividend payment for the 13th consecutive year.  Let's now turn to our consolidated outlook on Slide 16. As we look to the remainder of 2022, we remain on track to deliver our commitments and are reconfirming full year guidance projected sales of $12.6 billion to $13 billion and currency-neutral sales growth of 9% to 12%. While we are reconfirming our outlook, we also are increasingly cautious on the overall market environment outlook as we navigate continued foreign exchange fluctuations, ongoing inflation and potentially recessionary pressures. We expect to achieve our sales targets through pricing actions as we press ahead toward full dollar cost recovery.  We expect foreign exchange pressures to impact sales by approximately 5 percentage points compared to our previously forecasted 4 percentage points. We are also reconfirming adjusted operating EBITDA to be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which equates to currency-neutral operating EBITDA growth of 4% to 8%. Please note that we expect foreign exchange to impact that growth by approximately 6 percentage points versus 5 percentage points previously.  As always, we remain laser focused on mitigating the many macroeconomic challenges with an emphasis on controlling what we can control during these uncertain times, notably focusing on pricing execution and productivity.  In terms of the third quarter, we expect sales growth to be strong driven by pricing actions, with sales coming in modestly above $3 billion and impacted by incremental foreign exchange headwinds, some seasonality of our business and the divestiture of Microbial Control. The sale of Microbial Control will impact Q3 revenues by approximately $110 million. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $600 million to $610 million.  Before passing the call back to Frank, I want to revisit the 4 core business objectives we outlined at the beginning of the year. Overall, we are executing well against our operational priorities so far this year. Relative to maintaining strong sales momentum, we achieved 12% year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth for the first half of '22 and are targeting currency-neutral growth of 9% to 12% for the full year.  In terms of executing our broad-based pricing actions, we've fully recovered the total cost of inflation, and we remain on track to achieve a full dollar cost recovery for the full year '22. Importantly, we are closely monitoring inflationary trends in the broader market environment to ensure we are well equipped to stay ahead and, where necessary, quickly respond to future challenges.  On the productivity front, we continue to make tremendous progress towards our productivity savings goals for the full year. In the first half of the year, we delivered over $70 million operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies, well above our expectations. We are well on track to exceed our $100 million full year savings target.  Finally, relative to accelerating non-core divestitures, we successfully completed the sale of our Microbial Control business on July 1 and are continuing to assess our portfolio to identify additional portfolio optimization and divestiture opportunities in this uncertain market. These divestitures will help us delever our balance sheet and enable us to reinvest in our highest performing businesses.  With that, I'll pass the call back over to Frank.\nFranklin Clyburn: Thanks, Glenn. Before I wrap up today's call, I want to say I am proud of the efforts of our global teams as we continue to execute amid challenging market conditions. We've achieved strong performance in the first half of 2022 and increased our dividend for the 13th consecutive year. I am confident in our ability to achieve our full year financial targets as we continue executing against our operational priorities and control what we can control.  At the same time, we are committed to advancing our strategic transformation efforts, deploying innovation, refining our portfolio and strengthening our culture to deliver strong value creation for all of our stakeholders.  Moving through the second half of the year, we will be intensely and urgently focused on protecting and growing our business, identifying new strategic value creation opportunities, and communicating our refreshed operating model across the business and the market to position IFF for long-term success. I look forward to sharing more at our upcoming Capital Markets Day in early December.  I'd now like to open the call for any questions. Thank you.\nOperator: . And we will take our first question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: I wanted to ask about the productivity program and how you're thinking about balancing margin versus volume growth especially given, I think, what you said, Glenn, of modest volume growth in this period, sort of how do you think about that going forward?  And how do we think about net savings as it relates to long-term targets, including implied margin expansion? I think the math would get you something north of 200 basis points in implied margins. How do we think about that longer term?\nFranklin Clyburn: Mark, this is Frank. A couple of comments. I'll start with first, the productivity program that we've announced, we see that as really important not only near-term, Mark, but really building a continuing productivity mindset. We want that build into the company.  We also want to be able to use that to be able to invest in our growth opportunities. What we're trying to achieve, Mark, is really sustainable, profitable growth, and to start to really get leverage throughout the P&L. We think that's going to be really important for us from a profile perspective. This is why we've also done the ROIC work, Mark, on our portfolio, and we'll be able to share with you in December some of the specific targets from a financial perspective.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas Exane.\nHeidi Vesterinen: So if we look at your Q2 currency-neutral growth, I understand this is mainly price. While we see that most of your peers had strong volumes this quarter, why do you think you weren't able to grow volumes? And perhaps you could comment on the exit rate in Q2 in terms of volumes and momentum into Q3, please? And then somewhat linked to that, what was the reason for not upgrading your full year guidance after such a strong H1 in terms of EBITDA?\nGlenn Richter: Heidi, this is Glenn. Thanks for the questions. Relative to sort of volume comparatives, I would sort of maybe answer it 3 ways. One is, as you're well aware, the comparatives are difficult given the apples to oranges sometimes comparisons of the business. But I would say that if you really kind of strip our business down and look at sort of the first half results, most of our core businesses actually are doing quite well. So Flavors, Scents are both mid-single digit in terms of volume growth. Core business units within H&B, Health is up high single digit. Cultures, Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition, mid-single digits. Pharma is up low single digits.  So the difference is, as we've discussed throughout the year, we're being very thoughtful regarding a balance between volume and profitability. So we've been very strategic and thoughtful relative to margin enhancement actions and focusing on those businesses that have both capacity constraints and/or are lower-margin businesses, so that's the difference. We're very specifically trying to focus on making sure we deliver good outcomes for our shareholders as well as our customers from performance.  And then lastly, I would note that this is very consistent with what we signaled. We've said very early in the year, we were planning basically the balance of the year to be relatively flattish to 1 point, and this is very consistent with the strategy and how we're implementing it.  Relative to kind of guidance, the reality is the pace in which sort of inflationary pressures flow through raw materials into our cost of goods, it does vary by business. So there's a little bit of a lag here in terms of how that's hitting quarter-to-quarter. That explains some of the overperformance in the quarter, third quarter relative to kind of the full year outlook. And consequently, because of that lag and just generally a perspective on cautionary outlook given the macro environment, we're being sort of realistic in terms of how we guide, and consequently, we're sticking to the same guidance.  So hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein.\nGunther Zechmann: Frank, Glenn, and Mike. Can you talk about the volume contribution within Nourish that you expect in Q3? And how much revenue synergies and integrated solutions are included in that place?  And then secondly, what is your updated inflation forecast for the year, and any insight that you can share into 2023, please?\nFranklin Clyburn: Gunther, it's Frank. I'll get started. So first, with regards to revenue synergies, and as Glenn mentioned, we did see really good performance, especially within Flavors, within Nourish, and we're excited about the significant opportunity we believe we have there.  We also highlighted on the call some examples, Gunther, that we are really encouraged by some of the wins that we're seeing where we're utilizing our legacy N&B expertise, as well as legacy IFF expertise for vanilla flavor is an important win there. We highlighted an important win with regards to plant-based burgers. We're seeing good cross-selling opportunities. So overall, we're starting to see revenue synergies and we're hearing good positive feedback from our customers.  With that said, Gunther, there's work to be done, and I highlighted that on the prepared remarks. This is something that's going to be a significant area of focus for myself personally as well as the executive team. We're going to be leaning into how we bring our broader platform portfolio technology to our customers. So this is something we'll share a lot more about in our December Capital Markets Day.  Glenn, I don't know if you want to maybe touch on the inflation?\nGlenn Richter: Sure. Yes. Definitely Gunther. Relative to 2022, it's still choppy, but in general, no change to our outlook relative to the impact of inflation. Generally, energy has been slightly better. Logistics has been slightly better. Raw materials have been slightly worse in pockets. But generally, things are sort of stable.  I would also note that just the nature of the time it takes raw materials to go through inventory and show up in the P&L, any additional impact for the balance of the year is likely to be muted to 0 and really hit 2023.  We are taking a very deep look at '23. We've run through a preliminary scenario, we're doing an update in the coming weeks here as we plan for 2023. And our perspective at this point is we do anticipate another, I'll say, meaningful round of cost increase from inflation. That's going to be concentrated in our view more on raw materials. So there's a number of areas including soy, oils, obviously, certain commodity groups such as agricultural grains and those sort of things, we're seeing pretty significant inflation. Energy is choppy, but likely to also be some increase modestly in energy prices and logistics as well. We're likely to see some sort of modest increase as well. So kind of overall, we are expecting probably '23 not to the same degree as '22, but we are expecting additional inflationary pressures for next year.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Nice quarter and outlook. In terms of free cash flow performance for 2Q, any more color maybe by segment? What's sort of driving that consumption? And then I think you were hoping to do about $1 billion in positive free cash flow in '22. Can you make up some of this in the second half of the year?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. So good question, Mike. The sole impact is -- well, there's seasonality, as you know. So typically, in the first half of the year, first quarter, there's a build on working capital, namely inventories. Secondarily, there's the year-end of compensation that basically gets paid out, et cetera. We are running actually worse on cash flow than anticipated to the tune of about $200 million. That is 100% attributable to higher inventory levels that is principally related to basically higher costs.  So as you may recall, when we entered the year, we had our kind of Wave 1 inflation subsequent very early in the year. We identified another significant round of inflation coming through. That is rolling into inventory. So as a byproduct of that, we had guided to the full year that we'd be relatively flat to prior year from a free cash flow standpoint of about $1 billion-ish. We're sort of targeting to be probably about $200 million less than that at this point in time.  That being said, we are implementing a series of very important initiatives largely against the legacy N&B businesses. In terms of putting in new S&OP processes and enhancements, we're hopeful that those will drive some efficiencies, i.e., be able to bring some inventory levels. But I'd say best guess at this point is probably 800-ish versus the original $1 billion.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson: So I guess I wanted to come back to the inflation and cost question. I appreciate there's a business, but help us just balance, think about the price cost balance in the second half specifically? I think you entered the year having been behind on price cost from '21, and hoping you'd be catching up to that into '23. Is there still -- do you still see -- or still have line of sight to recapturing kind of that price-cost imbalance on a cumulative basis in '23?  And I guess, along those lines, can you talk about the actions you're taking to try to shorten some of the price lags in some of the businesses, and probably see it a little bit more in the Scent segment this quarter? But how -- what can we do to maybe compress that -- the length of those inventories in cost cycles?\nGlenn Richter: Adam, thanks for the question. I'd say a couple of answers. One is just relative to this year, I'll say we're slightly ahead, i.e. price versus cost, back to the how things roll through inventory slightly behind the second half of the year. That's part of the reason for the -- how one thinks about the balance of the year implied guidance versus kind of the first half of the year. So that's a piece of it.  We -- normally, 18 months would be the full lag from inflation to capture. You can see that it's sort of manifesting itself differently by business. Scent is the one that's the furthest behind from a timing, given the nature of the relatively large customers and generally are indices tag to the contracts from the standpoint. And we would fully expect that to continue to be the case.  The only question mark here is how one thinks about '23. So as I just mentioned, my prior answer to Mike is that we probably are going to see another round of inflation come through. So from that standpoint, it may be 18 months from the first round, but we may have a continued set of rounds of inflation we need to catch up, which would suggest probably late '23 or even '24, if that's the case.  But to your last part of your question, obviously, we've all been in a very unprecedented environment relative to pricing, and that's required us to sort of rethink traditional contracts. And the way we've been rethinking them is, to some extent, just having realistic discussions with our customers on these -- level of inflation and having to share the burden. And then in addition, just rethinking contracts in terms of the frequency, so as opposed to annual, semi-annual or other type of sort of more open agreements relative to changes in the marketplace. So that's been a bigger factor of relative to the contracts we put in place, and I suspect it will prevail in the future as well as we think about '23.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from John Roberts with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Roberts: Glenn. I think you earlier quantified it's 3 or 4 divestments for $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in expected proceeds. Is that still the right ballpark target as you look at the portfolio?  And then to your comments on inflation and higher working capital. So the way to think about how much is just oil prices working their way down the supply chain, and it's just taking time to get to you versus structural, European gas constraints in China, rotating lockdowns and logistics stuff? Can you separate oil prices or commodity prices versus the structural issues you're facing?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Good question, John. So relative to our outlook for divestitures, we still think the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion gross proceeds, 3 to 4 transactions completed by the end of next year is in the right ballpark. The market, as you're well aware, has slowed down, so the level of M&A activity is substantially less with the ball in the credit markets that has made it more difficult, particularly for private equity investors.  However, the size of our transactions, you can just do the simple math, aren't that large. They tend to be sort of nice strategic fits for other businesses. So from an initial dialogue standpoint, the interest level seems very good. So we think that things may be a little slower from a process standpoint, but we're still fairly confident that we will hit our target.  Relative to sort of broader global supplies or how one thinks about inventory over the longer cycle, about half of our growth, of our dollar growth of inventories is related to inflation this year, and about half is related to higher inventory levels. Those higher inventory levels, if you recall, would basically improve our customer service levels because we had low inventories, again, the legacy N&B businesses. I will say, though, I'm increasingly confident that through the implementation of improved S&OP processes across a number of our businesses, that will allow us actually to reduce some of those higher inventories.  The third thing you mentioned is really the global supply chain. Clearly, we, like everybody, have an extended supply chain, i.e., there's more products sitting on the water for longer times. There's more inventory buffer stock in our system, et cetera, that basically accommodate for the volatility of the market. We're actually thinking about what that means longer term in terms of working capital. And I suspect by the end of this year, we'll be able to sort of come back and provide some visibility on that. But I do think at the end of the day, that will be a meaningful improvement opportunity not just for ourselves, but for everyone as the supply chain gets back to order.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Frank and Glenn, where are you seeing initial signs of demand weakness, either by geography or by business? And second, if we were to go into a deeper downturn, what levers can, would you pull to offset that downturn?\nFranklin Clyburn: David, it's Frank. Thanks for the question. A couple of thoughts. From the demand weakness perspective, the geography that we are seeing is probably no surprises. Really China, we had the lockdowns, and we did see an impact clearly in the second quarter. And just to recall, David, China is our second largest market, so that's been somewhat of a challenge for us.  And then if you think about our portfolio, on the positive side, as Glenn mentioned, we did see good growth in Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes, Flavors, Fine and Consumer Fragrance as well, so that's the positive. If you think about the resiliency of our portfolio, we feel overall cautiously optimistic. One would anticipate as pressures continue to , Fine Fragrances may be somewhat of a challenge.  As we think about the additional levers, and this is what we're really staring into. But if you listen to some of our prepared remarks, clearly, productivity is going to be continuously important for us, and that's something that we are spending a lot of time on as a team and thinking about levers there. Glenn has already spoken about our pricing and our working with customers to really do everything we can to recoup the inflation that we're seeing.  And then the other lever we have is really staying close to our customers, our global key account teams, our customer insight teams, really trying to be as quick and agile as possible. Working with our customers to make sure we have good connection with them to understand kind of what we're seeing in the marketplace. So those are all levers that we are focused on, but it's also why we feel good on our recommitment of our guidance. Both the top line at 9% to 12% growth range, and then also our EBITDA range of 48%. So that's why we feel comfortable and confident in reconfirming our guidance today.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi: I just wanted to first up, follow up on the last question as it relates to new product development. Have you seen any signs of slowing as major customers sort of worry about consumer elasticity on a global basis?  And then on Slide 16, Frank, we talked about preparing for more uncertain market conditions, including a recession. How do you think the portfolio is positioned as we potentially go into some level of macroeconomic slowdown? And I'm just asking in context of your leverage profile occurred.\nFranklin Clyburn: Yes. So on the resiliency, as I mentioned, we feel overall cautiously optimistic on the portfolio. Clearly, there's a lot of moving pieces right now. But if you think about Food and Beverage, you think about Health, you think about what we are seeing resiliency from our Pharma business, so we feel overall that the portfolio going into possibly some challenging times is really well positioned overall. And I've kind of highlighted that Fine Fragrances may be an area that we start to see some pullback from a demand perspective.  As far as the innovation question in our portfolio, there are some customers that are going to really focus on our core offerings, that they're going to maybe not think about new offerings at this point in time. However, we still are seeing very strong signals of customers wanting to innovate, co-develop and work with us, and we're really excited about our pipeline and portfolio. And my belief is that's still going to be critically important for the future. It's something that we'll spend time in December really sharing with you why we're excited about our pipeline portfolio, but that's going to be really key for us.  So yes, you'll see some customers focus in the near term maybe on core offerings. However, as we look out, we're still seeing signals from customers that are working with us on innovation. It's going to be really important to the future.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. And if I could maybe just add to that relative to the leverage question, Ghansham, is that as Frank indicated, as you're well aware, this business is highly resilient through cycles. So you may be down a couple percent, you may have some temporary transition quarter or 2 as customers sort of destock inventories, but in general, you don't see massive swings in terms of volume.  Secondarily, very importantly, we do believe that sort of the pricing resiliency and being able to continue to sustain passing inflation through, which is helpful.  Third, productivity, as we've mentioned, is sort of a major driver here to sort of offset some of the potential demand drop in the marketplace. And then in general, a slowdown probably helps other elements of working capital, such as inventory is more stable as well, and maybe even slower CapEx investments. So not only from a P&L standpoint, but from a cash flow, very resilient to sort of managing the cycle, particularly with the success in pricing and the focus on productivity.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Josh Spector with UBS.\nJoshua Spector: I just wanted to follow up on Nourish, and particularly in the quarter, segment margins were much higher than our expectations, I believe, higher than your expectations. You talked about the visibility of raw materials flowing through your system. So I'm curious really what went better in the quarter, and why can't something like that occur in the next couple of quarters? What's different versus what happened this quarter?\nGlenn Richter: Yes, good question, Josh. It really is related to the sort of the matching of the build in inventories relative to the flow-throughs of sales. And as mentioned, we've sort of built inventories. And at this point, we think we're going to be fairly -- i.e., the raw materials have come through. Raw materials are generally sort of static from a cost standpoint. So we do expect them to sort of run through the next quarter or so, and we wouldn't expect to have this, I'll say, artificial pickup from a timing standpoint.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho.\nChristopher Parkinson: We've hit on price cost, we've hit on productivity. When we look out -- obviously, there's some uncertainty in the second half of the year. But when we look out into '23, '24, and Frank, now that you've had some time to look at your 4 primary businesses, can you talk about just any potential mix enrichment, specifically in H&B, and anything else that could really help us try to compartmentalize your longer-term margin opportunities across segments? Just any quick thoughts?\nFranklin Clyburn: Yes, Chris, just -- I mean, we'll spend some time in December around the portfolio, in particular. This is why we have really looked at our business through the ROIC lens that we've spoken about. And you can see the 3 categories that we highlighted, Invest to Grow and then also maintaining our business, and then some that we actually have to really improve or exit.  We're excited that we have significant opportunities within the Invest to Grow area. And I've highlighted Flavors, we've highlighted Health, our Food & Culture Enzyme businesses. So there is, we think, significant profitable opportunities for very good growth, big categories. The categories are growing, very strong end markets. So we're excited about that, Chris. And then also, we will continue to take a very disciplined approach overall to areas where we do not think we are the best owners. And Glenn highlighted our divestiture strategy, we'll continue to do that as well. So all in all, we feel good about the portfolio. And like I said, we'll impact a lot more of that when we get to December.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: The margin compression in Scent was weaker from the first to the second quarter, that is weaker sequentially. That seems to be the one business where you've not had the same profit resiliency. Why is that? And for Glenn, your deferred tax line in your funds flow was an outflow of $178 million. And for the full year last year, it was an outflow of $236 million. What's going on with your taxes so that you have this cash outflow?\nGlenn Richter: Jeff, you want me to answer the first question or second question?\nFranklin Clyburn: You can go.\nGlenn Richter: Okay. Sorry. Okay. So your first question was relative to the Scent trend and --\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Market performance.\nGlenn Richter: The reality is that -- 2 things. One, there were some one-time expenses in the second quarter relative to Scents. Secondarily, as we mentioned, that there's been 2 rounds of inflation. So as we talked, it's a little more of a lag in that business from a standpoint. So if you think about the 2 rounds of impact that's basically coming through and there's a bit of delay.  And relative to taxes, there's lots of -- every year, Jeffrey, there's lots of ebbs and flows, depending on what's happening across various parts of the globe in terms of our tax positions and settlements. So everything is actually trending fine versus sort of our expectations at this point in time. There's nothing sort of abnormal from a year-over-year standpoint. But I do appreciate the question.\nOperator: And we take our...\nGlenn Richter: We can go to the next one.\nOperator: Okay. We'll take the final question from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America.\nMatthew DeYoe: If I were to look at the top line kind of just on a rough cut basis, what percent of your sales or businesses fall into the invest category versus maximize versus optimized?\nFranklin Clyburn: And thanks for that question. And that's something that at this time, we're not prepared to share the different cuts percentage-wise. What I would share is that we do have really good opportunities in the Invest to Grow category. And as I mentioned, we'll clearly unpack that a little bit more as we get into December and Investor Day, and really share the excitement we have around the portfolio as well as the opportunities. But right now, we're not prepared to share the specific percentages, okay?\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Frank Clyburn for any closing remarks.\nFranklin Clyburn: So I would like to just thank everyone for joining the call, and also thank all of our IFF colleagues once again around the world. We feel very proud of our first half business performance and results, and we know that the teams around the world continue to work with our customers to bring innovation and to help our customers to be successful in the marketplace.  And we look forward to seeing at our third quarter call as well as, once again, our Capital Markets Day on December 7, and hope everyone has a good rest of the morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, and this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Franklin Clyburn",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I dive into our first half results, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous progress we have made over the last 3 months. Under a challenging operating environment, our global teams continued to display their steadfast commitment to our customers and passion for innovative discoveries as IFF delivered profitable growth. Since joining IFF, I have consistently been impressed by the caliber of the work, innovation and expertise our people deliver as well as the creative culture that underpins our success.  I once again thank our teams around the world for their hard work. I will begin today's call with an update on our strategy refresh process and value creation opportunities we are focusing on for the near and long term, as well as IFF's recent accomplishments as we execute on our operational priorities. This includes delivering $70 million of cost savings in the first half of the year, taking swift and aggressive pricing action to cover inflation, exiting our Microbial Control business and ensuring that we have the right talent in the right roles. I will then turn the call over to Glenn to provide a detailed look at our second quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the rest of 2022. We will then open the call up for questions.  Beginning with Slide 6, I'd like to provide an update on our efforts to refresh our long-term strategic plan. While we are pleased that IFF holds strong positions across many of our business segments today, we are committed to evaluating and fine-tuning both our strategy and execution to best position the business for long-term profitable growth. I am pleased to share that we are making meaningful progress in moving quickly to map out an exciting and ambitious path forward.  In Q2, we continued to advance our enterprise-wide review of our business and portfolio to ensure we are well equipped to successfully navigate current and future market conditions while capturing long-term value. Our goal for this comprehensive evaluation is to further develop the refined operating plan to generate sustainable sales growth by ensuring lasting competitive differentiation through innovation, product superiority and provide a clear road map where we can execute our priorities to create significant value to all of our stakeholders.  Already, we have successfully completed the foundational phases of the plan. We have identified meaningful opportunities to capture additional profitable growth in attractive end markets, geographies and cross-platform synergies, while also identifying internal opportunities in near-term external pressures that must be navigated to achieve this. Now, we are working to finalize refreshed operating plans that we will align our operating model, talent and incentives as well as finalize our long-term financial targets and capital allocation strategy that prioritizes sustainable long-term growth. In addition, we are strengthening our culture, one that embodies collaboration and accountability to ensure strong execution of our commitments.  We will continue to move rapidly and with urgency over the coming months to finalize our refreshed strategy, and look forward to sharing more on this with you at our Capital Markets Day to be held Wednesday, December 7 in New York City.  Moving to Slide 7, I'd like to give a brief snapshot on where we are focusing as we advance our strategic refresh. There are 5 core areas of focus. First, we are prioritizing a more thoughtful and data-driven approach to our resource allocation strategy. Investment is essential to our future growth, but it is critical that our spending decisions optimize returns and reflect the unique roles that each of our businesses serve in our broader portfolio. I will explain this in more details in a moment. Similarly, we are also making strategic decisions to support our research and development efforts. By focusing on the highest return projects and identifying ways we can leverage our cross-platform offerings we will be even better positioned to accelerate top line growth and extend our industry leadership in key categories. Shortly, we will introduce an enhanced productivity program designed to help us improve profitability and unlock additional opportunities to finance our growth initiatives.  At the same time, we continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensure that our offerings closely align to the markets in which we operate, the evolving expectations of our customers and with our long-term objectives. We successfully completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business, and we will continue to assess the portfolio as we explore additional non-core divestitures to reduce debt and improve our capital structure.  Lastly, we are reviewing our operating model to ensure that our structure, talent and incentives to maximize our unmatched portfolio and go-to-market strategy with our customers. Attracting and supporting the industry's best talent and aligning incentives is critical to drive continued collaboration and accountability across the organization.  I am focused on making sure we have the right talent to execute our strategic plan, and I'm pleased that we recently announced Deb Borg, who will join us as our Chief Human Resource and Diversity and Inclusion Officer on August 29, 2022. With her deep experience connecting HR, culture, employee engagement and business as well as our change management expertise, she has the right skill set for IFF and our people as we strengthen our execution-driven culture. She brings an extensive track record of building world-class talent and helping the business execute and drive value for all stakeholders. Our success with these initiatives will be supported by our ongoing work to modernize our foundation on data and technology capabilities as we strengthen our internal operations to help ensure best-in-class execution.  On Slide 8, I would like to share a bit more about the deliberate choices we are making, specifically how a more strategic and disciplined approach to resource allocation will create exciting opportunities for profitable growth. Across the board, we are focused on driving margin improvements, but to do so effectively, we're pursuing differential management strategy across key areas.  Last quarter, I shared an ROIC chart, which was a first glimpse into the lens that we are viewing the company through. To move forward with this plan, we have developed a comprehensive playbook that segments our business into 3 distinct archetypes with unique strategic imperatives. When we look at our portfolio, we would consider whether to invest to grow, maximize to drive efficiencies or optimize to rapidly improve performance. Using this model, we remain intensely focused on achieving above-market growth, strengthening our competitive global position, increasing our return on invested capital and analyzing the most valuable use of our existing assets.  For example, in a category like Flavors, we see meaningful opportunities to drive above-market revenue growth, primarily through reinvesting in innovation and commercial initiatives. We are prioritizing above-market revenue expansion in this category as opposed to margin improvement alone as we're focusing on large, profitable and faster-growing subcategories like Beverages or Dairy to drive strong value creation. Here, it is more about reinvesting margin upside to ensure we are bringing the best innovation to our customers to drive dollar profit growth.  On the other hand, in a market like Animal Nutrition, we are focused on maintaining the consistent growth we've delivered, with an emphasis on driving further productivity. By identifying certain segments in which to reinvest while strategically reducing R&D expenses in others, we will focus on margin improvement and create opportunities to invest in the highest value offerings.  We are taking a stronger approach within our optimized businesses, for example, our pectin business, a popular clean-label natural stabilizer, to quickly drive near-term earnings through pricing and cost initiatives while maintaining our market competitiveness and reallocating upside to invest to growth categories like Flavors. I will also say, for those optimized businesses where we do not have a strong improvement plan, we will accelerate divestitures and exit the category, with work already well underway.  I am excited about this initiative and the progress we are seeing already. Make no mistake, we are running IFF quite differently in bringing enhanced rigor to our operations across every business and function. Earlier this year, we spent time reviewing our key priorities, including pricing and portfolio optimization.  Moving to Slide 9. I would now like to focus on the multi-year productivity and reinvestment program I mentioned earlier, which I believe is key to achieving our long-term growth expectations and our profitability goals. Since joining IFF, I have spent time analyzing our cost profile and believe, as an organization, we have a significant opportunity to optimize our cost structure. I am fully committed to unlocking this value and have asked the team to accelerate our efforts to ensure we are well positioned to execute as we move into the second half of the year.  For more details, I would like to ask Glenn to comment. Thank you, Glenn. As I said, we will provide more specifics on this program at our Investor Day in December, but wanted to share an early indication with you as we committed to provide more details on this topic during our Q1 earnings call. More importantly, at our Investor Day, we will also provide you with a clear and more detailed road map for growth, including our incremental revenue opportunities from our combination with N&B. We remain confident that we have significant opportunities ahead, confirmed by our initial commercial wins and positive customer feedback as well as our competitors following our lead.  I know that realization of these benefits have been slower than expected due to external factors, including COVID, supply chain disruption, customer bandwidth, pricing initiatives and constrained capacity. However, since joining, I have launched a focused initiative to reinforce our emphasis and address existing gaps.  Specifically, we are developing a set of prioritized opportunities, each with clear financial impact, owner and time line to provide confidence in our ability to deliver. This will be a significant focus for me going forward as I'm committed to delivering the value proposition of our combined portfolio and will be personally involved, dedicating significant time and engagement with the business to drive performance.  I am pleased to say that we continue to see steady wins across our portfolio. Recently, we co-collaborated with a leading alternative protein producer to improve commercial and technical collaboration, essentially upstreaming the incorporation of Heritage IFF flavors into Heritage N&B Protein-Based, exceeding our customers' expectation for plant-based burgers. This resulted in IFF being awarded as a core supplier, one of three, increasing our market share and enjoying a long-term relationship. In addition, we are seeing the value of integrated solutions between our Nourish and H&B divisions.  The Dairy category is showing very good collaboration opportunities, thanks in large part to early technical support and a better, together approach with customers. In this win, we were a step ahead of the competition due to early engagement with a dairy customer during culture development phase and showing the best flavor collaboration.  These are just 2 examples, but strong proof points that we are moving in the right direction and delivering a better value proposition to our customers.  Now turning to Slide 10, I'd like to provide an overview of our performance for the first half of the year. Our strong first half results are once again a testament to the strength of our portfolio and the dedication of our talented global teams who have continued to go above and beyond in a complex market. Despite the macroeconomic challenges of the last 6 months, sales grew by a strong 18% or 12% on a currency-neutral basis to $6.5 billion. Comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA grew 8% to $1.4 billion.  I am proud to report that we increased our quarterly dividend by approximately 3%, the 13th consecutive year of increased payouts to our shareholders, which underscores our belief in our business and IFF's strong future cash flow generation. We also continue to work on deleveraging objectives, where we remain committed to our deleverage target of reducing net debt to EBITDA to less than 3x 36 months post the transaction, which is February 1, 2024. At the same time, we prudently and proactively amended the covenants on our existing credit agreements given the market volatility and uncertainty. Glenn will discuss in more detail.  As I mentioned a bit earlier, we also completed the divestiture of our Microbial Control business on July 1 and continuing to evaluate additional divestiture opportunities for our non-core assets as we move ahead based on our category management approach I described earlier.  Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Glenn to provide a closer look into our second quarter financials. Thanks, Glenn. Before I wrap up today's call, I want to say I am proud of the efforts of our global teams as we continue to execute amid challenging market conditions. We've achieved strong performance in the first half of 2022 and increased our dividend for the 13th consecutive year. I am confident in our ability to achieve our full year financial targets as we continue executing against our operational priorities and control what we can control.  At the same time, we are committed to advancing our strategic transformation efforts, deploying innovation, refining our portfolio and strengthening our culture to deliver strong value creation for all of our stakeholders.  Moving through the second half of the year, we will be intensely and urgently focused on protecting and growing our business, identifying new strategic value creation opportunities, and communicating our refreshed operating model across the business and the market to position IFF for long-term success. I look forward to sharing more at our upcoming Capital Markets Day in early December.  I'd now like to open the call for any questions. Thank you. Mark, this is Frank. A couple of comments. I'll start with first, the productivity program that we've announced, we see that as really important not only near-term, Mark, but really building a continuing productivity mindset. We want that build into the company.  We also want to be able to use that to be able to invest in our growth opportunities. What we're trying to achieve, Mark, is really sustainable, profitable growth, and to start to really get leverage throughout the P&L. We think that's going to be really important for us from a profile perspective. This is why we've also done the ROIC work, Mark, on our portfolio, and we'll be able to share with you in December some of the specific targets from a financial perspective. Gunther, it's Frank. I'll get started. So first, with regards to revenue synergies, and as Glenn mentioned, we did see really good performance, especially within Flavors, within Nourish, and we're excited about the significant opportunity we believe we have there.  We also highlighted on the call some examples, Gunther, that we are really encouraged by some of the wins that we're seeing where we're utilizing our legacy N&B expertise, as well as legacy IFF expertise for vanilla flavor is an important win there. We highlighted an important win with regards to plant-based burgers. We're seeing good cross-selling opportunities. So overall, we're starting to see revenue synergies and we're hearing good positive feedback from our customers.  With that said, Gunther, there's work to be done, and I highlighted that on the prepared remarks. This is something that's going to be a significant area of focus for myself personally as well as the executive team. We're going to be leaning into how we bring our broader platform portfolio technology to our customers. So this is something we'll share a lot more about in our December Capital Markets Day.  Glenn, I don't know if you want to maybe touch on the inflation? David, it's Frank. Thanks for the question. A couple of thoughts. From the demand weakness perspective, the geography that we are seeing is probably no surprises. Really China, we had the lockdowns, and we did see an impact clearly in the second quarter. And just to recall, David, China is our second largest market, so that's been somewhat of a challenge for us.  And then if you think about our portfolio, on the positive side, as Glenn mentioned, we did see good growth in Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes, Flavors, Fine and Consumer Fragrance as well, so that's the positive. If you think about the resiliency of our portfolio, we feel overall cautiously optimistic. One would anticipate as pressures continue to , Fine Fragrances may be somewhat of a challenge.  As we think about the additional levers, and this is what we're really staring into. But if you listen to some of our prepared remarks, clearly, productivity is going to be continuously important for us, and that's something that we are spending a lot of time on as a team and thinking about levers there. Glenn has already spoken about our pricing and our working with customers to really do everything we can to recoup the inflation that we're seeing.  And then the other lever we have is really staying close to our customers, our global key account teams, our customer insight teams, really trying to be as quick and agile as possible. Working with our customers to make sure we have good connection with them to understand kind of what we're seeing in the marketplace. So those are all levers that we are focused on, but it's also why we feel good on our recommitment of our guidance. Both the top line at 9% to 12% growth range, and then also our EBITDA range of 48%. So that's why we feel comfortable and confident in reconfirming our guidance today. Yes. So on the resiliency, as I mentioned, we feel overall cautiously optimistic on the portfolio. Clearly, there's a lot of moving pieces right now. But if you think about Food and Beverage, you think about Health, you think about what we are seeing resiliency from our Pharma business, so we feel overall that the portfolio going into possibly some challenging times is really well positioned overall. And I've kind of highlighted that Fine Fragrances may be an area that we start to see some pullback from a demand perspective.  As far as the innovation question in our portfolio, there are some customers that are going to really focus on our core offerings, that they're going to maybe not think about new offerings at this point in time. However, we still are seeing very strong signals of customers wanting to innovate, co-develop and work with us, and we're really excited about our pipeline and portfolio. And my belief is that's still going to be critically important for the future. It's something that we'll spend time in December really sharing with you why we're excited about our pipeline portfolio, but that's going to be really key for us.  So yes, you'll see some customers focus in the near term maybe on core offerings. However, as we look out, we're still seeing signals from customers that are working with us on innovation. It's going to be really important to the future. Yes, Chris, just -- I mean, we'll spend some time in December around the portfolio, in particular. This is why we have really looked at our business through the ROIC lens that we've spoken about. And you can see the 3 categories that we highlighted, Invest to Grow and then also maintaining our business, and then some that we actually have to really improve or exit.  We're excited that we have significant opportunities within the Invest to Grow area. And I've highlighted Flavors, we've highlighted Health, our Food & Culture Enzyme businesses. So there is, we think, significant profitable opportunities for very good growth, big categories. The categories are growing, very strong end markets. So we're excited about that, Chris. And then also, we will continue to take a very disciplined approach overall to areas where we do not think we are the best owners. And Glenn highlighted our divestiture strategy, we'll continue to do that as well. So all in all, we feel good about the portfolio. And like I said, we'll impact a lot more of that when we get to December. You can go. And thanks for that question. And that's something that at this time, we're not prepared to share the different cuts percentage-wise. What I would share is that we do have really good opportunities in the Invest to Grow category. And as I mentioned, we'll clearly unpack that a little bit more as we get into December and Investor Day, and really share the excitement we have around the portfolio as well as the opportunities. But right now, we're not prepared to share the specific percentages, okay? So I would like to just thank everyone for joining the call, and also thank all of our IFF colleagues once again around the world. We feel very proud of our first half business performance and results, and we know that the teams around the world continue to work with our customers to bring innovation and to help our customers to be successful in the marketplace.  And we look forward to seeing at our third quarter call as well as, once again, our Capital Markets Day on December 7, and hope everyone has a good rest of the morning. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Accelerating our productivity and expense synergy efforts represents one of our top priorities, and is increasingly important in a more challenging economic environment in order to maximize financial performance. To this end, we want to provide additional transparency to our multi-year productivity program and the expected results.  First of all, let me describe the scope of our efforts. Overall, we have established 4 productivity efforts that cover approximately 85% of IFF's total cost structure, focused primarily on operations and overhead expenses. The 4 teams include supply chain, which includes our procurement and global logistics operations. Opportunities include driving additional efficiencies in direct and indirect material spending through enhanced procurement strategies and demand management, particularly for indirect spend and reduced logistics costs driven by improved global S&OP processes.  The second team is focused on end-to-end manufacturing operations and includes a broad-based set of initiatives, including accelerating our digital manufacturing efforts, driving yield improvements, system-wide best practices and energy savings programs.  The third initiative is our economic profit team that is focused on leveraging improved technology and disciplined processes to optimize product mix, rationalize SKUs and enhance make versus buy decisions.  And our fourth team is focused on building out our global shared service platform in with technology, to drive increased centralization and process standardization to drive efficiencies across our administrative and business support functions.  In total, the combined programs are targeting a preliminary net annualized P&L impact of $250 million to $300 million that we expect to be achieved between 2023 and 2025.  Two important notes. First, this $250 million to $300 million annual impact is net of reinvestments that are targeted to strengthen our innovation pipeline, expand our commercial efforts across key products, customers and regions, deepen our technology and digital capabilities and strengthen our talent. Secondly, the net savings will be slightly more skewed to 2024 and 2025. We look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day in December.  With that, I'll turn it back to Frank. Thanks again, Frank. Turning first to our consolidated second quarter results. IFF generated more than $3 billion in sales, representing 11% year-over-year increase on comparable currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Nourish and Pharma solutions. In terms of our growth contribution, pricing represented the majority, with volumes up modestly.  Our focus coming into 2022 was to fully recover inflation through pricing actions, and for the full year, we are on track to recover approximately $1 billion in cost inflation. We are doing so in a very thoughtful and strategic manner, over on lower margin and capacity-constrained businesses.  While foreign exchange rates have had an adverse impact on our sales and EBITDA in the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that adjusted operating EBITDA grew 3% year-over-year on a reported basis or 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis driven by productivity gains and pricing actions we implemented in the quarter. We also achieved solid year-over-year earnings per share growth of 3%, excluding amortization.  Before moving on, I wanted to share that during the second quarter of '22, we took an impairment charge of $120 million within certain entities in Russia due to a number of factors, including reduced business focus as we have restricted our operations to essential consumer products that include food, hygiene and medicine, supply chain issues, reduced product demand and exchange rate volatility, all as the result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It was determined that such declines in operating performance were not expected to reverse in the near future, and future expected growth is expected to be limited given the operating conditions in Russia. This non-cash impairment charge was allocated pro rata to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment within the asset group in the amount of approximately $92 million and $28 million, respectively.  Moving now to Slide 12, I'll provide a brief overview of the underlying performance across our business segments. As I mentioned, sales growth across each of our business segments, including Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scents and Pharma Solutions contribute to IFF's year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 11%.  Nourish was once again our largest growth driver, with a significant broad-based growth across our Flavors, Ingredients and Food Design businesses. Scent had another strong quarter, with currency-neutral sales growth in the high single digits led by Fine Fragrance, Consumer Fragrance and Ingredients. Health & Biosciences delivered mid-single-digit growth due to consistent performance in Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes and Animal Nutrition, as well as Microbial Control prior to the official divestiture completed in July. Both Home & Personal Care and Grain Processing were negative in the second quarter as each business had very strong double-digit comparison in the prior year period.  Lastly, we are pleased by Pharma Solutions continued rebound, having achieved double-digit growth driven by continued strength in our Industrial and Pharma businesses.  Turning to Slide 13, I'd like to provide a review of our profitability for the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $700 million, exceeding our expectations and representing 7% in year-over-year comparable currency-neutral growth driven by the pricing actions and productivity gains that I mentioned earlier. Our comparable adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 21.3%, and on an inflation-adjusted basis would have been approximately 220 basis higher or approximately 23.5%, if we normalize for the impact of pricing contribution to sales. This compares to an EBITDA margin of 22% in Q2 of 2021.  As a result of our strategic pricing actions, we have fully recovered total inflation cost to date, and we are optimistic that we will achieve full dollar cost recovery for the full fiscal year. As we continue navigating this uncertain market, we will continue to closely monitor raw materials and logistics costs in the quarters ahead and take appropriate action to offset additional inflationary pressures and maintain profitability.  On Slide 14 is an overview of our second quarter performance by business segment. Nourish, which delivered year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth of 15% and 18% growth in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, saw strong demand, particularly in Food Design and Flavors. In Health and Biosciences, high single-digit increases in Health and Cultures & Food Enzymes, and mid-single-digit growth in Animal Nutrition drove 4% comparable currency neutral sales growth for the division. While we implemented strategic pricing actions and saw notable productivity gains similar to Nourish this quarter, lower volumes and an unfavorable mix led to 2% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA.  In Scent, Fine Fragrances continue to lead the way with double-digit growth, followed by high single-digit growth in Ingredients and low single-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance. Collectively, Scent achieved year-over-year comparable currency neutral sales growth of 9%, though inflationary pressures outpaced our strategic pricing actions, which led to a 17% decrease in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Our teams are continuing to work with our customers to address these ongoing inflationary pressures, and we fully anticipate to recover all inflationary costs over time.  Lastly, Pharma Solutions was one of our strongest performers this quarter, achieving 10% in year-over-year comparable currency-neutral sales growth and an exceptional 25% increase in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, driven by double-digit growth in Industrial and high single-digit growth in Pharma. The division's profitability was further supported by pricing actions and productivity gains.  Turning to Slide 15, I would like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position for the first half results. In our first 6 months, our free cash flow position was impacted by higher inventory values. This was a result of a combination of continued inflationary pressures and rebuilding inventories to support customer service levels. million in the first half, representing approximately 3.6% of sales, as we continue to make necessary investments in our business. In addition, IFF delivered $402 million in dividends to our shareholders.  From a leverage perspective, we remain well positioned as we advance our strategic refresh. We finished the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $569 million while gross debt for the quarter totaled $12.15 billion. Note that we received the $1.3 billion gross proceeds from the sale of our Microbial Control business in July. At the end of Q2, we maintained a 4.4x net debt credit adjusted EBITDA ratio.  In addition, just last week, we proactively amended our existing term loan credit agreement and revolving credit agreement in order to ensure we maintain adequate flexibility to navigate near-term market uncertainties. The associated amendment fee was approximately $800,000. The amended agreements delayed certain step-downs from maximum permitted leverage ratio of 4.5:1, stepping down to 3.5:1 over time, with the first step down now occurring at the end of the third quarter 2023 versus the end of the fourth quarter 2022 previously. Trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.644 billion.  As Frank mentioned, on August 3, our Board of Directors authorized a 3% or $0.02 increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.81 per share of the company's common stock. The quarterly dividend is payable on October 5, 2022 to shareholders of record as of September 23. Including this authorization, we increased our quarterly dividend payment for the 13th consecutive year.  Let's now turn to our consolidated outlook on Slide 16. As we look to the remainder of 2022, we remain on track to deliver our commitments and are reconfirming full year guidance projected sales of $12.6 billion to $13 billion and currency-neutral sales growth of 9% to 12%. While we are reconfirming our outlook, we also are increasingly cautious on the overall market environment outlook as we navigate continued foreign exchange fluctuations, ongoing inflation and potentially recessionary pressures. We expect to achieve our sales targets through pricing actions as we press ahead toward full dollar cost recovery.  We expect foreign exchange pressures to impact sales by approximately 5 percentage points compared to our previously forecasted 4 percentage points. We are also reconfirming adjusted operating EBITDA to be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, which equates to currency-neutral operating EBITDA growth of 4% to 8%. Please note that we expect foreign exchange to impact that growth by approximately 6 percentage points versus 5 percentage points previously.  As always, we remain laser focused on mitigating the many macroeconomic challenges with an emphasis on controlling what we can control during these uncertain times, notably focusing on pricing execution and productivity.  In terms of the third quarter, we expect sales growth to be strong driven by pricing actions, with sales coming in modestly above $3 billion and impacted by incremental foreign exchange headwinds, some seasonality of our business and the divestiture of Microbial Control. The sale of Microbial Control will impact Q3 revenues by approximately $110 million. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $600 million to $610 million.  Before passing the call back to Frank, I want to revisit the 4 core business objectives we outlined at the beginning of the year. Overall, we are executing well against our operational priorities so far this year. Relative to maintaining strong sales momentum, we achieved 12% year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth for the first half of '22 and are targeting currency-neutral growth of 9% to 12% for the full year.  In terms of executing our broad-based pricing actions, we've fully recovered the total cost of inflation, and we remain on track to achieve a full dollar cost recovery for the full year '22. Importantly, we are closely monitoring inflationary trends in the broader market environment to ensure we are well equipped to stay ahead and, where necessary, quickly respond to future challenges.  On the productivity front, we continue to make tremendous progress towards our productivity savings goals for the full year. In the first half of the year, we delivered over $70 million operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies, well above our expectations. We are well on track to exceed our $100 million full year savings target.  Finally, relative to accelerating non-core divestitures, we successfully completed the sale of our Microbial Control business on July 1 and are continuing to assess our portfolio to identify additional portfolio optimization and divestiture opportunities in this uncertain market. These divestitures will help us delever our balance sheet and enable us to reinvest in our highest performing businesses.  With that, I'll pass the call back over to Frank. Heidi, this is Glenn. Thanks for the questions. Relative to sort of volume comparatives, I would sort of maybe answer it 3 ways. One is, as you're well aware, the comparatives are difficult given the apples to oranges sometimes comparisons of the business. But I would say that if you really kind of strip our business down and look at sort of the first half results, most of our core businesses actually are doing quite well. So Flavors, Scents are both mid-single digit in terms of volume growth. Core business units within H&B, Health is up high single digit. Cultures, Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition, mid-single digits. Pharma is up low single digits.  So the difference is, as we've discussed throughout the year, we're being very thoughtful regarding a balance between volume and profitability. So we've been very strategic and thoughtful relative to margin enhancement actions and focusing on those businesses that have both capacity constraints and/or are lower-margin businesses, so that's the difference. We're very specifically trying to focus on making sure we deliver good outcomes for our shareholders as well as our customers from performance.  And then lastly, I would note that this is very consistent with what we signaled. We've said very early in the year, we were planning basically the balance of the year to be relatively flattish to 1 point, and this is very consistent with the strategy and how we're implementing it.  Relative to kind of guidance, the reality is the pace in which sort of inflationary pressures flow through raw materials into our cost of goods, it does vary by business. So there's a little bit of a lag here in terms of how that's hitting quarter-to-quarter. That explains some of the overperformance in the quarter, third quarter relative to kind of the full year outlook. And consequently, because of that lag and just generally a perspective on cautionary outlook given the macro environment, we're being sort of realistic in terms of how we guide, and consequently, we're sticking to the same guidance.  So hopefully, that's helpful. Sure. Yes. Definitely Gunther. Relative to 2022, it's still choppy, but in general, no change to our outlook relative to the impact of inflation. Generally, energy has been slightly better. Logistics has been slightly better. Raw materials have been slightly worse in pockets. But generally, things are sort of stable.  I would also note that just the nature of the time it takes raw materials to go through inventory and show up in the P&L, any additional impact for the balance of the year is likely to be muted to 0 and really hit 2023.  We are taking a very deep look at '23. We've run through a preliminary scenario, we're doing an update in the coming weeks here as we plan for 2023. And our perspective at this point is we do anticipate another, I'll say, meaningful round of cost increase from inflation. That's going to be concentrated in our view more on raw materials. So there's a number of areas including soy, oils, obviously, certain commodity groups such as agricultural grains and those sort of things, we're seeing pretty significant inflation. Energy is choppy, but likely to also be some increase modestly in energy prices and logistics as well. We're likely to see some sort of modest increase as well. So kind of overall, we are expecting probably '23 not to the same degree as '22, but we are expecting additional inflationary pressures for next year. Yes. So good question, Mike. The sole impact is -- well, there's seasonality, as you know. So typically, in the first half of the year, first quarter, there's a build on working capital, namely inventories. Secondarily, there's the year-end of compensation that basically gets paid out, et cetera. We are running actually worse on cash flow than anticipated to the tune of about $200 million. That is 100% attributable to higher inventory levels that is principally related to basically higher costs.  So as you may recall, when we entered the year, we had our kind of Wave 1 inflation subsequent very early in the year. We identified another significant round of inflation coming through. That is rolling into inventory. So as a byproduct of that, we had guided to the full year that we'd be relatively flat to prior year from a free cash flow standpoint of about $1 billion-ish. We're sort of targeting to be probably about $200 million less than that at this point in time.  That being said, we are implementing a series of very important initiatives largely against the legacy N&B businesses. In terms of putting in new S&OP processes and enhancements, we're hopeful that those will drive some efficiencies, i.e., be able to bring some inventory levels. But I'd say best guess at this point is probably 800-ish versus the original $1 billion. Adam, thanks for the question. I'd say a couple of answers. One is just relative to this year, I'll say we're slightly ahead, i.e. price versus cost, back to the how things roll through inventory slightly behind the second half of the year. That's part of the reason for the -- how one thinks about the balance of the year implied guidance versus kind of the first half of the year. So that's a piece of it.  We -- normally, 18 months would be the full lag from inflation to capture. You can see that it's sort of manifesting itself differently by business. Scent is the one that's the furthest behind from a timing, given the nature of the relatively large customers and generally are indices tag to the contracts from the standpoint. And we would fully expect that to continue to be the case.  The only question mark here is how one thinks about '23. So as I just mentioned, my prior answer to Mike is that we probably are going to see another round of inflation come through. So from that standpoint, it may be 18 months from the first round, but we may have a continued set of rounds of inflation we need to catch up, which would suggest probably late '23 or even '24, if that's the case.  But to your last part of your question, obviously, we've all been in a very unprecedented environment relative to pricing, and that's required us to sort of rethink traditional contracts. And the way we've been rethinking them is, to some extent, just having realistic discussions with our customers on these -- level of inflation and having to share the burden. And then in addition, just rethinking contracts in terms of the frequency, so as opposed to annual, semi-annual or other type of sort of more open agreements relative to changes in the marketplace. So that's been a bigger factor of relative to the contracts we put in place, and I suspect it will prevail in the future as well as we think about '23. Yes. Good question, John. So relative to our outlook for divestitures, we still think the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion gross proceeds, 3 to 4 transactions completed by the end of next year is in the right ballpark. The market, as you're well aware, has slowed down, so the level of M&A activity is substantially less with the ball in the credit markets that has made it more difficult, particularly for private equity investors.  However, the size of our transactions, you can just do the simple math, aren't that large. They tend to be sort of nice strategic fits for other businesses. So from an initial dialogue standpoint, the interest level seems very good. So we think that things may be a little slower from a process standpoint, but we're still fairly confident that we will hit our target.  Relative to sort of broader global supplies or how one thinks about inventory over the longer cycle, about half of our growth, of our dollar growth of inventories is related to inflation this year, and about half is related to higher inventory levels. Those higher inventory levels, if you recall, would basically improve our customer service levels because we had low inventories, again, the legacy N&B businesses. I will say, though, I'm increasingly confident that through the implementation of improved S&OP processes across a number of our businesses, that will allow us actually to reduce some of those higher inventories.  The third thing you mentioned is really the global supply chain. Clearly, we, like everybody, have an extended supply chain, i.e., there's more products sitting on the water for longer times. There's more inventory buffer stock in our system, et cetera, that basically accommodate for the volatility of the market. We're actually thinking about what that means longer term in terms of working capital. And I suspect by the end of this year, we'll be able to sort of come back and provide some visibility on that. But I do think at the end of the day, that will be a meaningful improvement opportunity not just for ourselves, but for everyone as the supply chain gets back to order. Yes. And if I could maybe just add to that relative to the leverage question, Ghansham, is that as Frank indicated, as you're well aware, this business is highly resilient through cycles. So you may be down a couple percent, you may have some temporary transition quarter or 2 as customers sort of destock inventories, but in general, you don't see massive swings in terms of volume.  Secondarily, very importantly, we do believe that sort of the pricing resiliency and being able to continue to sustain passing inflation through, which is helpful.  Third, productivity, as we've mentioned, is sort of a major driver here to sort of offset some of the potential demand drop in the marketplace. And then in general, a slowdown probably helps other elements of working capital, such as inventory is more stable as well, and maybe even slower CapEx investments. So not only from a P&L standpoint, but from a cash flow, very resilient to sort of managing the cycle, particularly with the success in pricing and the focus on productivity. Yes, good question, Josh. It really is related to the sort of the matching of the build in inventories relative to the flow-throughs of sales. And as mentioned, we've sort of built inventories. And at this point, we think we're going to be fairly -- i.e., the raw materials have come through. Raw materials are generally sort of static from a cost standpoint. So we do expect them to sort of run through the next quarter or so, and we wouldn't expect to have this, I'll say, artificial pickup from a timing standpoint. Jeff, you want me to answer the first question or second question? Okay. Sorry. Okay. So your first question was relative to the Scent trend and -- The reality is that -- 2 things. One, there were some one-time expenses in the second quarter relative to Scents. Secondarily, as we mentioned, that there's been 2 rounds of inflation. So as we talked, it's a little more of a lag in that business from a standpoint. So if you think about the 2 rounds of impact that's basically coming through and there's a bit of delay.  And relative to taxes, there's lots of -- every year, Jeffrey, there's lots of ebbs and flows, depending on what's happening across various parts of the globe in terms of our tax positions and settlements. So everything is actually trending fine versus sort of our expectations at this point in time. There's nothing sort of abnormal from a year-over-year standpoint. But I do appreciate the question. We can go to the next one."

These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K filed on February 28, 2022 and in our press release, all of which are on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release that we issued yesterday. Please note that we will be using comparable results for the first quarter defined as three months of legacy IFF results, January through March and three months of legacy N&B results in both the 2021 and 2022 periods, these results also exclude the impact of divestitures and acquisitions. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you may have. With that, I would now like to introduce Frank.\nFrank Clyburn: Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to be speaking with you all and excited to share perspectives from my first 90 days as CEO of IFF. During today's call, I will discuss my initial thoughts since joining IFF and highlight our key operating priorities and commitments as a company for the full-year 2022. As I've spent the last 90 days meeting with IFF colleagues and key customers around the world, asking questions, listening and evaluating our business, it has become even more clear to me that IFF has built a very strong foundation with incredible opportunities ahead. Our business has built the robust diversified portfolio and driven team needed to continue leading our industry while delivering sustainable profitable growth. Simply put, I am thrilled to lead and work along such a passion team of more than 24,000 employees with a shared commitment to strengthening customer partnerships and driving differentiated innovations. Together, we will focus every day on the operational rigor and executional excellence required to deliver even greater value for our customers and shareholders. Before moving forward, I first must acknowledge the humanitarian tragedy facing the Ukrainian people since Russia's invasion began. As we have previously stated, IFF unequivocally stands with the people of Ukraine. Our top priority remains the safety of our team members and their families in Ukraine. And like many other global companies, we are working closely with local governments to offer assistance where possible. Aligned with our core values several weeks to ago, we limited production and supply of ingredients in into Russia to only those that meet the essential needs of people, including food, hygiene and medicine. Our plan at this time is to continue to supply to the best of our ability in accordance with sanctions, logistics availability and other key factors. Now I would like to begin by sharing some initial learnings and insights from my first 90 days with IFF. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a detailed look at our first quarter 2022 financial results before providing commentary on our current outlook for the full-year 2022. After that, we will open the call for Q&A. Starting on Slide 6, I'd like to reflect on what I've seen and heard from our global colleagues, customers, investors, suppliers, and members of our Board. As I noted in my introduction, IFF is incredibly well positioned from a portfolio perspective with an exceptional depth and breadth of product offerings and an unrivaled R&D platform that uniquely positions IFF to win with our customers. Our business is poised to benefit from sustained long-term tailwinds for profitable growth as we have demonstrated leadership in the most in demand consumer categories. We are the largest player in our industry with unmatched global scale, a strong innovation pipeline and a highly diverse and balanced business mix across categories, regions and customers to create significant value. Collectively, these are attractive characteristics and a strong foundation to build upon moving forward. Equally important, however, are the clear opportunities to improve our operating practices and ensure that we are achieving our financial commitments. This is one of my top priorities going forward, as I believe that consistent and consecutive delivery of course, within our control is critical to build trust and credibility as IFF\u2019s CEO. Specifically, we are working to cultivate a culture across our entire platform that motivates our teams and ensures accountability across the business. We are continuing to enhance our operational execution with a renewed focus on instilling greater rigor and excellence, aligning our compensation metrics to keep to KPIs that are measurable and strongly correlated to value creation. Please note that we are committed to investing in capacity, digital, R&D and commercial to capture incremental growth and productivity opportunities to ensure we deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. With all our initiatives, we are closely focused on consistently delivering on our short and long-term financial commitments and creating enhanced value for all stakeholders. Moving to Slide 7, I'd like to provide a bit more detail on the process underpinning our efforts to accelerate value creation across IFF. Our success starts with enhancing our corporate culture to ensure that IFF efforts worldwide are aligned with our vision of strategic excellence. It starts with establishing a renewed focus on winning while outlining the benefits for our team around the world. To guide our efforts, we are developing a deeper understanding of the sources and drivers of value across the business to help prioritize our investment of energy and resources moving forward. By understanding the facts, our extended leadership team will have the ability to make better business decisions, including investment allocations, which we expect will lead to greater financial returns. With that understanding, we will have better visibility into our strategic roadmap, essentially setting our profitable growth agenda for both the near and long-term as we dedicate strategic investments from the highest value opportunities. Underpinning everything we do will be a commitment to operational rigor and a culture of executional excellence across our platform. Our results in the first quarter are beginning to reflect this commitment to operating discipline, which will remain a top priority for our leadership team going forward. We plan on going into more depth on our strategy and financial outlook moving forward at an Investor event that we are planning on having in the second half of 2022. More details to come on that in due course. Turning now to Slide 8, I would like to start with a foundational look at our portfolio. Since my joining IFF in early February, our executive management team have begun a whole diagnostic of our strategies and business model to ensure we were operating to the best of our ability. As part of this process, we have thoroughly examined our business relative to the drivers of our current and future levels of profitability. To ensure we capture the full cost of doing business, we have gone beyond traditional operating costs to account for invested capital, such as CapEx, inventory and fixed assets. Through this return on invested capital loans, we have incorporated all costs to create a more robust fact base across our entire business portfolio to make better resource decisions. Based on the preliminary assessment, here's a snapshot of our sub businesses. As you can see, we have a significant amount of high return businesses, but also like most businesses, we identified opportunities where we can improve our performance. In high performing areas of the portfolio, we will reinvest with conviction to fuel strong profitable growth. We will also explore all avenues to more efficiently manage resources in our medium return business with a goal of maximizing our performance. And in areas of our portfolio where returns are not meeting our expectations for a below best-in-class benchmarks, we intend to either optimize our capital decisions to improve returns or evaluate appropriate opportunities to de-prioritize or exit the business. As we move forward, we are fully committed to maximizing our portfolio to deliver the most attractive returns in value creation opportunities. In fact, for 2022, we have adjusted our long-term incentive plan, replacing our net debt ratio with return on invested capital as a performance metrics to increase focus on capital efficiency. Now, before I dive into our first quarter results, I want to reemphasize that I am committed to the four key operating priorities we outlined earlier this year. Building upon the strong sales momentum, we established in 2021, we are first aiming to maintain volume growth consistent with overall industry growth rates. To achieve this, we are making significant investments to increase capacity, improving supply chain bottlenecks and driving greater revenue synergy opportunities. On revenue synergy, specifically, it is all about expanded revenue growth opportunities, and we feel good about the longer term prospects and the power of the portfolio. To highlight an example, we recently were awarded access in vanilla, a large opportunity with the global customer by leveraging heritage N&B's global technical know-how in ice cream, in heritage IFF's Vanilla sustainability program. IFF offered a combination of technical expertise and sustainability that competitors do not have. The result was not only strong potential revenue and flavors, but also incremental value creation for total IFF, including protein, emulsifiers and LBG. I am pleased to see in my early days the traction we are making and excited to dig in with the business to unlock more growth opportunities ahead. Turning to Slide 10, I'd like to provide an overview of our solid performance for the first quarter. Despite the macroeconomic challenges of today's environment, we achieved good sales profit and growth across our business. In the first quarter, IFF delivered $3.2 billion in sales, representing 31% growth or 13% growth on a comparable currency neutral basis. While inflation in global supply chain restrictions continue to impact our profitability margin, we achieved 9% growth in our comparable currency neutral EBITDA. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.69 for the first quarter. As I mentioned, we are evaluating and implementing specific initiatives to ensure we continue to navigate the future headwinds during the remainder of 2022 and beyond. As a result of increased working capital requirements, higher CapEx and seasonality, our free cash flow results were negatively impacted in the first quarter. Looking ahead, I can assure you this will be a significant focus area for the remainder of the year, and we expect strong improvements in the back half of the year. In terms of deleveraging the balance sheet, we remain on plan as our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. We also delivered meaningful synergies and productivity gains for more than $30 million in the quarter, including operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies. As mentioned, we continue to prioritize portfolio optimization and are making strong progress on the divestiture of the microbial control business. It should be noted that the anticipated closing of our microbial control business is now expected to happen on July 1 versus June 1, previously to provide more time to complete the separation work streams and minimize disruptions and risk to the microbial control business upon close. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn to provide a closer look into our first quarter financials.\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Frank. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Let's start on Slide 11 with sales performance of each of IFF's core businesses. Together, Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions achieved $3.2 billion in sales revenue in Q1, representing comparable currency neutral sales growth of 13%. Of note, all our sub-businesses posted year-over-year comparable currency neutral growth in the first quarter. Nourish delivered the most substantial growth with significant broad-based strengths in our flavors, ingredients and food design businesses. Health & Biosciences similarly achieved strong sales growth having managed headwinds in the Health business. The Scent division carried a strong momentum from last year through the first quarter with strong results in fine fragrance, consumer fragrance and ingredients. Lastly, Pharma Solutions also achieved currency neutral sales growth driven by the division's continued strength in its industrial business and resume demand for pharma. In terms of sales growth contribution, pricing increased approximately 8% and volume grew approximately 5%. Turning to Slide 12, let's walk through our profitability in the quarter. First quarter adjusted operating EBITDA totaled $702 million, representing 9% comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth versus the first quarter of 2021. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 21.8% and on an inflation adjusted basis, would have been approximately 175 basis points higher or approximately 23.5%. Margin did come in better than we expected in the first quarter through the stronger than anticipated volume growth, better cost management as well as the fact that a significant amount of our higher inflationary cost remains in inventories and did not impact the P&L to the degree originally anticipated. However, this is largely timing-related and will change as we progress throughout the year. Including our results is a charge of approximately $20 million related to expected credit loss on receivables from customers located in Russia and Ukraine. While the macroeconomic environment remains incredibly dynamic with continuing inflationary pressures at the moment, we are pleased with the actions taken by our teams to manage through these challenges. We took a very proactive approach and quickly instituted broad-based pricing actions across our portfolio in response to these pressures. Consequently, the actions we have taken have resulted in a full dollar cost recovery of total inflation costs in the first quarter. Unfortunately, since our February earnings call, we have seen additional increases in raw material, logistics and energy costs and are diligently working with our customers on incremental pricing actions. One important note to call out is that we are seeing the strong cost increases flowing to inventory, which due to our inventory days means that the higher cost will eventually impact the P&L as we progress through the balance of the year. Now on Slide 13, I would like to highlight the underlying dynamics and first quarter performance of each of our business segments. In the first quarter, Nourish's strong comparable currency neutral sales growth of 16% was led by double-digit growth in food designs and ingredients. The segment's comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth was also strong at 14%, primarily driven by the division's pricing actions, volume growth and productivity gains. In Health & Biosciences, double-digit growth in health, microbial control and grain processing and high single-digit growth in animal nutrition and cultures in food enzymes show comparable currency neutral sales growth of 10% for the first quarter. Similar to Nourish, the segment's comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 8% was led by pricing, volume growth and productivity that helped offset mixed challenges. In Scent, fine fragrance continued the strong rebound with double-digit growth and cosmetic active and fragrance ingredients continue to perform above expectations. As for consumer fragrance, the business experienced modest growth in the first quarter. Overall percent on 6% comparable currency neutral sales growth, comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 2% as inflationary pressures outpaced pricing for the quarter. As a reminder, in Scent, there is a delay in pricing recovery about 18 months before you fully recover inflation via price increases. Finally, in Pharma Solutions, we saw double-digit growth in both pharma and industrial to deliver 10% comparable currency neutral sales growth for the quarter. Volume growth and productivity gains help drive 10% comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Now on Slide 14, I would like to address our cash flow and leverage positions. In the first quarter, increased working capital requirements in part due to seasonality and in part due to increased values of inventory and accounts receivable driven by inflation as well as higher capital expenditures negatively impacted our cash flow results for the quarter. In the first quarter, CapEx totaled $132 million, representing approximately 4.1% sales. As a reminder, we anticipate our 2022 CapEx to be approximately 5% of sales due to 2021 CapEx carryover and increased investments in capacity expansion and key technologies, which will help support growth while also lowering logistics costs. From a leverage perspective, we are on plan and are continuing to make progress toward achieving our deleveraging target. Q1 ended net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. Gross debt for the quarter totaled $11.7 billion and we finished the first quarter with cash and cash equivalence of $662 million. Despite the global financial pressures, we remain on track to keep our deleveraging target of 3x or lower by year three post-close, which will be supported by our food preparation divesture, sale of our microbial control business and other non-core business divestitures. Slide 15 provides our revised business outlook for 2022. We are adjusting our expected full-year 2022 revenue up to $12.6 billion to $13 billion from $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion. This reflects the effects of additional anticipated pricing actions not incorporated in our original guidance, primarily due to the additional inflationary pressures. This revision also reflects the expected completion of our microbial controls divestiture on July 1, one month later than originally planned, and the acquisition of Health Wright Products completed in April. In addition, our outlook takes into account a weaker euro to dollar currency outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to expect adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion as we continue to target full cost recovery of additional inflationary pressures via price increases. On a comparable currency neutral basis, this translates into sales growth of approximately 9% to 12% versus 6% to 9% previously for the full-year and comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of approximately 4% to 8%, which is unchanged. It should be noted that while we have increased our sales expectations for the full-year due to incremental pricing, we have reduced our volume expectations given a more challenging environment, including loss revenues as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, continued global supply chain issues and anticipated softer consumer demand as a result of higher energy prices and general inflation negatively impacting consumer spending. One data point is that in early Q2, we have already seen volume soften and for the full-year, we are now targeting low single-digit volume growth and high single-digit pricing contributions. Also, based on current market foreign exchange rates, we expect that foreign exchange will negatively impact sales in 2022 by approximately 4 percentage points versus 2 percentage points previously and adjusted operating EBITDA grew by approximately 5 percentage points versus 4% previously. These changes now reflect current market exchange rates, particularly the euro, where we are assuming that it remains at 106 to the dollar for the balance of the year or a blended full-year rate of approximately 108 to the dollar. We are also confirming our 2022 CapEx spend will be approximately 5% of sales. In terms of the second quarter, we continue to believe that sales growth will be driven by price increases with volumes contributing much less they did in the first quarter. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we expect to be in the range of $640 million to $650 million pressured by unfavorable impacts of currency as well as higher inflationary costs flowing from inventories to the income statement. As I wrap up, I want to revisit the four key areas of focus we touched upon in February to update you on our progress. As a reminder, our four key priorities for 2022 are maintaining strong sales momentum, executing broad-based pricing actions, capturing synergy and productivity and accelerating our non-core business divestitures. Overall, we feel good about our progress across all four areas in Q1 and are confidence in our ability to deliver on these commitments this year. In terms of supporting strong sales momentum, we are increasing our capacity across constrained portions of our portfolio, enhancing our supply chain efficiencies most notably in our H&B, Pharma Solutions and Ingredients business, to ensure that we maintain our volume growth in line with or above the industry. Relative to executing broad-based pricing actions in an effort to react more quickly to today's evolving environment and better prepared for tomorrow's challenges, we have significantly enhanced our processes, implemented new pricing tools and established core pricing teams to oversee each of our business units. Our focus has been centered around minimizing the amount of time lost between inflation signals and customer pricing actions to ensure that we quickly adjust  to protect profitability. With these changes, we successfully implemented our first round of pricing actions and recover the total cost of inflation in Q1 2022. Given additional known inflationary pressures and a lot of uncertainty regarding the future path of inflation, this remains our highest priority. Accelerating our productivity expense synergy efforts also remains a key priority and increasingly important in a more challenging macroeconomic environment. To this end, we are able to deliver over $30 million of operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies in the first quarter above our expectations. As a result, we expect to exceed our original $100 million full-year cost reduction target, which is net of reinvestments. This higher level of productivity is helping offset lower full-year volume expectations. As we look to accelerate our long-term productivity opportunities, we have sharpened our focus on three large areas of productivity, procurement efficiencies, notably in indirect spend; end-to-end operations efficiencies, inclusive of digital enablement, yield and mix enhancements and logistics efficiencies and expanding the scale and efficiency of IFF\u2019s global shared service platform. Importantly, we will remain prudent in protecting key topline investments, including R&D, customer sales and service and technology. We plan on providing more details of these initiatives at our Q2 earnings call. Finally, we made further headway in accelerating our non-core divestitures. We are on track to successfully complete the sale of our Microbial Control business by July 1. We are also targeting additional portfolio optimization in non-core business divestiture opportunities to delever our balance sheet and invest greater resources toward our higher return businesses. We are making very good progress in early non-core business marketing efforts and have already received strong interest from prospective buyers. Should these transactions go through? We anticipate that they will in aggregate be accretive to our go forward growth rate and margin profile. With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Frank.\nFrank Clyburn: Thanks, Glenn. Turning now to Slide 16. As I look back on the last three months, I am proud of the work underway to ensure that IFF\u2019s next chapter is as brightest yet. Our solid results, including consistent volume growth across our portfolio reflects IFF\u2019s critical role in the consumer goods value chain, particularly amid such a challenging operating environment. While market volatility will inevitably continue to impact our industry, we will closely monitor developments, strengthen our financial discipline and fortify our portfolio to address ongoing pressures. With the strong foundation we established in the first quarter, I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year 2022 financial targets, improve value creation and further cement our key operating priorities. Having begun the process of our strategic refresh, I look forward to sharing additional updates on IFF\u2019s long-term strategic vision at an Investor Day in the second half of 2022. I know many of you have questions as it relates to my perspective on IFF\u2019s long-term financial targets. Given we are going through a robust review of our value creation opportunity via our strategy refresh, I ask that you give us time to appropriately assess our long-term financial objectives. I want to thank you very much for all of your support, and I know that the best is yet to come for IFF. With that, I would like to now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  And we'll take our first question from Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGunther Zechmann: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gunther Zechmann from Bernstein. The 3 percentage point increase in organic sales growth, Frank, to 9% to 12%, that's almost unprecedented, pretty brave move. Given your tenure as a company, in what businesses do you expect to see the biggest price increases? And in what businesses do you include demand reduction as part of your guidance? And then I've got a question 1b as well, but I'll pause there.\nFrank Clyburn: Sure. Gunther, I\u2019ll let Glenn maybe to give some specific color on the different business segments.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey, Gunther. Let me first sort of \u2013 by the way, good afternoon to you. I want to unpack the $300 million. So you know sort of the nature of that, and then we\u2019ll talk about sort of where it sits. So the $300 million change is a function of several items. First of all, we have some portfolio adjustments, so the acquisition of Health Wright and then one additional month of Microbial Controls, the value that's about $130 million of incremental revenue. That's completely offset with our foreign exchange update, i.e., the stronger euro or the stronger dollar relative to euro rather, basically offsets that completely from a revenue standpoint. The residual is we have incremental pricing of around $370 million, and that's all related to raw material increases, which I'll come back to. And as we mentioned on the call, we're actually bringing down volume balance of the year. For a full-year, down about a $100 million from our original plan, so a little over a half a point full-year. We actually were better in the first quarter by a point. So we're taking down the balance of the year down by a $100 million. Where we're seeing basically the impact of the price/volume, it pretty much mirrors where the cost increases are occurring. So we've had more material cost inflation in our Nourish business and other businesses. So that's why you see the higher growth rates in that business. But we are continuing to see the impact on all the businesses. So nobody sort of is exempt from the second round of this $300 million in terms of kind of overall pressure, but a bit more in Nourish than the other business because of the raw material impact.\nGunther Zechmann: Great. And thanks, Glenn. And then 1b) can you provide an update where you see cost inflation for IFF this year? And as far as you can for next year, I know you don't guide for 2023 yet, but if you can share how much earnings you expect to recover next year from costs that you incurred last or this year, please?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. It is a great question Gunther, and also something that we're working on now where we don't really have a stats in part because there's two tough parts of the equation. One is to understand the overlap of the latest round of raw materials into next year. So there's a carry forward, but then equally are basically the pricing dynamics. So as mentioned, we're having to go back in the market because incremental pricing. So there'll be a full-year effect of that as well. I would also remind the group that last year we were still in the whole i.e. the inflation exceeded pricing in 2021 by $200 million. So we're still planned to basically go after a full capture, unfortunately, with the latest addition of inflation, it's just going to take a little bit longer into 2023 to sort of get us back to whole.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. And Frank, welcome to the industry. Congrats on your new role. I guess, my question was more so on Slide 6, where you have the opportunity section, and the third one in terms of reinvesting in capacity and R&D and so on. Can you just expand on that? And if you could just sort of assess the technological capabilities within the company? The way you see it at this point, I know it's very early in your tenure at IFF. Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Ghansham, hi. It's Frank, and thanks for the welcome, and also for the question. A couple things I want to highlight is \u2013 and you look at that slide, I do want to start with the fact that, I am very still encouraged by the opportunity that we have in IFF. The industry trends look very strong overall in the long-term around sustainability, health and wellness and naturals. Also, IFF with this highly diversified business mix across categories, regions, and customers, I think positions us very well. When you look at that slide and we talk about the opportunities, I think a couple of things I would highlight there is one is we are focused on really doing everything around our culture of executional excellence, that's going to be really important for us through our talent, instilling accountability and also our strong link to incentives for our teams. As far as reinvesting, clearly, we are going to look at that. That's going to be a part of our strategy refresh process, and we'll be spending a lot of time on that in the second half of the year when we share our overall plans. But early view would be clearly, we need to continue to build our capabilities around digital, data analytics are going to be really important. And then also we'll invest in our commercial efforts as we see opportunities for continued profitable growth. And then we're also doing a deep dive in R&D portfolio, and we'll look at the best innovation in R&D opportunities to invest behind as well. But much more to come as we head to the second half of the year.\nGhansham Panjabi: Okay. Look forward to the Investor Day. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning, Frank. Thanks. Let me add my congratulations. You've been very vocal about taking pricing across a broad range of customers, and these are \u2013 it's not quite like gas prices, right? These are very sensitive industrial relationships where companies are intertwined. And you mentioned that in the script, how it takes time, but I wanted to ask specifically, when your customers do push back on pricing? What do they say? What are the common push backs you get? Or if somebody says no to pricing, what's the reason when that happens? And is that happening? Or are those kinds of things getting said now more often than January, as you know, some companies, maybe some of your customers are under a little bit more stress now than they were in January? Thanks.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Jonathan, thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll let Glenn to add on as well. One, I think the teams have done a really good job starting off this year and working with customers to try to recoup the significant inflationary pressures we're seeing in the business. So we have, I think a strong value proposition. We have strong commercial teams that are working very closely with their customers to really understand the importance of us recouping our inflation, what we're seeing from an inflationary perspective. So I do feel we're off to a very good start. There are push backs. I think some of the push backs are in some of the smaller customers, some of our emerging market customers where price is much more sensitive. We are seeing pushback there. But all in all we feel as though, we are in a good place and will continue to work closely with our customers to navigate, which is, as we all know, unprecedented times. Glenn, anything you'd add?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey. Thanks Jonathan for the question. I'd say, first of all, obviously we're not unique is every industry is experiencing substantial increases in inflation, and all of our competitors are out there basically taking prices up as well. And as you're well aware, as it relates to our value add from our customers supply chain, we tend to be a relatively sort of low cost high value add relative to their overall value change. And I would say, simply put, with 60% of our cost structure related to raw materials, energy and logistics, it's sort of impossible for us to absorb. Those level increases. And rather as our customers well appreciate, we are in business who really provide them superior solutions, which requires significant investment in innovation, customer service capabilities, building and maintaining a very robust global supply chain. I would remind everybody, we're adding $200 million at CapEx this year alone to build out. So that's the value we add to our customer. And as a result of that, we can't sort of, if you will speculate on material costs and our customers appreciate that. Frankly, where we sit relative to our value add, they completely appreciate what we're doing for them. And that's been reflected in the success of pricing. I will note though, there are some sectors, as we mentioned, Scent as an example, that there's a lag. So it's not every single customer is out front here in terms of the pricing, but in general, the level of productive dialogue has been very, very good with our customers.\nJonathan Feeney: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I guess, maybe to start, Glenn, what are you assuming for volumes throughout the rest of the year? Guidance would suggest flattish, I guess, 2Q through 4Q, you alluded to April trend softening, were they positive? Curious too if you've seen competitors pricing and  is just a more IFF impact. And then Frank, I appreciate the commentary, I'm still evaluating the business. I guess the question that we get most often is the 26% EBITDA margin target most seem to think that that's just unrealistic at this point. Maybe if you could talk a bit about that, that would be helpful for folks. Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Thanks, Mark. So I'll start off with our volume outlook. 5%  for the first quarter, we're actually projecting 1% for the balance of the year. So relatively flattish. I would remind everybody, we have a very strong overlap in the last three quarters. The three quarters of last year were on average around 10% in terms of currency neutral sales of which that was around 8% volume each of the quarters is a very strong one. That's why we actually planned the second half of the year more flattish versus the first half of the year. Why we've taken it down is basically taken the balance of the year down about a $100 million in revenue, that is basically split into two components. One is the direct impact on Russia and Ukraine volumes. And the second half is really a combination of supply chain and demand issues. So supply chain would include a combination of all material access as well as China, and then generally we just feel that we're seeing early signs relative to the consumer pulling back. We really don't view this as a \u2013 not being competitive on a pricing standpoint, but frankly, just what we're seeing in the consumer and it's manifested itself literally in the last couple weeks a little bit more in the home and personal care side of the business versus sort of the food and beverage or pharma side. So we're not sure, honestly, whether that's sort of an end consumer sort of permanent pullback or adjustment in inventories, but we're just, frankly, just being cautious relative to sort of what's going on in the global economy.\nFrank Clyburn: And hey, Mark. It\u2019s Frank. Thanks for the question. And as I mentioned in some of the early remarks, we are working through our strategy refresh process and that does include our long-term plan in detail and we're looking at our current inputs into our plan. We will need some additional time to appropriately assess our long-term financial targets. And my immediate focus, our management team's focus is delivering our 2022 objectives and the financial goals that we're outlining here this morning, as which of course, there's a lot of focus on pricing as you continue to hear productivity an important levers in working with our customers to grow our absolute sales and dollar profit as we manage through the significant inflationary period. Longer term, Mark, there's no doubt in my mind, we have a lot of value creation ahead of us in the company, and I believe our business will generate sustainable profitable growth and it will yield margin expansion over time. As far as your specific question on the 26% adjusted EBITDA target, I think it's really safe to say as we look at where we are today, and you look at how the world has changed, we're not going to be able to achieve that 26% adjusted EBITDA target in 2023. With that said, as I mentioned, I do want the time to come back and share with you in the back half of the year, our plans, and also our focus on driving really strong profitable growth for the future.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nHeidi Vesterinen: Good morning. Just to clarify on pricing again. So you're looking to fully offset the dollar headwind from inflation for the full-year, I think you said. Can you, once again, explain how you hope to achieve this because it's normal industry practice for certain parts of your portfolio, like Scent to have a lag. So is there another segment of setting that lag for this full-year? Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Well, we actually are lagging, Heidi. As a reminder, we're $200 million behind from last year. So we're sort of catching up from last year and capturing a large \u2013 the largest percentage this year, but there's still a lag that will be going into 2023 as well.\nHeidi Vesterinen: Okay. But on a full-year 2022 basis, I think you had said you're looking to fully offset, right? So you won't have a squeeze from raw materials?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Now let me be clear. We have $200 million from last year from 2021 that we didn't capture, we began to implement. So if you look at the cumulative 2021, which is really the second half of 2021 in all this year, we're still $200 million behind.\nHeidi Vesterinen: Okay. And then the idea is to pass that on as we go into next year. Okay. Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Thank you, Heidi.\nOperator: We will go next to John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks. Welcome, Frank. Just one question. You've got one of the largest R&D budgets in the industry and the major drug hands are known for best in class R&D management here. But we don't get an innovation or vitality index. We don't get any stage-gate processing reported hard to know how productive R&D is or what the right level of spend is here. If you had a chance to kind of go through the processes within R&D and the Center of Excellence \u2013 and so forth, do you think there are changes that need to be made there?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Thanks John, for the question. I'll just sum it up in a couple of quick points and based on my experience, one, I have been very encouraged by some of the recent visits I've taken to our R&D centers. I just got back from Palo Alto, California, and really good innovation taking place. Some of the work we're doing in with regards to our enzymes, with regards to some of our Scent and sustainable delivery systems, flavor technology. So I'm encouraged early on of what I'm seeing. I think what I would highlight is from an R&D perspective, there's three things that come to mind. One is making sure you have the best talent, and that's a major focus for us in allowing our scientists to innovate. Number two is we have a process and model where you have very close connection with your commercial teams. So your arm in arm, your scientists and your commercial teams are really working on innovations that are going to be meaningful from a customer and consumer perspective. And that's a major focus that we're putting in place. And then number three is doing it in an efficient way and putting our capital against the biggest R&D opportunities. So early on, encouraging, this is going to be a focus for us, and this also will be a part of our second half Investor Day where we'll come back and share more about some of the exciting projects we're working on in our pipeline.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatthew DeYoe: Good morning, everyone. Frank, one of the criticisms we often here about IFF is the senior management churn has been pretty elevated following the N&B acquisition and that perhaps the broader leadership team is relatively inexperienced. How do you plan to address this as the new CEO when you think about the team that's around you?\nFrank Clyburn: So Matt, that's an important question. And what I would say is that we have to do everything that we can as a management team to really build, as I've been saying, the right culture, the right focus for the organization. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us with IFF, but we do need to deliver and we do need to focus on executional excellence. Yes, there has been some change in the management ranks. That is something that obviously we all take seriously, but our focus right now is with the team that we have in place is really to be laser focused on delivering and working on behalf of our customers to create value in the marketplace. So that's really the focus and I am excited about the passion and the energy I see from so many IFFer\u2019s around the world, I've had a chance to engage with a lot of them. And I think we're really in a good place as long as we can focus on the \u2013 through four priorities that Glenn mentioned earlier. I do feel good about our opportunity as we work through 2022 and then as we start to build the company for the future.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sison: Hey, good morning. Welcome Frank. I guess, your background has a lot of integration. And so I'm kind of thinking when you think about the DuPont acquisition, N&B and putting the company together, it does seem like the initial outlook for 2023 or the sort of initial goals are going to \u2013 a little bit off. So when you think about how we should measure, if this will be inevitably a successful deal together, what do you think we need to look for? And I know a lot of this will probably come in your Analyst Day, second half. I'm certain, you're looking at Cleveland as a possible site, and I\u2019m joking. But what should we think about as the metric or couple of metrics that. And at the end of the day would suggest this has been a really good deal over time.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Mike, and I think you recognized as where we started, we also are in some unprecedented times from inflationary perspective. And also what's happening with regards to China and COVID lockdowns, and what's happening with the war and impossible recessionary pressure. So clearly, the world is changing significantly. Mike, the way I would say, is that we will spend time, like you said, in the second part of this year, but really look at our focus. And I keep using this phrase about driving sustainable, profitable growth. We want to have a company that's growing top-tier within our peer set. And from a topline perspective, good strong leverage throughout the company, a relentless focus on constant improving of productivity and making sure we're doing everything that we can to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. So I think that will be some of the metrics and we'll come back obviously, as we get to the second half and give you specific metrics, but that's how I would have you think about it. Glenn, I don't know if you want to add\u2026\nGlenn Richter: Hey, Mike. I would just add. By the way, I lived in Cleveland, I'm not sure I'm allowed to come back though. But really at the end of the day, we are trying to deliver a superior outcome for our shareholders. And the way to do that as Frank had mentioned is to make sure we outpace the topline versus the industry. So having superior topline growth and secondarily superior return on invested capital, the way we view doing that is actually driving significant productivity, which we believe there is, and allowing that to basically reinvest back and help accelerate the topline and to continue to actually drive some of that to the bottom line while we're optimizing our portfolio. So to Frank's point, that will be sort of the major agenda when we get together later in the year, maybe in Cleveland.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. And Mike, just one last one, and I did mention that ROIC is now a part of our metrics as a team. So that's something that we've incorporated.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nLisa De Neve: Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I have two. First one is, can you talk a little bit on how the growth has been evolving in the first quarter through the different regions and how you expect volume growth to develop over the coming quarters or through the year? So the plus and minuses would be very helpful. And secondly, can you share a little bit what you're seeing in your innovation pipeline, in what segments are you seeing stronger levels of innovation. And also, do you see sort of any levels of reformulation activity? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Good morning, Lisa. So relative to the first quarter and balance of the year relative to region, our strongest areas have been the developed markets. So combination of Europe and North America, laggards has really been actually Greater Asia has slower growth in the first quarter. We expect, as we look at the balance of the year, we need to have a little bit challenges in Greater Asia, particularly China, as we mentioned, likely also to see a slowdown \u2013 meaningful slowdown in Europe, given the \u2013 what's happening from the economy standpoint, but are still sort of fairly optimistic on combination of North America and LATAM as well.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. And just real quickly, we're doing a lot of R&D work in Health and Biosciences area with regards to our enzymes and focusing on probiotics and also, laundry dish programs with global key accounts. We have work in some of our plant-based protein and dairy alternatives, couple of other quick ones to highlight in the scent area, some of the renewable and biodegradable fragrance ingredients were also really focusing, in nourish around a lot of our flavor technologies. And I highlighted one of the big wins that we had with vanilla recently with one of our customers. So we'll spend a lot more time here on the pipeline and portfolio, as I mentioned, coming up in the second half of the year.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning, and Frank, congratulations as well on the new role. Frank, building off your early view of the company, do you think IFF does a good job capturing the full value of this products with the customers? And secondarily, what do you think the IFF does better than competitors and where do you think it is lacking versus competitors? Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Very good questions. I think when you say, what do we do better, then I'll start there. I do think our global scale, the diversity of our and breadth of our portfolio and how we engage with our customers. I think we are leading in many categories and in many areas, and that's something that we will continue to leverage. And it also allows for us to work quickly with customers to co-create solutions with them. So that to me is a big strength of ours. What does some of the competitors do? There are competitors that are focused in certain areas that I do think have done a nice job from a pricing perspective or have in certain categories a little bit better margin construct than we do. And that's really why we're staring into our portfolio to make sure that we put our resources against the best opportunities and where we see those opportunities we're going to invest and then where we see opportunities to improve, we'll focus there. And then in some areas we will pull back investment or possibly even divest if we need to. So those are going to be some things that we're going to be looking at to make sure that we continue to build the strength around our portfolio, but those were some initial thoughts on how I think we are lining up with our customers and then how we compare to some of our competitors.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was curious that you touched earlier on pricing and how quickly you move during the first quarter? And Glenn, in your comments, you more or less referred to the press release that IFF put out discussing its kind of new approach to pricing. I mean, from where I said it feels like that's the first moment of the company now with this much greater scale, really taking on the role of industry leader. And I was curious what, if anything, you've seen in the competitive landscape, how others are now approaching pricing, if the industry as a whole is moving faster. I know it's been a short period of time, but it's an interesting question in the sense of IFF role again as industry leader? Thanks to this newfound scale. Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Thanks for the question. We actually, as you recall, in the fourth quarter, signaled pretty quickly given we saw this large tsunami of inflation and went out very quickly, in the fourth quarter of the first round that press release was really in advance of the second round. And all our competitors are seeing exactly the same, inflationary pressures as well. So I think, that was intended really to help our teams relative to the customer dialogue, sort of understand the dynamics and the impact on the business. Hence the purpose of the press releases, I did mention all our competitors as you're well aware are basically in the market doing the same thing and are passing along prices and time as well. We just moved fast even we saw in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned on the call, we really also invested in, I'll say in infrastructure around the organization to make sure we're more closely monitoring what's happening in the market and just moving much, much, much quicker because I think we are concerned that this \u2013 even the second round may be the second of others. So we just want to be prepared to do that. And that answer was the purpose of that, that press release.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Originally, when you bought the DuPont business, the idea was to take out $300 million in costs and to spend about $335 million to do it. And to date, I think IFF has spent $32 million, so it seems that the original cost reduction program is moving more slowly. Is that fair? That is why aren't the charge is larger? And secondly, on Slide 8, where you lay out your return on invested capital distribution. It looks like about a third of the company has unsatisfactory returns. What conclusion do you draw from that? Does that mean that you really need to overhaul the structure of the company dramatically or do you draw a different conclusion from that?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Let me \u2013 maybe I'll take the second one and come back to the first one. Your conclusion is correct in terms of the third \u2013 hardly one third of our business from a capital utilization standpoint needs to improve. And there are two major levers. So not surprisingly as it relates to some of our non-core divestiture work by the fall within that basket, if you will. So continue to optimize the portfolio as one lever. The second is really thinking about ultimately a combination of capital investment in those businesses and in addition, how we think about optimizing the profitability. So as part of the Frank's comments about the refresh strategy, we are thinking about the portfolio in that way. And by the way, that's also in the spirit of taking some of those dollars and moving them up to the far left of that chart and accelerating the growth dynamics of the higher return segments as well. Relative to our cost savings, as a reminder, we get roughly $300 million targeted for synergies, about half of those were procurement. So it's not surprising that you would have little to no integration-related expenses for those. Those pieces honestly are, as we've mentioned in the past, we are the farthest behind simply because of this environment. It's harder to materialize. The other half of the 150, we're sort of midway through in terms of capture. To your broader point about how we think about restructuring opportunities, we've moved beyond a discussion of just synergies, deal-related synergies was too narrow and we really are focusing more broadly on productivity. As I mentioned, there are three large buckets operations, procurement and then shared services. The first two of those are likely to have relatively low one-time costs because they're really optimizing operations, digital throughput, some fixed cost reduction, indirect material purchases. The latter being shared service probably will have some one-time restructuring charges as we build out our current infrastructure and continue to add capabilities into that network.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Spector: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just a couple follow-ups on the price rise dynamics. So just curious now what's your length of visibility on the raw material front? So how far ahead are you seeing today? And as you look at your pricing guide for the year, I guess, are you pricing your second round increase is that to capture the visibility that you see now? Or are you pricing ahead of that and does your guide imply a low double-digit price exit rate for the year at this point? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Generally, we're looking out to the third or fourth quarter for the raw materials. Energy is more problematic as well as logistics that tends to sort of \u2013 it's really kind of here and now if you will, in terms of kind of what's happening in the marketplace, we've done best estimates based on sort of where the markets are trading relative to energy as well as logistics costs. But generally the raw materials are sort of about six months out. But some of them have been \u2013 a lot of them have been locked in, some of them not. So we are continuing \u2013 by the way, we're continuing to monitor every single week. We sort of have an update on how we're feeling about the market in general over the last sort of month, six weeks, there's been some ebbing and flowing so slightly higher in energy, some relief in raw materials, but it hasn't materially been different than that 350-ish number that I provided you to earlier. So relative to sort of the carryover for next year, we still have to sort of work that through. As I mentioned, it's a combination of, what the tail of this year's annualized raw materials and then very importantly, we got to figure out as well as the tail of the pricing actions in the next year as well?\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you. Frank, now that you've had just a couple weeks to evaluate the portfolio, you just name kind of the two to three sub businesses that you're the most excited about. I mean, in your remarks, you've mentioned, probiotics and proteins, just coming from your background, what's getting you the most excited on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Sure. I'll be quick because I know, we've got a couple more that we\u2019re waiting on as well, but just to give you an example, enzymes, I think are areas that I'm excited about. And we're going to deploy resources to drive growth and really mix improvement there over time. There's also, I think some really solid areas such as fabric care, we think there's opportunities to improve our cash flow there. And then, we will continue to look at some of the underperforming areas as well. And I think this is something and Glenn highlighted on our four priorities, which is why we have made the decision to exit for instance, our Microbial Control business and we've announced that divestitures. So those are some examples and like I said, we'll spend much more time opening up and sharing a lot more as we get to the back half of the year.\nOperator: And we will go next to Andrew Keches with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Keches: Yes. Hi, good morning. Glenn, perhaps a question for you. If you take a step back and look at the balance sheet where a little more than a year into the N&B transaction and leverages essentially where it was at closing. And I think I heard you said you're dropping the balance sheet metric from executive compensation. So I guess I just want to understand your confidence and the ability to hit that 3.0x mark by the beginning of 2024, how critical are these divestitures that you're talking about? And is it right to think that maybe the scope for divestitures can expand particularly as we lap that two year IRS anniversary for N&B?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. So just a clarification, the reason we dropped the balance sheet metric is because we launched the new three-year plan. So to some extent, this is the window beyond sort of our deleverage. So I am very, very confident that we will hit three less. We will be closing on the Microbial Controls business at the end of this quarter, that's going to be net proceeds of $1.1 billion. As I mentioned in the past, we have three to four additional deals that will cumulatively add $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of gross. They're proceeding nicely, by the way, despite the sort of volatility in the market, they are attractive property strategically. That alone will basically get us to the goal independent of cash flow. To the last point of your question, we're going to continue obviously to take a look at the portfolio, that's part of the strategy refresh, which will probably afford additional opportunities to continue to approving the portfolio, but nothing to announce at this point and nor do we need that to accomplish that goal. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Frank Clyburn for any closing remarks.\nFrank Clyburn: So thank you to all for joining our call. I really appreciate your interests and the time we spent this morning discussing our first quarter results. And hopefully you could hear from myself, Glenn and on behalf of all of IFF, we're really encouraged and excited about the future. And we look forward to sharing more about our plans as we head to the second half of this year and also want to reiterate just how focused we are on a company, making sure we're executing and working with our customers to deliver important solutions for consumers around the world. So thank you and we look forward to speaking to you soon.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Clyburn",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to be speaking with you all and excited to share perspectives from my first 90 days as CEO of IFF. During today's call, I will discuss my initial thoughts since joining IFF and highlight our key operating priorities and commitments as a company for the full-year 2022. As I've spent the last 90 days meeting with IFF colleagues and key customers around the world, asking questions, listening and evaluating our business, it has become even more clear to me that IFF has built a very strong foundation with incredible opportunities ahead. Our business has built the robust diversified portfolio and driven team needed to continue leading our industry while delivering sustainable profitable growth. Simply put, I am thrilled to lead and work along such a passion team of more than 24,000 employees with a shared commitment to strengthening customer partnerships and driving differentiated innovations. Together, we will focus every day on the operational rigor and executional excellence required to deliver even greater value for our customers and shareholders. Before moving forward, I first must acknowledge the humanitarian tragedy facing the Ukrainian people since Russia's invasion began. As we have previously stated, IFF unequivocally stands with the people of Ukraine. Our top priority remains the safety of our team members and their families in Ukraine. And like many other global companies, we are working closely with local governments to offer assistance where possible. Aligned with our core values several weeks to ago, we limited production and supply of ingredients in into Russia to only those that meet the essential needs of people, including food, hygiene and medicine. Our plan at this time is to continue to supply to the best of our ability in accordance with sanctions, logistics availability and other key factors. Now I would like to begin by sharing some initial learnings and insights from my first 90 days with IFF. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a detailed look at our first quarter 2022 financial results before providing commentary on our current outlook for the full-year 2022. After that, we will open the call for Q&A. Starting on Slide 6, I'd like to reflect on what I've seen and heard from our global colleagues, customers, investors, suppliers, and members of our Board. As I noted in my introduction, IFF is incredibly well positioned from a portfolio perspective with an exceptional depth and breadth of product offerings and an unrivaled R&D platform that uniquely positions IFF to win with our customers. Our business is poised to benefit from sustained long-term tailwinds for profitable growth as we have demonstrated leadership in the most in demand consumer categories. We are the largest player in our industry with unmatched global scale, a strong innovation pipeline and a highly diverse and balanced business mix across categories, regions and customers to create significant value. Collectively, these are attractive characteristics and a strong foundation to build upon moving forward. Equally important, however, are the clear opportunities to improve our operating practices and ensure that we are achieving our financial commitments. This is one of my top priorities going forward, as I believe that consistent and consecutive delivery of course, within our control is critical to build trust and credibility as IFF's CEO. Specifically, we are working to cultivate a culture across our entire platform that motivates our teams and ensures accountability across the business. We are continuing to enhance our operational execution with a renewed focus on instilling greater rigor and excellence, aligning our compensation metrics to keep to KPIs that are measurable and strongly correlated to value creation. Please note that we are committed to investing in capacity, digital, R&D and commercial to capture incremental growth and productivity opportunities to ensure we deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. With all our initiatives, we are closely focused on consistently delivering on our short and long-term financial commitments and creating enhanced value for all stakeholders. Moving to Slide 7, I'd like to provide a bit more detail on the process underpinning our efforts to accelerate value creation across IFF. Our success starts with enhancing our corporate culture to ensure that IFF efforts worldwide are aligned with our vision of strategic excellence. It starts with establishing a renewed focus on winning while outlining the benefits for our team around the world. To guide our efforts, we are developing a deeper understanding of the sources and drivers of value across the business to help prioritize our investment of energy and resources moving forward. By understanding the facts, our extended leadership team will have the ability to make better business decisions, including investment allocations, which we expect will lead to greater financial returns. With that understanding, we will have better visibility into our strategic roadmap, essentially setting our profitable growth agenda for both the near and long-term as we dedicate strategic investments from the highest value opportunities. Underpinning everything we do will be a commitment to operational rigor and a culture of executional excellence across our platform. Our results in the first quarter are beginning to reflect this commitment to operating discipline, which will remain a top priority for our leadership team going forward. We plan on going into more depth on our strategy and financial outlook moving forward at an Investor event that we are planning on having in the second half of 2022. More details to come on that in due course. Turning now to Slide 8, I would like to start with a foundational look at our portfolio. Since my joining IFF in early February, our executive management team have begun a whole diagnostic of our strategies and business model to ensure we were operating to the best of our ability. As part of this process, we have thoroughly examined our business relative to the drivers of our current and future levels of profitability. To ensure we capture the full cost of doing business, we have gone beyond traditional operating costs to account for invested capital, such as CapEx, inventory and fixed assets. Through this return on invested capital loans, we have incorporated all costs to create a more robust fact base across our entire business portfolio to make better resource decisions. Based on the preliminary assessment, here's a snapshot of our sub businesses. As you can see, we have a significant amount of high return businesses, but also like most businesses, we identified opportunities where we can improve our performance. In high performing areas of the portfolio, we will reinvest with conviction to fuel strong profitable growth. We will also explore all avenues to more efficiently manage resources in our medium return business with a goal of maximizing our performance. And in areas of our portfolio where returns are not meeting our expectations for a below best-in-class benchmarks, we intend to either optimize our capital decisions to improve returns or evaluate appropriate opportunities to de-prioritize or exit the business. As we move forward, we are fully committed to maximizing our portfolio to deliver the most attractive returns in value creation opportunities. In fact, for 2022, we have adjusted our long-term incentive plan, replacing our net debt ratio with return on invested capital as a performance metrics to increase focus on capital efficiency. Now, before I dive into our first quarter results, I want to reemphasize that I am committed to the four key operating priorities we outlined earlier this year. Building upon the strong sales momentum, we established in 2021, we are first aiming to maintain volume growth consistent with overall industry growth rates. To achieve this, we are making significant investments to increase capacity, improving supply chain bottlenecks and driving greater revenue synergy opportunities. On revenue synergy, specifically, it is all about expanded revenue growth opportunities, and we feel good about the longer term prospects and the power of the portfolio. To highlight an example, we recently were awarded access in vanilla, a large opportunity with the global customer by leveraging heritage N&B's global technical know-how in ice cream, in heritage IFF's Vanilla sustainability program. IFF offered a combination of technical expertise and sustainability that competitors do not have. The result was not only strong potential revenue and flavors, but also incremental value creation for total IFF, including protein, emulsifiers and LBG. I am pleased to see in my early days the traction we are making and excited to dig in with the business to unlock more growth opportunities ahead. Turning to Slide 10, I'd like to provide an overview of our solid performance for the first quarter. Despite the macroeconomic challenges of today's environment, we achieved good sales profit and growth across our business. In the first quarter, IFF delivered $3.2 billion in sales, representing 31% growth or 13% growth on a comparable currency neutral basis. While inflation in global supply chain restrictions continue to impact our profitability margin, we achieved 9% growth in our comparable currency neutral EBITDA. We also achieved strong adjusted earnings per share, excluding amortization of $1.69 for the first quarter. As I mentioned, we are evaluating and implementing specific initiatives to ensure we continue to navigate the future headwinds during the remainder of 2022 and beyond. As a result of increased working capital requirements, higher CapEx and seasonality, our free cash flow results were negatively impacted in the first quarter. Looking ahead, I can assure you this will be a significant focus area for the remainder of the year, and we expect strong improvements in the back half of the year. In terms of deleveraging the balance sheet, we remain on plan as our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. We also delivered meaningful synergies and productivity gains for more than $30 million in the quarter, including operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies. As mentioned, we continue to prioritize portfolio optimization and are making strong progress on the divestiture of the microbial control business. It should be noted that the anticipated closing of our microbial control business is now expected to happen on July 1 versus June 1, previously to provide more time to complete the separation work streams and minimize disruptions and risk to the microbial control business upon close. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn to provide a closer look into our first quarter financials. Thanks, Glenn. Turning now to Slide 16. As I look back on the last three months, I am proud of the work underway to ensure that IFF's next chapter is as brightest yet. Our solid results, including consistent volume growth across our portfolio reflects IFF's critical role in the consumer goods value chain, particularly amid such a challenging operating environment. While market volatility will inevitably continue to impact our industry, we will closely monitor developments, strengthen our financial discipline and fortify our portfolio to address ongoing pressures. With the strong foundation we established in the first quarter, I remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year 2022 financial targets, improve value creation and further cement our key operating priorities. Having begun the process of our strategic refresh, I look forward to sharing additional updates on IFF's long-term strategic vision at an Investor Day in the second half of 2022. I know many of you have questions as it relates to my perspective on IFF's long-term financial targets. Given we are going through a robust review of our value creation opportunity via our strategy refresh, I ask that you give us time to appropriately assess our long-term financial objectives. I want to thank you very much for all of your support, and I know that the best is yet to come for IFF. With that, I would like to now open the call for questions. Sure. Gunther, I'll let Glenn maybe to give some specific color on the different business segments. Yes. Ghansham, hi. It's Frank, and thanks for the welcome, and also for the question. A couple things I want to highlight is \u2013 and you look at that slide, I do want to start with the fact that, I am very still encouraged by the opportunity that we have in IFF. The industry trends look very strong overall in the long-term around sustainability, health and wellness and naturals. Also, IFF with this highly diversified business mix across categories, regions, and customers, I think positions us very well. When you look at that slide and we talk about the opportunities, I think a couple of things I would highlight there is one is we are focused on really doing everything around our culture of executional excellence, that's going to be really important for us through our talent, instilling accountability and also our strong link to incentives for our teams. As far as reinvesting, clearly, we are going to look at that. That's going to be a part of our strategy refresh process, and we'll be spending a lot of time on that in the second half of the year when we share our overall plans. But early view would be clearly, we need to continue to build our capabilities around digital, data analytics are going to be really important. And then also we'll invest in our commercial efforts as we see opportunities for continued profitable growth. And then we're also doing a deep dive in R&D portfolio, and we'll look at the best innovation in R&D opportunities to invest behind as well. But much more to come as we head to the second half of the year. Yes. Jonathan, thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll let Glenn to add on as well. One, I think the teams have done a really good job starting off this year and working with customers to try to recoup the significant inflationary pressures we're seeing in the business. So we have, I think a strong value proposition. We have strong commercial teams that are working very closely with their customers to really understand the importance of us recouping our inflation, what we're seeing from an inflationary perspective. So I do feel we're off to a very good start. There are push backs. I think some of the push backs are in some of the smaller customers, some of our emerging market customers where price is much more sensitive. We are seeing pushback there. But all in all we feel as though, we are in a good place and will continue to work closely with our customers to navigate, which is, as we all know, unprecedented times. Glenn, anything you'd add? And hey, Mark. It's Frank. Thanks for the question. And as I mentioned in some of the early remarks, we are working through our strategy refresh process and that does include our long-term plan in detail and we're looking at our current inputs into our plan. We will need some additional time to appropriately assess our long-term financial targets. And my immediate focus, our management team's focus is delivering our 2022 objectives and the financial goals that we're outlining here this morning, as which of course, there's a lot of focus on pricing as you continue to hear productivity an important levers in working with our customers to grow our absolute sales and dollar profit as we manage through the significant inflationary period. Longer term, Mark, there's no doubt in my mind, we have a lot of value creation ahead of us in the company, and I believe our business will generate sustainable profitable growth and it will yield margin expansion over time. As far as your specific question on the 26% adjusted EBITDA target, I think it's really safe to say as we look at where we are today, and you look at how the world has changed, we're not going to be able to achieve that 26% adjusted EBITDA target in 2023. With that said, as I mentioned, I do want the time to come back and share with you in the back half of the year, our plans, and also our focus on driving really strong profitable growth for the future. Yes. Well, we actually are lagging, Heidi. As a reminder, we're $200 million behind from last year. So we're sort of catching up from last year and capturing a large \u2013 the largest percentage this year, but there's still a lag that will be going into 2023 as well. Yes. Now let me be clear. We have $200 million from last year from 2021 that we didn't capture, we began to implement. So if you look at the cumulative 2021, which is really the second half of 2021 in all this year, we're still $200 million behind. Thank you, Heidi. Yes. Thanks John, for the question. I'll just sum it up in a couple of quick points and based on my experience, one, I have been very encouraged by some of the recent visits I've taken to our R&D centers. I just got back from Palo Alto, California, and really good innovation taking place. Some of the work we're doing in with regards to our enzymes, with regards to some of our Scent and sustainable delivery systems, flavor technology. So I'm encouraged early on of what I'm seeing. I think what I would highlight is from an R&D perspective, there's three things that come to mind. One is making sure you have the best talent, and that's a major focus for us in allowing our scientists to innovate. Number two is we have a process and model where you have very close connection with your commercial teams. So your arm in arm, your scientists and your commercial teams are really working on innovations that are going to be meaningful from a customer and consumer perspective. And that's a major focus that we're putting in place. And then number three is doing it in an efficient way and putting our capital against the biggest R&D opportunities. So early on, encouraging, this is going to be a focus for us, and this also will be a part of our second half Investor Day where we'll come back and share more about some of the exciting projects we're working on in our pipeline. So Matt, that's an important question. And what I would say is that we have to do everything that we can as a management team to really build, as I've been saying, the right culture, the right focus for the organization. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us with IFF, but we do need to deliver and we do need to focus on executional excellence. Yes, there has been some change in the management ranks. That is something that obviously we all take seriously, but our focus right now is with the team that we have in place is really to be laser focused on delivering and working on behalf of our customers to create value in the marketplace. So that's really the focus and I am excited about the passion and the energy I see from so many IFFer's around the world, I've had a chance to engage with a lot of them. And I think we're really in a good place as long as we can focus on the \u2013 through four priorities that Glenn mentioned earlier. I do feel good about our opportunity as we work through 2022 and then as we start to build the company for the future. Yes. Mike, and I think you recognized as where we started, we also are in some unprecedented times from inflationary perspective. And also what's happening with regards to China and COVID lockdowns, and what's happening with the war and impossible recessionary pressure. So clearly, the world is changing significantly. Mike, the way I would say, is that we will spend time, like you said, in the second part of this year, but really look at our focus. And I keep using this phrase about driving sustainable, profitable growth. We want to have a company that's growing top-tier within our peer set. And from a topline perspective, good strong leverage throughout the company, a relentless focus on constant improving of productivity and making sure we're doing everything that we can to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. So I think that will be some of the metrics and we'll come back obviously, as we get to the second half and give you specific metrics, but that's how I would have you think about it. Glenn, I don't know if you want to add... Yes. And Mike, just one last one, and I did mention that ROIC is now a part of our metrics as a team. So that's something that we've incorporated. Yes. And just real quickly, we're doing a lot of R&D work in Health and Biosciences area with regards to our enzymes and focusing on probiotics and also, laundry dish programs with global key accounts. We have work in some of our plant-based protein and dairy alternatives, couple of other quick ones to highlight in the scent area, some of the renewable and biodegradable fragrance ingredients were also really focusing, in nourish around a lot of our flavor technologies. And I highlighted one of the big wins that we had with vanilla recently with one of our customers. So we'll spend a lot more time here on the pipeline and portfolio, as I mentioned, coming up in the second half of the year. Yes. Very good questions. I think when you say, what do we do better, then I'll start there. I do think our global scale, the diversity of our and breadth of our portfolio and how we engage with our customers. I think we are leading in many categories and in many areas, and that's something that we will continue to leverage. And it also allows for us to work quickly with customers to co-create solutions with them. So that to me is a big strength of ours. What does some of the competitors do? There are competitors that are focused in certain areas that I do think have done a nice job from a pricing perspective or have in certain categories a little bit better margin construct than we do. And that's really why we're staring into our portfolio to make sure that we put our resources against the best opportunities and where we see those opportunities we're going to invest and then where we see opportunities to improve, we'll focus there. And then in some areas we will pull back investment or possibly even divest if we need to. So those are going to be some things that we're going to be looking at to make sure that we continue to build the strength around our portfolio, but those were some initial thoughts on how I think we are lining up with our customers and then how we compare to some of our competitors. Sure. I'll be quick because I know, we've got a couple more that we're waiting on as well, but just to give you an example, enzymes, I think are areas that I'm excited about. And we're going to deploy resources to drive growth and really mix improvement there over time. There's also, I think some really solid areas such as fabric care, we think there's opportunities to improve our cash flow there. And then, we will continue to look at some of the underperforming areas as well. And I think this is something and Glenn highlighted on our four priorities, which is why we have made the decision to exit for instance, our Microbial Control business and we've announced that divestitures. So those are some examples and like I said, we'll spend much more time opening up and sharing a lot more as we get to the back half of the year. So thank you to all for joining our call. I really appreciate your interests and the time we spent this morning discussing our first quarter results. And hopefully you could hear from myself, Glenn and on behalf of all of IFF, we're really encouraged and excited about the future. And we look forward to sharing more about our plans as we head to the second half of this year and also want to reiterate just how focused we are on a company, making sure we're executing and working with our customers to deliver important solutions for consumers around the world. So thank you and we look forward to speaking to you soon."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Let's start on Slide 11 with sales performance of each of IFF's core businesses. Together, Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions achieved $3.2 billion in sales revenue in Q1, representing comparable currency neutral sales growth of 13%. Of note, all our sub-businesses posted year-over-year comparable currency neutral growth in the first quarter. Nourish delivered the most substantial growth with significant broad-based strengths in our flavors, ingredients and food design businesses. Health & Biosciences similarly achieved strong sales growth having managed headwinds in the Health business. The Scent division carried a strong momentum from last year through the first quarter with strong results in fine fragrance, consumer fragrance and ingredients. Lastly, Pharma Solutions also achieved currency neutral sales growth driven by the division's continued strength in its industrial business and resume demand for pharma. In terms of sales growth contribution, pricing increased approximately 8% and volume grew approximately 5%. Turning to Slide 12, let's walk through our profitability in the quarter. First quarter adjusted operating EBITDA totaled $702 million, representing 9% comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth versus the first quarter of 2021. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 21.8% and on an inflation adjusted basis, would have been approximately 175 basis points higher or approximately 23.5%. Margin did come in better than we expected in the first quarter through the stronger than anticipated volume growth, better cost management as well as the fact that a significant amount of our higher inflationary cost remains in inventories and did not impact the P&L to the degree originally anticipated. However, this is largely timing-related and will change as we progress throughout the year. Including our results is a charge of approximately $20 million related to expected credit loss on receivables from customers located in Russia and Ukraine. While the macroeconomic environment remains incredibly dynamic with continuing inflationary pressures at the moment, we are pleased with the actions taken by our teams to manage through these challenges. We took a very proactive approach and quickly instituted broad-based pricing actions across our portfolio in response to these pressures. Consequently, the actions we have taken have resulted in a full dollar cost recovery of total inflation costs in the first quarter. Unfortunately, since our February earnings call, we have seen additional increases in raw material, logistics and energy costs and are diligently working with our customers on incremental pricing actions. One important note to call out is that we are seeing the strong cost increases flowing to inventory, which due to our inventory days means that the higher cost will eventually impact the P&L as we progress through the balance of the year. Now on Slide 13, I would like to highlight the underlying dynamics and first quarter performance of each of our business segments. In the first quarter, Nourish's strong comparable currency neutral sales growth of 16% was led by double-digit growth in food designs and ingredients. The segment's comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth was also strong at 14%, primarily driven by the division's pricing actions, volume growth and productivity gains. In Health & Biosciences, double-digit growth in health, microbial control and grain processing and high single-digit growth in animal nutrition and cultures in food enzymes show comparable currency neutral sales growth of 10% for the first quarter. Similar to Nourish, the segment's comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 8% was led by pricing, volume growth and productivity that helped offset mixed challenges. In Scent, fine fragrance continued the strong rebound with double-digit growth and cosmetic active and fragrance ingredients continue to perform above expectations. As for consumer fragrance, the business experienced modest growth in the first quarter. Overall percent on 6% comparable currency neutral sales growth, comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 2% as inflationary pressures outpaced pricing for the quarter. As a reminder, in Scent, there is a delay in pricing recovery about 18 months before you fully recover inflation via price increases. Finally, in Pharma Solutions, we saw double-digit growth in both pharma and industrial to deliver 10% comparable currency neutral sales growth for the quarter. Volume growth and productivity gains help drive 10% comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Now on Slide 14, I would like to address our cash flow and leverage positions. In the first quarter, increased working capital requirements in part due to seasonality and in part due to increased values of inventory and accounts receivable driven by inflation as well as higher capital expenditures negatively impacted our cash flow results for the quarter. In the first quarter, CapEx totaled $132 million, representing approximately 4.1% sales. As a reminder, we anticipate our 2022 CapEx to be approximately 5% of sales due to 2021 CapEx carryover and increased investments in capacity expansion and key technologies, which will help support growth while also lowering logistics costs. From a leverage perspective, we are on plan and are continuing to make progress toward achieving our deleveraging target. Q1 ended net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.2x. Gross debt for the quarter totaled $11.7 billion and we finished the first quarter with cash and cash equivalence of $662 million. Despite the global financial pressures, we remain on track to keep our deleveraging target of 3x or lower by year three post-close, which will be supported by our food preparation divesture, sale of our microbial control business and other non-core business divestitures. Slide 15 provides our revised business outlook for 2022. We are adjusting our expected full-year 2022 revenue up to $12.6 billion to $13 billion from $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion. This reflects the effects of additional anticipated pricing actions not incorporated in our original guidance, primarily due to the additional inflationary pressures. This revision also reflects the expected completion of our microbial controls divestiture on July 1, one month later than originally planned, and the acquisition of Health Wright Products completed in April. In addition, our outlook takes into account a weaker euro to dollar currency outlook for the balance of the year. We continue to expect adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion as we continue to target full cost recovery of additional inflationary pressures via price increases. On a comparable currency neutral basis, this translates into sales growth of approximately 9% to 12% versus 6% to 9% previously for the full-year and comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of approximately 4% to 8%, which is unchanged. It should be noted that while we have increased our sales expectations for the full-year due to incremental pricing, we have reduced our volume expectations given a more challenging environment, including loss revenues as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, continued global supply chain issues and anticipated softer consumer demand as a result of higher energy prices and general inflation negatively impacting consumer spending. One data point is that in early Q2, we have already seen volume soften and for the full-year, we are now targeting low single-digit volume growth and high single-digit pricing contributions. Also, based on current market foreign exchange rates, we expect that foreign exchange will negatively impact sales in 2022 by approximately 4 percentage points versus 2 percentage points previously and adjusted operating EBITDA grew by approximately 5 percentage points versus 4% previously. These changes now reflect current market exchange rates, particularly the euro, where we are assuming that it remains at 106 to the dollar for the balance of the year or a blended full-year rate of approximately 108 to the dollar. We are also confirming our 2022 CapEx spend will be approximately 5% of sales. In terms of the second quarter, we continue to believe that sales growth will be driven by price increases with volumes contributing much less they did in the first quarter. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we expect to be in the range of $640 million to $650 million pressured by unfavorable impacts of currency as well as higher inflationary costs flowing from inventories to the income statement. As I wrap up, I want to revisit the four key areas of focus we touched upon in February to update you on our progress. As a reminder, our four key priorities for 2022 are maintaining strong sales momentum, executing broad-based pricing actions, capturing synergy and productivity and accelerating our non-core business divestitures. Overall, we feel good about our progress across all four areas in Q1 and are confidence in our ability to deliver on these commitments this year. In terms of supporting strong sales momentum, we are increasing our capacity across constrained portions of our portfolio, enhancing our supply chain efficiencies most notably in our H&B, Pharma Solutions and Ingredients business, to ensure that we maintain our volume growth in line with or above the industry. Relative to executing broad-based pricing actions in an effort to react more quickly to today's evolving environment and better prepared for tomorrow's challenges, we have significantly enhanced our processes, implemented new pricing tools and established core pricing teams to oversee each of our business units. Our focus has been centered around minimizing the amount of time lost between inflation signals and customer pricing actions to ensure that we quickly adjust  to protect profitability. With these changes, we successfully implemented our first round of pricing actions and recover the total cost of inflation in Q1 2022. Given additional known inflationary pressures and a lot of uncertainty regarding the future path of inflation, this remains our highest priority. Accelerating our productivity expense synergy efforts also remains a key priority and increasingly important in a more challenging macroeconomic environment. To this end, we are able to deliver over $30 million of operational efficiencies and deal-related synergies in the first quarter above our expectations. As a result, we expect to exceed our original $100 million full-year cost reduction target, which is net of reinvestments. This higher level of productivity is helping offset lower full-year volume expectations. As we look to accelerate our long-term productivity opportunities, we have sharpened our focus on three large areas of productivity, procurement efficiencies, notably in indirect spend; end-to-end operations efficiencies, inclusive of digital enablement, yield and mix enhancements and logistics efficiencies and expanding the scale and efficiency of IFF's global shared service platform. Importantly, we will remain prudent in protecting key topline investments, including R&D, customer sales and service and technology. We plan on providing more details of these initiatives at our Q2 earnings call. Finally, we made further headway in accelerating our non-core divestitures. We are on track to successfully complete the sale of our Microbial Control business by July 1. We are also targeting additional portfolio optimization in non-core business divestiture opportunities to delever our balance sheet and invest greater resources toward our higher return businesses. We are making very good progress in early non-core business marketing efforts and have already received strong interest from prospective buyers. Should these transactions go through? We anticipate that they will in aggregate be accretive to our go forward growth rate and margin profile. With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Frank. Yes. Hey, Gunther. Let me first sort of \u2013 by the way, good afternoon to you. I want to unpack the $300 million. So you know sort of the nature of that, and then we'll talk about sort of where it sits. So the $300 million change is a function of several items. First of all, we have some portfolio adjustments, so the acquisition of Health Wright and then one additional month of Microbial Controls, the value that's about $130 million of incremental revenue. That's completely offset with our foreign exchange update, i.e., the stronger euro or the stronger dollar relative to euro rather, basically offsets that completely from a revenue standpoint. The residual is we have incremental pricing of around $370 million, and that's all related to raw material increases, which I'll come back to. And as we mentioned on the call, we're actually bringing down volume balance of the year. For a full-year, down about a $100 million from our original plan, so a little over a half a point full-year. We actually were better in the first quarter by a point. So we're taking down the balance of the year down by a $100 million. Where we're seeing basically the impact of the price/volume, it pretty much mirrors where the cost increases are occurring. So we've had more material cost inflation in our Nourish business and other businesses. So that's why you see the higher growth rates in that business. But we are continuing to see the impact on all the businesses. So nobody sort of is exempt from the second round of this $300 million in terms of kind of overall pressure, but a bit more in Nourish than the other business because of the raw material impact. Yes. It is a great question Gunther, and also something that we're working on now where we don't really have a stats in part because there's two tough parts of the equation. One is to understand the overlap of the latest round of raw materials into next year. So there's a carry forward, but then equally are basically the pricing dynamics. So as mentioned, we're having to go back in the market because incremental pricing. So there'll be a full-year effect of that as well. I would also remind the group that last year we were still in the whole i.e. the inflation exceeded pricing in 2021 by $200 million. So we're still planned to basically go after a full capture, unfortunately, with the latest addition of inflation, it's just going to take a little bit longer into 2023 to sort of get us back to whole. Yes. Hey. Thanks Jonathan for the question. I'd say, first of all, obviously we're not unique is every industry is experiencing substantial increases in inflation, and all of our competitors are out there basically taking prices up as well. And as you're well aware, as it relates to our value add from our customers supply chain, we tend to be a relatively sort of low cost high value add relative to their overall value change. And I would say, simply put, with 60% of our cost structure related to raw materials, energy and logistics, it's sort of impossible for us to absorb. Those level increases. And rather as our customers well appreciate, we are in business who really provide them superior solutions, which requires significant investment in innovation, customer service capabilities, building and maintaining a very robust global supply chain. I would remind everybody, we're adding $200 million at CapEx this year alone to build out. So that's the value we add to our customer. And as a result of that, we can't sort of, if you will speculate on material costs and our customers appreciate that. Frankly, where we sit relative to our value add, they completely appreciate what we're doing for them. And that's been reflected in the success of pricing. I will note though, there are some sectors, as we mentioned, Scent as an example, that there's a lag. So it's not every single customer is out front here in terms of the pricing, but in general, the level of productive dialogue has been very, very good with our customers. Thanks, Mark. So I'll start off with our volume outlook. 5%  for the first quarter, we're actually projecting 1% for the balance of the year. So relatively flattish. I would remind everybody, we have a very strong overlap in the last three quarters. The three quarters of last year were on average around 10% in terms of currency neutral sales of which that was around 8% volume each of the quarters is a very strong one. That's why we actually planned the second half of the year more flattish versus the first half of the year. Why we've taken it down is basically taken the balance of the year down about a $100 million in revenue, that is basically split into two components. One is the direct impact on Russia and Ukraine volumes. And the second half is really a combination of supply chain and demand issues. So supply chain would include a combination of all material access as well as China, and then generally we just feel that we're seeing early signs relative to the consumer pulling back. We really don't view this as a \u2013 not being competitive on a pricing standpoint, but frankly, just what we're seeing in the consumer and it's manifested itself literally in the last couple weeks a little bit more in the home and personal care side of the business versus sort of the food and beverage or pharma side. So we're not sure, honestly, whether that's sort of an end consumer sort of permanent pullback or adjustment in inventories, but we're just, frankly, just being cautious relative to sort of what's going on in the global economy. Hey, Mike. I would just add. By the way, I lived in Cleveland, I'm not sure I'm allowed to come back though. But really at the end of the day, we are trying to deliver a superior outcome for our shareholders. And the way to do that as Frank had mentioned is to make sure we outpace the topline versus the industry. So having superior topline growth and secondarily superior return on invested capital, the way we view doing that is actually driving significant productivity, which we believe there is, and allowing that to basically reinvest back and help accelerate the topline and to continue to actually drive some of that to the bottom line while we're optimizing our portfolio. So to Frank's point, that will be sort of the major agenda when we get together later in the year, maybe in Cleveland. Good morning, Lisa. So relative to the first quarter and balance of the year relative to region, our strongest areas have been the developed markets. So combination of Europe and North America, laggards has really been actually Greater Asia has slower growth in the first quarter. We expect, as we look at the balance of the year, we need to have a little bit challenges in Greater Asia, particularly China, as we mentioned, likely also to see a slowdown \u2013 meaningful slowdown in Europe, given the \u2013 what's happening from the economy standpoint, but are still sort of fairly optimistic on combination of North America and LATAM as well. Yes. Thanks for the question. We actually, as you recall, in the fourth quarter, signaled pretty quickly given we saw this large tsunami of inflation and went out very quickly, in the fourth quarter of the first round that press release was really in advance of the second round. And all our competitors are seeing exactly the same, inflationary pressures as well. So I think, that was intended really to help our teams relative to the customer dialogue, sort of understand the dynamics and the impact on the business. Hence the purpose of the press releases, I did mention all our competitors as you're well aware are basically in the market doing the same thing and are passing along prices and time as well. We just moved fast even we saw in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned on the call, we really also invested in, I'll say in infrastructure around the organization to make sure we're more closely monitoring what's happening in the market and just moving much, much, much quicker because I think we are concerned that this \u2013 even the second round may be the second of others. So we just want to be prepared to do that. And that answer was the purpose of that, that press release. Yes. Let me \u2013 maybe I'll take the second one and come back to the first one. Your conclusion is correct in terms of the third \u2013 hardly one third of our business from a capital utilization standpoint needs to improve. And there are two major levers. So not surprisingly as it relates to some of our non-core divestiture work by the fall within that basket, if you will. So continue to optimize the portfolio as one lever. The second is really thinking about ultimately a combination of capital investment in those businesses and in addition, how we think about optimizing the profitability. So as part of the Frank's comments about the refresh strategy, we are thinking about the portfolio in that way. And by the way, that's also in the spirit of taking some of those dollars and moving them up to the far left of that chart and accelerating the growth dynamics of the higher return segments as well. Relative to our cost savings, as a reminder, we get roughly $300 million targeted for synergies, about half of those were procurement. So it's not surprising that you would have little to no integration-related expenses for those. Those pieces honestly are, as we've mentioned in the past, we are the farthest behind simply because of this environment. It's harder to materialize. The other half of the 150, we're sort of midway through in terms of capture. To your broader point about how we think about restructuring opportunities, we've moved beyond a discussion of just synergies, deal-related synergies was too narrow and we really are focusing more broadly on productivity. As I mentioned, there are three large buckets operations, procurement and then shared services. The first two of those are likely to have relatively low one-time costs because they're really optimizing operations, digital throughput, some fixed cost reduction, indirect material purchases. The latter being shared service probably will have some one-time restructuring charges as we build out our current infrastructure and continue to add capabilities into that network. Yes. Generally, we're looking out to the third or fourth quarter for the raw materials. Energy is more problematic as well as logistics that tends to sort of \u2013 it's really kind of here and now if you will, in terms of kind of what's happening in the marketplace, we've done best estimates based on sort of where the markets are trading relative to energy as well as logistics costs. But generally the raw materials are sort of about six months out. But some of them have been \u2013 a lot of them have been locked in, some of them not. So we are continuing \u2013 by the way, we're continuing to monitor every single week. We sort of have an update on how we're feeling about the market in general over the last sort of month, six weeks, there's been some ebbing and flowing so slightly higher in energy, some relief in raw materials, but it hasn't materially been different than that 350-ish number that I provided you to earlier. So relative to sort of the carryover for next year, we still have to sort of work that through. As I mentioned, it's a combination of, what the tail of this year's annualized raw materials and then very importantly, we got to figure out as well as the tail of the pricing actions in the next year as well? Yes. So just a clarification, the reason we dropped the balance sheet metric is because we launched the new three-year plan. So to some extent, this is the window beyond sort of our deleverage. So I am very, very confident that we will hit three less. We will be closing on the Microbial Controls business at the end of this quarter, that's going to be net proceeds of $1.1 billion. As I mentioned in the past, we have three to four additional deals that will cumulatively add $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of gross. They're proceeding nicely, by the way, despite the sort of volatility in the market, they are attractive property strategically. That alone will basically get us to the goal independent of cash flow. To the last point of your question, we're going to continue obviously to take a look at the portfolio, that's part of the strategy refresh, which will probably afford additional opportunities to continue to approving the portfolio, but nothing to announce at this point and nor do we need that to accomplish that goal. So thanks for the question."

Participants will be announced by their name and company. In order to get all participants an opportunity to ask their questions, we request a limit of one question per person. I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's fourth Quarter and full year 2023 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the results can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release both of which can be found on our website. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you may have at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik.\nErik Fyrwald: Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today. I would like to begin by sharing some initial perspectives since joining IFF. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a look at the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results before providing commentary on our current outlook for the full year 2024. After that, we'll open the call for Q&A. Now I officially joined IFF on February 6th, and I have been impressed by the world-class teams globally and the strong innovation across our company. I spent the last few weeks visiting our operations and teams in some of our U.S. and overseas businesses. I spent that time listening to our teams, meeting many of our customers, and assessing the current status of our businesses. IFF has a proud history as a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions and a great platform from which-to-build and expand our partnerships with customers across the value chain to help them create leading consumer products. I believe in our purpose to help create a better world through science and creativity applied to sustainably meet customer and consumer needs. The opportunity we have ahead of us is very big, and that is why I joined IFF. We have solid businesses and will take the actions needed to unleash our full potential to start to deliver profitable market share gains by bringing great innovation to win with our customers. A perfect example of this is in our scent business, where we have been outperforming competition, something we must do also across our other businesses. IFF also has other high-quality businesses such as flavors and health and biosciences where we will leverage our innovation to deliver higher growth rates with very attractive profitability. And in some of our challenge businesses, such as functional ingredients, with focus and attention, we can significantly improve performance. In both instances, we will do so by putting the business first, eliminating unnecessary processes and overhead, driving empowerment and strong leadership. And by doing so, IFF will be a more innovative and customer-centric organization that will be effective and efficient. We also must be better executors, focus the IFF team away from distractions to continuously grow market share across all our businesses, put more of our investments into our high-return businesses and transformative R&D initiatives and our IT infrastructure, and achieve our capital structure targets by reducing outstanding debt. And when we do this, over time, I see strong upside and value creation for all IFF's stakeholders. Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through the achievements and factors that marked IFF's progress through the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Now, throughout the past year, IFF FERC [ph] have continued to take important steps to strengthen our financial and operational foundation and position this company to deliver value for the near, mid, and long-term. Our performance in the fourth quarter demonstrates progress. While reported sales were down, comparable currency-neutral sales increased 1% and comparable currency-neutral EBITDA grew 17% with an adjusted margin expansion of 260 basis points. We've also seen notable improvements in volume trends across the majority of our business segments in the second half of the year, enabling us to perform within previously stated guidance ranges for full year 2023 sales and adjusted operating EBITDA. Now, with this progress and the improving performance through the second half of 2023, we exited the year on solid footing, and we are optimistic about our ability to build on this momentum and are targeting getting back to year-on-year growth for the full year 2024 while strengthening for 2025 and beyond. Now, as I said earlier, we are committed to reducing our level of debt. We have therefore announced an update to our dividend policy to reduce the quarterly dividend by approximately 50% to $0.40 per share. This is not a decision the board and management have taken lightly, as we know the dividend is important to shareholders. However, it will enable us to reduce debt faster, strengthening our capital structure, which will create additional long-term value. This will also give the company greater financial flexibility, which will, when required, give us the ability to make more high-return growth investments. I'll now turn it over to Glenn. Glenn?\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Erik, and hello, everyone. Moving to slide seven, as Erik mentioned, the board and management have taken this opportunity to accelerate the improvement of our capital structure as we work towards our deleveraging target of three times net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, we reduced our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. We believe this dividend change provides a dividend yield that is consistent with industry peers and is aligned with IFF's long-term cash flow generation and target payouts. The dividend remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, and we expect this new base to grow alongside our profit over time. IFF remains committed to providing competitive returns to our shareholders and firmly believes these actions set us up for more durable value creation in the long-term. Now, on slide eight, as Erik mentioned, our performance for the fourth quarter reflects the operational and strategic initiatives that our team has implemented over the last several months to deliver strong results amid an uncertain operating environment. Despite some continued challenges in the market, volume trends continue to improve sequentially, with increases in nearly all businesses resulting in growth for total IFF. IFF generated $2.7 billion in sales, representing a 1% increase in comparable currency-neutral sales. This improvement reflected strong growth in our scent business with continued volume pressure in Nourish and Pharma, both impacted by de-stocking. Volumes continue to improve sequentially from down mid-single digits in Q3 to down low single digits in Q4, and if excluding the impact of functional ingredients, volumes for the fourth quarter would have increased low single digits. Adjusted operating EBITDA total $461 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% increase on a comparable currency-neutral basis. We also realized a year-over-year increase of approximately 260 basis points to our comparable currency-neutral-adjusted operating EBITDA margin. This growth in EBITDA was supported by both internal steps IFF has taken, including continued gains and efficiencies from our productivity initiatives and favorable net pricing. Before moving on, I wanted to share that we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter related to our nourish business. The primary drivers of the goodwill impairment are related to lower business projections due to volume declines, mainly in functional ingredients, continued cost inflation, and unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Now moving to slide nine, taking a closer look at our profitability performance for the fourth quarter, we delivered $461 million, which equates to a robust comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 17%. I'm happy to report that in Q4, IFF realized strong productivity gains and in conjunction with favorable net price to inflation, helped us overcome ongoing volume pressures to deliver against our objectives. Importantly, IFF has remained focused on executing upon our productivity program to improve our operational effectiveness and efficiency. In 2023, we continued to launch additional steps as part of these programs while also making strategic investments in key growth areas. Now on slide 10, I'll provide a closer look at our performance by business segment during the quarter. In nourish, sales declined 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis as strong growth in flavors was offset by continued softness in functional ingredients. While functional ingredients remained the main driver of weakness for nourish in the quarter, it is worth noting that we again saw meaningful sequential improvement. In terms of profitability, the positive impact from our ongoing pricing actions and productivity initiatives drove improvements and led to a 3% increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Health & Biosciences continues to show robust top and bottom line growth. Price increases, volume growth and productivity gains led to growth across most H&B business segments led by double-digit growth in health. Overall, H&B delivered a comparable currency-neutral sales increase of 5% year-over-year and a 35% year-over-year increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Our scent segment continued to deliver a very strong performance in Q4, including 11% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales, driven by double-digit growth in consumer fragrance, as well as mid-single-digit growth in Fine fragrance. Like Health & Biosciences, scent also saw significant growth in adjusted operating EBITDA, increasing 34% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by favorable net pricing, volume, and productivity gains. While Pharma Solutions experienced significant pricing and productivity gains, these improvements were offset by lower volume, driven primarily by continued de-stocking trends, as well as strong year-ago comparison. This led to comparable currency-neutral sales declining 10% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declining 13% in the quarter. Turning to slide 11, I'll discuss our progress in improving our cash flow and leveraged positions. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $1.44 billion, a significant increase from the previous year, reflecting the strong improvement in inventory levels. CapEx of the year was $503 million, or approximately 4.4% of sales. Our progress on working capital improvement, led by an intense focus on right-sizing our inventories, helped enhance our free cash flow position, which saw a sequential increase of over $500 million, totaling $936 million for the full year and ahead of expectations. Included in our free cash flow is about $430 million of costs, primarily related to integration and transaction-related items. We also delivered $826 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $729 million, including $26 million in assets held for sale in Q4. Additionally, we realized a $200 million sequential reduction in gross debt, which totaled approximately $10.1 billion for the quarter, with a net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA a 4.5 times, our trailing 12-month credit-adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.1 billion. With the announced sale of our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics business, which we still expect to close in the first quarter of 2024, the right-sizing of our quarterly dividend and additional portfolio actions we are planning to make, we are taking decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet and achieve our leveraged targets. On slide 12, I'd like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Due to a combination of improvements across our business and in the broader market toward the tail end of 2023, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. For the full year 2024, we expect sales in the range of $10.8 billion to $11.1 billion. This reflects our prudent approach to volume expectations and the impact of modest negative pricing in 2024, which is largely isolated to more price-competitive categories such as functional ingredients and fragrance ingredients, given lower input costs and competitive dynamics. We expect overall pricing to decline approximately 2.5% in 2024, following a 10% increase in 2022 and a 6% increase in 2023. Strategically, we believe this will position us to be more cost-competitive in the market and allow us to regain market share in select businesses. In terms of volume, the visibility to the degree and pace of the recovery remains a bit fluid and has been explicitly incorporated in our 0% to 3% range. The most significant variable impacting this range will be the pace of recovery in functional ingredients. However, this is a marked improvement from 2023, where we finished down mid-single digits and '22 we were down low single digits, as we believe our industry will return to more normalized growth rates. On the bottom line, we expect to deliver full year '24 adjusted operating EBITDA between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Our guidance assumes not just improved volumes from 2023, but also solid profitability and a margin expansion across our segments. We are hyper-focused on continuing to execute our productivity initiatives to help mitigate expected inflation, primary labor costs, and incentive compensation reset, while continuing to reinvest in the higher-return businesses. It's also worth noting, we have some benefit of one-time items such as the negative impact in 2023 from the inventory reduction program and the previously announced write-down of inventory related to Locust Bean Kernel or LBK that will not repeat in 2024. In particular, there was an approximately $130 million impact from the negative absorption in 2023 related to our inventory reduction program and some volume declines, which is down from an estimated $165 million we provided in the third quarter. A portion of this will be offset by higher annual incentive compensation expense as we reset our payout to target levels in 2024. While there's still work to do, efforts to bolster our financial profile and portfolio are providing effective, and while its hard to predict the timing and details of the market recovering and its impact on our results, we see opportunity for improvement in 2024 with all divisions targeting better volumes, with improvements in profitability and margin expansion across all four divisions. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of approximately $475 million to $500 million. Throughout 2024, we will be relentlessly focused on our efforts to optimize our portfolio, improve financial performance, and reach our deleveraging targets. I'm confident that the actions taken in 2023 and our outlook for improving performance in 2024 will position IFF to capture significant value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Erik for closing remarks.\nErik Fyrwald: Thank you, Glenn. I'm truly excited to be joining IFF during this transformative time for the company. I have long admired IFF as the category-defining leader in the industry, and it's an honor to be able to work alongside our talented global teams to help us navigate and even thrive at a critical moment for our company and our industry. Through robust efforts from our teams worldwide and shared commitment to putting the customer at the center of all we do, IFF will continue strengthening our commercial execution and become a more nimble and efficient organization. Our global teams made progress towards ensuring we can meet the evolving needs of our customers and deliver industry-competitive returns, and we will accelerate the progress going forward. While 2023 was a challenging year, our financial results in the fourth quarter highlight an improving trend. Based on this performance and some improving market conditions, we are expecting a return to volume growth this year, which should enable EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Our updated dividend policy and the additional divestitures we continue to work on reflects our commitment to improve our capital structure. While the global economic landscape is uncertain, IFF will be focused on strengthening our execution, and as I said, we have work to do to improve our businesses and achieve our vision, but I am confident we are well-positioned to build on our progress and create sustainable value for all stakeholders in 2024 and beyond. I'd like to thank our teams and partners for welcoming me to IFF and look forward to seeing what we'll achieve in 2024. With that, I'd like to now open the call for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hey, guys. Good morning. And Erik, first off, congrats on your new role.\nErik Fyrwald: Thank you.\nGhansham Panjabi: I guess my question is on your fiscal year '24 EBITDA guidance, and I'm hoping that you can sort of bridge on a year-over-year basis the differential between '24 and '23. And also, Glenn, highlight what changed relative to the variances you highlighted from your three-queue conference call back in November, apart from just the fixed-cost absorption you cited. And if you could also just give us a sense as to what the embedded volumes are by segment as it relates to the low-single-digit volume guidance for '24? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Sure. Yes, good morning, Ghansham. Easily done and a frequently asked question. So if you'll indulge me, I'll start with last year's results at 1980. There are two adjustments to get that to a normalized basis. One is the divestitures, which you're aware of. It's a half a year of savory solutions in FSI, and the LMC will be closed at the end of the quarter, so it's roughly three-quarters of LMC. That's roughly $78 million of normalized impact. And the other factor, which is the same, basically, we had discussed before, we also have included our updated view of foreign exchange, that's $50 million reduction. I'm not sure that was previously discussed from a standpoint. So that gets to a like-for-like base of $18.50. Our volume mix impact for this year is forecasted to be $170 million positive. That is inclusive of the $130 million of positive overlap on absorption. As we noted on our call, that actually came down as the fourth quarter volumes were higher from a production standpoint, so that was slightly different than we had guided. Our net price for the year is basically is zero. That is inclusive of the $44 million of LBK, so that's netted in that number. We can certainly talk more about the pricing dynamics this year. Then we have about a $35 million reset for AIP, so that's a negative, but that's better than we thought. We thought that would be in the 70 range from the standpoint. So I think all of the one-timers being absorption slightly lower, the negative reset on AIP is slightly lower, FX is new, and then the deals basically were all known. The last items are sort of wage, inflation, that's about $120 million, and the productivity is about $150 million in the P&L, so that's sort of consistent with our three-year view. So that adds up to the midpoint of our range of $2 billion. And then relative to the volume question, I think it's very simple to think about our view of this year. The functional ingredients, which is circa less than 25% of the business, we are projecting that to be relatively flattish for the year. All the other businesses actually have growth directly in the 2% to 3% range on a full year basis, a little bit more slower in the beginning of the year and ramping up in the latter, but that's why we mentioned. As we think about that range of guidance, it's functional ingredients is the area that probably gives us the most pause and we've been the most cautious, and that sort of is the difference between the high end of the 3% versus the 0% range. So hopefully that answers the question.\nOperator: Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJosh Spector: Hi. Good morning.\nGlenn Richter: Hi, Josh.\nJosh Spector: Hey. So I just wanted to -- hey, so I wanted to ask on the dividend. So I think it's been pretty clear that it's been a pretty big use of cash for a couple of years now. So, really the question is, why was now the right time versus when you looked at that probably a year ago or maybe two years ago? And what does that mean as it relates to the divestment strategy or timing? Has anything changed as you think about what's next?\nErik Fyrwald: So this is Erik. First of all, I wasn't here a year ago, obviously, but I did arrive on February 6th, looked at our entire situation, talked to Glenn and his team, talked to the board, and made the decision to go ahead and cut the dividend now. I think it's a wise move in terms of our overall balance sheet efforts to get our balance sheet in great shape, and it doesn't impact the divestment timing or strategy. We continue to work on our portfolio optimization, but obviously we're focused even more on working on strengthening the businesses, increasing our earnings and cash flow.\nOperator: Thank you.\nErik Fyrwald: Next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Alliance Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nGunther Zechmann: Hi, and Erik, welcome back to the public market as well. Erik, what are your priorities for this year? I appreciate you've only been in the role for a few weeks, but for this year maybe also beyond when I think about the portfolio and the balance sheet, please. And in addition, how do you think about IFF's midterm targets? And lastly, Glenn, what is your free cash flow guidance for 2024, please?\nErik Fyrwald: Thank you, Gunther, and glad to be back in the public market. My priorities for 2024, I should say, our priorities for 2024 are to continue the portfolio optimization work and have that be part of improving our balance sheet. But again, more importantly, we're going to strengthen each business. We're going to make sure that each business is clear on how they can strengthen their customer focus to profitably grow market share, strengthen the R&D and innovation in each business so that we better delight customers with our innovation so that we bring innovation that they value, that we can grow our market share with them. And then thirdly, we're going to keep driving productivity and strengthen productivity in each business unit and then also corporately. We want a very effective and efficient back office. What will reduce the amount of engagement we've had with consultants, advisors, and others that have caused us to be too internally focused. We're going to get back to focus on winning with the businesses by better serving our customers than our competition. In terms of how I'm thinking about the midterm targets, it's too early for me to comment, but I'll look at them with the team here and we'll do it by business and then we'll roll it up for the company and we'll get back to you in the not too distant future on that, but on the last one, Glenn?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey, good morning, Gunther. Our projected free cash flow for this year is $500 million. I would note that that's inclusive and an expectation of $100 million of taxes for the sale of LMC and carryover for savory and then another $100 million for other restructure one-time items. So there's 200 of Reg G, but net of the 200, we're at $500 million for your free cash flow.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. And Erik, congratulations on your role. Erik, two things.\nErik Fyrwald: Thanks David.\nDavid Begleiter: First, can you comment on pressure ports that a sales process for pharma solutions is underway? And secondly, in addition, it's 2.5% reduction in pricing you're forecasting in '24. All the pricing you expect to give up versus the roughly 19% pricing you've achieved over the last three years on a cumulative basis? Thank you.\nErik Fyrwald: I'll take the first one, and, Glenn, you can have the second piece, because I'm not that familiar with the details at this point, but I'm getting into it. But in terms of any portfolio optimization, we're not going to comment on rumors. All I can tell you is we continue to work on portfolio optimization, and we will not sell a business at a price that doesn't make sense, but we're looking at what does make sense for IFF and for our employees and any business that we might consider divesting. So with that, Glenn?\nGlenn Richter: Yes, thanks. Good morning once again, David. As you point out, we've got three years of very significant pricing to reflective of the inflation environment of 18%, 19% cumulatively. 2.5% is all we're anticipating. That actually reflects sort of overall price decline. So as I mentioned, that price is sort of zero in our P&L. It is highly concentrated in the functional ingredients and the scent ingredient space. And we've been extremely surgical in terms of where we needed to give it back. And at this point, we're pretty much locked in to most of our pricing for the year at this point. So that actually feels like a pretty safe number relative to the plan.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nLisa De Neve: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So the question I have is two-fold. I mean, how is IFF positioned versus peers? I mean, does it expect to go in line with the market, in line with its direct peers, or believe that it's actually better positioned and this year, but also maybe more structurally? And next to that, how should we really think about delivery of the functional ingredients optimization and efficiency program for this year? And I have a small follow-up on the pricing. So on the negative pricing in fragrance ingredients, have your customers come back for pricing here? And are your peers offering the same price reductions or comparable price reductions? Thank you.\nErik Fyrwald: Thank you, Lisa. And I'll take the first part of that question. I've looked very hard at the data over the last five years, and clearly we have underperformed, as all of you know. We have pockets of strength, scent as an example I mentioned in the opening comments, but we have some businesses that are challenged, like food ingredients. What I can tell you is we're going to have each business be very clear on what is their strategy to win. How are they going to delight their customer set and make sure that we profitably grow our market share? How are we going to make sure that we have our innovation targeted and needs the customer's value? And how are we going to make sure we're driving productivity? So each of the business end-to-end, how do we drive the businesses? And as you know, we've got strong businesses in great markets, like our flavors and our fragrances or scent business, terrific businesses that should be able to fully compete with margins and growth rates with Givaudan and others. We've got a strong business unit in Health & Biosciences in great markets, and we should be able to fully compete with margins and growth against Novonesis. In our challenged businesses, we've got very good markets in food ingredients and protein solutions, and we should be able to be fully competitive with Kerry and other food ingredient players. And we've got a very good business and very good markets with pharmaceutical ingredients, and we need to be fully competitive with our ingredients set there, Ashland and others. So, we have not performed as a company, across the company in the last five years like we should. In the next five years, we'll get back on track.\nGlenn Richter: Hey, Lisa, this is Glenn. Let me address your second question regarding functional ingredients. So from past conversations, 2021-'22, we had a number of missteps on our part that caused this business to step backwards. Since that, we've been working on basically four major items. One, getting service levels up to the right standard. I'm happy to say for the last year plus, service levels have been at 95% plus across all the business and across the entire globe. Secondly and perhaps most importantly, is getting volume back on track, which is combination of our sales execution pipeline. As we mentioned, that has dramatically picked up over the last year in getting our pricing right in the market, we just talked about that. We've been very smart this year thinking about market-by-market, product-by-product, what makes sense to be competitive, to win and retain business. We feel much better about that. The third item has really been around sort of our general go-to-market strategy, and as Erik has mentioned, be much more focused across the ingredients team, making sure that they own the results. Lastly, it's cost. So we have been really focusing on all of the costs, but largely the 85% that sits in cost of goods. So it's skew rationalization, raw material consolidation, manufacturing footprint consolidation, taking out fixed costs, et cetera, and we're making very good progress. We are seeing successive improvements in volume quarter-to-quarter. Q2 last year was a low watermark. We're actually moving into sort of flattish as we start this year, and we're also continuing to see good expansion in margin. So we have a lot of work to do, as Erik mentioned, but we're beginning to see some progress in terms of what we've been doing. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open.\nNicola Tang: Hi, everyone. I just wanted to pick up on a few topics that were just asked by Lisa. On this pricing side, I was wondering if you could give a bit more detail on this expected price declines in functional ingredients and in fragrance ingredients, and whether you could expand on your comment on competitive dynamics in these markets. And then, in addition, on the volume side, I was wondering why you don't expect more in terms of year-on-year volume improvement bearing in mind, I mean, I guess the headwind of de-stocking and inflation that are clearly in the base in 2023? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Thanks. Two very good questions. So on the pricing of our 2.5%, 80% of our downward pricing is concentrated in functional ingredients and the scent ingredients business. Those areas, by definition, are more commoditized, and in addition, those areas have seen some more meaningful deflation in terms of commodities. So it's natural. As I mentioned previously, we were doing a very good job of making sure we're competitive in the market by product, by region, and we feel good that that 2.5% sort of is reflective of the environment. The second question regarding why are we not more optimistic? Honestly, we're just cautious. We're very cautious and prudent given the environment. The last year was extremely bumpy. We do believe that de-stocking for most of our business is largely behind us, and we're seeing positive signs, but we need a couple of quarters of positive momentum, I think, and stabilization before we can move from cautious to optimistic.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nJohn Roberts: And welcome back, Erik, two-part or if I could. Is the functional ingredients business significantly different today than when you were at DuPont? It sounds like you think it's just more of a cyclical problem that can be addressed through productivity, but do you think there are structural changes you need to make there? And then, your predecessor was targeting going from four segments to three segments. Have you gone back to the whiteboard to start over on those plans, or was that nearing completion and there's just some fine-tuning left to complete it?\nErik Fyrwald: Thanks, John. And let me start with the first one. The makeup of our functional ingredients business is better than what it was when I had responsibility for that as part of agriculture and nutrition back at DuPont a number of years ago. So I believe our potential is significantly higher than it was then. I think that it's in a very good market. I think we've underperformed. And I think we've underperformed because we've been too internally focused. We've had lots of consultants. We've had lots of advisors talking about helping us to figure out what to do around synergies. And what I can tell you is, I've been in these businesses for many, many years, these types of businesses. The goal was not synergy. Synergy is a tool. The goal is to have a very clear strategy for our functional ingredients business. How are we going to profitably grow our market share with customers by delighting the customers with our solutions approach, with our innovation, and then do that in a productive way with our assets and our functions, very productive. We have the potential to significantly improve the performance of this business. I've spent time with our business leaders. I think they're headed in the right direction and we're going to further accelerate the progress and make sure that we profitably grow our food ingredients business and fully compete with our competitors, the leading competitors in food ingredients, because we have so much value to bring customers. If we do it right, when we do it right, we'll have a very good business. And then, in terms of the organization structure, no decisions today, but what I will tell you is I'm a big fan of business units that have end-to-end accountability and responsibility to drive all the levers of the P&L, making sure that everything we do is to delight customers, profitably grow our market share, but do it in a way that's efficient and effective so each business unit can win. And I find when business units are winning, all of a sudden synergies become clearer and become more powerful and easier to access. So we're going to ensure that our businesses are on the right track and that our synergies are additive to further strengthen each of our businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you and good morning. Erik, welcome back. Glenn, two questions from my side, please. Your Health & Bio segment margin was the best in more than three years. Can you just maybe rank order the drivers of the improvement there? And more importantly is the 30% plus level sustainable into 2024. And then secondly, what are your input cost trends and the outlook that you're baking into your guidance for this year?\nGlenn Richter: Yes, so I think for the H&B had a very good year and that was a result of a progressive improvement in volumes. As we noted, the health business, one of our largest segments, actually had a very good fourth quarter. Secondarily, productivity, so we've driven a lot of productivity across the business. And third, really net price. So there's been -- to your second question, a decline in input cost in that business as well. So that got us to the 30% range for the business. I did note on the call that we are anticipating H&B like all four of our businesses that demonstrate both EBITDA growth and margin expansion this year. So we expect that to be the case for H&B. In general, our input costs, as I mentioned, are anticipated to be down this year. Energy is flattish at this point, logistics are down, and we're seeing some raw materials deflation. As a reminder, it takes about four months for a purchase to run through the balance sheet. So that's a positive momentum. That's a net zero, as I mentioned, for the overall enterprise for the year. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nLaurence Alexander: Good morning. If end markets do not cooperate, can you provide more granularity on how you can de-lever in 2024 and 2025 in terms of reviewing business lines, Brexit, productivity relative to comp and so forth? And Erik, given your initial impressions on IFF operating culture and discussion around productive solutions, can you speak more to the mindset around productivity and R&D? Is it more about operational fixes, or do you see structural or philosophical issues around how the firm has targeted ROIC margins or profit growth?\nGlenn Richter: Yes, thanks. This is Glenn. I'll answer the first part of your question. In general, we're pretty cautious on our outlook on volume. So we're, as I mentioned, flattish to three. So we haven't expected a giant recovery this year in our base case. So that's kind of a starting point. In the absence of that materializing, we have been very good at delivering productivity, as Erik mentioned in his opening comments. We are accelerating both ongoing efforts, and we have additional efforts underway to take costs out that aren't reflected in the plan. So that would be my second comment. Relative to the de-leverage, so that gives you some sense on the earnings profile and offsets if there's additional softness in the external market. The de-leverage will largely be accomplished through divestitures. As Erik mentioned, we are on path. We feel very good in terms of our activities underway, and we do think we'll accomplish our targeted divestitures, which will be the biggest driver of achieving our de-leveraged goal.\nErik Fyrwald: Now, on your second question, Laurence, my initial impressions of IFF's capabilities are we've got really great people. We've got really great capabilities in each of our businesses, and we have just under-performed. But there are pockets of examples where we are performing tremendously well that give me so much confidence that we can make this happen across the company. I spent time with the leadership of arguably the largest consumer products company in the world, where we have a very strong relationship, very much innovation-driven, their innovation people to make sure that the best consumer products are being developed. And we were meeting both with our scent teams and their fragrance team, and with our Health & Biosciences team and their consumer products teams. And it was the best relationship, the best dynamic that I've ever experienced in my 42 years of customer interactions. And then I had another interaction with the top management of a leading beauty care company in Europe. And same thing, our people were working hand in glove with their people to create great, great consumer products that consumers love. So we can do it. We do it. We just need to do it more across the company. And I'm really excited by helping our teams, stop being so internally focused, get more focused by business unit on winning with customers, and then collaborate where it makes sense to enhance across our portfolio, to bring even more to customers so that the customers win more and we win more. Now in terms of productivity, as Glenn mentioned, their pocket's there where we're doing very well, but there's more we can do on productivity. Ralf Finzel and his production team are really driving tremendous productivity in our operations, and it's still early phase, but they're ramping that up very nicely. We've already had efforts in back office productivity for our corporate functions. That's going okay, but we're going to accelerate that. You'll see more shared service centers and more activity with IT systems to make sure that we're effective serving the businesses and very efficient. So I love what I see. There's so much excellence here, but we've got to get it across the company, and we will.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. Just a question on the Q1 guide. So, it's about 487 [ph] 488 [ph] at midpoint in a seasonally weak quarter. And you noted some nice volume ramping productivity throughout the year. So even annualizing that is above the low end of the guide. So can you help us understand if that guide is just conservative? And then just a small follow-up, when do you expect to see the end of de-stocking within your Pharma Solutions business?\nGlenn Richter: Yes, I'll start with the second. Generally, we've seen de-stocking basically, I'll say it's done everywhere with exception of pharma largely, and it's the second half of the year. Pharma just started late as an industry part of the de-stocking for logical reasons given the margin structure, but we do anticipate the second half of this year to be done with pharma. The Q1 we think is a very reasonable guide, 475 to 500. We have started off the year generally pretty good on the volume side, but we just want to be cautious as we sort of go through the quarter. Generally, the volume slightly lower than the average for the year, so that's a little bit of the impact there, Patrick.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions on cash flow and investment. One, just wants to clarify on the deleveraging targets. It had previously been three times by the end of calendar '24. Are you no longer committing to that timeline? Second, the last slide of the deck references high return growth investment. Can you provide any more clarity on what those are, size, and timing of those? Then finally, Glenn, I think you said earlier a question, the $500 million free cash flow guidance for the year. Can you bridge $2 billion of EBITDA to $500 million free cash flow, but even acknowledging some deal-related charges, cash flow would be down year-on-year, and I just want to make sure I understand the context and implications of that?\nErik Fyrwald: Thank you, Adam. I'll start, and then Glenn can add on. First of all, I fully am aligned with and agree with a target of three times net leverage debt as a target to get to. I think the year end '24, I'd like to see us get there by the end of '24, but we're not going to do something stupid that destroys significant value to get there in '24, but I can tell you we're going to make very good progress at least towards that goal in '24. In terms of high return growth investments alluded to, I'll just reinforce that flavors and fragrances, we call it scent, and health & biosciences are strong business units in great markets. I've been in many chemistry and biological markets. These are great markets, and we're going to invest in them to win.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. So hey, good morning, Adam. So let me take you through the cash flow reconciliation. It's a good question. And I'll start from the top with EBITDA. So the midpoint of our guide is $2 billion. We are forecasting $345 million of interest expense. Cash taxes are roughly $450. That includes the Reg G or transaction related. I'll back them out later. We have networking capital, slightly a negative. We're being a little cautious in terms of the overall full year. Part is just the growth of the business. And then there's miscellaneous, sort of others, about $100 million of other items to get an operating cash flow of $1.50 billion-ish. As we mentioned, we have a CapEx target up this year. We're trying to invest in our growth business of about $540 for the year. That gets us to a free cash flow, including Reg G of $500 million. I would note, as I mentioned, there's $200 million of Reg G items, $100 million of that's transaction, largely taxes, a little bit of other deal costs, but largely taxes. And then there's $100 million of other miscellaneous Reg G items as well. So that gets you to, if you back those out on adjusted free cash flow around $700 million for the year. The other note I'd say, Adam, the biggest shift year-over-year is networking capital. We had an improvement last year of $500 million. We're being sort of conservative and flattish to slightly down this year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Sison: Hey, good morning. Hey, Erik, welcome back. I'm sure you've seen several chemical businesses go awry over the years for a lot of different reasons. What's your sort of playbook in terms of turning around a business and clearly functional ingredients has been a sore spot here? Anything in particular you're going to sort of work on to get that business back? And then, just a quick follow-up on pharma, Glenn, since Erik's only been here a couple weeks. But where do you think margins can get back to for that business? The last two quarters have been pretty light relative to its historical past.\nErik Fyrwald: Well, thanks, Mike. And I'll start with the functional ingredients question. First of all, I like the functional ingredients business. It is a very good business with lots of opportunity to bring value to customers. And by having multiple elements of the solution set, you can bring value in terms of helping customers achieve their goals and what food products they want to have to delight customers, delight consumers. So I think what we really have to do here is, and the team is working on this, is make sure that we're clear on what is our strategy, how are we going to create value in this business, how are we going to make sure that we're focused on the right consumers, excuse me, the right customers in the right way, profitably growing our market share, and how do we make sure that our assets are very competitive, that our costs are very competitive, that we're driving productivity so that we can be competitive with our product portfolio both in terms of the value we bring and the costs to deliver that value. And then we're spending money on innovation. We've got lots of great innovation. Make sure that innovation is tied to real customer needs that they're willing to pay for that can be part of the solution set. And I think that we've taken our eye off the ball, as I said before, too much internal focus, listening to too many consultants going all different directions. We get clear what we're trying to do, what the goals are, and execute well against those goals. This business will significantly improve in 2024 and beyond.\nGlenn Richter: Yes, good morning, Mike. Good to hear your voice. Regarding pharma, as you know, this business quarter-to-quarter can be a little lumpy based on demand. And fourth quarter is typically a lower volume quarter. The margins are always compressed seasonally for the fourth quarter, so it's difficult to look at that. We are very optimistic on the strength of this business and the go-forward plan. We do expect the business to be in approximately the mid-20s from an EBITDA margin this year from a standpoint. And there's tons of other initiatives to continue to drive up the margin further. So I think what you're seeing is a function de-stocking, idle mills, seasonality over the last couple of quarters, but just not reflective of the fundamentals of the business.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks and good morning, everybody. I guess lots of questions, but I'll try to keep it narrow here. So today's IFF was created to provide a suite of products to customers. At least that was the initial idea in merging the legacy IFF into the DuPont business. I guess, Erik, how do you think about that as an effective go-to-market strategy? The corollary to it, we hear a lot from investors that this is arguably a better business, pre-even cruder on, is there a scenario where you can divest nearly all of those assets of the acquired businesses? How integrated are they? Is that possible? And sort of, just holistically thoughts on kind of all of that together, and then just one follow-up to you, Glenn, the flat expected plus three volumes, considering how easy the comparisons are, would still suggest that two years is strongly negative. How do you think about that from a competitiveness standpoint, meaning it would suggest that you're still losing share? And I guess, it's not across all of the businesses equally, but it's still a pretty stark difference relative to your closest peers? Thank you.\nErik Fyrwald: Okay. Thank you. I'll start by saying that I believe that the historical IFF plus the DuPont nutrition and biosciences business are stronger together than they were separately. The potential, the opportunity is greater than it was separately. So I believe in that combination very strongly. Now, as I said before, we haven't executed it well, and I've seen this happen before. When I got to Syngenta almost eight years ago, the seeds in the crop protection businesses had been mushed together, and the focus was on synergies versus having a great crop protection business and a great seeds business. We made clear that we were going to have those two businesses as business units, end-to-end business units. And as soon as we did that, we found out that we had been losing share, losing margin versus the competition. We started regaining that, and by the way, when the business units were clearing what they were trying to do, the synergies grew a lot because there were synergies. I see the same thing here at IFF as we're really good at flavors, at fragrances or scents, at health & biosciences, at food ingredients, those businesses, when they're performing well the synergies will increase, not decrease. The ability to help each other, the different businesses to help each other, to help customers more together will increase, but we've got to get the businesses performing extremely well by themselves and not have synergy of the goal, have synergy of tools. When we do that, I can assure you that the combination will be very strong.\nGlenn Richter: Hey, good morning, Mark. Hey, thanks for the question. You're right, if you look at a three-year stack, we would still be negative over the three-year average by about 1%, 1.5% over, including if you hit the 3% this year. But I would note, as we said in the past, I think you have to sort of think about the performance of the business between 75% and 25%. 75% of the business, our core scent business is forming very well. Flavors has pockets of strength, H&B, both enzymes, probiotics, culture's business are doing well, pharma overall is doing well. It's really the other 25, which is functional ingredients we've talked about, that actually has been a drag on the overall results of the business. So if you separate that, I think you clearly have a very different view in terms of that three-year stack, and the 75% is nicely positive, and I would submit it's in line with competition. For the most part, we have opportunities, as Erik said, to perform better, but it's focused on that 25%. I also will note once again, as we're trying to be realistic, there's prospects that the markets improve more significantly. Certainly the start of the year knock on wood is pretty encouraging, but it's too early to call anything above that range until we see a consistency month-by-month in terms of volumes coming back. So, I appreciate the question.\nErik Fyrwald: The only thing I would add is that even in the 75%, there is significant improvement opportunity, and we've got businesses that are looking at that, and we're going to work with those businesses to support them, both for the businesses to win more and for the corporate cost overheads to be lower and more effective at supporting the businesses. So there is great opportunity, of course, in food ingredients to turn it around, but even the rest of the company to significantly improve performance, and we're going to do it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nSalvator Tiano: Yes, thank you very much. I want to ask a couple of questions on the -- I guess, strategy shifts to grow that you mentioned a little bit more, a few more details. And essentially, as you're trying to reposition the business and gain market share that's becoming the clear focus. What would that mean for R&D spending, SG&A spending, and CapEx in the next few years, not necessarily 2024, but that's almost three or four-year basis? And you made a comment about the 2024 price, that's 2.5% negative, in part being because of competitive pressures, but also because it will allow you to gain some market share. So how are you thinking in this new strategy about the tradeoff between price and volume?\nErik Fyrwald: I'll start, and I think our R&D spend is significant today. I think if you look at what we spend, it's very competitive versus the industry leaders, other industry leaders, but I do think we can focus it better, connect it better to the business units and to customers, and ensure that the R&D efforts are fully aligned with the highest value needs that our customers have. So I think we can get more out of the R&D spend that we have, and where there are areas that we need to spend more R&D, particularly in health &biosciences and flavors and fragrances, we will spend more on R&D. On capital expenditures, I feel similarly that the level of capital expenditures are reasonable, but we have to look at where we're spending it and make sure that it's optimized and we're spending the capital in places that have significant returns, have very good returns, and strengthen the businesses where we need to win.\nGlenn Richter: And I would just add to that, as we mentioned, we're going to be up about 8% year-over-year in CapEx, and at core operational CapEx, which is really supporting growth in our core products is up 10%. So we're in the right range from a CapEx, around 5% of sales in terms of what we need to maintain and grow the business.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time, so I would like to hand the call back to the team for concluding remarks.\nErik Fyrwald: Great. Well, thank you for joining the call this morning. Again, I just want to finish by saying that I'm thrilled to be at IFF. We've got a tremendous team at IFF. We've got great capabilities. We haven't performed to our potential in the past, but I can tell you we're all completely committed to making sure that we unleash the full potential of our businesses and drive the right kind of synergies that enhance each of the businesses, and make customers very pleased, delighted with what we bring in our innovation. And by doing that, possibly grow our market share and through their productivity efforts, make sure we do that with leading margins. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Erik Fyrwald",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today. I would like to begin by sharing some initial perspectives since joining IFF. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a look at the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results before providing commentary on our current outlook for the full year 2024. After that, we'll open the call for Q&A. Now I officially joined IFF on February 6th, and I have been impressed by the world-class teams globally and the strong innovation across our company. I spent the last few weeks visiting our operations and teams in some of our U.S. and overseas businesses. I spent that time listening to our teams, meeting many of our customers, and assessing the current status of our businesses. IFF has a proud history as a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions and a great platform from which-to-build and expand our partnerships with customers across the value chain to help them create leading consumer products. I believe in our purpose to help create a better world through science and creativity applied to sustainably meet customer and consumer needs. The opportunity we have ahead of us is very big, and that is why I joined IFF. We have solid businesses and will take the actions needed to unleash our full potential to start to deliver profitable market share gains by bringing great innovation to win with our customers. A perfect example of this is in our scent business, where we have been outperforming competition, something we must do also across our other businesses. IFF also has other high-quality businesses such as flavors and health and biosciences where we will leverage our innovation to deliver higher growth rates with very attractive profitability. And in some of our challenge businesses, such as functional ingredients, with focus and attention, we can significantly improve performance. In both instances, we will do so by putting the business first, eliminating unnecessary processes and overhead, driving empowerment and strong leadership. And by doing so, IFF will be a more innovative and customer-centric organization that will be effective and efficient. We also must be better executors, focus the IFF team away from distractions to continuously grow market share across all our businesses, put more of our investments into our high-return businesses and transformative R&D initiatives and our IT infrastructure, and achieve our capital structure targets by reducing outstanding debt. And when we do this, over time, I see strong upside and value creation for all IFF's stakeholders. Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through the achievements and factors that marked IFF's progress through the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Now, throughout the past year, IFF FERC [ph] have continued to take important steps to strengthen our financial and operational foundation and position this company to deliver value for the near, mid, and long-term. Our performance in the fourth quarter demonstrates progress. While reported sales were down, comparable currency-neutral sales increased 1% and comparable currency-neutral EBITDA grew 17% with an adjusted margin expansion of 260 basis points. We've also seen notable improvements in volume trends across the majority of our business segments in the second half of the year, enabling us to perform within previously stated guidance ranges for full year 2023 sales and adjusted operating EBITDA. Now, with this progress and the improving performance through the second half of 2023, we exited the year on solid footing, and we are optimistic about our ability to build on this momentum and are targeting getting back to year-on-year growth for the full year 2024 while strengthening for 2025 and beyond. Now, as I said earlier, we are committed to reducing our level of debt. We have therefore announced an update to our dividend policy to reduce the quarterly dividend by approximately 50% to $0.40 per share. This is not a decision the board and management have taken lightly, as we know the dividend is important to shareholders. However, it will enable us to reduce debt faster, strengthening our capital structure, which will create additional long-term value. This will also give the company greater financial flexibility, which will, when required, give us the ability to make more high-return growth investments. I'll now turn it over to Glenn. Glenn? Thank you, Glenn. I'm truly excited to be joining IFF during this transformative time for the company. I have long admired IFF as the category-defining leader in the industry, and it's an honor to be able to work alongside our talented global teams to help us navigate and even thrive at a critical moment for our company and our industry. Through robust efforts from our teams worldwide and shared commitment to putting the customer at the center of all we do, IFF will continue strengthening our commercial execution and become a more nimble and efficient organization. Our global teams made progress towards ensuring we can meet the evolving needs of our customers and deliver industry-competitive returns, and we will accelerate the progress going forward. While 2023 was a challenging year, our financial results in the fourth quarter highlight an improving trend. Based on this performance and some improving market conditions, we are expecting a return to volume growth this year, which should enable EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Our updated dividend policy and the additional divestitures we continue to work on reflects our commitment to improve our capital structure. While the global economic landscape is uncertain, IFF will be focused on strengthening our execution, and as I said, we have work to do to improve our businesses and achieve our vision, but I am confident we are well-positioned to build on our progress and create sustainable value for all stakeholders in 2024 and beyond. I'd like to thank our teams and partners for welcoming me to IFF and look forward to seeing what we'll achieve in 2024. With that, I'd like to now open the call for questions. Thank you. So this is Erik. First of all, I wasn't here a year ago, obviously, but I did arrive on February 6th, looked at our entire situation, talked to Glenn and his team, talked to the board, and made the decision to go ahead and cut the dividend now. I think it's a wise move in terms of our overall balance sheet efforts to get our balance sheet in great shape, and it doesn't impact the divestment timing or strategy. We continue to work on our portfolio optimization, but obviously we're focused even more on working on strengthening the businesses, increasing our earnings and cash flow. Next question. Thank you, Gunther, and glad to be back in the public market. My priorities for 2024, I should say, our priorities for 2024 are to continue the portfolio optimization work and have that be part of improving our balance sheet. But again, more importantly, we're going to strengthen each business. We're going to make sure that each business is clear on how they can strengthen their customer focus to profitably grow market share, strengthen the R&D and innovation in each business so that we better delight customers with our innovation so that we bring innovation that they value, that we can grow our market share with them. And then thirdly, we're going to keep driving productivity and strengthen productivity in each business unit and then also corporately. We want a very effective and efficient back office. What will reduce the amount of engagement we've had with consultants, advisors, and others that have caused us to be too internally focused. We're going to get back to focus on winning with the businesses by better serving our customers than our competition. In terms of how I'm thinking about the midterm targets, it's too early for me to comment, but I'll look at them with the team here and we'll do it by business and then we'll roll it up for the company and we'll get back to you in the not too distant future on that, but on the last one, Glenn? Thanks David. I'll take the first one, and, Glenn, you can have the second piece, because I'm not that familiar with the details at this point, but I'm getting into it. But in terms of any portfolio optimization, we're not going to comment on rumors. All I can tell you is we continue to work on portfolio optimization, and we will not sell a business at a price that doesn't make sense, but we're looking at what does make sense for IFF and for our employees and any business that we might consider divesting. So with that, Glenn? Thank you, Lisa. And I'll take the first part of that question. I've looked very hard at the data over the last five years, and clearly we have underperformed, as all of you know. We have pockets of strength, scent as an example I mentioned in the opening comments, but we have some businesses that are challenged, like food ingredients. What I can tell you is we're going to have each business be very clear on what is their strategy to win. How are they going to delight their customer set and make sure that we profitably grow our market share? How are we going to make sure that we have our innovation targeted and needs the customer's value? And how are we going to make sure we're driving productivity? So each of the business end-to-end, how do we drive the businesses? And as you know, we've got strong businesses in great markets, like our flavors and our fragrances or scent business, terrific businesses that should be able to fully compete with margins and growth rates with Givaudan and others. We've got a strong business unit in Health & Biosciences in great markets, and we should be able to fully compete with margins and growth against Novonesis. In our challenged businesses, we've got very good markets in food ingredients and protein solutions, and we should be able to be fully competitive with Kerry and other food ingredient players. And we've got a very good business and very good markets with pharmaceutical ingredients, and we need to be fully competitive with our ingredients set there, Ashland and others. So, we have not performed as a company, across the company in the last five years like we should. In the next five years, we'll get back on track. Thanks, John. And let me start with the first one. The makeup of our functional ingredients business is better than what it was when I had responsibility for that as part of agriculture and nutrition back at DuPont a number of years ago. So I believe our potential is significantly higher than it was then. I think that it's in a very good market. I think we've underperformed. And I think we've underperformed because we've been too internally focused. We've had lots of consultants. We've had lots of advisors talking about helping us to figure out what to do around synergies. And what I can tell you is, I've been in these businesses for many, many years, these types of businesses. The goal was not synergy. Synergy is a tool. The goal is to have a very clear strategy for our functional ingredients business. How are we going to profitably grow our market share with customers by delighting the customers with our solutions approach, with our innovation, and then do that in a productive way with our assets and our functions, very productive. We have the potential to significantly improve the performance of this business. I've spent time with our business leaders. I think they're headed in the right direction and we're going to further accelerate the progress and make sure that we profitably grow our food ingredients business and fully compete with our competitors, the leading competitors in food ingredients, because we have so much value to bring customers. If we do it right, when we do it right, we'll have a very good business. And then, in terms of the organization structure, no decisions today, but what I will tell you is I'm a big fan of business units that have end-to-end accountability and responsibility to drive all the levers of the P&L, making sure that everything we do is to delight customers, profitably grow our market share, but do it in a way that's efficient and effective so each business unit can win. And I find when business units are winning, all of a sudden synergies become clearer and become more powerful and easier to access. So we're going to ensure that our businesses are on the right track and that our synergies are additive to further strengthen each of our businesses. Now, on your second question, Laurence, my initial impressions of IFF's capabilities are we've got really great people. We've got really great capabilities in each of our businesses, and we have just under-performed. But there are pockets of examples where we are performing tremendously well that give me so much confidence that we can make this happen across the company. I spent time with the leadership of arguably the largest consumer products company in the world, where we have a very strong relationship, very much innovation-driven, their innovation people to make sure that the best consumer products are being developed. And we were meeting both with our scent teams and their fragrance team, and with our Health & Biosciences team and their consumer products teams. And it was the best relationship, the best dynamic that I've ever experienced in my 42 years of customer interactions. And then I had another interaction with the top management of a leading beauty care company in Europe. And same thing, our people were working hand in glove with their people to create great, great consumer products that consumers love. So we can do it. We do it. We just need to do it more across the company. And I'm really excited by helping our teams, stop being so internally focused, get more focused by business unit on winning with customers, and then collaborate where it makes sense to enhance across our portfolio, to bring even more to customers so that the customers win more and we win more. Now in terms of productivity, as Glenn mentioned, their pocket's there where we're doing very well, but there's more we can do on productivity. Ralf Finzel and his production team are really driving tremendous productivity in our operations, and it's still early phase, but they're ramping that up very nicely. We've already had efforts in back office productivity for our corporate functions. That's going okay, but we're going to accelerate that. You'll see more shared service centers and more activity with IT systems to make sure that we're effective serving the businesses and very efficient. So I love what I see. There's so much excellence here, but we've got to get it across the company, and we will. Thank you, Adam. I'll start, and then Glenn can add on. First of all, I fully am aligned with and agree with a target of three times net leverage debt as a target to get to. I think the year end '24, I'd like to see us get there by the end of '24, but we're not going to do something stupid that destroys significant value to get there in '24, but I can tell you we're going to make very good progress at least towards that goal in '24. In terms of high return growth investments alluded to, I'll just reinforce that flavors and fragrances, we call it scent, and health & biosciences are strong business units in great markets. I've been in many chemistry and biological markets. These are great markets, and we're going to invest in them to win. Well, thanks, Mike. And I'll start with the functional ingredients question. First of all, I like the functional ingredients business. It is a very good business with lots of opportunity to bring value to customers. And by having multiple elements of the solution set, you can bring value in terms of helping customers achieve their goals and what food products they want to have to delight customers, delight consumers. So I think what we really have to do here is, and the team is working on this, is make sure that we're clear on what is our strategy, how are we going to create value in this business, how are we going to make sure that we're focused on the right consumers, excuse me, the right customers in the right way, profitably growing our market share, and how do we make sure that our assets are very competitive, that our costs are very competitive, that we're driving productivity so that we can be competitive with our product portfolio both in terms of the value we bring and the costs to deliver that value. And then we're spending money on innovation. We've got lots of great innovation. Make sure that innovation is tied to real customer needs that they're willing to pay for that can be part of the solution set. And I think that we've taken our eye off the ball, as I said before, too much internal focus, listening to too many consultants going all different directions. We get clear what we're trying to do, what the goals are, and execute well against those goals. This business will significantly improve in 2024 and beyond. Okay. Thank you. I'll start by saying that I believe that the historical IFF plus the DuPont nutrition and biosciences business are stronger together than they were separately. The potential, the opportunity is greater than it was separately. So I believe in that combination very strongly. Now, as I said before, we haven't executed it well, and I've seen this happen before. When I got to Syngenta almost eight years ago, the seeds in the crop protection businesses had been mushed together, and the focus was on synergies versus having a great crop protection business and a great seeds business. We made clear that we were going to have those two businesses as business units, end-to-end business units. And as soon as we did that, we found out that we had been losing share, losing margin versus the competition. We started regaining that, and by the way, when the business units were clearing what they were trying to do, the synergies grew a lot because there were synergies. I see the same thing here at IFF as we're really good at flavors, at fragrances or scents, at health & biosciences, at food ingredients, those businesses, when they're performing well the synergies will increase, not decrease. The ability to help each other, the different businesses to help each other, to help customers more together will increase, but we've got to get the businesses performing extremely well by themselves and not have synergy of the goal, have synergy of tools. When we do that, I can assure you that the combination will be very strong. The only thing I would add is that even in the 75%, there is significant improvement opportunity, and we've got businesses that are looking at that, and we're going to work with those businesses to support them, both for the businesses to win more and for the corporate cost overheads to be lower and more effective at supporting the businesses. So there is great opportunity, of course, in food ingredients to turn it around, but even the rest of the company to significantly improve performance, and we're going to do it. I'll start, and I think our R&D spend is significant today. I think if you look at what we spend, it's very competitive versus the industry leaders, other industry leaders, but I do think we can focus it better, connect it better to the business units and to customers, and ensure that the R&D efforts are fully aligned with the highest value needs that our customers have. So I think we can get more out of the R&D spend that we have, and where there are areas that we need to spend more R&D, particularly in health &biosciences and flavors and fragrances, we will spend more on R&D. On capital expenditures, I feel similarly that the level of capital expenditures are reasonable, but we have to look at where we're spending it and make sure that it's optimized and we're spending the capital in places that have significant returns, have very good returns, and strengthen the businesses where we need to win. Great. Well, thank you for joining the call this morning. Again, I just want to finish by saying that I'm thrilled to be at IFF. We've got a tremendous team at IFF. We've got great capabilities. We haven't performed to our potential in the past, but I can tell you we're all completely committed to making sure that we unleash the full potential of our businesses and drive the right kind of synergies that enhance each of the businesses, and make customers very pleased, delighted with what we bring in our innovation. And by doing that, possibly grow our market share and through their productivity efforts, make sure we do that with leading margins. Thank you."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you, Erik, and hello, everyone. Moving to slide seven, as Erik mentioned, the board and management have taken this opportunity to accelerate the improvement of our capital structure as we work towards our deleveraging target of three times net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, we reduced our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. We believe this dividend change provides a dividend yield that is consistent with industry peers and is aligned with IFF's long-term cash flow generation and target payouts. The dividend remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, and we expect this new base to grow alongside our profit over time. IFF remains committed to providing competitive returns to our shareholders and firmly believes these actions set us up for more durable value creation in the long-term. Now, on slide eight, as Erik mentioned, our performance for the fourth quarter reflects the operational and strategic initiatives that our team has implemented over the last several months to deliver strong results amid an uncertain operating environment. Despite some continued challenges in the market, volume trends continue to improve sequentially, with increases in nearly all businesses resulting in growth for total IFF. IFF generated $2.7 billion in sales, representing a 1% increase in comparable currency-neutral sales. This improvement reflected strong growth in our scent business with continued volume pressure in Nourish and Pharma, both impacted by de-stocking. Volumes continue to improve sequentially from down mid-single digits in Q3 to down low single digits in Q4, and if excluding the impact of functional ingredients, volumes for the fourth quarter would have increased low single digits. Adjusted operating EBITDA total $461 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% increase on a comparable currency-neutral basis. We also realized a year-over-year increase of approximately 260 basis points to our comparable currency-neutral-adjusted operating EBITDA margin. This growth in EBITDA was supported by both internal steps IFF has taken, including continued gains and efficiencies from our productivity initiatives and favorable net pricing. Before moving on, I wanted to share that we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter related to our nourish business. The primary drivers of the goodwill impairment are related to lower business projections due to volume declines, mainly in functional ingredients, continued cost inflation, and unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Now moving to slide nine, taking a closer look at our profitability performance for the fourth quarter, we delivered $461 million, which equates to a robust comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 17%. I'm happy to report that in Q4, IFF realized strong productivity gains and in conjunction with favorable net price to inflation, helped us overcome ongoing volume pressures to deliver against our objectives. Importantly, IFF has remained focused on executing upon our productivity program to improve our operational effectiveness and efficiency. In 2023, we continued to launch additional steps as part of these programs while also making strategic investments in key growth areas. Now on slide 10, I'll provide a closer look at our performance by business segment during the quarter. In nourish, sales declined 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis as strong growth in flavors was offset by continued softness in functional ingredients. While functional ingredients remained the main driver of weakness for nourish in the quarter, it is worth noting that we again saw meaningful sequential improvement. In terms of profitability, the positive impact from our ongoing pricing actions and productivity initiatives drove improvements and led to a 3% increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Health & Biosciences continues to show robust top and bottom line growth. Price increases, volume growth and productivity gains led to growth across most H&B business segments led by double-digit growth in health. Overall, H&B delivered a comparable currency-neutral sales increase of 5% year-over-year and a 35% year-over-year increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Our scent segment continued to deliver a very strong performance in Q4, including 11% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales, driven by double-digit growth in consumer fragrance, as well as mid-single-digit growth in Fine fragrance. Like Health & Biosciences, scent also saw significant growth in adjusted operating EBITDA, increasing 34% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven by favorable net pricing, volume, and productivity gains. While Pharma Solutions experienced significant pricing and productivity gains, these improvements were offset by lower volume, driven primarily by continued de-stocking trends, as well as strong year-ago comparison. This led to comparable currency-neutral sales declining 10% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declining 13% in the quarter. Turning to slide 11, I'll discuss our progress in improving our cash flow and leveraged positions. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations totaled $1.44 billion, a significant increase from the previous year, reflecting the strong improvement in inventory levels. CapEx of the year was $503 million, or approximately 4.4% of sales. Our progress on working capital improvement, led by an intense focus on right-sizing our inventories, helped enhance our free cash flow position, which saw a sequential increase of over $500 million, totaling $936 million for the full year and ahead of expectations. Included in our free cash flow is about $430 million of costs, primarily related to integration and transaction-related items. We also delivered $826 million in dividends to our shareholders in 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $729 million, including $26 million in assets held for sale in Q4. Additionally, we realized a $200 million sequential reduction in gross debt, which totaled approximately $10.1 billion for the quarter, with a net debt to credit-adjusted EBITDA a 4.5 times, our trailing 12-month credit-adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.1 billion. With the announced sale of our Lucas Meyer Cosmetics business, which we still expect to close in the first quarter of 2024, the right-sizing of our quarterly dividend and additional portfolio actions we are planning to make, we are taking decisive action to strengthen our balance sheet and achieve our leveraged targets. On slide 12, I'd like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Due to a combination of improvements across our business and in the broader market toward the tail end of 2023, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. For the full year 2024, we expect sales in the range of $10.8 billion to $11.1 billion. This reflects our prudent approach to volume expectations and the impact of modest negative pricing in 2024, which is largely isolated to more price-competitive categories such as functional ingredients and fragrance ingredients, given lower input costs and competitive dynamics. We expect overall pricing to decline approximately 2.5% in 2024, following a 10% increase in 2022 and a 6% increase in 2023. Strategically, we believe this will position us to be more cost-competitive in the market and allow us to regain market share in select businesses. In terms of volume, the visibility to the degree and pace of the recovery remains a bit fluid and has been explicitly incorporated in our 0% to 3% range. The most significant variable impacting this range will be the pace of recovery in functional ingredients. However, this is a marked improvement from 2023, where we finished down mid-single digits and '22 we were down low single digits, as we believe our industry will return to more normalized growth rates. On the bottom line, we expect to deliver full year '24 adjusted operating EBITDA between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Our guidance assumes not just improved volumes from 2023, but also solid profitability and a margin expansion across our segments. We are hyper-focused on continuing to execute our productivity initiatives to help mitigate expected inflation, primary labor costs, and incentive compensation reset, while continuing to reinvest in the higher-return businesses. It's also worth noting, we have some benefit of one-time items such as the negative impact in 2023 from the inventory reduction program and the previously announced write-down of inventory related to Locust Bean Kernel or LBK that will not repeat in 2024. In particular, there was an approximately $130 million impact from the negative absorption in 2023 related to our inventory reduction program and some volume declines, which is down from an estimated $165 million we provided in the third quarter. A portion of this will be offset by higher annual incentive compensation expense as we reset our payout to target levels in 2024. While there's still work to do, efforts to bolster our financial profile and portfolio are providing effective, and while its hard to predict the timing and details of the market recovering and its impact on our results, we see opportunity for improvement in 2024 with all divisions targeting better volumes, with improvements in profitability and margin expansion across all four divisions. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA of approximately $475 million to $500 million. Throughout 2024, we will be relentlessly focused on our efforts to optimize our portfolio, improve financial performance, and reach our deleveraging targets. I'm confident that the actions taken in 2023 and our outlook for improving performance in 2024 will position IFF to capture significant value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Erik for closing remarks. Sure. Yes, good morning, Ghansham. Easily done and a frequently asked question. So if you'll indulge me, I'll start with last year's results at 1980. There are two adjustments to get that to a normalized basis. One is the divestitures, which you're aware of. It's a half a year of savory solutions in FSI, and the LMC will be closed at the end of the quarter, so it's roughly three-quarters of LMC. That's roughly $78 million of normalized impact. And the other factor, which is the same, basically, we had discussed before, we also have included our updated view of foreign exchange, that's $50 million reduction. I'm not sure that was previously discussed from a standpoint. So that gets to a like-for-like base of $18.50. Our volume mix impact for this year is forecasted to be $170 million positive. That is inclusive of the $130 million of positive overlap on absorption. As we noted on our call, that actually came down as the fourth quarter volumes were higher from a production standpoint, so that was slightly different than we had guided. Our net price for the year is basically is zero. That is inclusive of the $44 million of LBK, so that's netted in that number. We can certainly talk more about the pricing dynamics this year. Then we have about a $35 million reset for AIP, so that's a negative, but that's better than we thought. We thought that would be in the 70 range from the standpoint. So I think all of the one-timers being absorption slightly lower, the negative reset on AIP is slightly lower, FX is new, and then the deals basically were all known. The last items are sort of wage, inflation, that's about $120 million, and the productivity is about $150 million in the P&L, so that's sort of consistent with our three-year view. So that adds up to the midpoint of our range of $2 billion. And then relative to the volume question, I think it's very simple to think about our view of this year. The functional ingredients, which is circa less than 25% of the business, we are projecting that to be relatively flattish for the year. All the other businesses actually have growth directly in the 2% to 3% range on a full year basis, a little bit more slower in the beginning of the year and ramping up in the latter, but that's why we mentioned. As we think about that range of guidance, it's functional ingredients is the area that probably gives us the most pause and we've been the most cautious, and that sort of is the difference between the high end of the 3% versus the 0% range. So hopefully that answers the question. Next question. Hi, Josh. Yes. Hey, good morning, Gunther. Our projected free cash flow for this year is $500 million. I would note that that's inclusive and an expectation of $100 million of taxes for the sale of LMC and carryover for savory and then another $100 million for other restructure one-time items. So there's 200 of Reg G, but net of the 200, we're at $500 million for your free cash flow. Yes, thanks. Good morning once again, David. As you point out, we've got three years of very significant pricing to reflective of the inflation environment of 18%, 19% cumulatively. 2.5% is all we're anticipating. That actually reflects sort of overall price decline. So as I mentioned, that price is sort of zero in our P&L. It is highly concentrated in the functional ingredients and the scent ingredient space. And we've been extremely surgical in terms of where we needed to give it back. And at this point, we're pretty much locked in to most of our pricing for the year at this point. So that actually feels like a pretty safe number relative to the plan. Hey, Lisa, this is Glenn. Let me address your second question regarding functional ingredients. So from past conversations, 2021-'22, we had a number of missteps on our part that caused this business to step backwards. Since that, we've been working on basically four major items. One, getting service levels up to the right standard. I'm happy to say for the last year plus, service levels have been at 95% plus across all the business and across the entire globe. Secondly and perhaps most importantly, is getting volume back on track, which is combination of our sales execution pipeline. As we mentioned, that has dramatically picked up over the last year in getting our pricing right in the market, we just talked about that. We've been very smart this year thinking about market-by-market, product-by-product, what makes sense to be competitive, to win and retain business. We feel much better about that. The third item has really been around sort of our general go-to-market strategy, and as Erik has mentioned, be much more focused across the ingredients team, making sure that they own the results. Lastly, it's cost. So we have been really focusing on all of the costs, but largely the 85% that sits in cost of goods. So it's skew rationalization, raw material consolidation, manufacturing footprint consolidation, taking out fixed costs, et cetera, and we're making very good progress. We are seeing successive improvements in volume quarter-to-quarter. Q2 last year was a low watermark. We're actually moving into sort of flattish as we start this year, and we're also continuing to see good expansion in margin. So we have a lot of work to do, as Erik mentioned, but we're beginning to see some progress in terms of what we've been doing. Thank you. Thanks. Two very good questions. So on the pricing of our 2.5%, 80% of our downward pricing is concentrated in functional ingredients and the scent ingredients business. Those areas, by definition, are more commoditized, and in addition, those areas have seen some more meaningful deflation in terms of commodities. So it's natural. As I mentioned previously, we were doing a very good job of making sure we're competitive in the market by product, by region, and we feel good that that 2.5% sort of is reflective of the environment. The second question regarding why are we not more optimistic? Honestly, we're just cautious. We're very cautious and prudent given the environment. The last year was extremely bumpy. We do believe that de-stocking for most of our business is largely behind us, and we're seeing positive signs, but we need a couple of quarters of positive momentum, I think, and stabilization before we can move from cautious to optimistic. Yes, so I think for the H&B had a very good year and that was a result of a progressive improvement in volumes. As we noted, the health business, one of our largest segments, actually had a very good fourth quarter. Secondarily, productivity, so we've driven a lot of productivity across the business. And third, really net price. So there's been -- to your second question, a decline in input cost in that business as well. So that got us to the 30% range for the business. I did note on the call that we are anticipating H&B like all four of our businesses that demonstrate both EBITDA growth and margin expansion this year. So we expect that to be the case for H&B. In general, our input costs, as I mentioned, are anticipated to be down this year. Energy is flattish at this point, logistics are down, and we're seeing some raw materials deflation. As a reminder, it takes about four months for a purchase to run through the balance sheet. So that's a positive momentum. That's a net zero, as I mentioned, for the overall enterprise for the year. So thanks for the question. Yes, thanks. This is Glenn. I'll answer the first part of your question. In general, we're pretty cautious on our outlook on volume. So we're, as I mentioned, flattish to three. So we haven't expected a giant recovery this year in our base case. So that's kind of a starting point. In the absence of that materializing, we have been very good at delivering productivity, as Erik mentioned in his opening comments. We are accelerating both ongoing efforts, and we have additional efforts underway to take costs out that aren't reflected in the plan. So that would be my second comment. Relative to the de-leverage, so that gives you some sense on the earnings profile and offsets if there's additional softness in the external market. The de-leverage will largely be accomplished through divestitures. As Erik mentioned, we are on path. We feel very good in terms of our activities underway, and we do think we'll accomplish our targeted divestitures, which will be the biggest driver of achieving our de-leveraged goal. Yes, I'll start with the second. Generally, we've seen de-stocking basically, I'll say it's done everywhere with exception of pharma largely, and it's the second half of the year. Pharma just started late as an industry part of the de-stocking for logical reasons given the margin structure, but we do anticipate the second half of this year to be done with pharma. The Q1 we think is a very reasonable guide, 475 to 500. We have started off the year generally pretty good on the volume side, but we just want to be cautious as we sort of go through the quarter. Generally, the volume slightly lower than the average for the year, so that's a little bit of the impact there, Patrick. Yes. So hey, good morning, Adam. So let me take you through the cash flow reconciliation. It's a good question. And I'll start from the top with EBITDA. So the midpoint of our guide is $2 billion. We are forecasting $345 million of interest expense. Cash taxes are roughly $450. That includes the Reg G or transaction related. I'll back them out later. We have networking capital, slightly a negative. We're being a little cautious in terms of the overall full year. Part is just the growth of the business. And then there's miscellaneous, sort of others, about $100 million of other items to get an operating cash flow of $1.50 billion-ish. As we mentioned, we have a CapEx target up this year. We're trying to invest in our growth business of about $540 for the year. That gets us to a free cash flow, including Reg G of $500 million. I would note, as I mentioned, there's $200 million of Reg G items, $100 million of that's transaction, largely taxes, a little bit of other deal costs, but largely taxes. And then there's $100 million of other miscellaneous Reg G items as well. So that gets you to, if you back those out on adjusted free cash flow around $700 million for the year. The other note I'd say, Adam, the biggest shift year-over-year is networking capital. We had an improvement last year of $500 million. We're being sort of conservative and flattish to slightly down this year. Yes, good morning, Mike. Good to hear your voice. Regarding pharma, as you know, this business quarter-to-quarter can be a little lumpy based on demand. And fourth quarter is typically a lower volume quarter. The margins are always compressed seasonally for the fourth quarter, so it's difficult to look at that. We are very optimistic on the strength of this business and the go-forward plan. We do expect the business to be in approximately the mid-20s from an EBITDA margin this year from a standpoint. And there's tons of other initiatives to continue to drive up the margin further. So I think what you're seeing is a function de-stocking, idle mills, seasonality over the last couple of quarters, but just not reflective of the fundamentals of the business. Hey, good morning, Mark. Hey, thanks for the question. You're right, if you look at a three-year stack, we would still be negative over the three-year average by about 1%, 1.5% over, including if you hit the 3% this year. But I would note, as we said in the past, I think you have to sort of think about the performance of the business between 75% and 25%. 75% of the business, our core scent business is forming very well. Flavors has pockets of strength, H&B, both enzymes, probiotics, culture's business are doing well, pharma overall is doing well. It's really the other 25, which is functional ingredients we've talked about, that actually has been a drag on the overall results of the business. So if you separate that, I think you clearly have a very different view in terms of that three-year stack, and the 75% is nicely positive, and I would submit it's in line with competition. For the most part, we have opportunities, as Erik said, to perform better, but it's focused on that 25%. I also will note once again, as we're trying to be realistic, there's prospects that the markets improve more significantly. Certainly the start of the year knock on wood is pretty encouraging, but it's too early to call anything above that range until we see a consistency month-by-month in terms of volumes coming back. So, I appreciate the question. And I would just add to that, as we mentioned, we're going to be up about 8% year-over-year in CapEx, and at core operational CapEx, which is really supporting growth in our core products is up 10%. So we're in the right range from a CapEx, around 5% of sales in terms of what we need to maintain and grow the business."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you may have at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Clyburn: Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin by providing an overview of our performance in the third quarter and an update on our strong execution to position IFF for long-term success. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results by business and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. We will then open the call for questions. Moving to Slide 6. Our third quarter story is one of sequential improvement. As we've discussed, improving volumes has been a top priority, and we are pleased with the sequential volume improvements that we have achieved across the majority of our business. On a total company basis, while our volume in the third quarter was down mid-single digits, it was a marked improvement from our Q2 lows where we saw a double-digit decline. Similarly, our enhanced productivity initiatives as well as favorable price to inflation led to strong adjusted operating EBITDA results. Sequentially, our adjusted operating EBITDA margin finished at 17.9%, which is a 50 basis point improvement versus the second quarter of 2023. And our focus on ongoing working capital improvements drove strong free cash flow generation. In particular, the continued execution of our inventory reduction program has resulted in more than a $600 million reduction in inventory since the end of 2022. This was the largest driver of our free cash flow, which improved $320 million versus the second quarter of '23. The net result is that we delivered higher than our expectations on both the top and bottom line. At the same time, our commercial excellence initiatives in our R&D platform continue to drive improvements in our sales pipeline. In addition, in Functional Ingredients, as discussed on our second quarter call, we are implementing a targeted operational improvement plan to improve sales execution, strengthen our operating model and reshape the portfolio. As we shared previously, we expect this plan for Functional Ingredients will translate into low single-digit comparable currency-neutral sales growth in line with the market and a mid-teen adjusted operating EBITDA margin over the next 3 years with a strong improvement in 2024. And while this will take time, we are seeing improvements in our volume performance, where we finished the quarter down mid-teens versus low 20% declines in Q2 of 2023. With this momentum, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver within our previously announced full year '23 sales guidance range and we are now targeting the mid- to high end of our full year 2023 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range. As Glenn will highlight, we are seeing signs of green shoots in the fourth quarter, with stabilization and improvements across several parts of our business. Lastly, we've made important progress against our portfolio optimization initiatives as we are rapidly addressing our capital structure. Most notably, aligned with our best owner mindset, we announced an agreement to sell Lucas Meyer Cosmetics to specialty chemical company, Clariant, for $810 million, which is equivalent to a high teens multiple based on our projections. We expect to complete the transaction in the early part of the first quarter of 2024, and all proceeds will support our deleveraging priorities. Moving forward, we continue to pursue strategic noncore divestitures that will drive further deleverage and enable us to further prioritize our fastest-growing margin-accretive businesses and deliver long-term value for shareholders. Moving to Slide 7. In the third quarter, IFF generated $2.8 billion in sales, representing a 3% decline on the comparable currency-neutral basis. A strong performance in Scent and Health & Biosciences was more than offset by softness in Nourish and Pharma Solutions. As I mentioned, volumes improved sequentially across nearly all businesses with particularly strong performance in Scent and Health & Biosciences. Excluding Functional Ingredients, which continues to disproportionately impact our results, overall volume declined low to single digits in the third quarter. Adjusted operating EBITDA for the quarter was $506 million, down 10% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Our favorable net price to inflation as well as enhanced productivity gains were more than offset by lower volumes due primarily to temporary customer destocking and unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $0.89, primarily impacted by lower profitability. Now I'll turn it over to Glenn to provide more detail on profitability and our performance by business segment.\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Frank, and good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Taking a closer look at our profitability performance on Slide 8. As Frank mentioned, we delivered higher-than-expected EBITDA of $506 million in the third quarter. While we continue to benefit from favorable price to inflation and productivity gains, as you can see from the slide, ongoing volume pressures impacted our profitability in the quarter. While we are encouraged by the sequential volume improvement, we have seen across most of our portfolio, it remained the primary pressure in Q3. If we look at our profitability performance, absent the unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory improvement program, adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined 6% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Note that our negative absorption in the quarter was less than expected as our inventory reduction program for the year has run its course and volumes have improved. We have done a good job at driving working capital improvement through our inventory reduction program, driving more than $600 million reduction in inventory since the end of '22. As a result, at this time, we are now expecting approximately a $165 million impact from negative absorption to profitability for the full year, down from $180 million. This could also flex further as the fourth quarter unfolds. To reiterate, this is a onetime transitory impact to the P&L in order to maximize cash flow moving forward. Turning to Slide 9. I'll provide a closer look at our Q3 performance by business segment. In Nourish, sales declined 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven mainly by the continued weakness in Functional Ingredients. While Functional Ingredients remained a main driver of weakness in Nourish in the third quarter, we did see sequential improvement and expect this to continue as we move into the fourth quarter. Good growth in our Flavors business and the positive impact of IFF's ongoing pricing actions and productivity initiatives were more than offset by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption. Together, this led to a 26% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Health & Bioscience continued to deliver strong results in Q3, led by meaningful growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Grain Processing, Home & Personal Care and Animal Nutrition leading to comparable currency-neutral growth of 2% year-over-year. Price increases and productivity gains led to a 12% year-over-year increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Scent was once again our strongest performer, delivering 7% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance and high single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance. Like Health & Biosciences, Scent also saw strong 19% growth in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA with profitability driven by favorable net pricing and productivity gains. Pharma Solutions growth rate was pressured this quarter, in large part due to a very strong prior year comparison with a 28% 2022 sales growth comparison and a 76% '22 adjusted operating EBITDA comparison. Price increases and productivity gains for this business were more than offset by lower volumes and comparable currency neutral sales declined 9% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 34% in the quarter. Now on Slide 10, I'll discuss our cash flow and leverage position. Cash flow from operations totaled $795 million, a significant increase, reflecting a strong improvement in inventory levels. CapEx year-to-date was $390 million or approximately 4.4% of sales. Our inventory reduction program and working capital improvements have also greatly contributed to IFF's improved free cash flow performance, which totaled $405 million, a significant increase of $320 million from the second quarter. Year-to-date, we also distributed $619 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $652 million, which includes $23 million in assets held for sale. Additionally, gross debt for the quarter totaled approximately $10.3 billion, with a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 4.6x. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.1 billion. We are making good progress on working down our debt levels. And as Frank mentioned earlier, portfolio optimization remains a near-term priority as we work to reduce our leverage position and ensure our resources are focused on the businesses that will carry our success into the future. The sale of our Cosmetic Ingredients business, which is expected to close in the early part of the first quarter 2024 will further support our strength in capital structure as we pay down debt in line with our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA targets. Now on Slide 11, I would like to focus on our consolidated outlook for the rest of the year. First, we are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance range of $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, which reflects the improved momentum we are seeing across the majority of our business and accounts for the macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange impact, which we expect will persist through the end of the year. On the bottom line, we are now expecting to deliver full year 2023 adjusted operating EBITDA at the mid to high end of our previously announced guidance of $1.85 billion to $2 billion, driven primarily by favorable price to inflation and improved productivity. We also now expect full year interest expense to be slightly higher at approximately $450 million. Our projected effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 21%, the same estimate we provided last quarter. Finally, as we look to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect an improving trend in the majority of our businesses as we navigate the macroeconomic challenges impacting our industry. We are seeing signs of green shoots in the fourth quarter, with stabilization improvements across several parts of our business. As we near the end of the year, I know many of you have questions on 2024. While the macroeconomic environment remains volatile with low visibility, we are optimistic heading into the new year. We have several known one-off items that we have high level of confidence will be tailwinds, including significant negative absorption related to our successful inventory reduction program and onetime Locust Bean Kernel inventory write-down. Also, we will continue to execute on our cost and productivity initiatives and have a carryover benefit from this year's restructuring program. These, of course, will be partially offset by a reset of our annual incentive compensation program where we have reduced payments in 2023 related to our performance versus target. In the end, improved volume performance will be critical to our success, and we believe that destocking will largely be done as we exit the year and we also believe we will benefit from acceleration of our strategic transformation initiatives. We will provide our 2024 guidance with our fourth quarter results, which we expect to be towards the end of February. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Frank for closing remarks.\nFrank Clyburn: Thank you, Glenn. Let me start by saying that I am tremendously proud of what our teams have accomplished in the last quarter to advance our focused strategic initiatives and build a stronger, more resilient IFF. Our improved performance, productivity gains and reaffirmed financial guidance reflect the hard work of our global teams that continue to support our long-term vision. We executed against our strategic priorities in Q3, and we'll continue to take action in Q4 to build a stronger IFF, better positioned to accelerate growth, expand margins and deliver value for shareholders. Finally, looking at our business more broadly, we will continue to pursue portfolio optimization initiatives to strengthen our capital structure. As we've discussed previously, we are laser-focused on investing in our highest-return businesses while positioning our less margin-accretive businesses for success, either through new ownership or through focused improvement plans, such as those we're pursuing for Functional Ingredients. Our goal, as we move through the end of 2023 and beyond is to ensure that each of our businesses has the resources and where appropriate, the ownership most conducive to accelerating our growth, expanding our margins and maximizing our long-term returns as we continue to innovate for customers worldwide. With that, I will now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein.\nGunther Zechmann : Frank, my question to you. Could you please talk about the development in the Functional Ingredients part of the business? It looks like a V-shaped recovery, but any color you could give around the moving parts within that business on the top line and the ramp-up, what you mentioned around the fixed cost measures that you're taking would be great.\nFrank Clyburn: Gunther, it\u2019s Frank. A couple of things. One, with regards to Functional Ingredients, the business clearly across all of ingredients is stabilizing, Gunther, and we saw good sequential improvement when I look at Q2 to Q3, in particular, in 3 of the biggest business lines, core texturants, some multipliers, sweeteners and protein solutions, good sequential improvement. So that\u2019s a very positive sign for us. And obviously, those products are going into some of our key dairy and bakery end market categories. As far as the Functional Ingredient plan overall, we\u2019re focused in 3 areas: one, enhance our go-to-market approach; two, drive operational efficiencies; and three, really reshaping the product portfolio. And since we\u2019ve announced we\u2019ve added targeted commercial professionals to pursue incremental opportunities with our customers, we\u2019ve also reviewed our organization and we\u2019re in the process of adjusting our operating model, Gunther, to drive greater efficiencies throughout. And at the same time, we have completed a full review of our product lines, and we\u2019re in the process of investing behind our strongest products as well as rationalizing those that are underperforming. Team is urgently acting to drive better performance across Functional Ingredients. And the net result of this Gunther will be \u2013 we\u2019re very confident we can grow sales in line with the market and deliver a mid-teen adjusted operating EBITDA margin over the next 3 years. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.\nMike Sison : Nice quarter. Frank, deleveraging is an important part of your thesis going forward. And can you maybe provide an update on your divestiture process? I think there's press out there that Pharma potentially is up for sale and how that fits in your strategy?\nGlenn Richter: Mike, it's Glenn. Why don't I attempt to start it, and then Frank can sort of add into it. So just we have been very transparent for many, many quarters that continue to enhance the portfolio, i.e., refine it is the key enabler of getting to our future leverage goals. We were pleased to announce in the quarter the sale of Lucas Meyers Cosmetics for $810 million gross proceeds. That should net about $730 million net. All of that will be used for divestitures. And the company went for a circa 18 multiple based on this year's forecast earnings. So we're pleased by that. We have a number of other additional portfolio actions underway. We have not publicly mentioned Pharma, but as you noted, it's in the press from that standpoint. We are confident that these actions will get us to where we need to, which is a 3x or less leverage ratio. Relative to your question around Pharma. Pharma is a very good business. It's a sticky business. It's in a very healthy sector in terms of the Pharma business. But candidly, it has relatively limited overlap in terms of end customers. For the rest of IFF, there are limited revenue or other synergies across the complex with Pharma. And to answer your question regarding how Pharma fits into our overall framework. As a reminder, Pharma was sort of in the middle of the pack in terms of ROIC. It has a relatively high-return business, which is the excipients, all that 75% and then has a lower return, more industrial business on that. So I think that -- I don't know, Frank, do you want to add anything else to that?\nFrank Clyburn: No, I think we can go. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas.\nNicola Tang: Actually, Frank and Glenn, you both commented that volume performance improved sequentially through Q3, and you pointed to signs of green shoots. So I was wondering if you could give more color either by division or by specific end markets in terms of where you're seeing that improvement? And what's your latest assessment of customer inventory levels overall, do you think that destocking is now behind us?\nGlenn Richter: Thanks for the question. It was interesting to see literally essentially every single sub-business within Nourish, H&B and Scent had a sequential improvement in volumes from Q2 to Q3. So it was very broad-based in terms of the performance improvements we saw. I\u2019d say, in general, the HPC categories were stronger from an absolute volume standpoint than the food and bev, which is not surprising given what\u2019s happening from a consumer demand standpoint. Pharma was the one exception. Pharma actually had volumes down. I would note, though, they had an incredibly strong third quarter of last year. They had a plus 12% in terms of volumes. So there\u2019s a bit of an overlap. We had converted a system in Q2 of last year. So there was a bit of a backlog of orders, which were cleared up in Q3. So a little bit of a normalization from the standpoint. Relative to your question on destocking, it\u2019s very difficult to say per se. However, our feedback from our business is, we would say that the majority of the customers at this point are either done or expected to be winding down by the end of the fourth quarter. I think the one segment that\u2019s a little bit of a lagger is Pharma. The Pharma business in terms of the customers started destocking a little bit later. It has a meaningful distributor component of the business as well and also the industrial side. And I think that\u2019s also been reflected very clearly in the competitive side for the Pharma business as well. So knock on wood, things are sort of moving very broad based across the entire business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho.\nJohn Roberts: Scent benefited from favorable price versus raws. Was that both sequential and year-over-year? Are you getting more price sequentially? And how are you thinking about 2024?\nGlenn Richter: John, this is Glenn again. By the way, welcome to your new home. So relative to Scents, sequentially, it\u2019s relatively neutral, Q2 to Q3 in terms of the net price versus cost, although it is less moving, less price and more cost. So we\u2019re now seeing the effects of the deflation basically moving through more so. And year-over-year, slightly higher in the third quarter versus the second quarter. As a reminder, in our core markets being the consumer and Fine Fragrance, our final pricing actions were implemented at the beginning of this year. So really what we\u2019re now beginning to do \u2013 and there was some implementation in the second quarter of last year, so we\u2019re now sort of fully overlapped last year from a neutrality standpoint, and what we\u2019ll be seeing more is the cost reduction. One important asterisk, we have a percent of our business, as you know, that\u2019s basically sells ingredients. About 50% of the production is used for our own products and 50% sold. There\u2019s a commodity component such as turpentine as an example, Galaxolide, which is somewhat commoditized. So the pricing dynamic is a little bit more on a downward cycle given those categories. But in general, the net price cost is generally very stable in the Scent business. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan : So I guess I'm curious about how you think about your volume performance relative to peers as it appears that they're still outgrowing you all. I suppose somewhat related maybe to the last question, but bigger picture, it looks like pricing was a much smaller contributor sequentially. Does that factor into how you think about volumes? And then just lastly, tied together, when do you think your sales can go back to the long-term algorithm?\nFrank Clyburn: Mark, it\u2019s Frank. Let me take that one. And a couple of things that I really wanted to highlight on this question. So first, we spent a lot of time, obviously, with our teams throughout the quarter and at the end of the quarter, looking at our competitive dynamics and how we are positioned. And to highlight, maybe if you could give me a minute just to walk through some of our key business lines. So Flavors, for instance, Mark, we actually grew the business this quarter. And feel very good about our performance, in particular, in North America and Greater Asia and a very well positioned against our competitive set. Health & Biosciences, you actually saw growth versus prior year, Mark, which was very encouraging. And in fact, you saw growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition. Home & Personal Care was a good growth quarter for us. Grain Processing, good growth from a sales perspective as well. And then if I look at our Scent business, our Scent business actually grew above market, Mark. Consumer Fragrance above market. So clearly growing market share there. And then also our Fine Fragrance business had good performance. So I feel really good about this Scent performance versus prior year. And then also as we\u2019ve already highlighted across just about all of our business lines, good sequential improvement. So when I look at our overall business, I feel really good about the sequential improvement. The one area that we do have disproportionate volume declines versus our competitors as we\u2019ve highlighted is Functional Ingredients. If you were to exclude Functional Ingredients, Mark, our volume would be down low single digits. So we feel as though we\u2019re well within our peer set there. And like I said, we feel very good about the majority of our business and how we\u2019re performing. And then the other one that we have highlighted, Mark, was with regards to Pharma. But Pharma, as we\u2019ve mentioned, had a very strong competitive quarter last year. So that\u2019s more of a competitive issue for us in this quarter compared to last quarter of last year. But all in all, Mark, we feel as though the overall business is sequentially improving and is in a really good position as we head into 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Frank, on Pharma Solutions, can you comment on the sequential margin decline? Was it more mix or more costs? And what does this mean for you, do you think for margins in Q4 and next year for Pharma?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, David. So Pharma, as we mentioned, the comparison versus prior year, as we highlighted, was a 28% growth. Last year with a lot of shipment catch-up as we implemented in some SAP shipments that went into Q3 of \u201822. And then EBITDA growth last year was 76%. So that was the comparator versus last year. And obviously, you can see that we\u2019re down 9% on the top line this year because of that comparator. If you look sequentially, Mark, you do see some choppiness, as Glenn highlighted earlier. There are some distributors that are starting to rightsize inventory in this business. That is something that we see more of a destocking as we ended kind of Q3. And as we go into Q4, we anticipate that the inventory destocking will continue. With that said, we think it\u2019s temporary in nature. I have no concerns about the overall outlook for the Pharma business, very sticky business. Our core Pharma position is \u2013 what should I say, our core Pharma business is well positioned with our customers. So destocking by our distributors, rightsizing inventory, temporary in nature, and we feel good about the growth potential performance as we go into \u201824 and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.\nAdam Samuelson : So Glenn, in your prepared remarks and hoping you could just maybe elaborate a little bit around some of the high-level puts and takes as they stand today for 2024 EBITDA versus 2023. Obviously, there's the absence of the inventory absorption charges, the inventory write-off in the second quarter. You've got headwinds on incentive comp, and if you can quantify that? It doesn't sound like there's a lot -- at this point, should we be thinking about a lot of price cost tailwinds? You're going to have the divestiture kind of impact. But can you help us think about productivity kind of savings that we should be kind of thinking about going into 2024 on a year-over-year basis? And then from there, is the major swing really just volumes and the operating leverage associated with that? Or is there anything else that you would highlight?\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Adam. So let me kind of break that down into 2 components. One, just normalizing, I\u2019ll say, the onetime items from this year into next year and then talk a little bit about 2024. In terms of normalizing this year, first thing you do is you have to take out $75 million of EBITDA related to divestitures. So that\u2019s roughly 6 months of Savory Solutions and then FSI, or Fragrance Specialty Ingredients business. And then basically a full year directionally for LMC, that\u2019s about $75 million in earnings. In addition, you have to add back the impact of absorption which goes away. That absorption is related to the inventory reduction. So as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve taken out nearly $600 million of volume-related inventory this year. That\u2019s about $165 million benefit. On top of that, the LBK write-off in the second quarter was $44 million. And then lastly, in terms of sort of add normal items, I would add about $25 million of additional benefit associated with the annualization of our headcount reduction program this year. Offsetting that, as you mentioned, is roughly $70 million-ish of basically truing up our incentive plans back to 100% given this is a challenging year, they\u2019ll pay out at a lower percentage. So those are the normalized items I would take the sort of baseline the 2023 results. Candidly, relative to \u201824, we are \u2013 we\u2019ll be prepared to have a very fulsome discussion at the February call. We\u2019re in mid-planning process right now. We\u2019re working with all the businesses in terms of their plans from volume, net price, procurement on deflation, productivity programs, et cetera. So it\u2019s a little early to talk about those components at this point, but we promise you, we\u2019ll have a very detailed discussion in February.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi.\nPatrick Cunningham : Just a follow-up on positive absorption or just absorption coming off next year. What percentage of the portfolio is build-to-order versus build-to-stock? And are there any specific businesses where that split is skewed towards one or the other?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. And I wouldn't say that those that are built-to-order don't have absorption impact because they do. But to answer your question, we're roughly 55% build-to-stock, 45% build-to-order in terms of the overall portfolio. So the build-to-stock is more the legacy DuPont or N&B portfolio versus a legacy FNF for the build-to-order. So as a result, that Nourish is split, probably slightly more build-to-stock and build-to-order, but a combination of the Ingredients business, the food systems and then the -- obviously, the Flavors business, the H&B and Pharma businesses are largely build-to-stock and the Scent business is largely build-to-order.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman : I was curious if you guys could talk a little bit about pricing. Pricing in the quarter came through a bit stronger, I think, than we had anticipated. And so just curious about that because I didn't think that there was any incremental pricing going through. So maybe it was just sort of stickiness, but would love some detail on that.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. It\u2019s more related to deflation than price per se. Pricing \u2013 actually, all of our pricing was implemented earlier this year. We really have not been implementing any more pricing actions this year. So it\u2019s really been the favorability associated with deflation that enhance our earnings versus expectations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.\nJosh Spector: So I was just wondering if you could give an update on free cash flow. What your expectations are for this year now? And just given you scaled back your inventory, I guess your manufacturing headwind from inventory adjustments, does that mean you're done? Or is there more opportunistic inventory reduction to do to shore up free cash flow further?\nGlenn Richter: So the second part \u2013 Josh, this is Glenn. So the second part of your question, we are largely done with the inventory reductions. We\u2019re basically going to be largely flatlined for the balance of the year. Relative to our free cash flow estimates for the year, they are unchanged versus our previous quarter. We will be, call it, circa $450 million on reported free cash flow for the year. I will note, once again, that includes about $440 million-ish of Reg G items. So we\u2019re right around $900 million of adjusted free cash flow for the year. Just as a reminder of those Reg G items, they\u2019re broken down into about a little over half of them, call it, about $240 million are literally associated with our divestitures. A big portion of those are taxes, not surprisingly. We also have another roughly $80 million of the final integration costs. Those are associated with systems conversion and legal entity changes from DuPont. Those will be completed this year. And then there\u2019s about $75 million-ish related to restructure. That\u2019s from the implementation of this year, and then, call it, $50 million-ish sort of all other related expenses. So that\u2019s sort of a breakdown of the Reg G items.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.\nLaurence Alexander : Can you update how much of your business ex Pharma is in the fix or shift category? And how much it needs to improve in aggregate or on average for you to be happy with it? I mean like not just like a minimum threshold, but what your like 3- to 5-year target might be?\nGlenn Richter: When you reference fix or shift, I'm assuming you're talking about the Ingredients business, so is that correct?\nLaurence Alexander : Most of it, but I guess I'm fishing for if you have anything else that you're now putting in that category?\nGlenn Richter: That's largely -- it's 90% of it. And as we mentioned, that business is of our total businesses about 20% to 25% of the total portfolio. And Frank outlined on the call previously, the major initiatives. It will take some time to fully implement those initiatives. So we are seeing some progression improvement in the business. But we're ways away from sort of getting back to sort of the full historical level of both earnings profile and growth. Our target is to go from largely a high single-digit EBITDA margin level to mid-teens and to basically get the business basically growing in line with the industry which historically has been sort of on a volume basis, 1% to 2% a year.\nFrank Clyburn: And this is Frank. What I would add is on that 20% Glenn mentions and a number of those have \u2013 assets have been disposed and we continue down the path of optimizing our portfolio as we\u2019ve highlighted. And then within Functional Ingredients, as we\u2019ve mentioned, we are making good progress, as I highlighted earlier, and that\u2019s really where the majority of the improvement area needs to be. But I don\u2019t want to lose also sight of the 80% or so of the businesses we\u2019ve been highlighting today that has seen good sequential improvement in a number of businesses that actually grew versus prior year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck with JPMorgan.\nSilke Kueck: Is there a $70 million SG&A benefit this year from the compensation changes? And did most of that occur in the third quarter? And secondly, if there's a $160 million headwind from unfavorable manufacturing absorption, which is 150 basis points headwind to gross margin. Do you expect as a base case, your gross margin to be up by 150 basis points next year? And do you need volume growth in order to achieve that?\nGlenn Richter: I think to the second question, you should definitely normalize the absorption as a starting point. The ultimate margin dynamics for next year, which we\u2019ll discuss in more detail in February, will be a combination of mix, volume growth and ultimately, any additional sort of price inflationary pressures. So it\u2019s a complex. I don\u2019t think you can just straight line the improvement. I think you can reset the baseline, but then you have to sort of think through all the variables of what\u2019s driving the gross margin rate for next year. So we\u2019ll park that, come back to that in February. The $70 million that we've referenced really are the savings from headcount reductions we've implemented this year. So as a reminder, there was a program that where we\u2019ve targeted $100 million of annualized cost reduction, so roughly $70 million, $75 million of that this year and then about $25 million will be the annualized impact. It\u2019s all been implemented. So it\u2019s all done. So it\u2019s really just a timing element of that. And then lastly, there\u2019s always some choppiness quarter-to-quarter because of accruals around variable incentives. So depending on up or down, things can get trued up and can be a little bit choppy. So that does affect the quarter-to-quarter RSA as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America.\nSalvator Tiano : Yes. I wanted to ask if you can remind us a little bit your exposure to some of the key soybean -- sorry, well, to the soybean price as well as to key oil seeds, vegetable oils? And whether the recent -- previously decline in some of these edible oils can be a meaningful contributor to '24 EBITDA?\nGlenn Richter: I would say 2 things. We have a very, very large basket of raws. So there\u2019s lots of things moving in either direction. In general, the cost trends or deflation trends are working in our favor. So that\u2019s a general statement. Relative to soy, we do actually lock in over time. We typically hedge out for a period. So we don\u2019t necessarily always capture either the immediate upside or downside, but over the longer arc, obviously, as those prices decline, we capture it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Keches with Barclays.\nAndrew Keches: Congrats on the quarter. Just to confirm, in the past, you've mentioned the 3.0x net debt-to-EBITDA as a level you plan to hit in 2024. So I guess just based on where you are in the asset sale discussions, do you still have confidence and visibility into achieving that level next year? Or is there some risk that, that gets extended? I know the covenant horizon was pushed out about a year to early '26. So any help on the time line would be great.\nGlenn Richter: We are -- great question, Andrew. We're very confident that relative to our current M&A activity in the market, it will allow us to accomplish our goal of 3x or less. And it should be -- we should be able to accomplish it by the end of next year. This is always a -- there's always, I'll say, a timing element relative to closing transactions given the separation, legal entity changes, those sort of things. But barring sort of a normal path, we should be in good shape by the end of next year.\nOperator: That will conclude the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Frank for closing remarks.\nFrank Clyburn: So first, I want to start by thanking all of our IFF FERC colleagues around the world and all of the tremendous work that they are focused on to really help our customers and to continue to innovate. Our vision as a company is truly to be the innovative leader in essential solutions, and we\u2019re very proud of the progress that we\u2019re making through this quarter. And I also want to thank everyone for joining our call. We look forward to our fourth quarter update and full year guidance for \u201824 update in February, and I wish everyone well, and thanks for joining our call.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I will begin by providing an overview of our performance in the third quarter and an update on our strong execution to position IFF for long-term success. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results by business and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. We will then open the call for questions. Moving to Slide 6. Our third quarter story is one of sequential improvement. As we've discussed, improving volumes has been a top priority, and we are pleased with the sequential volume improvements that we have achieved across the majority of our business. On a total company basis, while our volume in the third quarter was down mid-single digits, it was a marked improvement from our Q2 lows where we saw a double-digit decline. Similarly, our enhanced productivity initiatives as well as favorable price to inflation led to strong adjusted operating EBITDA results. Sequentially, our adjusted operating EBITDA margin finished at 17.9%, which is a 50 basis point improvement versus the second quarter of 2023. And our focus on ongoing working capital improvements drove strong free cash flow generation. In particular, the continued execution of our inventory reduction program has resulted in more than a $600 million reduction in inventory since the end of 2022. This was the largest driver of our free cash flow, which improved $320 million versus the second quarter of '23. The net result is that we delivered higher than our expectations on both the top and bottom line. At the same time, our commercial excellence initiatives in our R&D platform continue to drive improvements in our sales pipeline. In addition, in Functional Ingredients, as discussed on our second quarter call, we are implementing a targeted operational improvement plan to improve sales execution, strengthen our operating model and reshape the portfolio. As we shared previously, we expect this plan for Functional Ingredients will translate into low single-digit comparable currency-neutral sales growth in line with the market and a mid-teen adjusted operating EBITDA margin over the next 3 years with a strong improvement in 2024. And while this will take time, we are seeing improvements in our volume performance, where we finished the quarter down mid-teens versus low 20% declines in Q2 of 2023. With this momentum, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver within our previously announced full year '23 sales guidance range and we are now targeting the mid- to high end of our full year 2023 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range. As Glenn will highlight, we are seeing signs of green shoots in the fourth quarter, with stabilization and improvements across several parts of our business. Lastly, we've made important progress against our portfolio optimization initiatives as we are rapidly addressing our capital structure. Most notably, aligned with our best owner mindset, we announced an agreement to sell Lucas Meyer Cosmetics to specialty chemical company, Clariant, for $810 million, which is equivalent to a high teens multiple based on our projections. We expect to complete the transaction in the early part of the first quarter of 2024, and all proceeds will support our deleveraging priorities. Moving forward, we continue to pursue strategic noncore divestitures that will drive further deleverage and enable us to further prioritize our fastest-growing margin-accretive businesses and deliver long-term value for shareholders. Moving to Slide 7. In the third quarter, IFF generated $2.8 billion in sales, representing a 3% decline on the comparable currency-neutral basis. A strong performance in Scent and Health & Biosciences was more than offset by softness in Nourish and Pharma Solutions. As I mentioned, volumes improved sequentially across nearly all businesses with particularly strong performance in Scent and Health & Biosciences. Excluding Functional Ingredients, which continues to disproportionately impact our results, overall volume declined low to single digits in the third quarter. Adjusted operating EBITDA for the quarter was $506 million, down 10% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Our favorable net price to inflation as well as enhanced productivity gains were more than offset by lower volumes due primarily to temporary customer destocking and unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $0.89, primarily impacted by lower profitability. Now I'll turn it over to Glenn to provide more detail on profitability and our performance by business segment. Thank you, Glenn. Let me start by saying that I am tremendously proud of what our teams have accomplished in the last quarter to advance our focused strategic initiatives and build a stronger, more resilient IFF. Our improved performance, productivity gains and reaffirmed financial guidance reflect the hard work of our global teams that continue to support our long-term vision. We executed against our strategic priorities in Q3, and we'll continue to take action in Q4 to build a stronger IFF, better positioned to accelerate growth, expand margins and deliver value for shareholders. Finally, looking at our business more broadly, we will continue to pursue portfolio optimization initiatives to strengthen our capital structure. As we've discussed previously, we are laser-focused on investing in our highest-return businesses while positioning our less margin-accretive businesses for success, either through new ownership or through focused improvement plans, such as those we're pursuing for Functional Ingredients. Our goal, as we move through the end of 2023 and beyond is to ensure that each of our businesses has the resources and where appropriate, the ownership most conducive to accelerating our growth, expanding our margins and maximizing our long-term returns as we continue to innovate for customers worldwide. With that, I will now open up the call for questions. Gunther, it's Frank. A couple of things. One, with regards to Functional Ingredients, the business clearly across all of ingredients is stabilizing, Gunther, and we saw good sequential improvement when I look at Q2 to Q3, in particular, in 3 of the biggest business lines, core texturants, some multipliers, sweeteners and protein solutions, good sequential improvement. So that's a very positive sign for us. And obviously, those products are going into some of our key dairy and bakery end market categories. As far as the Functional Ingredient plan overall, we're focused in 3 areas: one, enhance our go-to-market approach; two, drive operational efficiencies; and three, really reshaping the product portfolio. And since we've announced we've added targeted commercial professionals to pursue incremental opportunities with our customers, we've also reviewed our organization and we're in the process of adjusting our operating model, Gunther, to drive greater efficiencies throughout. And at the same time, we have completed a full review of our product lines, and we're in the process of investing behind our strongest products as well as rationalizing those that are underperforming. Team is urgently acting to drive better performance across Functional Ingredients. And the net result of this Gunther will be \u2013 we're very confident we can grow sales in line with the market and deliver a mid-teen adjusted operating EBITDA margin over the next 3 years. Thanks for the question. No, I think we can go. Yes. Mark, it's Frank. Let me take that one. And a couple of things that I really wanted to highlight on this question. So first, we spent a lot of time, obviously, with our teams throughout the quarter and at the end of the quarter, looking at our competitive dynamics and how we are positioned. And to highlight, maybe if you could give me a minute just to walk through some of our key business lines. So Flavors, for instance, Mark, we actually grew the business this quarter. And feel very good about our performance, in particular, in North America and Greater Asia and a very well positioned against our competitive set. Health & Biosciences, you actually saw growth versus prior year, Mark, which was very encouraging. And in fact, you saw growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition. Home & Personal Care was a good growth quarter for us. Grain Processing, good growth from a sales perspective as well. And then if I look at our Scent business, our Scent business actually grew above market, Mark. Consumer Fragrance above market. So clearly growing market share there. And then also our Fine Fragrance business had good performance. So I feel really good about this Scent performance versus prior year. And then also as we've already highlighted across just about all of our business lines, good sequential improvement. So when I look at our overall business, I feel really good about the sequential improvement. The one area that we do have disproportionate volume declines versus our competitors as we've highlighted is Functional Ingredients. If you were to exclude Functional Ingredients, Mark, our volume would be down low single digits. So we feel as though we're well within our peer set there. And like I said, we feel very good about the majority of our business and how we're performing. And then the other one that we have highlighted, Mark, was with regards to Pharma. But Pharma, as we've mentioned, had a very strong competitive quarter last year. So that's more of a competitive issue for us in this quarter compared to last quarter of last year. But all in all, Mark, we feel as though the overall business is sequentially improving and is in a really good position as we head into 2024. Yes, David. So Pharma, as we mentioned, the comparison versus prior year, as we highlighted, was a 28% growth. Last year with a lot of shipment catch-up as we implemented in some SAP shipments that went into Q3 of \u201822. And then EBITDA growth last year was 76%. So that was the comparator versus last year. And obviously, you can see that we're down 9% on the top line this year because of that comparator. If you look sequentially, Mark, you do see some choppiness, as Glenn highlighted earlier. There are some distributors that are starting to rightsize inventory in this business. That is something that we see more of a destocking as we ended kind of Q3. And as we go into Q4, we anticipate that the inventory destocking will continue. With that said, we think it's temporary in nature. I have no concerns about the overall outlook for the Pharma business, very sticky business. Our core Pharma position is \u2013 what should I say, our core Pharma business is well positioned with our customers. So destocking by our distributors, rightsizing inventory, temporary in nature, and we feel good about the growth potential performance as we go into \u201824 and beyond. And this is Frank. What I would add is on that 20% Glenn mentions and a number of those have \u2013 assets have been disposed and we continue down the path of optimizing our portfolio as we've highlighted. And then within Functional Ingredients, as we've mentioned, we are making good progress, as I highlighted earlier, and that's really where the majority of the improvement area needs to be. But I don't want to lose also sight of the 80% or so of the businesses we've been highlighting today that has seen good sequential improvement in a number of businesses that actually grew versus prior year. So first, I want to start by thanking all of our IFF FERC colleagues around the world and all of the tremendous work that they are focused on to really help our customers and to continue to innovate. Our vision as a company is truly to be the innovative leader in essential solutions, and we're very proud of the progress that we're making through this quarter. And I also want to thank everyone for joining our call. We look forward to our fourth quarter update and full year guidance for \u201824 update in February, and I wish everyone well, and thanks for joining our call."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Taking a closer look at our profitability performance on Slide 8. As Frank mentioned, we delivered higher-than-expected EBITDA of $506 million in the third quarter. While we continue to benefit from favorable price to inflation and productivity gains, as you can see from the slide, ongoing volume pressures impacted our profitability in the quarter. While we are encouraged by the sequential volume improvement, we have seen across most of our portfolio, it remained the primary pressure in Q3. If we look at our profitability performance, absent the unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory improvement program, adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined 6% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Note that our negative absorption in the quarter was less than expected as our inventory reduction program for the year has run its course and volumes have improved. We have done a good job at driving working capital improvement through our inventory reduction program, driving more than $600 million reduction in inventory since the end of '22. As a result, at this time, we are now expecting approximately a $165 million impact from negative absorption to profitability for the full year, down from $180 million. This could also flex further as the fourth quarter unfolds. To reiterate, this is a onetime transitory impact to the P&L in order to maximize cash flow moving forward. Turning to Slide 9. I'll provide a closer look at our Q3 performance by business segment. In Nourish, sales declined 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, driven mainly by the continued weakness in Functional Ingredients. While Functional Ingredients remained a main driver of weakness in Nourish in the third quarter, we did see sequential improvement and expect this to continue as we move into the fourth quarter. Good growth in our Flavors business and the positive impact of IFF's ongoing pricing actions and productivity initiatives were more than offset by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption. Together, this led to a 26% year-over-year decrease in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Health & Bioscience continued to deliver strong results in Q3, led by meaningful growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Grain Processing, Home & Personal Care and Animal Nutrition leading to comparable currency-neutral growth of 2% year-over-year. Price increases and productivity gains led to a 12% year-over-year increase in comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Scent was once again our strongest performer, delivering 7% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance and high single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance. Like Health & Biosciences, Scent also saw strong 19% growth in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA with profitability driven by favorable net pricing and productivity gains. Pharma Solutions growth rate was pressured this quarter, in large part due to a very strong prior year comparison with a 28% 2022 sales growth comparison and a 76% '22 adjusted operating EBITDA comparison. Price increases and productivity gains for this business were more than offset by lower volumes and comparable currency neutral sales declined 9% and comparable currency-neutral adjusted operating EBITDA declined 34% in the quarter. Now on Slide 10, I'll discuss our cash flow and leverage position. Cash flow from operations totaled $795 million, a significant increase, reflecting a strong improvement in inventory levels. CapEx year-to-date was $390 million or approximately 4.4% of sales. Our inventory reduction program and working capital improvements have also greatly contributed to IFF's improved free cash flow performance, which totaled $405 million, a significant increase of $320 million from the second quarter. Year-to-date, we also distributed $619 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $652 million, which includes $23 million in assets held for sale. Additionally, gross debt for the quarter totaled approximately $10.3 billion, with a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 4.6x. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.1 billion. We are making good progress on working down our debt levels. And as Frank mentioned earlier, portfolio optimization remains a near-term priority as we work to reduce our leverage position and ensure our resources are focused on the businesses that will carry our success into the future. The sale of our Cosmetic Ingredients business, which is expected to close in the early part of the first quarter 2024 will further support our strength in capital structure as we pay down debt in line with our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA targets. Now on Slide 11, I would like to focus on our consolidated outlook for the rest of the year. First, we are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance range of $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, which reflects the improved momentum we are seeing across the majority of our business and accounts for the macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange impact, which we expect will persist through the end of the year. On the bottom line, we are now expecting to deliver full year 2023 adjusted operating EBITDA at the mid to high end of our previously announced guidance of $1.85 billion to $2 billion, driven primarily by favorable price to inflation and improved productivity. We also now expect full year interest expense to be slightly higher at approximately $450 million. Our projected effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 21%, the same estimate we provided last quarter. Finally, as we look to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect an improving trend in the majority of our businesses as we navigate the macroeconomic challenges impacting our industry. We are seeing signs of green shoots in the fourth quarter, with stabilization improvements across several parts of our business. As we near the end of the year, I know many of you have questions on 2024. While the macroeconomic environment remains volatile with low visibility, we are optimistic heading into the new year. We have several known one-off items that we have high level of confidence will be tailwinds, including significant negative absorption related to our successful inventory reduction program and onetime Locust Bean Kernel inventory write-down. Also, we will continue to execute on our cost and productivity initiatives and have a carryover benefit from this year's restructuring program. These, of course, will be partially offset by a reset of our annual incentive compensation program where we have reduced payments in 2023 related to our performance versus target. In the end, improved volume performance will be critical to our success, and we believe that destocking will largely be done as we exit the year and we also believe we will benefit from acceleration of our strategic transformation initiatives. We will provide our 2024 guidance with our fourth quarter results, which we expect to be towards the end of February. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Frank for closing remarks. Mike, it's Glenn. Why don't I attempt to start it, and then Frank can sort of add into it. So just we have been very transparent for many, many quarters that continue to enhance the portfolio, i.e., refine it is the key enabler of getting to our future leverage goals. We were pleased to announce in the quarter the sale of Lucas Meyers Cosmetics for $810 million gross proceeds. That should net about $730 million net. All of that will be used for divestitures. And the company went for a circa 18 multiple based on this year's forecast earnings. So we're pleased by that. We have a number of other additional portfolio actions underway. We have not publicly mentioned Pharma, but as you noted, it's in the press from that standpoint. We are confident that these actions will get us to where we need to, which is a 3x or less leverage ratio. Relative to your question around Pharma. Pharma is a very good business. It's a sticky business. It's in a very healthy sector in terms of the Pharma business. But candidly, it has relatively limited overlap in terms of end customers. For the rest of IFF, there are limited revenue or other synergies across the complex with Pharma. And to answer your question regarding how Pharma fits into our overall framework. As a reminder, Pharma was sort of in the middle of the pack in terms of ROIC. It has a relatively high-return business, which is the excipients, all that 75% and then has a lower return, more industrial business on that. So I think that -- I don't know, Frank, do you want to add anything else to that? Thanks for the question. It was interesting to see literally essentially every single sub-business within Nourish, H&B and Scent had a sequential improvement in volumes from Q2 to Q3. So it was very broad-based in terms of the performance improvements we saw. I'd say, in general, the HPC categories were stronger from an absolute volume standpoint than the food and bev, which is not surprising given what's happening from a consumer demand standpoint. Pharma was the one exception. Pharma actually had volumes down. I would note, though, they had an incredibly strong third quarter of last year. They had a plus 12% in terms of volumes. So there's a bit of an overlap. We had converted a system in Q2 of last year. So there was a bit of a backlog of orders, which were cleared up in Q3. So a little bit of a normalization from the standpoint. Relative to your question on destocking, it's very difficult to say per se. However, our feedback from our business is, we would say that the majority of the customers at this point are either done or expected to be winding down by the end of the fourth quarter. I think the one segment that's a little bit of a lagger is Pharma. The Pharma business in terms of the customers started destocking a little bit later. It has a meaningful distributor component of the business as well and also the industrial side. And I think that's also been reflected very clearly in the competitive side for the Pharma business as well. So knock on wood, things are sort of moving very broad based across the entire business. John, this is Glenn again. By the way, welcome to your new home. So relative to Scents, sequentially, it's relatively neutral, Q2 to Q3 in terms of the net price versus cost, although it is less moving, less price and more cost. So we're now seeing the effects of the deflation basically moving through more so. And year-over-year, slightly higher in the third quarter versus the second quarter. As a reminder, in our core markets being the consumer and Fine Fragrance, our final pricing actions were implemented at the beginning of this year. So really what we're now beginning to do \u2013 and there was some implementation in the second quarter of last year, so we're now sort of fully overlapped last year from a neutrality standpoint, and what we'll be seeing more is the cost reduction. One important asterisk, we have a percent of our business, as you know, that's basically sells ingredients. About 50% of the production is used for our own products and 50% sold. There's a commodity component such as turpentine as an example, Galaxolide, which is somewhat commoditized. So the pricing dynamic is a little bit more on a downward cycle given those categories. But in general, the net price cost is generally very stable in the Scent business. So thanks for the question. Thank you, Adam. So let me kind of break that down into 2 components. One, just normalizing, I'll say, the onetime items from this year into next year and then talk a little bit about 2024. In terms of normalizing this year, first thing you do is you have to take out $75 million of EBITDA related to divestitures. So that's roughly 6 months of Savory Solutions and then FSI, or Fragrance Specialty Ingredients business. And then basically a full year directionally for LMC, that's about $75 million in earnings. In addition, you have to add back the impact of absorption which goes away. That absorption is related to the inventory reduction. So as we've mentioned, we've taken out nearly $600 million of volume-related inventory this year. That's about $165 million benefit. On top of that, the LBK write-off in the second quarter was $44 million. And then lastly, in terms of sort of add normal items, I would add about $25 million of additional benefit associated with the annualization of our headcount reduction program this year. Offsetting that, as you mentioned, is roughly $70 million-ish of basically truing up our incentive plans back to 100% given this is a challenging year, they'll pay out at a lower percentage. So those are the normalized items I would take the sort of baseline the 2023 results. Candidly, relative to \u201824, we are \u2013 we'll be prepared to have a very fulsome discussion at the February call. We're in mid-planning process right now. We're working with all the businesses in terms of their plans from volume, net price, procurement on deflation, productivity programs, et cetera. So it's a little early to talk about those components at this point, but we promise you, we'll have a very detailed discussion in February. Yes. And I wouldn't say that those that are built-to-order don't have absorption impact because they do. But to answer your question, we're roughly 55% build-to-stock, 45% build-to-order in terms of the overall portfolio. So the build-to-stock is more the legacy DuPont or N&B portfolio versus a legacy FNF for the build-to-order. So as a result, that Nourish is split, probably slightly more build-to-stock and build-to-order, but a combination of the Ingredients business, the food systems and then the -- obviously, the Flavors business, the H&B and Pharma businesses are largely build-to-stock and the Scent business is largely build-to-order. Yes. It's more related to deflation than price per se. Pricing \u2013 actually, all of our pricing was implemented earlier this year. We really have not been implementing any more pricing actions this year. So it's really been the favorability associated with deflation that enhance our earnings versus expectations. So the second part \u2013 Josh, this is Glenn. So the second part of your question, we are largely done with the inventory reductions. We're basically going to be largely flatlined for the balance of the year. Relative to our free cash flow estimates for the year, they are unchanged versus our previous quarter. We will be, call it, circa $450 million on reported free cash flow for the year. I will note, once again, that includes about $440 million-ish of Reg G items. So we're right around $900 million of adjusted free cash flow for the year. Just as a reminder of those Reg G items, they're broken down into about a little over half of them, call it, about $240 million are literally associated with our divestitures. A big portion of those are taxes, not surprisingly. We also have another roughly $80 million of the final integration costs. Those are associated with systems conversion and legal entity changes from DuPont. Those will be completed this year. And then there's about $75 million-ish related to restructure. That's from the implementation of this year, and then, call it, $50 million-ish sort of all other related expenses. So that's sort of a breakdown of the Reg G items. When you reference fix or shift, I'm assuming you're talking about the Ingredients business, so is that correct? That's largely -- it's 90% of it. And as we mentioned, that business is of our total businesses about 20% to 25% of the total portfolio. And Frank outlined on the call previously, the major initiatives. It will take some time to fully implement those initiatives. So we are seeing some progression improvement in the business. But we're ways away from sort of getting back to sort of the full historical level of both earnings profile and growth. Our target is to go from largely a high single-digit EBITDA margin level to mid-teens and to basically get the business basically growing in line with the industry which historically has been sort of on a volume basis, 1% to 2% a year. I think to the second question, you should definitely normalize the absorption as a starting point. The ultimate margin dynamics for next year, which we'll discuss in more detail in February, will be a combination of mix, volume growth and ultimately, any additional sort of price inflationary pressures. So it's a complex. I don't think you can just straight line the improvement. I think you can reset the baseline, but then you have to sort of think through all the variables of what's driving the gross margin rate for next year. So we'll park that, come back to that in February. The $70 million that we've referenced really are the savings from headcount reductions we've implemented this year. So as a reminder, there was a program that where we've targeted $100 million of annualized cost reduction, so roughly $70 million, $75 million of that this year and then about $25 million will be the annualized impact. It's all been implemented. So it's all done. So it's really just a timing element of that. And then lastly, there's always some choppiness quarter-to-quarter because of accruals around variable incentives. So depending on up or down, things can get trued up and can be a little bit choppy. So that does affect the quarter-to-quarter RSA as well. I would say 2 things. We have a very, very large basket of raws. So there's lots of things moving in either direction. In general, the cost trends or deflation trends are working in our favor. So that's a general statement. Relative to soy, we do actually lock in over time. We typically hedge out for a period. So we don't necessarily always capture either the immediate upside or downside, but over the longer arc, obviously, as those prices decline, we capture it. We are -- great question, Andrew. We're very confident that relative to our current M&A activity in the market, it will allow us to accomplish our goal of 3x or less. And it should be -- we should be able to accomplish it by the end of next year. This is always a -- there's always, I'll say, a timing element relative to closing transactions given the separation, legal entity changes, those sort of things. But barring sort of a normal path, we should be in good shape by the end of next year."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to Michael DeVeau. Michael, please go ahead.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's second quarter conference call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a moment to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions that you have. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Clyburn: Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining today for an important discussion on our business performance and the critical actions underway to create an even stronger IFF. As you are aware, recent results from across our industry and many of our largest customers has clearly demonstrated that macroeconomic headwinds continue largely unabated. This environment has challenged financial performance of IFF and our peers in the first half of 2023 and has resulted in a more cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. However, despite this tough environment, it is also important that we highlight the significant progress we are making on transforming and strengthening IFF's business. Consequently, today, we will share promising early results from the strategic transformation initiatives we have been discussing with you as well as some additional actions we are taking, summarize our performance for the second quarter 2023 and outline the additional steps we are taking to drive shareholder value creation at IFF's. Then we will be happy to take any questions you have at the end. With that in mind, on Slide 6, I'll begin with a quick summary of the key takeaways for the second quarter, which I will unpack further here in the next few slides, including the actions we are taking to progress our strategic transformation. First, amid the current operating environment facing the industry, including temporary destocking, IFF's is performing broadly in line with peers, excluding Functional Ingredients. Second, consistent with our invest, maximize and optimize framework that we introduced in our 2022 Investor Day, we continue to broaden our portfolio optimization efforts including through strategic noncore divestitures. Third, we've outlined as clear operational improvement plan to drive improvement within our Functional Ingredients business. And lastly, our work behind the scenes to strengthen our organization is paying off as we are making strong progress in terms of our strategic initiatives to ensure IFF is well positioned for long-term success as market conditions begin to improve. Let me now unpack each of these a bit further. Turning to Slide 7. Amid the current operating environment, Q2 results were mixed as comparable currency neutral sales growth for the second quarter was down 4%. Strong results in Scent and Pharma Solutions were more than offset by softness in H&B and Nourish, particularly Functional Ingredients. From a profitability perspective, our adjusted operating EBITDA was in line with our guidance range, excluding a onetime inventory write-down due to unprecedented cost fluctuations for one ingredient Locust Bean Kernel. Our focus on cash flow generation has yielded solid results, improving sequentially and versus the prior year period as we successfully executed on our inventory reduction program. Now as we look to the balance of the year, the pace of industry recovery that we expected is not materializing according to our original expectation. Consumer demand remains soft and temporary customer destocking trends are continuing. As a result, we have adjusted our expectations for the full year 2023 lowering sales to $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, entirely driven by lower volumes. For the full year, we expect volumes to now be down mid to high single digits versus roughly flat previously. Our adjusted operating EBITDA range is now $1.85 billion to $2 billion as favorable net price to inflation and enhanced productivity are more than offset by lower volume, higher manufacturing absorption costs related to our inventory reduction program and the impact of the write-down of LBK inventory. Approximately 75% of IFF's business, including Sent, Pharma Solutions, H&B, Flavors and Food Design are performing broadly in line with industry peers. The one area where we have significant opportunity to accelerate is the Functional Ingredients business, where we are aggressively implementing an operational improvement plan. I will share more in a moment. On Slide 8, looking at our business more broadly, we're continuing to accelerate our portfolio optimization initiatives to maximize returns and deleverage our balance sheet according to plan. We are investing behind to maximize our high-return businesses while optimizing other businesses, including through additional divestitures across all three categories and best maximize and optimize within our strategic framework. We've made significant progress on this front with the recently completed sales of our Microbial Control Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients businesses. We are continuing that momentum as we launch a sale process for Lucas Meyer Cosmetics aligned with our best owner mindset. This is consistent with our mindset of ensuring each of our businesses as the resources and ownership most conducive to long-term success and maximum returns. For LMC specifically, it is a fantastic business, and I have no doubt that it will continue to prosper under new ownership. And for IFF, it would allow us to reduce outstanding debt, while continuing to invest in our most core and accretive businesses. We have also hired JPMorgan to explore additional divestiture actions within the portfolio as a pathway to accelerate, deleverage and unlock further value creation for our shareholders. We are reviewing all options consistent with our strategic framework, and we will only pursue opportunities that are value accretive for our shareholders. A key part of our approach is that we will not look to divest assets at depressed multiples, especially those that are impacted by temporary destocking trends. Instead, we believe there is more value creation from improving these businesses before divesting. On Slide 9, I wanted to put this in today's presentation to show the dynamics we are seeing across the portfolio. As you can foresee from the slide, the vast majority of our portfolio from 2021 through the first half of 2023 has performed near or at expectations volumetrically, on a quarterly average basis, even amongst this unprecedented macro environment over the past 2 years. Also, when comparing with our peers, we believe these businesses are largely performing in line with them based on our business mix. The main business has been Functional Ingredients with quarterly average volumes down approximately 6% and during that same time frame. The message is similar if we analyze our volume performance on a first half 2023 basis as volumes for Functional Ingredients is down approximately 20% and versus a mid-single-digit decline for the rest of the business. Based on this, and as I mentioned on the first quarter call, we have been taking immediate action to improve Functional Ingredients performance while continuing to invest in our high-return businesses and make up the bulk of IFF by revenue, Scent, H&B, Pharma and the other categories within our Nourish division. On Slide 10, I would like to focus on Functional Ingredients in particular. Digging deeper into Functional Ingredients in what has happened, overall market declines in alternative protein consumption including demand decline for plant-based products, persistent supply chain challenges given the macro backdrop since the pandemic and more aggressive inventory management by customers have collectively contributed to pressure Functional Ingredients. Looking forward, while food demand volumes are beginning to stabilize and service challenges across the entire supply chain have improved, we do expect customer destocking to persist through the second half of the year based on what we are hearing from our customers. This destocking, while temporary in nature, will continue to pressure our Functional Ingredients volume as we move through the second half. Now moving to Slide 11. Our plan includes several near-term actions to improve performance in Functional Ingredients. First and foremost, there are clear opportunities to enhance our go-to-market approach with several key customers and accelerate our pipeline to win more opportunities. Since the early part of the year, we have hired over 50 new commercial professionals entirely focused on Functional Ingredients to pursue incremental market opportunities. We are already seeing early signs of improvement with a strong and growing pipeline. The second opportunity is strengthening our operating model. We will be disciplined in our approach from a productivity and operational excellence perspective, delivering 2% to 4% of annual productivity and also, as we think strategically about how to allocate capital to this business to deliver strong ROIC growth. We have also made the decision to report Functional Ingredients to provide increased transparency on performance and ensure increased management accountability with well-defined KPIs. Lastly, we are working to significantly reshape the Functional Ingredients portfolio for success. This means increasing the competitive edge of our successful core product lines while modifying or discontinuing those that have proven not to be additive to the portfolio. The net result of this operational improvement plan, supported by our new leader in Nourish and Function Ingredients, will allow us to grow sales in line with the market and deliver a mid-teen adjusted operated EBITDA margin over the next 3 years. We expect that to this plan, plus the elimination of more transitory challenges such as the LBK inventory write-down and negative absorption, we will see a meaningful improvement in 2024. Moving to Slide 12. I would like to now focus on the significant progress we are making against our strategic plan as we seek to be the premier partner, build our future and become one IFF. Despite the current macro environment, we see our industry in, our teams around the world are putting in the work to ensure we are setting ourselves up to capitalize as economic conditions begin to normalize. Our commercial excellence initiatives are yielding strong results. We have greatly improved customer service performance, identified more than $250 million in new growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond and are expanding the sales pipeline up more than 50% year-over-year across all divisions. We are building our future and extending our leadership in R&D with 15 new technology launches year-to-date and an expected revenue contribution exceeding $100 million. At the same time, our focused productivity initiatives yielded approximately $140 million in savings through the first half of the year. We are optimizing our portfolio to focus on our highest growth, highest margin businesses through selected divestitures, which will complement our efficiency objectives as we meet our deleveraging targets. Lastly, we're making exciting progress in building a more unified IFF. We are finalizing our transition to our new customer line operating model, which will be completed in the first quarter of 2024. We've also continued to enhance our culture and deepen our bench of world-class talent. In June, we appointed Yuvraj Arora, an experienced CPG executive who previously led U.S. categories for Kellogg as President of our Nourish division. With our leadership team and incentive structure now in place, the organization is poised for sustainable, profitable growth and expansion. Now on Slide 13, I would like to highlight the strong improvements we have made in terms of our pipeline opportunity. Our scientific and technological expertise remains a key differentiator in the competitive market. We win by introducing new and unique capabilities to meet our customers' evolving needs. We're seeing the benefits of our refocused R&D and commercial excellence initiatives, including a more than 50% increase in opportunities so far in 2023 and versus the same 2022 period. This increase is giving us continued optimism in the future potential of IFF. In Nourish, increased opportunities across regions and categories, has led to a greater than 60% pipeline inflow versus last year. Our recent notable win included Xylitol, which is a sweetener used in bars, cereals and other confectionery goods. In sense, our compounds pipeline opportunity continues to be healthy and strong. Included in this was a significant win for our Boost Powder Detergent, a 100% active powder laundry detergent that is effective and safe to use unwatchable fabrics. In Health and Biosciences, greater capacity is driving a robust pipeline in our Cultures and Food Enzymes and our Health & Grain Processing units. Included within this is a notable win in North America probiotics, a dietary supplement that supports gut health. And in Pharma Solutions, the pipeline has doubled while the team has delivered key wins in METHOCEL, a plant-based, more dissoluble, functional ingredient that supports dietary sublet manufacturing in a high-growth category. Collectively, our team's creativity and efficiency in bringing innovative solutions to market provides confidence in our ability to strengthen our long-term leadership as the preferred partner for CPGs worldwide. Moving to Slide 14. Our management team is aligned on key objectives essential to IFF's success as market conditions normalize, turning IFF into a leader in high-value innovative solutions. Through the second half of this year and beyond, we are focused on accelerating growth and maximizing shareholder value, expanding our margin, enhancing our return on capital and improving our leverage ratios. We believe we have a strong, achievable plan in place to ensure we are well positioned to rebound growth and profitability and continuing executing on our broader strategic transformation in 2024 and beyond. I will now turn it over to Glenn to discuss our second quarter performance and financial position entering the second half of 2023.\nGlenn Richter: Thanks, Frank. Turning to Slide 15. In Q2, IFF generated $2.9 billion in sales with comparable currency neutral sales declined 4% as strong performance in Scent and Pharma was offset by softness in Nourish and Health and Biosciences. Our pricing continues to remain strong in the second quarter as it was up high single digits. However, volume in the quarter declined low double digits about twice the decline anticipated in the quarter. To provide some more color on volumes, Sent and Pharma were largely in line with expectations, while H&B underperformed in large part due to softer volume performance in health. The majority of our underperformance of our overall volume decline in the quarter, approximately 60% was attributable to Functional Ingredients. Excluding the impact of Functional Ingredients, IFF volume would have only been down mid-single digits. Adjusted operating EBITDA was $510 million, down 18% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis, largely driven by unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption of approximately $55 million and a $44 million write-down of inventory related to unprecedented cost fluctuations for Locust Bean Kernel. As Frank mentioned earlier, excluding this onetime LDK write-down, our adjusted operating EBITDA would have been $554 million, within our previously communicated guidance range of $540 to $590 million. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $0.86 in the quarter, impacted by lower profitability. Taking a closer look at our profitability performance on Slide 16. Excluding the unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory reduction program and the inventory write-down of LBK comparable adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis versus the previous year. We continue to benefit from strong pricing and productivity gains. However, as you can see from the slide, the biggest driver impacting profitability in the quarter was the decline in volumes. This volume decline is most pronounced in our Nourish business, driven by Functional Ingredients. As noted, volumes across our Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses met expectations and H&D was modestly behind. Turning now to Slide 17. I'll provide a look at our second quarter performance by business segment. As we've noted, continued weakness in functional ingredients impacted Nourish performance overall, with strong results in Flavors and Food Design and in line with peers. Pricing and productivity gains were more than offset by lower volumes, unfavorable manufacturing absorption and the LBK inventory write-down. Turning to Health & Biosciences, strong results from certain segments, including Cultures and Food Enzymes, Grain processing and Home and Personal Care, were offset by volume decline in health, driven primarily by the continued soft market conditions across the probiotics and broader dietary supplements markets. From a profitability perspective, pricing and productivity gains were more than offset by lower volume and unfavorable manufacturing absorption. Scent continued to remain resilient, performing strongly this quarter, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance, and high single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance with solid contributions from both volume and price. This, coupled with strong productivity, led to growth and margin expansion across the division. These initiatives also drove strong growth in Pharma Solutions, which saw a 16% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA on a comparable currency-neutral basis, led by solid performance in our core Pharma business, and ongoing pricing and productivity gains. Turning to Slide 18. Cash flow from operations totaled $375 million this quarter, as a result of our very focused efforts to drive strong working capital improvements and right-size our inventories. We are ahead of target, having achieved approximately $320 million inventory reduction year-to-date, after normalizing for LBK write-down. I would like to reiterate that while this inventory reduction program is adversely impacting the P&L through negative manufacturing absorption, it is a short-term impact that we will be recovering over time. CapEx for the first half was $290 million or approximately 4.9% of sales. Given this, our free cash flow position for the quarter has improved sequentially from last quarter and was $85 million in Q2. Included in our free cash flow is about $160 million of cost primarily related to integration and transaction-related costs. We also distributed $413 million of dividends to our shareholders. In Q2, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $641 million, additionally, net debt for the quarter totaled approximately $10.6 billion with net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 4.5 times. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Improving our leverage profile and ensuring IFF continues to meet its deleverage commitments remains a top priority and I am pleased with the strong working capital improvements made to date. With the initiatives in play, including our portfolio optimization efforts, IFF is on a path to delever according to our plan through the rest of 2023 and into 2024. As we mentioned, we remain laser-focused on achieving our target leverage profile to improve cash flow and the portfolio actions and other strategic initiatives we discussed today. Moving to Slide 19. Like many in our sector, we continue to navigate this unprecedented market environment. Consequently, we now expect many of the challenges that we faced through the first half of the year to continue through the second half of the year, including customer destocking and related consumer demand visibility constraints. And as a result, we have revised our second half outlook. Importantly, we remain intently focused on the levers that we can control, including accelerating sales growth, delivering positive price inflation margin, delivering on our identified productivity initiatives while also seeking additional efficiency opportunities and driving continued improvement in cash flow. Ultimately, these actions will strengthen the platform and better position IFF who when the environment improves. On Slide 20 is our updated financial guidance. We are now expecting net sales to be in a range of $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, while our new guidance reflects softer revenue expectations across all businesses, our lower expectations and Functional Ingredients accounts for the majority of the revenue change. For the full year 2023, we are expecting Functional Ingredients volumes to be down double digits. However, the rest of the business to be down low single digits amid continued and temporary customer destocking. For the second half of 2023, we expect sales to be between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, with comparable volumes flat to down high single digits. At the midpoint, of our volume guidance range, our 2-year average volume is down 4%, which is consistent with what we delivered in the first half. Also, please remember that included in our first half '23 results are approximately $300 million in sales and approximately $30 million EBITDA related to our Savory Solutions and FSI divestitures. With these transactions closed at the beginning of June and August, respectively, our second half '23 financials will be lower by these amounts. For full year '23, adjusted operating EBITDA we now expect to be between $1.85 billion and $2 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance. This is driven by three factors, our reduced volume expectations, $80 million more of higher absorption costs and the $44 million LBK inventory write-down. We are now expecting our full year inventory reduction to be approximately $425 million, and as a result, the absorption related to our inventory reduction will be approximately $180 million impact to profitability for the full year. To reiterate, this is a onetime transitory impact to the P&L in order to maximize cash flow moving forward. We remain committed to driving working capital improvements through our inventory reduction program as we navigate this near-term complexity. And finally, and very importantly, in light of this environment, we are maintaining strong cost discipline to drive enhanced productivity across the organization in order to protect profitability. For our full year expectations for interest expense, we now expect it to be around $425 million mainly due to higher interest forecast on short-term debt and factory programs and a higher balance of short-term debt due to lower earnings. And we also expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 21% or no change. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to continue to pressure sales in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth which we now expect will adversely impact us by 2% and 6%, respectively. This incremental pressure is due to a handful of hyperinflationary currencies that have moved against us in the first half of '23, where FX was a 3-point headwind to sales and a 7-point headwind to adjusted operating EBITDA and we expect that many of these currencies will continue to significantly to value in the second half of '23. Now I'll turn back to Frank for closing remarks.\nFrank Clyburn: Thanks, Glenn. Our incredible teams around the world continue to deliver pioneering discoveries and strengthen our customer relationships ensuring that IFF is the innovative engine behind the most critical and beloved consumer products. These efforts are reflected in the solid results across the majority of our businesses despite the current environment, which gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver industry-leading growth and profitability in the years ahead. Our strategic plan is showing very encouraging early results. We are investing in opportunities for growth, innovation and enhanced productivity, and we are taking decisive actions to manage through the volatile market conditions, refocusing functional ingredients with an operational improvement plan to strengthen operations and execution and progressing our deleveraging efforts through ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, including the launch of our cosmetic ingredients process. Amid even this challenging market environment, we are making great progress transforming IFF into the leader in high-value innovative solutions and the partner for our customers. The actions we are taking today and through the remainder of 2023 will create a stronger IFF capable of delivering significant value for shareholders and all of our stakeholders. With that, I will open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess just to the question that we're getting a lot from investors is as we look at the - the updated EBITDA guidance for the year, it does appear that you're going to be moving above your covenant threshold in the back half. And so Glenn, you talked about being kind of continuing to commit to deleveraging. Can you just comment on what that path looks like over the balance of the year? And in that context, how should we think about the dividend? And then what is the updated expectation for free cash flow for 2023. I don't think I heard an updated guidance number there? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Adam, thanks very much, good morning. And great questions to start off here. Let me start off by reassuring everybody, I am quite confident that we will not trip our covenants and the reason I am is because there are multiple levers that we can pull, and I'll get to your question about cash flow, but we've made very strong progress on working capital and other improvements in cash flow this year. In addition, we are well downstream on divestitures from a portfolio standpoint as well. And I would also remind you that there's a credit-adjusted definition of EBITDA, which is different than the adjusted EBITDA number. So obviously, there are a number of add-backs relative to that calculation. So point one, very confident we will not have an issue with our covenant. Point number two is currently a change in our dividend is not on the table. And then point number three, relative to our cash flow forecast for this year on a free cash flow basis reported we're expecting to be about $100 million lower than our original guide. As a reminder, we had a $600 million free cash flow for this year. We're forecasting $475 million. As a reminder, within that $475 million, there are 450 million Reg G charges. So on an adjusted basis, we expect to be over $900 million. That compares to the $1 billion we started off, that $450 million, by the way, includes $250 million of transaction related. So it's taxes, it's M&A, separation fees for the microbial control FSI and say solutions of the residual, $75 million is related to the final integration activities with DuPont this year, and there's another $100 million plus that are largely related to the restructure that we performed this year. So - so again, on an adjusted basis, we expect our free cash flow to be around $900 million versus the original $1 billion. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is open.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. I guess how does the operating backdrop in 2023 change how you're thinking about the financial commitments through 2026, I think you outlined at the Investor Day back in December. Maybe you can touch on the internal offsets you're pulling to count or the lower volume baseline. And I'm just asking because at this point, your dividend outlay is unsustainable relative to your rebased EBITDA starting point as Adam pointed out.\nFrank Clyburn: Hi. Yes, this is Frank, and I'll take that one. And good morning, everyone. A couple of things that I want to highlight. First and foremost, if you look at what's taking place through '23. Clearly, we are seeing temporary destocking, as we mentioned, and we have been pulling a number of levers to manage the business. First, you can see really good progress with productivity. As Glenn highlighted, we've been really improving our net working capital and also making sure that we're doing everything to control our cost to manage the '23 year as it unfolds. We are on track. As you recall, we highlighted that we're going to have a cost reduction takeout of about $100 million. That is on track as well. More importantly, though, I am very excited about the opportunity that we have as we come out of temporary destocking. And as we move into '24 and as you could see, as we discussed with our customers, we're very well positioned based on the pipeline increase that we just highlighted, also based on the commercial efforts that we're putting forward. We've improved our customer service significantly, which gives me a lot of confidence as I look at the outlook, to your question over the next several years. So we're managing for the near-term temporary destocking, but we are clearly preparing for a good, strong growth in '24. We still remain committed to our long-term guidance that we put out of 4% to 6% top line sales growth and 8% to 10% EBITDA that we can't communicated during Capital Markets Day.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. And if I could just tag on to the end of that regarding your comment regarding the unsustainability of the dividend, I just will piggyback on my response to Adam's question, again, on an adjusted basis, $900 million of free cash flow and in addition, as we've called out, there's over $200 million of onetime items between LBK write-off and then the negative absorption. So we are confident as we exit this year, we're going to be in a much, much better trajectory, particularly as the environment improves. So I'm not sure the assertion on sustainability is correct.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks, and good morning, everybody. I guess the first question is just what gives you confidence in the back half outlook? I think you talked, Glenn, about the volume assumptions essentially being the same on a 2-year basis, 2H versus 1H - you've cut numbers now, not necessarily your fault, partly industry stuff, now three times since the Investor Day. So what gives you confidence, what should investors take that would give you - give them any confidence that you can hit the numbers that you laid out there? And then helpful on the divestiture commentary. Curious how integrated the businesses are today such that more divestitures aren't disruptive that they don't create significant fixed cost deleverage and having to staff up and absorb costs? Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. So I'll take the question. Thanks, It's really important. We've talked to a number of our customers. With regards to the temporary destocking, and we do believe that it is very prudent for us right now to derisk the plan based on the back half of the year, and we do think we've done that. And in derisking the plan, we also believe that we set the floor. So we're very confident and what you are now seeing is our new guidance going forward. Important to note though, while we are navigating '23, we are also continuing to prepare, as we just discussed, as we move into '24 as we see destocking subside and as we see volumes improve. Glenn, I don't know if you want to\nGlenn Richter: I would add. It's a very, very legitimate question, Mark, is a, we feel we're being very prudent relative to the range in terms of what the guide is here. Secondarily, we have July in our belt at this point, and it's negative 4% volume August is trending a little bit lower than that, but very, very consistent with what we think the quarter is unfolding. So a combination of bringing down to a 2-year consistent with the first half, a couple more months largely closed gives us a pretty good sense that we're going to be in a good place. And obviously, we wanted to make sure we were prudent relative to the construction of this outlook. Your question on M&A is a good one, and there's no simple answer. Some businesses are more integrated than others. It is clearly a consideration relative to our portfolio strategy. The good news is we have acquired substantial experience over the last 3 years now through a combination of the sale of the microbial control business, Savory Solution and Atlas as well as other ones we're working on. So we've got a pretty good track record in sort of being able to navigate through that. But it is an important consideration as we think about which parts of the portfolio we trim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nGunther Zechmann: Good morning, Frank. Good morning, Glenn. I know you don't guide for next year yet, but what do you think are the main moving parts if we want to build the bridge for 2024 considering your comparables. You talked about you're excited about the pipeline growth, destocking to subside. What are some of the potential negatives as well that we should take into account? So refineries for 2024, please?\nGlenn Richter: Sure. Maybe I'll begin Gunther and Frank can add on. As we think about '24, one is, as we mentioned, we do believe that the environment will be improving. So we think we're now going to be entering an environment where destocking will be complete consumer pullback will be largely stabilized at a point. So that's point one. Point two, as we mentioned, there are a number of items to normalize from this year. So the $180 million associated with absorption which we have consciously tackled, by the way, that has delivered a $500 million reduction in inventory full year from a standpoint. So it's a very, very significant achievement we're accomplishing. It's also the LDK write-off, obviously, 44. So there are onetime items - from a volume standpoint, as Frank had mentioned, we feel that 75% of our business, i.e., everything except Functional Ingredients is performing well in line with our competitive peers. So we'd expect them to continue to trend well in an improving market. And the other 25%, we have been underway for a number of months on remediation and expect that business to pick up next year. And lastly, I would say that the other areas that we can control, i.e., productivity, working capital and cash flow efficiency and portfolio are well on track. So we feel like - those should continue as we move into '24. But obviously, as we close the year, we'll have a more detailed update on next year.\nFrank Clyburn : Yes. And I would add, Gunther, and I highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We've been spending a lot of time with our key customers. I can tell you that I've had discussions with many of with those CEOs with those companies and Chief Technology Officers. And what we highlighted is the 15 new R&D launches this year, the strong platforms that we have and as Glenn mentioned, if you look at our business performance in Scent, if you look at Pharma, if you look at Health & Biosciences overall, we're in really good shape, and the businesses are performing well in a challenging environment and backdrop. And even within Nourish, one of the things I wanted to highlight after is that our Flavors business, our system ingredients business as we help customers solve some of their challenges is in good shape as well and benchmarks extremely well versus our peers. And now we have a plan that we will be getting after improving our functional ingredients and that's something that we'll continue to monitor very closely. We have a new team that's been put in place to really improve that business. And as volumes start to normalize, as you head into next year, we feel really good that you'll start to see improvement in that business, which gives us a lot of confidence for '24.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJosh Spector: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking for taking my questions So I was wondering if you could provide some more detail kind of walking through your second quarter EBITDA to your second half run rate. So I mean, as you mentioned earlier, you exclude the inventory write-down you did about 550. Your guide at the midpoint is maybe $450 million a quarter. I guess the inventory adjustment isn't changing. It's maybe getting a little bit better price cost, you had some benefits from volumes you're guiding similar. I guess I'm not sure what's driving that magnitude of decline. So more color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Sure. Good morning, Josh. So let me actually - let me just do first half to second half because honestly, the first quarter is very similar to the second quarter. So the first half on a reported basis was $1.2 0 billion [ph] of EBITDA adjusted EBITDA. And then the midpoint of the guide is 9.05 for the second half. As you pointed out, you need to adjust the first half for a combination of the absorption, $150 million LBK write-off, adding another 44, you've got to reduce for divestitures, which come out of the second half, you should take out 30 and then you have foreign exchange differential of $20 million to $30 million, so that gets you roughly to $1.150 billion. And then obviously, for the second half, you have some absorption of 30. So that gets you to 9.35. So it's a 1.150 first half normalized versus a 935 million. So it's roughly $200 million delta between them. So can break it down into basically two components. About $50 million is related to lower GP from seasonal volumes, particularly the fourth quarter, it's our lowest quarter. So on an apples-to-apples basis, there's $100-plus million of differential. The other is a little bit productivity timing, but it's largely a net price realization versus cost higher in the first half than the second half. And as you noted or as we've noted, we have a 7% pricing in the first half. It's circa 3% in the second half. So while we continue to see some progress on reduction of input costs, there was a better achievement in the first half versus the second half. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open.\nNicola Tang: Thanks. Hi, everyone, I wanted to take a closer look at Functional Ingredients. I was wondering if you could give more color on which product groups or perhaps switch end markets in Functional Ingredients actually drove that volume weakness in Q2? And could you elaborate a bit more on the cautious outlook for the second half as well? Also, at your Investor Day last year, you highlighted your plan to optimize or exit underperforming divisions, so with today's new efficiency plan in Functional Ingredients, does this mean that you've ruled out exiting this division? Or could it still be a potential divestment candidate? Thanks.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Nicola, this is Frank. I'll take both. On the first question, we are looking at all options. However, as we've communicated, we will not pursue any options that aren't accretive to our shareholders. And we think right now, in particular, within Functional Ingredients, we are focused on the improvement plan that we outlined, and we do see really good early progress starting to emerge within that business. As far as the first part of your question, if we look at Functional Ingredients, underneath that, I'll use the example of protein solutions with Soft, Nicole of this quarter primarily due to destocking and these are isolated soy proteins that go into nutritional bars and beverages. I've had a chance to meet with a couple of the customers and the positive news is we're very well position within those end markets. The destocking has been the impact primarily for isolated soy proteins going into those beverages and bars. So that's an example, Nicole, of what we've seen, and that's been the impact we've seen across Functional Ingredients primarily destocking. There has been some customer softness in some of the meat alternative products that are within Functional Ingredients as well. But hopefully, that helps give us a little bit more color of what we're seeing. And then as we come out of destocking, as I mentioned, we do anticipate things to start to normalize as we get into '24.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. What's the threshold for deciding when to take a write-down in raw material inventory. You've had spikes in citral, vanilla, other ingredients in the past, I don't recall this kind of a write-down before. And then I think your earlier comments on price raws were year-over-year. Could you give us a sense of sequential and whether or not LDK is kind of affecting the sequential number significantly?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Good question, John. And good morning to you. Materiality and ultimately, the measure is do we expect to be selling it below cost. I would say LBK is a very unique case. You cited some others. But as it relates to the volatility over the last 2 years to give you some sense, prices have dropped from \u20ac35 per kilo to 8 in less than 12 months. So that was a clear case that we needed to basically recognize the current value of the inventory that's an anomaly. At least in my short history of 2 years, we've never seen anything like that in terms of kind of the sheer level of volatility, such a short period of time. I would also note that the inventories were slightly higher, which actually made it a bigger - slightly bigger write-off simply because we were making sure that we had enough supply for security purposes. Relative to the raws trends, they're continuing to progress downward, but I'll say, at a more modest rate than we saw in the second half of last year and then entering into this year. As you know, many of the factors impacting prices such as energy prices is one big input have decreased, but they've stabilized as well. So we're seeing a little bit more improvement. I would note that the other two big input costs for us are logistics and energy, energy has come down dramatically this year. It's largely pretty stable at this point globally. And then logistics as well has been a very, very big improvement over the year, and that has largely stabilized and actually we see some continued downward progression in terms of prices as well. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nHarris Fein: Hi, good morning. This is Harris Fein on for Chris. Thanks for taking my question. So can you talk a little bit more about the visibility that you have into where consumer sell-through is trending versus any differences you're seeing in destocking at your customer level? Do you think that your customers are still holding above normal inventories? Or do you think that this is a situation where maybe they're drawing down normal inventories into an area well below normal because maybe there's more supply chain comfort. And I guess based on all that, how are you thinking about the potential for destocking to maybe weak into 2024 at this point? Thanks.\nFrank Clyburn: Yeah, hi. This is Frank. Thanks for the question. We do work very closely with, in particular, our large global key accounts and then also our large regional accounts. And I do think supply chains have improved, so they are willing to adjust some of their inventories. What we are hearing from them is mixed. Some customers are saying that destocking will start to come to an end as we kind of go through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. Some are saying that it really is depending on end market consumer demand and are thinking more that the destocking persists through the rest of this year and starts to improve as we get into 2024. So what we have done is, as we mentioned, in our approach is to really be prudent in the approach and to derisk our plan. However, we are very much focused on working with them to prepare for once temporary destocking is over to improve, obviously, our performance. And I can tell you that when we look at - as I mentioned, our pipeline win rate and some of the commercial activities we have underway, we feel really good and well positioned. But your question on visibility is one that we are working with them on. But clearly, we are making sure we're doing everything we can prepare for as we head towards the end of this year and into next year. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I really appreciate the transparency on the Functional Ingredients deep dive. What percentage of the Functional Ingredients business would you characterize as a commodity, low-margin business? And are any of these businesses separable now? Or is the bias more towards optimization and the prioritization of investment?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, I'll start and then, Glenn, I'll let you add. If you look at Functional Ingredients, what's underneath that is protein solutions, which is about a third or it's approximately - in functional ingredients. We have multipliers and sweeteners. We have core tax trends, cellulosis and food protection and systems are kind of within functional ingredients. We feel good with regards to our specialty protein. So we think there's good differentiation there. And that represents about half of protein solutions, and there are some more value proteins in there that I would say are a little bit more in a competitive landscape. Emulsifiers I would say, are probably in the category of much more competitive to answer your question, and it's something that we're looking at in particular, some of the emulsifiers that are within that category within that business and also some of the core text rents, we feel as though are some are differentiated, but there are some core texturants that are probably more challenged competitively. So we're staring at our portfolio. We feel good overall. We're going to put where we have core differentiation, our efforts to behind that core, and that's a part of the functional ingredients plan. In areas here are some of the ingredients that are more commoditized or where we don't bring a differentiated benefit. That's where we're going to look to really optimize or possibly even discontinue in those ingredients. So we have a well thought out plan as we move forward and feel good about the new team that we have in place.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. I would just add two other comments is these are somewhat more commoditized than the rest of our portfolio. But to bring up Frank's point, our portfolio is very much focused on high value add. So you think about our cellulosics business, you think about Xylitol, you sort of think about our soy isolates, really as it relates to specialty proteins, et cetera, alginate, et cetera. We really are focusing a part of our strategy of maximizing the value-add opportunities in our portfolio and have been super turbocharging our customer pipeline activity to focus on those categories.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Sison: Hey. Good morning, guys. Frank, The DuPont transaction was designed to help you generate better organic growth longer term. And it seems like functional ingredients has been more of a challenge there. So when you think about the potential value of the deal, is there any left? Or can you give us some thoughts of can this - can any of their businesses really help improve your organic growth? And then longer term, how do you think you rebuild the EBITDA from '23 to what level do you think is possible?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. I think that if you look at the transaction, we still feel very confident about the value creation opportunities for IFF going forward. We are, as we highlighted and is primarily due to destocking, and we have a clear plan to address some of the challenges in Functional Ingredients. If you look at our Health & Biosciences business, tremendous capabilities. The business is performing well. Pharma is also performing extremely well. So we still feel very good about the future value creation opportunity, as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nLisa De Neve: Good morning, Frank and Glenn. And thank you so much for taking my questions. I have two main questions. So following your intention to explore potential incremental divestitures I mean what is the current market interest to actually engage with M&A at this point of the cycle? And how difficult is for potential buyers to potentially obtain financing in this volatile and higher interest rate environment. And how should we think about the time line for potential divestments? That's my first question. And then the second question I have is like from your top management level, how is your visibility across the different business units? How quickly do you see when certain units are deteriorating, whether it's market driven or any other reason? And how quickly do you address some underperformance in some segments. And maybe on that note as well, what will change in Nourish, there is now there is a new head driving that segment? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: I'll start, Lisa, I think technically at six questions, but let's unpack them. So on the M&A front, there are both PE firms, but more importantly, strategics out there that would have a high level of interest relative to our portfolio, relative to the former of the credit markets have stabilized. So there's tons of PE money out there being put to work and the credit market is actually in a pretty good place. But more importantly, on the strategic side, there is a very broad appetite relative to partnerships, various assets in the portfolio. As you know, most of the peers in this space actually have very good balance sheets. There's value to consolidation in this space, et cetera. So we feel very good about the robustness relative to the opportunities out there. We will be smart in terms of how we do that. It's got to make sense for us strategically in terms of what's in the portfolio - in the portfolio and it needs to be smart from a value creation for our shareholder. As we mentioned earlier, we're not interested in divesting assets cheaply. We'd rather actually maintain them, fix them, grow them from that standpoint before we did that. So I think that was your first set of questions. Frank, do you want to take that?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. I think you had a question about visibility into the business, and we do have a window where we are looking at a couple of weeks, obviously, we can look at our orders, and we obviously do a lot of work with regards to engaging with our customers. So - and we moved pretty quickly. I said we move very quickly, I should say, with regards to how we adjust our business. And the example is, I think you're seeing us very rapidly focus on productivity, focus on cash flow. We've moved very rapidly with regards to improvement in net working capital. We signaled early on that we were seeing some softness in destocking and end market demand and ingredients, and we quickly put in place 50 commercial resources to address that. So we're moving very rapidly to address any challenges that we have. And then to your last question, Naresh [ph] President is on board, fully aligned and helped to develop the plan you're seeing around Functional Ingredients as well as helping us to focus on driving Flavors and Systems as we move forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. End of the call, but I'll just keep this kind of high level and strategic. I was curious as you think about some of the things that are in this Functional Ingredients portfolio, including, importantly, the things that are maybe less differentiated and then, therefore, less attractive to continue to be in. But what's the role of those things in the dream - the dream of integrated solutions. Because my understanding is that part of the delivering full service to customers is having that full portfolio and that was sort of part of the argument for being a one-stop shop. But now it feels like the financial return profile or managing this collection of businesses that are varying degrees of more or less attractive on a stand-alone basis? Is making that bigger like industrial logic more challenged. So maybe a little bit long to the end of the call, but I was just curious on how you'd react to that.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, Lauren, I would say that when I look at Functional Ingredients, I'll give you an example, where we bring significant differentiating value is within our systems business where we're bringing in combining multiple ingredients. And for example, emulsifiers are used in over 50% of our systems applications and what we're bringing for customers. So we still believe that there is integrated solution opportunities as we work across all of Nourish. What we're highlighting is due to destocking, we need a very quick rapid improvement plan based on the need to improve the financial profile of Functional Ingredients. But we still do see that the integration with in particular, with regards to emulsifiers as well as some of our protein solutions is still bringing a lot of benefit and advantages to customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mr. DeYoe, your line is now open.\nMichael DeVeau: Maybe operator, we'll go to the next one.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nLaurence Alexander: Just very quickly, how much of an EBITDA drag do you have from the working capital reductions that you've done this year? And secondly, for the target for Functional Ingredients to sort of match the market. Do you see yet a path for functional greens to get above-market growth in, say, 5, 7 years? Or is matching the market kind of sort of the best fix?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. So the answer to the first question is $180 million is related to bringing inventory out of the system. So as I mentioned, there's $500 million of volume related on we have a little bit of raw materials price escalation. So the balance sheet will show a net $400 million and change improvement that way, that's significantly above what we were planning at the beginning of the year, we're sort of making more progress. So the cost of doing that is basically the negative absorption on the P&L from a standpoint for this year. But obviously, it's sort of one and done. And at least for the interim period, honestly, we haven't thought about 5 to 7 years is getting to market and generally, these categories were sort of low single-digit growth is the right target to be in part because we want to be reasonable in part. We also want to optimize the return on these assets because they typically have a lower ROIC more capital intensive. So it's not growth, the sale growth, that's really sort of optimizing the returns. But thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSilke Kueck: Hi. I also have a question along those lines. So if there's $180 million income statement on penalty for reducing the inventories and improving the cash flows, is there a benefit in 2024 if the inventories don't get rebuilt, like I understand you've done about the same cost, but you feel like an actual benefit unless you rebuild inventories?\nFrank Clyburn: You don't need to rebuild them. You just need to may be flat. So as a reference point, our total production will be down around 15% this year. As we mentioned, we expect sales volumes to be down 6. So there's - that 9% incremental is basically to eat through that $0.5 billion of inventory still getting there. So assuming you - that's one and done, then you get the pickup of the 180 next year because obviously, production is at zero at that point going forward. So as you - if you rebuild inventories over time as you grow the business, that actually creates a positive absorption going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Keches with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Keches: Thanks, I appreciate the question. Glenn, if I could ask a time line for that three times net leverage target changed. I heard you reiterate I didn't hear the time line though. And do you still expect to get there by the end of 2024 with asset sales I think even with Lucas Meyer and [indiscernible] sort of in, it still seems like you'd have additional work cut out for you?\nFrank Clyburn: Yeah, yeah...\nAndrew Keches: And then related to that, Yes, related. I appreciate that - so your messaging deleveraging is still a priority. But at the end of the day, the agencies have you very close to high yield at this point, and that dividend is still effectively two times what your cash flow is. So is maintaining IG rating a significant importance to you? And yes, that's intentional emphasis on maintaining?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. The answer is - to the second question, we're very committed to maintaining investment grade. As you're well aware, the rating agencies are patient relative to your long-term strategy and goals. We've obviously have been in close discussions with them. They know our plans in terms of what we're doing. Again, I would submit to you that the reality is on adjusted cash flow basis we're at 900 this year with some onetime items that mainly gets you north of that, probably not the best place to be relative to an $800 million dividend, and we get that, but normal growth trajectory gets you into a much better place from that. On the deleverage, i.e., the activities and the target, we are still committed to heading three times by the end of next year. We have been at work for quite a few months on M&A. And that's - we've been mentioning portfolio revisit since the end of last year. So there are a number of activities underway from that standpoint. And so we do feel that we have enough, if you will, irons in the fire beyond Lucas Meyer to basically accomplish our goals.\nFrank Clyburn: Great. Thank you, Glenn. And as we come to a close today, a couple of key points I would like to just reiterate. And first, I want to make sure that we reemphasize that the majority of our business is doing well and is very resilient as we manage through temporary destocking. Second, we are taking action very rapidly to improve our business trajectory and our capital structure. We've implemented a functional ingredients operational improvement plan, and we look forward to sharing more with you of the progress. We're driving divestitures, as you've heard, such as the announced sale of LMC as well as additional opportunities that we're looking at to delever, and we're executing on our strategic priorities with strong improvements in commercial and operational excellence, as you heard today. We do remain confident in our value creation potential, given the relative strength of our pipeline and we highlighted just within the first half of this year, over a 50% increase versus prior year and is the transitory nature of destocking ends, that's going to really position us well as we head into 2024, as the environment normalizes.\nFrank Clyburn: And then lastly, I wanted to really reiterate, IFF is a great business. We're in a great industry, and we have significant opportunities to create value for our stakeholders and we want to thank each and everyone of you for joining our call today.\nOperator: That concludes the IFF second quarter conference call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Clyburn",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining today for an important discussion on our business performance and the critical actions underway to create an even stronger IFF. As you are aware, recent results from across our industry and many of our largest customers has clearly demonstrated that macroeconomic headwinds continue largely unabated. This environment has challenged financial performance of IFF and our peers in the first half of 2023 and has resulted in a more cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. However, despite this tough environment, it is also important that we highlight the significant progress we are making on transforming and strengthening IFF's business. Consequently, today, we will share promising early results from the strategic transformation initiatives we have been discussing with you as well as some additional actions we are taking, summarize our performance for the second quarter 2023 and outline the additional steps we are taking to drive shareholder value creation at IFF's. Then we will be happy to take any questions you have at the end. With that in mind, on Slide 6, I'll begin with a quick summary of the key takeaways for the second quarter, which I will unpack further here in the next few slides, including the actions we are taking to progress our strategic transformation. First, amid the current operating environment facing the industry, including temporary destocking, IFF's is performing broadly in line with peers, excluding Functional Ingredients. Second, consistent with our invest, maximize and optimize framework that we introduced in our 2022 Investor Day, we continue to broaden our portfolio optimization efforts including through strategic noncore divestitures. Third, we've outlined as clear operational improvement plan to drive improvement within our Functional Ingredients business. And lastly, our work behind the scenes to strengthen our organization is paying off as we are making strong progress in terms of our strategic initiatives to ensure IFF is well positioned for long-term success as market conditions begin to improve. Let me now unpack each of these a bit further. Turning to Slide 7. Amid the current operating environment, Q2 results were mixed as comparable currency neutral sales growth for the second quarter was down 4%. Strong results in Scent and Pharma Solutions were more than offset by softness in H&B and Nourish, particularly Functional Ingredients. From a profitability perspective, our adjusted operating EBITDA was in line with our guidance range, excluding a onetime inventory write-down due to unprecedented cost fluctuations for one ingredient Locust Bean Kernel. Our focus on cash flow generation has yielded solid results, improving sequentially and versus the prior year period as we successfully executed on our inventory reduction program. Now as we look to the balance of the year, the pace of industry recovery that we expected is not materializing according to our original expectation. Consumer demand remains soft and temporary customer destocking trends are continuing. As a result, we have adjusted our expectations for the full year 2023 lowering sales to $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, entirely driven by lower volumes. For the full year, we expect volumes to now be down mid to high single digits versus roughly flat previously. Our adjusted operating EBITDA range is now $1.85 billion to $2 billion as favorable net price to inflation and enhanced productivity are more than offset by lower volume, higher manufacturing absorption costs related to our inventory reduction program and the impact of the write-down of LBK inventory. Approximately 75% of IFF's business, including Sent, Pharma Solutions, H&B, Flavors and Food Design are performing broadly in line with industry peers. The one area where we have significant opportunity to accelerate is the Functional Ingredients business, where we are aggressively implementing an operational improvement plan. I will share more in a moment. On Slide 8, looking at our business more broadly, we're continuing to accelerate our portfolio optimization initiatives to maximize returns and deleverage our balance sheet according to plan. We are investing behind to maximize our high-return businesses while optimizing other businesses, including through additional divestitures across all three categories and best maximize and optimize within our strategic framework. We've made significant progress on this front with the recently completed sales of our Microbial Control Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients businesses. We are continuing that momentum as we launch a sale process for Lucas Meyer Cosmetics aligned with our best owner mindset. This is consistent with our mindset of ensuring each of our businesses as the resources and ownership most conducive to long-term success and maximum returns. For LMC specifically, it is a fantastic business, and I have no doubt that it will continue to prosper under new ownership. And for IFF, it would allow us to reduce outstanding debt, while continuing to invest in our most core and accretive businesses. We have also hired JPMorgan to explore additional divestiture actions within the portfolio as a pathway to accelerate, deleverage and unlock further value creation for our shareholders. We are reviewing all options consistent with our strategic framework, and we will only pursue opportunities that are value accretive for our shareholders. A key part of our approach is that we will not look to divest assets at depressed multiples, especially those that are impacted by temporary destocking trends. Instead, we believe there is more value creation from improving these businesses before divesting. On Slide 9, I wanted to put this in today's presentation to show the dynamics we are seeing across the portfolio. As you can foresee from the slide, the vast majority of our portfolio from 2021 through the first half of 2023 has performed near or at expectations volumetrically, on a quarterly average basis, even amongst this unprecedented macro environment over the past 2 years. Also, when comparing with our peers, we believe these businesses are largely performing in line with them based on our business mix. The main business has been Functional Ingredients with quarterly average volumes down approximately 6% and during that same time frame. The message is similar if we analyze our volume performance on a first half 2023 basis as volumes for Functional Ingredients is down approximately 20% and versus a mid-single-digit decline for the rest of the business. Based on this, and as I mentioned on the first quarter call, we have been taking immediate action to improve Functional Ingredients performance while continuing to invest in our high-return businesses and make up the bulk of IFF by revenue, Scent, H&B, Pharma and the other categories within our Nourish division. On Slide 10, I would like to focus on Functional Ingredients in particular. Digging deeper into Functional Ingredients in what has happened, overall market declines in alternative protein consumption including demand decline for plant-based products, persistent supply chain challenges given the macro backdrop since the pandemic and more aggressive inventory management by customers have collectively contributed to pressure Functional Ingredients. Looking forward, while food demand volumes are beginning to stabilize and service challenges across the entire supply chain have improved, we do expect customer destocking to persist through the second half of the year based on what we are hearing from our customers. This destocking, while temporary in nature, will continue to pressure our Functional Ingredients volume as we move through the second half. Now moving to Slide 11. Our plan includes several near-term actions to improve performance in Functional Ingredients. First and foremost, there are clear opportunities to enhance our go-to-market approach with several key customers and accelerate our pipeline to win more opportunities. Since the early part of the year, we have hired over 50 new commercial professionals entirely focused on Functional Ingredients to pursue incremental market opportunities. We are already seeing early signs of improvement with a strong and growing pipeline. The second opportunity is strengthening our operating model. We will be disciplined in our approach from a productivity and operational excellence perspective, delivering 2% to 4% of annual productivity and also, as we think strategically about how to allocate capital to this business to deliver strong ROIC growth. We have also made the decision to report Functional Ingredients to provide increased transparency on performance and ensure increased management accountability with well-defined KPIs. Lastly, we are working to significantly reshape the Functional Ingredients portfolio for success. This means increasing the competitive edge of our successful core product lines while modifying or discontinuing those that have proven not to be additive to the portfolio. The net result of this operational improvement plan, supported by our new leader in Nourish and Function Ingredients, will allow us to grow sales in line with the market and deliver a mid-teen adjusted operated EBITDA margin over the next 3 years. We expect that to this plan, plus the elimination of more transitory challenges such as the LBK inventory write-down and negative absorption, we will see a meaningful improvement in 2024. Moving to Slide 12. I would like to now focus on the significant progress we are making against our strategic plan as we seek to be the premier partner, build our future and become one IFF. Despite the current macro environment, we see our industry in, our teams around the world are putting in the work to ensure we are setting ourselves up to capitalize as economic conditions begin to normalize. Our commercial excellence initiatives are yielding strong results. We have greatly improved customer service performance, identified more than $250 million in new growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond and are expanding the sales pipeline up more than 50% year-over-year across all divisions. We are building our future and extending our leadership in R&D with 15 new technology launches year-to-date and an expected revenue contribution exceeding $100 million. At the same time, our focused productivity initiatives yielded approximately $140 million in savings through the first half of the year. We are optimizing our portfolio to focus on our highest growth, highest margin businesses through selected divestitures, which will complement our efficiency objectives as we meet our deleveraging targets. Lastly, we're making exciting progress in building a more unified IFF. We are finalizing our transition to our new customer line operating model, which will be completed in the first quarter of 2024. We've also continued to enhance our culture and deepen our bench of world-class talent. In June, we appointed Yuvraj Arora, an experienced CPG executive who previously led U.S. categories for Kellogg as President of our Nourish division. With our leadership team and incentive structure now in place, the organization is poised for sustainable, profitable growth and expansion. Now on Slide 13, I would like to highlight the strong improvements we have made in terms of our pipeline opportunity. Our scientific and technological expertise remains a key differentiator in the competitive market. We win by introducing new and unique capabilities to meet our customers' evolving needs. We're seeing the benefits of our refocused R&D and commercial excellence initiatives, including a more than 50% increase in opportunities so far in 2023 and versus the same 2022 period. This increase is giving us continued optimism in the future potential of IFF. In Nourish, increased opportunities across regions and categories, has led to a greater than 60% pipeline inflow versus last year. Our recent notable win included Xylitol, which is a sweetener used in bars, cereals and other confectionery goods. In sense, our compounds pipeline opportunity continues to be healthy and strong. Included in this was a significant win for our Boost Powder Detergent, a 100% active powder laundry detergent that is effective and safe to use unwatchable fabrics. In Health and Biosciences, greater capacity is driving a robust pipeline in our Cultures and Food Enzymes and our Health & Grain Processing units. Included within this is a notable win in North America probiotics, a dietary supplement that supports gut health. And in Pharma Solutions, the pipeline has doubled while the team has delivered key wins in METHOCEL, a plant-based, more dissoluble, functional ingredient that supports dietary sublet manufacturing in a high-growth category. Collectively, our team's creativity and efficiency in bringing innovative solutions to market provides confidence in our ability to strengthen our long-term leadership as the preferred partner for CPGs worldwide. Moving to Slide 14. Our management team is aligned on key objectives essential to IFF's success as market conditions normalize, turning IFF into a leader in high-value innovative solutions. Through the second half of this year and beyond, we are focused on accelerating growth and maximizing shareholder value, expanding our margin, enhancing our return on capital and improving our leverage ratios. We believe we have a strong, achievable plan in place to ensure we are well positioned to rebound growth and profitability and continuing executing on our broader strategic transformation in 2024 and beyond. I will now turn it over to Glenn to discuss our second quarter performance and financial position entering the second half of 2023. Thanks, Glenn. Our incredible teams around the world continue to deliver pioneering discoveries and strengthen our customer relationships ensuring that IFF is the innovative engine behind the most critical and beloved consumer products. These efforts are reflected in the solid results across the majority of our businesses despite the current environment, which gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver industry-leading growth and profitability in the years ahead. Our strategic plan is showing very encouraging early results. We are investing in opportunities for growth, innovation and enhanced productivity, and we are taking decisive actions to manage through the volatile market conditions, refocusing functional ingredients with an operational improvement plan to strengthen operations and execution and progressing our deleveraging efforts through ongoing portfolio optimization efforts, including the launch of our cosmetic ingredients process. Amid even this challenging market environment, we are making great progress transforming IFF into the leader in high-value innovative solutions and the partner for our customers. The actions we are taking today and through the remainder of 2023 will create a stronger IFF capable of delivering significant value for shareholders and all of our stakeholders. With that, I will open the call up for questions. Hi. Yes, this is Frank, and I'll take that one. And good morning, everyone. A couple of things that I want to highlight. First and foremost, if you look at what's taking place through '23. Clearly, we are seeing temporary destocking, as we mentioned, and we have been pulling a number of levers to manage the business. First, you can see really good progress with productivity. As Glenn highlighted, we've been really improving our net working capital and also making sure that we're doing everything to control our cost to manage the '23 year as it unfolds. We are on track. As you recall, we highlighted that we're going to have a cost reduction takeout of about $100 million. That is on track as well. More importantly, though, I am very excited about the opportunity that we have as we come out of temporary destocking. And as we move into '24 and as you could see, as we discussed with our customers, we're very well positioned based on the pipeline increase that we just highlighted, also based on the commercial efforts that we're putting forward. We've improved our customer service significantly, which gives me a lot of confidence as I look at the outlook, to your question over the next several years. So we're managing for the near-term temporary destocking, but we are clearly preparing for a good, strong growth in '24. We still remain committed to our long-term guidance that we put out of 4% to 6% top line sales growth and 8% to 10% EBITDA that we can't communicated during Capital Markets Day. Yes. So I'll take the question. Thanks, It's really important. We've talked to a number of our customers. With regards to the temporary destocking, and we do believe that it is very prudent for us right now to derisk the plan based on the back half of the year, and we do think we've done that. And in derisking the plan, we also believe that we set the floor. So we're very confident and what you are now seeing is our new guidance going forward. Important to note though, while we are navigating '23, we are also continuing to prepare, as we just discussed, as we move into '24 as we see destocking subside and as we see volumes improve. Glenn, I don't know if you want to Yes. And I would add, Gunther, and I highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We've been spending a lot of time with our key customers. I can tell you that I've had discussions with many of with those CEOs with those companies and Chief Technology Officers. And what we highlighted is the 15 new R&D launches this year, the strong platforms that we have and as Glenn mentioned, if you look at our business performance in Scent, if you look at Pharma, if you look at Health & Biosciences overall, we're in really good shape, and the businesses are performing well in a challenging environment and backdrop. And even within Nourish, one of the things I wanted to highlight after is that our Flavors business, our system ingredients business as we help customers solve some of their challenges is in good shape as well and benchmarks extremely well versus our peers. And now we have a plan that we will be getting after improving our functional ingredients and that's something that we'll continue to monitor very closely. We have a new team that's been put in place to really improve that business. And as volumes start to normalize, as you head into next year, we feel really good that you'll start to see improvement in that business, which gives us a lot of confidence for '24. Yes. Nicola, this is Frank. I'll take both. On the first question, we are looking at all options. However, as we've communicated, we will not pursue any options that aren't accretive to our shareholders. And we think right now, in particular, within Functional Ingredients, we are focused on the improvement plan that we outlined, and we do see really good early progress starting to emerge within that business. As far as the first part of your question, if we look at Functional Ingredients, underneath that, I'll use the example of protein solutions with Soft, Nicole of this quarter primarily due to destocking and these are isolated soy proteins that go into nutritional bars and beverages. I've had a chance to meet with a couple of the customers and the positive news is we're very well position within those end markets. The destocking has been the impact primarily for isolated soy proteins going into those beverages and bars. So that's an example, Nicole, of what we've seen, and that's been the impact we've seen across Functional Ingredients primarily destocking. There has been some customer softness in some of the meat alternative products that are within Functional Ingredients as well. But hopefully, that helps give us a little bit more color of what we're seeing. And then as we come out of destocking, as I mentioned, we do anticipate things to start to normalize as we get into '24. Yes. Good question, John. And good morning to you. Materiality and ultimately, the measure is do we expect to be selling it below cost. I would say LBK is a very unique case. You cited some others. But as it relates to the volatility over the last 2 years to give you some sense, prices have dropped from \u20ac35 per kilo to 8 in less than 12 months. So that was a clear case that we needed to basically recognize the current value of the inventory that's an anomaly. At least in my short history of 2 years, we've never seen anything like that in terms of kind of the sheer level of volatility, such a short period of time. I would also note that the inventories were slightly higher, which actually made it a bigger - slightly bigger write-off simply because we were making sure that we had enough supply for security purposes. Relative to the raws trends, they're continuing to progress downward, but I'll say, at a more modest rate than we saw in the second half of last year and then entering into this year. As you know, many of the factors impacting prices such as energy prices is one big input have decreased, but they've stabilized as well. So we're seeing a little bit more improvement. I would note that the other two big input costs for us are logistics and energy, energy has come down dramatically this year. It's largely pretty stable at this point globally. And then logistics as well has been a very, very big improvement over the year, and that has largely stabilized and actually we see some continued downward progression in terms of prices as well. Thank you. Yeah, hi. This is Frank. Thanks for the question. We do work very closely with, in particular, our large global key accounts and then also our large regional accounts. And I do think supply chains have improved, so they are willing to adjust some of their inventories. What we are hearing from them is mixed. Some customers are saying that destocking will start to come to an end as we kind of go through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. Some are saying that it really is depending on end market consumer demand and are thinking more that the destocking persists through the rest of this year and starts to improve as we get into 2024. So what we have done is, as we mentioned, in our approach is to really be prudent in the approach and to derisk our plan. However, we are very much focused on working with them to prepare for once temporary destocking is over to improve, obviously, our performance. And I can tell you that when we look at - as I mentioned, our pipeline win rate and some of the commercial activities we have underway, we feel really good and well positioned. But your question on visibility is one that we are working with them on. But clearly, we are making sure we're doing everything we can prepare for as we head towards the end of this year and into next year. Thanks for the question. Yes, I'll start and then, Glenn, I'll let you add. If you look at Functional Ingredients, what's underneath that is protein solutions, which is about a third or it's approximately - in functional ingredients. We have multipliers and sweeteners. We have core tax trends, cellulosis and food protection and systems are kind of within functional ingredients. We feel good with regards to our specialty protein. So we think there's good differentiation there. And that represents about half of protein solutions, and there are some more value proteins in there that I would say are a little bit more in a competitive landscape. Emulsifiers I would say, are probably in the category of much more competitive to answer your question, and it's something that we're looking at in particular, some of the emulsifiers that are within that category within that business and also some of the core text rents, we feel as though are some are differentiated, but there are some core texturants that are probably more challenged competitively. So we're staring at our portfolio. We feel good overall. We're going to put where we have core differentiation, our efforts to behind that core, and that's a part of the functional ingredients plan. In areas here are some of the ingredients that are more commoditized or where we don't bring a differentiated benefit. That's where we're going to look to really optimize or possibly even discontinue in those ingredients. So we have a well thought out plan as we move forward and feel good about the new team that we have in place. Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. I think that if you look at the transaction, we still feel very confident about the value creation opportunities for IFF going forward. We are, as we highlighted and is primarily due to destocking, and we have a clear plan to address some of the challenges in Functional Ingredients. If you look at our Health & Biosciences business, tremendous capabilities. The business is performing well. Pharma is also performing extremely well. So we still feel very good about the future value creation opportunity, as we move forward. Yes. I think you had a question about visibility into the business, and we do have a window where we are looking at a couple of weeks, obviously, we can look at our orders, and we obviously do a lot of work with regards to engaging with our customers. So - and we moved pretty quickly. I said we move very quickly, I should say, with regards to how we adjust our business. And the example is, I think you're seeing us very rapidly focus on productivity, focus on cash flow. We've moved very rapidly with regards to improvement in net working capital. We signaled early on that we were seeing some softness in destocking and end market demand and ingredients, and we quickly put in place 50 commercial resources to address that. So we're moving very rapidly to address any challenges that we have. And then to your last question, Naresh [ph] President is on board, fully aligned and helped to develop the plan you're seeing around Functional Ingredients as well as helping us to focus on driving Flavors and Systems as we move forward. Yes, Lauren, I would say that when I look at Functional Ingredients, I'll give you an example, where we bring significant differentiating value is within our systems business where we're bringing in combining multiple ingredients. And for example, emulsifiers are used in over 50% of our systems applications and what we're bringing for customers. So we still believe that there is integrated solution opportunities as we work across all of Nourish. What we're highlighting is due to destocking, we need a very quick rapid improvement plan based on the need to improve the financial profile of Functional Ingredients. But we still do see that the integration with in particular, with regards to emulsifiers as well as some of our protein solutions is still bringing a lot of benefit and advantages to customers. Yes. So the answer to the first question is $180 million is related to bringing inventory out of the system. So as I mentioned, there's $500 million of volume related on we have a little bit of raw materials price escalation. So the balance sheet will show a net $400 million and change improvement that way, that's significantly above what we were planning at the beginning of the year, we're sort of making more progress. So the cost of doing that is basically the negative absorption on the P&L from a standpoint for this year. But obviously, it's sort of one and done. And at least for the interim period, honestly, we haven't thought about 5 to 7 years is getting to market and generally, these categories were sort of low single-digit growth is the right target to be in part because we want to be reasonable in part. We also want to optimize the return on these assets because they typically have a lower ROIC more capital intensive. So it's not growth, the sale growth, that's really sort of optimizing the returns. But thanks for the question. You don't need to rebuild them. You just need to may be flat. So as a reference point, our total production will be down around 15% this year. As we mentioned, we expect sales volumes to be down 6. So there's - that 9% incremental is basically to eat through that $0.5 billion of inventory still getting there. So assuming you - that's one and done, then you get the pickup of the 180 next year because obviously, production is at zero at that point going forward. So as you - if you rebuild inventories over time as you grow the business, that actually creates a positive absorption going forward. Yeah, yeah... Yes. The answer is - to the second question, we're very committed to maintaining investment grade. As you're well aware, the rating agencies are patient relative to your long-term strategy and goals. We've obviously have been in close discussions with them. They know our plans in terms of what we're doing. Again, I would submit to you that the reality is on adjusted cash flow basis we're at 900 this year with some onetime items that mainly gets you north of that, probably not the best place to be relative to an $800 million dividend, and we get that, but normal growth trajectory gets you into a much better place from that. On the deleverage, i.e., the activities and the target, we are still committed to heading three times by the end of next year. We have been at work for quite a few months on M&A. And that's - we've been mentioning portfolio revisit since the end of last year. So there are a number of activities underway from that standpoint. And so we do feel that we have enough, if you will, irons in the fire beyond Lucas Meyer to basically accomplish our goals. Great. Thank you, Glenn. And as we come to a close today, a couple of key points I would like to just reiterate. And first, I want to make sure that we reemphasize that the majority of our business is doing well and is very resilient as we manage through temporary destocking. Second, we are taking action very rapidly to improve our business trajectory and our capital structure. We've implemented a functional ingredients operational improvement plan, and we look forward to sharing more with you of the progress. We're driving divestitures, as you've heard, such as the announced sale of LMC as well as additional opportunities that we're looking at to delever, and we're executing on our strategic priorities with strong improvements in commercial and operational excellence, as you heard today. We do remain confident in our value creation potential, given the relative strength of our pipeline and we highlighted just within the first half of this year, over a 50% increase versus prior year and is the transitory nature of destocking ends, that's going to really position us well as we head into 2024, as the environment normalizes. And then lastly, I wanted to really reiterate, IFF is a great business. We're in a great industry, and we have significant opportunities to create value for our stakeholders and we want to thank each and everyone of you for joining our call today."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thanks, Frank. Turning to Slide 15. In Q2, IFF generated $2.9 billion in sales with comparable currency neutral sales declined 4% as strong performance in Scent and Pharma was offset by softness in Nourish and Health and Biosciences. Our pricing continues to remain strong in the second quarter as it was up high single digits. However, volume in the quarter declined low double digits about twice the decline anticipated in the quarter. To provide some more color on volumes, Sent and Pharma were largely in line with expectations, while H&B underperformed in large part due to softer volume performance in health. The majority of our underperformance of our overall volume decline in the quarter, approximately 60% was attributable to Functional Ingredients. Excluding the impact of Functional Ingredients, IFF volume would have only been down mid-single digits. Adjusted operating EBITDA was $510 million, down 18% year-over-year on a comparable currency-neutral basis, largely driven by unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption of approximately $55 million and a $44 million write-down of inventory related to unprecedented cost fluctuations for Locust Bean Kernel. As Frank mentioned earlier, excluding this onetime LDK write-down, our adjusted operating EBITDA would have been $554 million, within our previously communicated guidance range of $540 to $590 million. Adjusted EPS, excluding amortization, was $0.86 in the quarter, impacted by lower profitability. Taking a closer look at our profitability performance on Slide 16. Excluding the unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory reduction program and the inventory write-down of LBK comparable adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis versus the previous year. We continue to benefit from strong pricing and productivity gains. However, as you can see from the slide, the biggest driver impacting profitability in the quarter was the decline in volumes. This volume decline is most pronounced in our Nourish business, driven by Functional Ingredients. As noted, volumes across our Scent and Pharma Solutions businesses met expectations and H&D was modestly behind. Turning now to Slide 17. I'll provide a look at our second quarter performance by business segment. As we've noted, continued weakness in functional ingredients impacted Nourish performance overall, with strong results in Flavors and Food Design and in line with peers. Pricing and productivity gains were more than offset by lower volumes, unfavorable manufacturing absorption and the LBK inventory write-down. Turning to Health & Biosciences, strong results from certain segments, including Cultures and Food Enzymes, Grain processing and Home and Personal Care, were offset by volume decline in health, driven primarily by the continued soft market conditions across the probiotics and broader dietary supplements markets. From a profitability perspective, pricing and productivity gains were more than offset by lower volume and unfavorable manufacturing absorption. Scent continued to remain resilient, performing strongly this quarter, led by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance, and high single-digit growth in Fine Fragrance with solid contributions from both volume and price. This, coupled with strong productivity, led to growth and margin expansion across the division. These initiatives also drove strong growth in Pharma Solutions, which saw a 16% increase in adjusted operating EBITDA on a comparable currency-neutral basis, led by solid performance in our core Pharma business, and ongoing pricing and productivity gains. Turning to Slide 18. Cash flow from operations totaled $375 million this quarter, as a result of our very focused efforts to drive strong working capital improvements and right-size our inventories. We are ahead of target, having achieved approximately $320 million inventory reduction year-to-date, after normalizing for LBK write-down. I would like to reiterate that while this inventory reduction program is adversely impacting the P&L through negative manufacturing absorption, it is a short-term impact that we will be recovering over time. CapEx for the first half was $290 million or approximately 4.9% of sales. Given this, our free cash flow position for the quarter has improved sequentially from last quarter and was $85 million in Q2. Included in our free cash flow is about $160 million of cost primarily related to integration and transaction-related costs. We also distributed $413 million of dividends to our shareholders. In Q2, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $641 million, additionally, net debt for the quarter totaled approximately $10.6 billion with net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 4.5 times. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Improving our leverage profile and ensuring IFF continues to meet its deleverage commitments remains a top priority and I am pleased with the strong working capital improvements made to date. With the initiatives in play, including our portfolio optimization efforts, IFF is on a path to delever according to our plan through the rest of 2023 and into 2024. As we mentioned, we remain laser-focused on achieving our target leverage profile to improve cash flow and the portfolio actions and other strategic initiatives we discussed today. Moving to Slide 19. Like many in our sector, we continue to navigate this unprecedented market environment. Consequently, we now expect many of the challenges that we faced through the first half of the year to continue through the second half of the year, including customer destocking and related consumer demand visibility constraints. And as a result, we have revised our second half outlook. Importantly, we remain intently focused on the levers that we can control, including accelerating sales growth, delivering positive price inflation margin, delivering on our identified productivity initiatives while also seeking additional efficiency opportunities and driving continued improvement in cash flow. Ultimately, these actions will strengthen the platform and better position IFF who when the environment improves. On Slide 20 is our updated financial guidance. We are now expecting net sales to be in a range of $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion, while our new guidance reflects softer revenue expectations across all businesses, our lower expectations and Functional Ingredients accounts for the majority of the revenue change. For the full year 2023, we are expecting Functional Ingredients volumes to be down double digits. However, the rest of the business to be down low single digits amid continued and temporary customer destocking. For the second half of 2023, we expect sales to be between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, with comparable volumes flat to down high single digits. At the midpoint, of our volume guidance range, our 2-year average volume is down 4%, which is consistent with what we delivered in the first half. Also, please remember that included in our first half '23 results are approximately $300 million in sales and approximately $30 million EBITDA related to our Savory Solutions and FSI divestitures. With these transactions closed at the beginning of June and August, respectively, our second half '23 financials will be lower by these amounts. For full year '23, adjusted operating EBITDA we now expect to be between $1.85 billion and $2 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance. This is driven by three factors, our reduced volume expectations, $80 million more of higher absorption costs and the $44 million LBK inventory write-down. We are now expecting our full year inventory reduction to be approximately $425 million, and as a result, the absorption related to our inventory reduction will be approximately $180 million impact to profitability for the full year. To reiterate, this is a onetime transitory impact to the P&L in order to maximize cash flow moving forward. We remain committed to driving working capital improvements through our inventory reduction program as we navigate this near-term complexity. And finally, and very importantly, in light of this environment, we are maintaining strong cost discipline to drive enhanced productivity across the organization in order to protect profitability. For our full year expectations for interest expense, we now expect it to be around $425 million mainly due to higher interest forecast on short-term debt and factory programs and a higher balance of short-term debt due to lower earnings. And we also expect our effective tax rate for the year to be 21% or no change. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to continue to pressure sales in comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth which we now expect will adversely impact us by 2% and 6%, respectively. This incremental pressure is due to a handful of hyperinflationary currencies that have moved against us in the first half of '23, where FX was a 3-point headwind to sales and a 7-point headwind to adjusted operating EBITDA and we expect that many of these currencies will continue to significantly to value in the second half of '23. Now I'll turn back to Frank for closing remarks. Yes. Adam, thanks very much, good morning. And great questions to start off here. Let me start off by reassuring everybody, I am quite confident that we will not trip our covenants and the reason I am is because there are multiple levers that we can pull, and I'll get to your question about cash flow, but we've made very strong progress on working capital and other improvements in cash flow this year. In addition, we are well downstream on divestitures from a portfolio standpoint as well. And I would also remind you that there's a credit-adjusted definition of EBITDA, which is different than the adjusted EBITDA number. So obviously, there are a number of add-backs relative to that calculation. So point one, very confident we will not have an issue with our covenant. Point number two is currently a change in our dividend is not on the table. And then point number three, relative to our cash flow forecast for this year on a free cash flow basis reported we're expecting to be about $100 million lower than our original guide. As a reminder, we had a $600 million free cash flow for this year. We're forecasting $475 million. As a reminder, within that $475 million, there are 450 million Reg G charges. So on an adjusted basis, we expect to be over $900 million. That compares to the $1 billion we started off, that $450 million, by the way, includes $250 million of transaction related. So it's taxes, it's M&A, separation fees for the microbial control FSI and say solutions of the residual, $75 million is related to the final integration activities with DuPont this year, and there's another $100 million plus that are largely related to the restructure that we performed this year. So - so again, on an adjusted basis, we expect our free cash flow to be around $900 million versus the original $1 billion. Thank you. Yes. And if I could just tag on to the end of that regarding your comment regarding the unsustainability of the dividend, I just will piggyback on my response to Adam's question, again, on an adjusted basis, $900 million of free cash flow and in addition, as we've called out, there's over $200 million of onetime items between LBK write-off and then the negative absorption. So we are confident as we exit this year, we're going to be in a much, much better trajectory, particularly as the environment improves. So I'm not sure the assertion on sustainability is correct. I would add. It's a very, very legitimate question, Mark, is a, we feel we're being very prudent relative to the range in terms of what the guide is here. Secondarily, we have July in our belt at this point, and it's negative 4% volume August is trending a little bit lower than that, but very, very consistent with what we think the quarter is unfolding. So a combination of bringing down to a 2-year consistent with the first half, a couple more months largely closed gives us a pretty good sense that we're going to be in a good place. And obviously, we wanted to make sure we were prudent relative to the construction of this outlook. Your question on M&A is a good one, and there's no simple answer. Some businesses are more integrated than others. It is clearly a consideration relative to our portfolio strategy. The good news is we have acquired substantial experience over the last 3 years now through a combination of the sale of the microbial control business, Savory Solution and Atlas as well as other ones we're working on. So we've got a pretty good track record in sort of being able to navigate through that. But it is an important consideration as we think about which parts of the portfolio we trim. Sure. Maybe I'll begin Gunther and Frank can add on. As we think about '24, one is, as we mentioned, we do believe that the environment will be improving. So we think we're now going to be entering an environment where destocking will be complete consumer pullback will be largely stabilized at a point. So that's point one. Point two, as we mentioned, there are a number of items to normalize from this year. So the $180 million associated with absorption which we have consciously tackled, by the way, that has delivered a $500 million reduction in inventory full year from a standpoint. So it's a very, very significant achievement we're accomplishing. It's also the LDK write-off, obviously, 44. So there are onetime items - from a volume standpoint, as Frank had mentioned, we feel that 75% of our business, i.e., everything except Functional Ingredients is performing well in line with our competitive peers. So we'd expect them to continue to trend well in an improving market. And the other 25%, we have been underway for a number of months on remediation and expect that business to pick up next year. And lastly, I would say that the other areas that we can control, i.e., productivity, working capital and cash flow efficiency and portfolio are well on track. So we feel like - those should continue as we move into '24. But obviously, as we close the year, we'll have a more detailed update on next year. Sure. Good morning, Josh. So let me actually - let me just do first half to second half because honestly, the first quarter is very similar to the second quarter. So the first half on a reported basis was $1.2 0 billion [ph] of EBITDA adjusted EBITDA. And then the midpoint of the guide is 9.05 for the second half. As you pointed out, you need to adjust the first half for a combination of the absorption, $150 million LBK write-off, adding another 44, you've got to reduce for divestitures, which come out of the second half, you should take out 30 and then you have foreign exchange differential of $20 million to $30 million, so that gets you roughly to $1.150 billion. And then obviously, for the second half, you have some absorption of 30. So that gets you to 9.35. So it's a 1.150 first half normalized versus a 935 million. So it's roughly $200 million delta between them. So can break it down into basically two components. About $50 million is related to lower GP from seasonal volumes, particularly the fourth quarter, it's our lowest quarter. So on an apples-to-apples basis, there's $100-plus million of differential. The other is a little bit productivity timing, but it's largely a net price realization versus cost higher in the first half than the second half. And as you noted or as we've noted, we have a 7% pricing in the first half. It's circa 3% in the second half. So while we continue to see some progress on reduction of input costs, there was a better achievement in the first half versus the second half. So hopefully, that's helpful. Yes. I would just add two other comments is these are somewhat more commoditized than the rest of our portfolio. But to bring up Frank's point, our portfolio is very much focused on high value add. So you think about our cellulosics business, you think about Xylitol, you sort of think about our soy isolates, really as it relates to specialty proteins, et cetera, alginate, et cetera. We really are focusing a part of our strategy of maximizing the value-add opportunities in our portfolio and have been super turbocharging our customer pipeline activity to focus on those categories. I'll start, Lisa, I think technically at six questions, but let's unpack them. So on the M&A front, there are both PE firms, but more importantly, strategics out there that would have a high level of interest relative to our portfolio, relative to the former of the credit markets have stabilized. So there's tons of PE money out there being put to work and the credit market is actually in a pretty good place. But more importantly, on the strategic side, there is a very broad appetite relative to partnerships, various assets in the portfolio. As you know, most of the peers in this space actually have very good balance sheets. There's value to consolidation in this space, et cetera. So we feel very good about the robustness relative to the opportunities out there. We will be smart in terms of how we do that. It's got to make sense for us strategically in terms of what's in the portfolio - in the portfolio and it needs to be smart from a value creation for our shareholder. As we mentioned earlier, we're not interested in divesting assets cheaply. We'd rather actually maintain them, fix them, grow them from that standpoint before we did that. So I think that was your first set of questions. Frank, do you want to take that?"

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. DeVeau, you may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's first quarter conference call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. Please take a minute to review our forward-looking statements. During the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in our press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Frank Clyburn; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Clyburn: Thanks, Mike. And hello, everyone. We delivered first quarter 2023 results in line or ahead of our expectations amidst a challenging operating environment. Our team successfully navigated soft end market demand and customer inventory destocking as they executed on our priorities to deliver on our financial commitments. We are proud of the results and want to thank the entire IFF team for their contribution. However, year-on-year comparisons in a number of areas showed the backdrop in which we are operating remains challenging as I acknowledged on our last call. As you will see from our quarterly financials, we have made solid progress on our objectives of reducing costs to improve efficiency, recovering inflation and materially reducing our inventories while improving our service levels to our customers. The key challenge remains volume growth and our management team remains keenly focused on accelerating profitable sales growth moving forward. Before I get into our first quarter performance, I do want to share an update on our search for our Nourish President. Over the past several months, we have engaged with various leaders about the opportunity to run our largest division. At this time, our search continues as we are looking to attract a well-regarded leader with a strong track record of success that can drive performance in this division. I am pleased with the slate of candidates that we have and look forward to welcoming a new leader in due course. We will provide further updates going forward as we progress the process. Starting on slide 6, I'd like to begin with a high level look at our performance in the quarter before handing it over to Glenn to discuss our financials and full year outlook in more detail. In quarter one, IFF generated $3 billion in sales, which reflects 1% comparable currency neutral growth, led by increases in Scent and Pharma Solutions. As we expected, volumes in the first quarter, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2022, remained under pressure, down high single digits due mainly to consumer demand slowdowns and significant customer destocking actions. It should be noted that we are also comparing to our strongest year ago comparison, where our volume grew mid- single digits in the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating EBITDA finished at $503 million in the first quarter of 2023 and largely was impacted by the lower volumes as well as our proactive effort to rebalance inventories to drive cash flow generation. As we shared earlier this year, we are executing our inventory reduction program making strong progress in the first quarter, as expected while it was cash flow positive, it did lead to a significant headwind in terms of profitability as our fixed costs were absorbed over reduced manufacturing volumes, which represented approximately a 15 percentage point year-over-year impact. At the same time, we were successfully recovering our total inflation through increased pricing actions in the first quarter and executed on our internal productivity initiatives that continue to deliver strong cost and operational efficiencies. From a leverage perspective, our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 4.6x. As we disclosed earlier in the quarter, we have proactively renegotiated our debt covenants to ensure IFF's continued resilience as we navigate today's complex global macroeconomic environment. These amended agreements will provide us with maximum flexibility as we grow our business and continue to optimize our portfolio to achieve our target profile. To this end, we continue to deliver on our portfolio optimization commitments. Our Savory Solutions divestiture is now on track to close at the end of May. In February, we also announced the sale of our Flavor Specialty Ingredients business to UK based private firm Exponent for $220 million in cash proceeds, which will be used for debt repayment. We expect that this transaction will close by the end of the third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. Moving forward, portfolio divestitures remain a central part of our strategy, and we are evaluating several opportunities to further strengthen our capital structure as we drive towards our targeted leverage profile. Turning to slide 7, I'd like to provide a bit more detail on our sales performance in the quarter. As I mentioned, we delivered more than $3 billion in sales in the first quarter, which represents comparable currency neutral sales growth of 1%. Our revenue growth in the first quarter was led by continued strength in our Scent business and steady performance in Pharma Solutions. In a moment, Glenn will take you through the underlying factors driving the performance across our business segments. But first, it's important I provide high level context on what we are seeing in the environment. Scent once again delivered a strong performance, both fine fragrance and consumer fragrance grew double digits. Our Pharma Solutions segment also delivered solid growth, driven once again by a strong performance in core form. Nourish was flat this quarter as our ingredients business continued to be pressured by macroeconomic factors and destocking, which offset growth in Flavors and Food Design. While certain businesses within our Health and Biosciences segment were also challenged this quarter. Cultures and Food Enzymes and Home and Personal Care were two strong performers in H&B that we expect will continue to gain share throughout the year. Taking a step back and reflecting on our performance, there are essentially a handful of categories that have disproportionately impact our volume performance, specifically with our Nourish segment, our Ingredients division, which represents approximately 25% of total company sales and includes Protein Solutions, Emulsifiers and Sweeteners, core texturants, cellulosics and food protection, drove about 60% of our total volume decline in the quarter. As we outlined at our December Investor Day, we are working to improve our performance and have largely addressed our capacity issues and have improved our service levels in these businesses. We are now working on modifying our pricing strategies, enhancing our commercial coverage and simplifying our internal processes, all to grow our project pipeline and deliver more robust growth going forward. And while this will take time and attention, we are doing so with a sense of urgency to ensure that when current market challenges like destocking subside, we are well positioned to capture market share. Looking at our profitability for this quarter on slide 8, first quarter adjusted operating EBITDA total $503 million, down 19% on a year-over-year comparable currency neutral basis as expected. As I shared on our last call, lower volumes related to consumer demand softness and significant customer inventory destocking. Plus unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory reduction program meaningfully impacted our profitability despite continued strong pricing and productivity gains. We were successful in generating approximately $60 million of gross productivity gains in the first quarter. However, this strong benefit was offset by higher manufacturing related costs, such as lower yields, slower obsolete inventory, and higher manufacturing inflation. If we look at our profitability performance, absence of the unfavorable manufacturing absorption, comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined approximately 4%. Looking ahead, we remain intensely focus on controlling our controllables, including identifying additional opportunities to further optimize our operations and strengthen our balance sheet. While we certainly have work to do to fully execute on our refreshed strategic plan, we have taken significant action to ensure our business maintains its flexibility and resilience needed to deliver in any macroeconomic environment. While we do believe 2023 will continue to be impacted by many of these factors, and depending on an improving volume environment the back after the year, we continue to believe we can deliver our long -\u2060term adjusted operating EBITDA growth target of 8% to 10% on a comparable, currency neutral basis over the \u201824 to \u201826 time period. I'll now turn it over to Glenn to provide more context around our divisional performance, cash flow, and financial outlook going forward.\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Frank, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Turning now to slide 9, let me review our first quarter performance across each of our four business segments. In Nourish, sales were flat on a comparable currency neutral basis with growth in Food Design and Flavors, all set by continued volume declines in ingredients. As Frank shared, Nourish ingredients, which includes protein solutions, emulsifiers and sweeteners, core texturants and cellulosics and food protection had the most pronounced volume declines in the quarter representing approximately 60% of our total company volume decline. Despite our pricing actions and productivity initiatives in the quarter, within our Nourish segment, the lower volumes and the unfavorable manufacturing absorption due to our inventory reduction program that I mentioned earlier, more than offset those efforts, contributing to a 27% year -\u2060over -\u2060year decrease in currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA at $208 million. Those same pressures impacted Health and Biosciences this quarter, with a 3% year -\u2060over -\u2060year decrease in comparable currency \u2060neutral sales and a 19% year -\u2060over -\u2060year decrease in comparable currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, despite price increases and strong productivity gains. While we saw solid growth in Cultures and Food Enzymes and Home and Personal care, lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption also pressured our performance. As Frank mentioned earlier, our Scent division continues to perform quite well, delivering an 8% increase in comparable currency \u2060neutral sales and a 1% increase in comparable currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, driven by double \u2060digit growth in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance. Scent\u2019s growth this quarter was driven by higher volumes, pricing, and productivity gains, as the division has remained resilient. Lastly, I'm pleased to share the Pharma Solution has delivered a 4% increase in comparable currency neutral sales, led by continued growth in core pharma. That said, like Nourish and Health and Biosciences, the segment was also impacted by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption, leading to a 6% decrease in comparable currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Overall for the quarter, sales and EBITDA were slightly ahead of our expectations, with pricing on track, modestly better volumes, and favorable productivity. Now on slide 10, I'll discuss our cash flow and leverage position for the quarter. Cash flow from operations grew $127 million this quarter, which is an improvement versus the negative $4 million we reported in a year ago period. One bright spot in the quarter was approximately a $200 million decrease in inventory versus our year end 2022. As I discussed on our fourth quarter call, we have initiated a number of actions across our business and supply chain, genes, including system process enhancements, to rapidly reduce our inventories over the course of the year. While this is adversely impacting the P&L through negative manufacturing absorption, it is a short-\u2060term impact that will be recovered over time. Looking ahead, while the majority of our efforts to reduce inventories for 2023 are behind us, we do have near-\u2060term headwind in Q2, albeit to a lesser degree than Q1, as we continue to correct our over inventory position and maximize cash flow. I also want to note that accounts payable on the quarter was adversely impacted as a result of season payment patterns, and by our inventory reduction program, whereby we slowed the purchase of raw materials, which had a direct impact on our AP. We expect this will improve over the course of the year as we achieve our target inventory level. CapEx spending for the quarter was $175 million, or approximately 5.8% of sales. This was elevated due to project timing and we expect to moderate through the balance of the year. We continue to believe that we will be around $500 million in CapEx for full year 2023. Our cash flow for the first quarter was negative $48 million. This is consistent with the seasonality of cash flows for our business. Included in our free cash flow is about $100 million of costs, primarily related to integration and transaction related costs. In terms of leverage, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $594 million which includes $4 million in assets currently held for sale. While net debt totaled $10.7 billion, our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.3 billion, and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.6x for the quarter as we mentioned earlier. While our leverage position is slightly higher than in the past few quarters, we were proactive in renegotiating our debt covenants in the first quarter. To ensure that we have appropriate capital flexibility as we execute on our strategic priorities in what may continue to be a challenging market. Importantly, we continue to actively evaluate the portfolio with consideration for further divestitures that provide additional financial flexibility and debt pay down without impacting our long term aspirations. Turning to slide 11 for our consolidated outlook for the fiscal year 2023. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we continue to believe our volume performance will improve, yet acknowledge that market conditions remain uncertain. In our discussion with customers, the majority have signaled that their destocking efforts are ending, as they believe the consumer will remain resilient in the second half. Nevertheless, we have yet to see a broad based volume improvement across our business, but we remain steadfast in our focus to control what we can control to protect profitability, maximize cash flow, and drive portfolio optimization. For the full year, we now expect sales to be approximately $12.3 billion versus $12.5 billion previously. This change is largely related to energy and raw material pass-through price adjustments. In addition, we have a modest increase in unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. As we noted on our February earnings call, about 30% of our original 6% pricing guidance was related to energy inflation, much of which is pass-through via surcharges with energy prices having moderated significantly. We are maintaining our expectation of flat comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth and continue to believe adjusted operating EBITDA will be approximately $2.34 billion. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to continue to pressure sales and comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth which we now expect will adversely impact us 1% and 3% respectively. This incremental pressure is due to a handful of hyperinflationary currencies that have and we expect will continue to significantly devalue over the course of 2023. On a comparable currency neutral basis, all the above noted items translate into approximately 5% versus is approximately 6% previously. The sole driver once again is the energy and raw material pass-through price adjustments as we continue to believe volumes will be flat for the full year. In terms of calendarization, we believe volume will sequentially improve each quarter with a growth rebound expected in the second half of the year as the market challenges are expected to subside and our year ago comparisons are more favorable. To provide additional context, first quarter volume performance was modestly better than we anticipated, with the second quarter modestly lower. The net result is that on a first half basis we are broadly in line with our expectation, which we believe will be offset by a favorable second half. On a two year average basis, we expect first half volumes to be approximately negative 2%, reflective of destocking, and second half volumes to be up plus 2%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect sales to be approximately $3 billion to $3.1 billion, with volume performance down mid-single digits and adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $540 million to $590 million. We remain intensely focused on improving our inventory levels and driving cost savings through productivity and restructuring initiatives to ensure we generate strong cash flow for the full year. As a result, we continue to target 2023 adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion, excluding cost related integration, restructuring and geo related items. Turning to slide 12, we recognize that we continue to face a challenging environment, including reduced visibility on consumer and customer demand outlook and the path of inflation. However, we remain intently focused on what we can control with the goal of continuing to strengthen IFF's operating foundation and execution performance. As we've discussed, there are a few top operational priorities that will enable IFF to not only manage these complexities, but also to drive long-term profitable growth. Our highest long-term priority is accelerating top line growth. To achieve this goal, we are making key strategic investments in key areas of our business and continue to be more surgical in our pricing actions to ensure we recover inflationary pressures while supporting volume growth. We have also made great progress in enhancing our customer service and supply chain agility to reduce bottlenecks and increase efficiency. In the first quarter, we maintained strong service levels while also reducing our inventories, improving approximately $200 million from December \u201922 in conjunction with this, we will be rolling out a redesigned sales, inventory and operations planning process. Enhancing productivity also remains essential as part of our transformation. As mentioned earlier, during the quarter we successfully achieved approximately $60 million of productivity benefits and began seeing initial results from our restructuring program. I expect this benefit will rapidly increase over the balance of the year. And be a strong contributor to our EBITDA performance this year. Last, we remain laser focused on improving our cash flows and delivering our long-term deleveraging target. We expect to continue to make improvements in net working capital through the balance of 2023 and into next year. We are in parallel executing against our portfolio optimization efforts, continuing to divest noncore business, In Q2 and Q3, we expect to complete the sale of our Savory Solutions and Flavored Specialty Ingredients businesses with proceeds used to pay down debt. Going forward, this is a central part of our strategy and we continue to evaluate additional portfolio optimization opportunities to strengthen our capital structure. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Frank.\nFrank Clyburn: Thank you, Glenn. Moving to slide 13, I would like to summarize our current position. In line first quarter results and reiterate where we are headed for the remainder of 2023. Over the years, IFF has remained resilient amid a variety of market conditions while successfully transforming the business to meet evolving customer needs. The same is true today as we focus on controlling what we can control and executing on the operational priorities outlined in our strategic refresh in order to achieve our financial vision and drive sustainable, profitable growth that benefits all of our stakeholders. We continue to believe our volume will improve, yet acknowledge that market conditions remain uncertain. As Glenn mentioned earlier, a majority of our customers have signaled that they expect destocking efforts will end and believe the consumer will remain resilient in the second half. We will continue to take action to stay nimble. Strengthen our financial and operational foundation and maintain our resilience as we continue to be diligently focused on delivering our operational and financial objectives. Moving forward, we remain committed to bringing strong products and innovation to our customers as we meet or exceed their service expectations. Financially, we are focused on improving our working capital positioned by rapidly reducing inventory levels to increase cash flow generation and we will continue to execute on our growth focused strategy by enhancing productivity, driving operational efficiencies and prioritizing our highest return businesses, all while maintaining capital discipline. We have started the year in line with our objectives and are confident in our ability to continue to execute going forward. Once again, I want to thank our teams for their tireless work to innovate and bring to market the essential products and solutions that shape so many of our daily experiences. And I have no doubt that we are well on track to build a more efficient, agile and customer centric organization poised to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in any market environment. With that, I would like to now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Heidi Vesterinen with BNP Paribas.\nHeidi Vesterinen: Good morning. So I wondered if you could please talk more about the cadence of volume and margin performance to the quarters to get your guidance, please, and specifically on volume. So you reported Q1 volumes down high single digits, which I think is what you had guided for originally, but then in your speech, you said that it was better than expected. And then you're now saying, I think Q2 is looking somewhat worse than expected, and I think your guidance used to be down low single digits. So can you clarify what the guidance for Q2, please? Perhaps if you can also comment by segment and then same for margins through the year, please. Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn: Hi, Heidi. It's Frank. A couple of things. So in Q1, we had guided to your point high single digits volume decline, and we actually performed a little bit better than what we had assumed in that original guidance, sales were up 1%, as you know, on a currency neutral basis. So a little bit of ahead in Q1. Q2 is slight down from what we had assumed originally. However, when we take a step back, Heidi, think about the first half of the year, mid-single digit volume decline, which is pretty much right on what we had expected at the beginning of the year. So really what you're seeing is a phasing and shift for the first half of the year, mid-single digit decline in volume. And we'll talk a little bit more about some of the different areas here in just a bit. The second half of the year, what we are anticipating and assuming is obviously against a much easier comp as we get to the back half of the year. We are making the assumption that we will have mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year, which then, when you look at the full year, has our volume being flat year-over-year. So let me unpack a little bit about some of the key assumptions as we get into the back half of the year and even into the second quarter. First, destocking, we are assuming that ends pretty much in Q2. So if you think about destocking, Heidi, we saw this really come to fruition in Q4, the volumes were down high single digits of Q4 of \u201822. We continue to see destocking in Q1 and some destocking is continuing in Q2. But we think destocking at the end as we head into the second half of the year. This is really important for our protein solutions business and health business that were significantly impacted by destocking. Second, the assumption is that consumer trends do remain resilient. There's some uncertainty in that but if we look at what we have heard from our customers and as we're working with them and bringing innovative solutions. In Home and Personal Care, we saw good growth in the first quarter. We anticipate that will continue, dish detergent, a lot of innovative projects that we're working on and we see good progress and acceleration as we go into the second half of the year. We think food and beverage will still remain resilient. Obviously, our flavors business is really important there grew in Q1 and we anticipate we will see accelerated sequential performance as we go throughout this year and in the back half. We also are focused on improving our ingredients business. We've discussed that really a focus on putting some additional resources behind ingredients. Our customer service has improved significantly. We have the capacity to serve customers. So that's something that we are also assuming as we go forward and in our ingredients business. And then we're seeing resilience in consumer and fine fragrance, and we anticipate that to continue. And then also pharma continues to be resilient as well. So when we take a step back from a volume perspective, Heidi, think of first half down mid-single digit volume, second half up mid-single digit volume, and then ultimately volume flat for the full year. The third thing that we are seeing that we believe will accelerate in the back half of the year and improve sequentially is geographical volume growth in the back half. For instance, China, this quarter, Heidi was up 2% in sales. Asia Pacific, or I should say Greater Asia, was up 1%. As we talk to our teams in Asia and in China, while the opening is still slow in parts of China, we are seeing improved signals from customers. And that gives us confidence as we get into the back half of the year that you will see geographical improvement. And then we've also noted that North America has been challenged for us over the last couple of quarters. We anticipate sequentially that will improve as we get to the back half of the year. So that's the assumptions from a volume perspective, a lot of like we said, there's some uncertainty, but we're believing that those three assumptions and drivers are what gives us the assumption at this point in time to hold our volume flat for the year. In addition to that, as you look at the back half of the year, there's a couple of other things I will highlight. On the call, we spoke about the fact that absorption in the first quarter was a headwind for us. It will be a headwind in Q2 to a lesser degree, obviously, as you get to the back half of the year, that will go positive and help us. And then in addition to that, if you recall, we highlighted that we have our cost reduction program. Full year, we highlighted a cost reduction program of $100 million. We highlighted a run rate of $70 million to $75 million for the year. And if you look at the back half, that is where you'll see the majority of that benefit in the second half of this year as we execute on our cost and people reduction program. So when we take all those things into account, Heidi, that is why we feel as though holding our EBITDA guidance to the $2.34 billion that Glenn highlighted was the appropriate assumption at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks. And good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about guidance and then some of the troubled areas within the business. So in your opinion, are you being more conservative or optimistic than you were previously? It seems like underlying assumptions, maybe from a consumer dynamic, has changed to be more positive within the underlying guidance. I'm curious if you could comment on that. And then for the more challenged portions of the portfolio, things like the legacy and [inaudible] and ingredients. In terms of what you highlighted, what proactive steps are you taking to offset what seems like perhaps more permanent and structural volumetric share loss? Meaning like improving service levels doesn't seem like it could be enough to change the trajectory of the business, but perhaps I'm wrong. So sort of curious how you're thinking about what you can do to improve those pieces of the business which have been dragging performance and losing share. Thanks.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Mark, it\u2019s Frank, a couple of things. One is with regards to the businesses that were challenged, and some of these as we have highlighted clearly were due to what we see more destocking and end market demand and not necessarily share loss. But I will also acknowledge there has been share loss in other parts of our business. So for instance in health, Mark, you highlighted, we have discussed that the probiotic market in North America several times. In that business in particular, we have been really focused on our resources into that marketplace. That is really the down in volume has been driven much more by destocking and end market softness. But with that said, we have a strong focus with our health team. There's a lot of reviews with our commercial team, and we are starting to see sequential improvement in that business, Mark, as we go forward. In our Ingredients business, as I just highlighted, there's a couple of things that we are put in place. One, our customer service levels were not where they needed to be. We highlighted that during our Investor Day. They have improved significantly, Mark. So that is a big, I would say, plus for us, and we're getting good positive feedback from customers. So customer service levels in the on time performance range of 90% to 95% is really important, and we're there. Second, we now have the capacity that we need to supply customers. We had run into capacity challenges in the past, so we now have the supply that we need. Third, we are putting targeted resources in specific markets that are going to be focused on commercial customers around ingredients. So additional resources Mark, to your point are also a part of what we are doing. And then, four, what has been encouraging, we had gotten away from really good pipeline development with our customers in that space. And I can tell you this is going to take some time, but we are seeing good projects now come to fruition, and we are seeing pipeline progress in nourish and in ingredients since specifically. So those are the areas of focus. The team is spending a lot of time really looking at how we can accelerate our sales performance in those areas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gunther Zechmann with Bernstein.\nGunther Zechmann: Hi, thank you. Hi, Frank. Hi, Glenn. Can you please provide your insights into the cash flow progression, the cadence throughout the year and the $1 billion free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow target? And also within that, could you just discuss and outline what you've embedded in terms of working capital improvement, please?\nGlenn Richter: Good afternoon, Gunther. Thanks for the question. I think the summarized version is we're actually tracking quite well against our objectives. And I'll sort of unpack, as you know, the two big contributors relative to our adjusted free cash flow combination of achieving our earnings guidance and then secondarily all the work on working capital. We had a very good quarter relative to our expectations around working capital. As a reminder, our full year objectives for working capital are consisted of a $200 million point on point, yearend reduction in inventory and then $100 million increase between payables and receivables for a net $100 million reduction in net working capital. The biggest driver of that, obviously, is inventory at that $200 million, that $200 million reduction is actually a $350 million volume reduction with $160 million of basically price escalation, i.e. raw material cost increases coming through. In the first quarter, focusing on inventory, we actually were over $200 million down inclusive of around $80 million of price escalation. So the volume component in the first quarter was $280 million against our full year objective of $350 million. So we're trending quite well. We will probably actually get to the full sort of, our initial level of inventory reduction by the end of the second quarter at this point in time. Payables and receivables, they're a little lumpy seasonally. We're feeling very good about achieving those objectives at the end of the year. So overall we feel very good, particularly relative to the working capital improvements.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. How do you explain what appears to be underlying consumer strength in fragrances versus the underlying consumer weakness in food, ingredients? Or maybe the question should be how did the channels get so overstocked in food, ingredients and not so overstocked in fragrance consumer products? And are there significant divergences in the current point of sale volumes between packaged food and fragrance products?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Hi, John. This is Frank. What we have seen in consumer fragrances, in particular, we saw a very strong Q1. In fact, we also saw a very strong Q1 in fine fragrances as well. So we feel really good about what we're seeing. I think consumer fragrances, it was a lot of, I would say pent-up demand. I think you are seeing clearly some positive trends on what we have been working with our customers, in particular, bringing new innovation to consumer fragrances. We've worked with lot of the large consumer packaged goods companies over the last several years and I think this is where we really have brought strong innovation in our consumer business. So we feel really good about that. There clearly was an inventory build significantly in ingredients as we've highlighted. You could see it as you go through the first part of \u201822 and then you look all the way back to \u201821. I think that what took place in those businesses in particular, uncertainty around supply chains and companies wanting to make sure that they had the supply necessary as you went through a lot of volatility in the supply chains, which is what caused the build. And obviously now what we're seeing is some of the destocking from those efforts in those businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS.\nLucas Beaumont: Yes. Good morning. This is Lucas Beaumont on for Josh. So just wanted to focus on the production cost under absorption. Could you please tell us sort of what was the actual size of the impact there in 1Q? Look like maybe $150 million or so in the EBITDA bridge. And then looking at 2Q in the second half, how much residual impact are you assuming in each period as the year progresses? And finally, if we get a scenario where volumes kind of disappoint to the downside, would that get larger? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey. Thanks for the question. This is Glenn. Within the first quarter, the negative absorption impact was $100 million, which translates actually into 330 basis points of impact on EBITDA margin. That represented a year-over-year volume decline of about 20%. So think about our annual fixed cost base for our manufacturing base of about $2 billion. Every one point on an annualized basis is basically worth about $20 million. So hence why we're able to reduce our inventory so significantly, we took production down significantly, so I'll say a onetime event of $100 million. We are expecting, as I mentioned, to continue to make progress on reducing inventories and expecting to have mid-single digit down volume in the second quarter. That translates into another $50 million of negative absorption. We are anticipating actually positive absorption in the second half of the year as Frank mentioned. We're expecting mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year. So production volumes being up year-over-year. Again, the context of the risk associated or opportunity associated with declines or increases in manufacturing, one point on a full year basis is equal to $20 million of negative absorption. So if you think about two points in the second half, that would be the equivalency of that $20 million. We have discussed in the past. We will have to continue to consider that if we continue to see volume softer than our expectations, what will be the balance of continuing to manage cash flow and keep our inventories in the right place for production efficiency purposes versus basically the earnings profile. So they're clearly in a softer environment than anticipated. There is some risk of further negative absorption in the second half of the year. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.\nGhansham Panjabi: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Yes, just judging by some of the comments from your major customers out of this earnings season, it clearly looks like the global consumer is a little bit weaker. Just curious, given inflation has peaked and just your more recent conversations with your customers, do you get a sense as to whether some of the promotional activity that your customers typically resort to during periods of weakness, are they starting to contemplate that? Just trying to get a sense as to the risk profile as we cycle through the rest of the year because you will be passed these talking, but we still have a weaker consumer. Thanks.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, hi. This is Frank. I think as we talk to our customers, at least the big consumer good companies, I would say they're probably cautiously optimistic on the resiliency of the consumer. They are stepping up in certain categories, promotional activities and efforts. We have clearly seen a lot of, I would say good focus from them on innovation and looking for new projects as they continue to focus on building out their future offerings to consumers. I also think that what is taking place is if you look at from our lens and it goes back to what I was highlighting, we do anticipate that sequential improvement will continue from a volume perspective. So just to reiterate a couple of points in particular in the areas that are really key for us, the sequential lift going from first half down mid-single digits to positive mid-single digits in the second half. We do continue to see working with our customers very clear opportunities for that sequential step up, especially against a softer back comparison quarter in the back half. So we believe that our consumer companies that we're working closely with are the ones that are highlighting differentiation and innovation has been key. And that's something that we will continue to focus and work on as a company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Keches with Barclays.\nAndrew Keches: Yes, hi. Good morning. Glenn, I was hoping to get a little more context for your deleveraging plans over the next well, this year and next. So you came into this year a little over 4x on the net basis that figure has gone up, again as expected, you do have those divestitures announced which will help you get leverage back down, it looks like to about where you came into the year, but I think it still looks like we're going to end the year around flat in 2023 from a leverage standpoint. So I guess that leaves you with a lot of wood to chop next year to get down to that 3.0x target. So I guess the question is do you expect to get there organically or at this point do you actually need those additional portfolio actions to drive the accelerated deleveraging and actually get you there next year? And then related to that, it's not lost to me that your dividend is really absorbing all your cash flow at this point. So to the extent that conditions do deteriorate from here or you can't optimize the portfolio further, are you open to considering a dividend reduction or cut at some point to preserve the investment grade status?\nGlenn Richter: Hey Andrew, this is Glenn, thanks for the question. Agree relative to wood chopping, that's why I have a hatchet with me today. But relative to your assumption for this year, you're correct. We were a little over 4x at the beginning of the year. We will be receiving net proceeds after tax distributions transaction over $750 million, combination of this quarter and next quarter related to the sales saving solutions and FSI which will all go to debt pay down relative to getting to the 3x times or less by the end of next year. We are fully committed to that. That will be achieved through a combination of three elements. One, we continue to have opportunity to improve our working capital position. We expect to continue to make progress next year from this year. Secondarily, we do expect the earnings trajectory will improve significantly next year. Part of it is overlapping some significant items, such as $100 million of negative absorption and then getting the top line going with our productivity program. So that's the second thing either denominator improving, but that all being said, divestitures clearly play a role in getting to that less than 3x. We have been very active reviewing the portfolio. We are proceeding on multiple fronts. We are fully confident that we have an attractive set of assets that actually aren't ideal fits for our portfolio. We are past the two year anniversary of the Reverse Morris Trust considerations as of February this year of note, and we are proceeding quite well on that path. So I'd say our confidence remains high and commitment remains high to get to less than 3x. And regarding cutting the dividend, that is not on the table at all.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.\nChristopher Parkinson: Thank you. You adjusted your revenue guidance a little bit. You're citing some energy and raw movements. Just can you remind us of just how much of your portfolio passes through? And just as a corollary of that, can you also just give us a real quick update on price cost movements, yes, for the balance of \u201823 and just what portion of your portfolio you believe will reign resilient in terms of pricing? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey, Chris. It's Glenn again. Relative to energy, as a reminder, in our original guidance, at the beginning of the year, we had 6% gross pricing in the P&L. 30% of that, or a little less than two points, was associated with energy. About 75% of our energy prices are either directly via index or indirectly via aligned surcharge attached to energy pass-through to customers, and they are generally reviewed on a quarterly basis. We expect that as we mentioned, we're taking a point out of that just because there's been a very significant decline in energy prices globally. We believe that that will be relatively net neutral this year, in part not only because the pass-through, but secondary timing. The majority of our energy prices actually sit in inventory because they're part of production cost. So with 140 days of inventory, they sort of match by the end of the year. There should be some overlap as we roll into next year, but for this year, we're assuming that the energy net is sort of neutral from a P&L standpoint. In general, we are seeing positive deflationary trends not only in energy, but in logistics as well as in certain raw materials. So that is favorable relative to the portfolio, as we mentioned in the past, we believe that is a potential upside. It would be either late this year because generally the rolls obviously run through inventories, but could be meaningful next year. And relative to our portfolio, we would say that roughly 60 to two thirds of our portfolio have some degree of resiliency, i.e. less commoditized, more uniqueness relative to characteristic. But I would caution we're in the early days of deflation. So I think it's a little early to declare sort of significant margin capture relative to improvements in raw material and other costs as well. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you guys commented on pricing, particularly in Nourish as a revisiting of pricing strategy. So I was just kind of curious if we could talk a little bit more about that kind of where you think there are areas to adjust what you kind of meant by that. And then a corollary would be just a discussion on Nourish margins over time. Kind of been in that like, 12% range over the past two quarters. And I was just curious how you're thinking about Nourish profitability, perhaps looking further out and also, again, notice adjustment in pricing strategy. Thanks.\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Hey, Lauren, it's Frank. On the pricing strategy, we are working with customers to balance price volume opportunities. So clearly this is not across the board, but very surgical, Lauren, in our practices, in particular, in certain geographies and I would highlight in great areas of China and certain markets where there is more price sensitivity. We are looking at price volume, but not across the board. So very surgical approach to pricing. Margins will improve, Lauren, over this year and over time. Remember that Nourish based on the first quarter, a lot of the manufacturing absorption impacted the Nourish division in Q1. There'll be some impact, as we've highlighted in Q2. And then things will improve in the back half for Nourish and for the company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America.\nMatthew DeYoe: Good morning, everyone. Frank, can you talk a little bit about the enzymes business? I know it's a big consumer of energy and footprint is pretty European based. So the gas price in Europe, with that coming off a lot, is that an area where energy will be given back in price? Do you think you can hold on to it there? And I guess, given all the volatility on the cost center, where are margins now for enzymes versus maybe where they were in 2021? And where do you think they may be by the end of the year?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, I'll have to take a look back in \u201821. But let me give you the enzyme business and take a step back. One, we think this is a really important business for us, and we're seeing great innovation in our enzyme business. As I highlighted, we saw really good growth in home and personal care. We continue to see really good growth from our food and cultural enzymes. And we're seeing encouraging now trends as destocking improves in our probiotic business. Grain processing, animal nutrition is still somewhat challenged, but we are working very diligently on those businesses. From a margin perspective, I'll take a, look, remember that as we look at 2021, our overall margins were obviously, I think, better in \u201821. We did see obviously decline based off of what has happened from inflation. So clearly that has impacted us in 2022. Manufacturing absorption also impacted us as we hit the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. But over time, we're really confident in the margin progression and improvement in the health and biosciences business as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Silica Cook with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. There's like $52 million in severance charges you recorded this quarter. Is that roughly like 500 people that are supposed to leave? And can you tell how many have left so far and how many are to leave? And I have a follow up on volumes. If you volumes split out mid-single digits for the quarter, does that mean that we're down high single digits in nutrition and in health and bio? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Hey Sopha, this is Glenn. We are expecting charges of roughly $75 million full year for the cost reduction program. That will be an annualized impact of about $100 million. We expect kind of around $72 million to hit the P&L this year. For obvious reasons, I'm not going to describe sort of the pace at which exits in the organization are happening from the standpoint. So that covers that. Can you remind me the second question again?\nUnidentified Analyst : I was wondering whether your volume headwinds were like in the high single digits -- were down . I was wondering whether volumes were in high single digits in both nourish and, in your healthcare, and bio segment.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. As we had mention, the softish part of our business from a volume standpoint was in Nourish. But more specifically that really was in the ingredients portfolio, which is roughly $3 billion of Nourish on an annualized basis. So that's where it was concentrated for flavors and food designs generally were fine. Thank you. There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Frank Clyburn for closing remarks.\nFrank Clyburn: Thank you everyone and appreciate the time today for our first quarter earnings call. And we look forward to future updates and continuing our transformation. And our overall path to a very strong, profitable, growth profile company and helping consumers around the world. Look forward to speaking to you soon.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Clyburn",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. And hello, everyone. We delivered first quarter 2023 results in line or ahead of our expectations amidst a challenging operating environment. Our team successfully navigated soft end market demand and customer inventory destocking as they executed on our priorities to deliver on our financial commitments. We are proud of the results and want to thank the entire IFF team for their contribution. However, year-on-year comparisons in a number of areas showed the backdrop in which we are operating remains challenging as I acknowledged on our last call. As you will see from our quarterly financials, we have made solid progress on our objectives of reducing costs to improve efficiency, recovering inflation and materially reducing our inventories while improving our service levels to our customers. The key challenge remains volume growth and our management team remains keenly focused on accelerating profitable sales growth moving forward. Before I get into our first quarter performance, I do want to share an update on our search for our Nourish President. Over the past several months, we have engaged with various leaders about the opportunity to run our largest division. At this time, our search continues as we are looking to attract a well-regarded leader with a strong track record of success that can drive performance in this division. I am pleased with the slate of candidates that we have and look forward to welcoming a new leader in due course. We will provide further updates going forward as we progress the process. Starting on slide 6, I'd like to begin with a high level look at our performance in the quarter before handing it over to Glenn to discuss our financials and full year outlook in more detail. In quarter one, IFF generated $3 billion in sales, which reflects 1% comparable currency neutral growth, led by increases in Scent and Pharma Solutions. As we expected, volumes in the first quarter, similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2022, remained under pressure, down high single digits due mainly to consumer demand slowdowns and significant customer destocking actions. It should be noted that we are also comparing to our strongest year ago comparison, where our volume grew mid- single digits in the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating EBITDA finished at $503 million in the first quarter of 2023 and largely was impacted by the lower volumes as well as our proactive effort to rebalance inventories to drive cash flow generation. As we shared earlier this year, we are executing our inventory reduction program making strong progress in the first quarter, as expected while it was cash flow positive, it did lead to a significant headwind in terms of profitability as our fixed costs were absorbed over reduced manufacturing volumes, which represented approximately a 15 percentage point year-over-year impact. At the same time, we were successfully recovering our total inflation through increased pricing actions in the first quarter and executed on our internal productivity initiatives that continue to deliver strong cost and operational efficiencies. From a leverage perspective, our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 4.6x. As we disclosed earlier in the quarter, we have proactively renegotiated our debt covenants to ensure IFF's continued resilience as we navigate today's complex global macroeconomic environment. These amended agreements will provide us with maximum flexibility as we grow our business and continue to optimize our portfolio to achieve our target profile. To this end, we continue to deliver on our portfolio optimization commitments. Our Savory Solutions divestiture is now on track to close at the end of May. In February, we also announced the sale of our Flavor Specialty Ingredients business to UK based private firm Exponent for $220 million in cash proceeds, which will be used for debt repayment. We expect that this transaction will close by the end of the third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. Moving forward, portfolio divestitures remain a central part of our strategy, and we are evaluating several opportunities to further strengthen our capital structure as we drive towards our targeted leverage profile. Turning to slide 7, I'd like to provide a bit more detail on our sales performance in the quarter. As I mentioned, we delivered more than $3 billion in sales in the first quarter, which represents comparable currency neutral sales growth of 1%. Our revenue growth in the first quarter was led by continued strength in our Scent business and steady performance in Pharma Solutions. In a moment, Glenn will take you through the underlying factors driving the performance across our business segments. But first, it's important I provide high level context on what we are seeing in the environment. Scent once again delivered a strong performance, both fine fragrance and consumer fragrance grew double digits. Our Pharma Solutions segment also delivered solid growth, driven once again by a strong performance in core form. Nourish was flat this quarter as our ingredients business continued to be pressured by macroeconomic factors and destocking, which offset growth in Flavors and Food Design. While certain businesses within our Health and Biosciences segment were also challenged this quarter. Cultures and Food Enzymes and Home and Personal Care were two strong performers in H&B that we expect will continue to gain share throughout the year. Taking a step back and reflecting on our performance, there are essentially a handful of categories that have disproportionately impact our volume performance, specifically with our Nourish segment, our Ingredients division, which represents approximately 25% of total company sales and includes Protein Solutions, Emulsifiers and Sweeteners, core texturants, cellulosics and food protection, drove about 60% of our total volume decline in the quarter. As we outlined at our December Investor Day, we are working to improve our performance and have largely addressed our capacity issues and have improved our service levels in these businesses. We are now working on modifying our pricing strategies, enhancing our commercial coverage and simplifying our internal processes, all to grow our project pipeline and deliver more robust growth going forward. And while this will take time and attention, we are doing so with a sense of urgency to ensure that when current market challenges like destocking subside, we are well positioned to capture market share. Looking at our profitability for this quarter on slide 8, first quarter adjusted operating EBITDA total $503 million, down 19% on a year-over-year comparable currency neutral basis as expected. As I shared on our last call, lower volumes related to consumer demand softness and significant customer inventory destocking. Plus unfavorable manufacturing absorption related to our inventory reduction program meaningfully impacted our profitability despite continued strong pricing and productivity gains. We were successful in generating approximately $60 million of gross productivity gains in the first quarter. However, this strong benefit was offset by higher manufacturing related costs, such as lower yields, slower obsolete inventory, and higher manufacturing inflation. If we look at our profitability performance, absence of the unfavorable manufacturing absorption, comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA would have declined approximately 4%. Looking ahead, we remain intensely focus on controlling our controllables, including identifying additional opportunities to further optimize our operations and strengthen our balance sheet. While we certainly have work to do to fully execute on our refreshed strategic plan, we have taken significant action to ensure our business maintains its flexibility and resilience needed to deliver in any macroeconomic environment. While we do believe 2023 will continue to be impacted by many of these factors, and depending on an improving volume environment the back after the year, we continue to believe we can deliver our long -\u2060term adjusted operating EBITDA growth target of 8% to 10% on a comparable, currency neutral basis over the \u201824 to \u201826 time period. I'll now turn it over to Glenn to provide more context around our divisional performance, cash flow, and financial outlook going forward. Thank you, Glenn. Moving to slide 13, I would like to summarize our current position. In line first quarter results and reiterate where we are headed for the remainder of 2023. Over the years, IFF has remained resilient amid a variety of market conditions while successfully transforming the business to meet evolving customer needs. The same is true today as we focus on controlling what we can control and executing on the operational priorities outlined in our strategic refresh in order to achieve our financial vision and drive sustainable, profitable growth that benefits all of our stakeholders. We continue to believe our volume will improve, yet acknowledge that market conditions remain uncertain. As Glenn mentioned earlier, a majority of our customers have signaled that they expect destocking efforts will end and believe the consumer will remain resilient in the second half. We will continue to take action to stay nimble. Strengthen our financial and operational foundation and maintain our resilience as we continue to be diligently focused on delivering our operational and financial objectives. Moving forward, we remain committed to bringing strong products and innovation to our customers as we meet or exceed their service expectations. Financially, we are focused on improving our working capital positioned by rapidly reducing inventory levels to increase cash flow generation and we will continue to execute on our growth focused strategy by enhancing productivity, driving operational efficiencies and prioritizing our highest return businesses, all while maintaining capital discipline. We have started the year in line with our objectives and are confident in our ability to continue to execute going forward. Once again, I want to thank our teams for their tireless work to innovate and bring to market the essential products and solutions that shape so many of our daily experiences. And I have no doubt that we are well on track to build a more efficient, agile and customer centric organization poised to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in any market environment. With that, I would like to now open the call for questions. Hi, Heidi. It's Frank. A couple of things. So in Q1, we had guided to your point high single digits volume decline, and we actually performed a little bit better than what we had assumed in that original guidance, sales were up 1%, as you know, on a currency neutral basis. So a little bit of ahead in Q1. Q2 is slight down from what we had assumed originally. However, when we take a step back, Heidi, think about the first half of the year, mid-single digit volume decline, which is pretty much right on what we had expected at the beginning of the year. So really what you're seeing is a phasing and shift for the first half of the year, mid-single digit decline in volume. And we'll talk a little bit more about some of the different areas here in just a bit. The second half of the year, what we are anticipating and assuming is obviously against a much easier comp as we get to the back half of the year. We are making the assumption that we will have mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year, which then, when you look at the full year, has our volume being flat year-over-year. So let me unpack a little bit about some of the key assumptions as we get into the back half of the year and even into the second quarter. First, destocking, we are assuming that ends pretty much in Q2. So if you think about destocking, Heidi, we saw this really come to fruition in Q4, the volumes were down high single digits of Q4 of \u201822. We continue to see destocking in Q1 and some destocking is continuing in Q2. But we think destocking at the end as we head into the second half of the year. This is really important for our protein solutions business and health business that were significantly impacted by destocking. Second, the assumption is that consumer trends do remain resilient. There's some uncertainty in that but if we look at what we have heard from our customers and as we're working with them and bringing innovative solutions. In Home and Personal Care, we saw good growth in the first quarter. We anticipate that will continue, dish detergent, a lot of innovative projects that we're working on and we see good progress and acceleration as we go into the second half of the year. We think food and beverage will still remain resilient. Obviously, our flavors business is really important there grew in Q1 and we anticipate we will see accelerated sequential performance as we go throughout this year and in the back half. We also are focused on improving our ingredients business. We've discussed that really a focus on putting some additional resources behind ingredients. Our customer service has improved significantly. We have the capacity to serve customers. So that's something that we are also assuming as we go forward and in our ingredients business. And then we're seeing resilience in consumer and fine fragrance, and we anticipate that to continue. And then also pharma continues to be resilient as well. So when we take a step back from a volume perspective, Heidi, think of first half down mid-single digit volume, second half up mid-single digit volume, and then ultimately volume flat for the full year. The third thing that we are seeing that we believe will accelerate in the back half of the year and improve sequentially is geographical volume growth in the back half. For instance, China, this quarter, Heidi was up 2% in sales. Asia Pacific, or I should say Greater Asia, was up 1%. As we talk to our teams in Asia and in China, while the opening is still slow in parts of China, we are seeing improved signals from customers. And that gives us confidence as we get into the back half of the year that you will see geographical improvement. And then we've also noted that North America has been challenged for us over the last couple of quarters. We anticipate sequentially that will improve as we get to the back half of the year. So that's the assumptions from a volume perspective, a lot of like we said, there's some uncertainty, but we're believing that those three assumptions and drivers are what gives us the assumption at this point in time to hold our volume flat for the year. In addition to that, as you look at the back half of the year, there's a couple of other things I will highlight. On the call, we spoke about the fact that absorption in the first quarter was a headwind for us. It will be a headwind in Q2 to a lesser degree, obviously, as you get to the back half of the year, that will go positive and help us. And then in addition to that, if you recall, we highlighted that we have our cost reduction program. Full year, we highlighted a cost reduction program of $100 million. We highlighted a run rate of $70 million to $75 million for the year. And if you look at the back half, that is where you'll see the majority of that benefit in the second half of this year as we execute on our cost and people reduction program. So when we take all those things into account, Heidi, that is why we feel as though holding our EBITDA guidance to the $2.34 billion that Glenn highlighted was the appropriate assumption at this time. Yes. Mark, it's Frank, a couple of things. One is with regards to the businesses that were challenged, and some of these as we have highlighted clearly were due to what we see more destocking and end market demand and not necessarily share loss. But I will also acknowledge there has been share loss in other parts of our business. So for instance in health, Mark, you highlighted, we have discussed that the probiotic market in North America several times. In that business in particular, we have been really focused on our resources into that marketplace. That is really the down in volume has been driven much more by destocking and end market softness. But with that said, we have a strong focus with our health team. There's a lot of reviews with our commercial team, and we are starting to see sequential improvement in that business, Mark, as we go forward. In our Ingredients business, as I just highlighted, there's a couple of things that we are put in place. One, our customer service levels were not where they needed to be. We highlighted that during our Investor Day. They have improved significantly, Mark. So that is a big, I would say, plus for us, and we're getting good positive feedback from customers. So customer service levels in the on time performance range of 90% to 95% is really important, and we're there. Second, we now have the capacity that we need to supply customers. We had run into capacity challenges in the past, so we now have the supply that we need. Third, we are putting targeted resources in specific markets that are going to be focused on commercial customers around ingredients. So additional resources Mark, to your point are also a part of what we are doing. And then, four, what has been encouraging, we had gotten away from really good pipeline development with our customers in that space. And I can tell you this is going to take some time, but we are seeing good projects now come to fruition, and we are seeing pipeline progress in nourish and in ingredients since specifically. So those are the areas of focus. The team is spending a lot of time really looking at how we can accelerate our sales performance in those areas. Yes. Hi, John. This is Frank. What we have seen in consumer fragrances, in particular, we saw a very strong Q1. In fact, we also saw a very strong Q1 in fine fragrances as well. So we feel really good about what we're seeing. I think consumer fragrances, it was a lot of, I would say pent-up demand. I think you are seeing clearly some positive trends on what we have been working with our customers, in particular, bringing new innovation to consumer fragrances. We've worked with lot of the large consumer packaged goods companies over the last several years and I think this is where we really have brought strong innovation in our consumer business. So we feel really good about that. There clearly was an inventory build significantly in ingredients as we've highlighted. You could see it as you go through the first part of \u201822 and then you look all the way back to \u201821. I think that what took place in those businesses in particular, uncertainty around supply chains and companies wanting to make sure that they had the supply necessary as you went through a lot of volatility in the supply chains, which is what caused the build. And obviously now what we're seeing is some of the destocking from those efforts in those businesses. Yes, hi. This is Frank. I think as we talk to our customers, at least the big consumer good companies, I would say they're probably cautiously optimistic on the resiliency of the consumer. They are stepping up in certain categories, promotional activities and efforts. We have clearly seen a lot of, I would say good focus from them on innovation and looking for new projects as they continue to focus on building out their future offerings to consumers. I also think that what is taking place is if you look at from our lens and it goes back to what I was highlighting, we do anticipate that sequential improvement will continue from a volume perspective. So just to reiterate a couple of points in particular in the areas that are really key for us, the sequential lift going from first half down mid-single digits to positive mid-single digits in the second half. We do continue to see working with our customers very clear opportunities for that sequential step up, especially against a softer back comparison quarter in the back half. So we believe that our consumer companies that we're working closely with are the ones that are highlighting differentiation and innovation has been key. And that's something that we will continue to focus and work on as a company. Yes. Hey, Lauren, it's Frank. On the pricing strategy, we are working with customers to balance price volume opportunities. So clearly this is not across the board, but very surgical, Lauren, in our practices, in particular, in certain geographies and I would highlight in great areas of China and certain markets where there is more price sensitivity. We are looking at price volume, but not across the board. So very surgical approach to pricing. Margins will improve, Lauren, over this year and over time. Remember that Nourish based on the first quarter, a lot of the manufacturing absorption impacted the Nourish division in Q1. There'll be some impact, as we've highlighted in Q2. And then things will improve in the back half for Nourish and for the company. Yes, I'll have to take a look back in \u201821. But let me give you the enzyme business and take a step back. One, we think this is a really important business for us, and we're seeing great innovation in our enzyme business. As I highlighted, we saw really good growth in home and personal care. We continue to see really good growth from our food and cultural enzymes. And we're seeing encouraging now trends as destocking improves in our probiotic business. Grain processing, animal nutrition is still somewhat challenged, but we are working very diligently on those businesses. From a margin perspective, I'll take a, look, remember that as we look at 2021, our overall margins were obviously, I think, better in \u201821. We did see obviously decline based off of what has happened from inflation. So clearly that has impacted us in 2022. Manufacturing absorption also impacted us as we hit the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. But over time, we're really confident in the margin progression and improvement in the health and biosciences business as we go forward. Thank you everyone and appreciate the time today for our first quarter earnings call. And we look forward to future updates and continuing our transformation. And our overall path to a very strong, profitable, growth profile company and helping consumers around the world. Look forward to speaking to you soon."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Turning now to slide 9, let me review our first quarter performance across each of our four business segments. In Nourish, sales were flat on a comparable currency neutral basis with growth in Food Design and Flavors, all set by continued volume declines in ingredients. As Frank shared, Nourish ingredients, which includes protein solutions, emulsifiers and sweeteners, core texturants and cellulosics and food protection had the most pronounced volume declines in the quarter representing approximately 60% of our total company volume decline. Despite our pricing actions and productivity initiatives in the quarter, within our Nourish segment, the lower volumes and the unfavorable manufacturing absorption due to our inventory reduction program that I mentioned earlier, more than offset those efforts, contributing to a 27% year -\u2060over -\u2060year decrease in currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA at $208 million. Those same pressures impacted Health and Biosciences this quarter, with a 3% year -\u2060over -\u2060year decrease in comparable currency \u2060neutral sales and a 19% year -\u2060over -\u2060year decrease in comparable currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, despite price increases and strong productivity gains. While we saw solid growth in Cultures and Food Enzymes and Home and Personal care, lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption also pressured our performance. As Frank mentioned earlier, our Scent division continues to perform quite well, delivering an 8% increase in comparable currency \u2060neutral sales and a 1% increase in comparable currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA, driven by double \u2060digit growth in Fine Fragrance and Consumer Fragrance. Scent's growth this quarter was driven by higher volumes, pricing, and productivity gains, as the division has remained resilient. Lastly, I'm pleased to share the Pharma Solution has delivered a 4% increase in comparable currency neutral sales, led by continued growth in core pharma. That said, like Nourish and Health and Biosciences, the segment was also impacted by lower volumes and unfavorable manufacturing absorption, leading to a 6% decrease in comparable currency \u2060neutral adjusted operating EBITDA. Overall for the quarter, sales and EBITDA were slightly ahead of our expectations, with pricing on track, modestly better volumes, and favorable productivity. Now on slide 10, I'll discuss our cash flow and leverage position for the quarter. Cash flow from operations grew $127 million this quarter, which is an improvement versus the negative $4 million we reported in a year ago period. One bright spot in the quarter was approximately a $200 million decrease in inventory versus our year end 2022. As I discussed on our fourth quarter call, we have initiated a number of actions across our business and supply chain, genes, including system process enhancements, to rapidly reduce our inventories over the course of the year. While this is adversely impacting the P&L through negative manufacturing absorption, it is a short-\u2060term impact that will be recovered over time. Looking ahead, while the majority of our efforts to reduce inventories for 2023 are behind us, we do have near-\u2060term headwind in Q2, albeit to a lesser degree than Q1, as we continue to correct our over inventory position and maximize cash flow. I also want to note that accounts payable on the quarter was adversely impacted as a result of season payment patterns, and by our inventory reduction program, whereby we slowed the purchase of raw materials, which had a direct impact on our AP. We expect this will improve over the course of the year as we achieve our target inventory level. CapEx spending for the quarter was $175 million, or approximately 5.8% of sales. This was elevated due to project timing and we expect to moderate through the balance of the year. We continue to believe that we will be around $500 million in CapEx for full year 2023. Our cash flow for the first quarter was negative $48 million. This is consistent with the seasonality of cash flows for our business. Included in our free cash flow is about $100 million of costs, primarily related to integration and transaction related costs. In terms of leverage, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $594 million which includes $4 million in assets currently held for sale. While net debt totaled $10.7 billion, our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.3 billion, and our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA was 4.6x for the quarter as we mentioned earlier. While our leverage position is slightly higher than in the past few quarters, we were proactive in renegotiating our debt covenants in the first quarter. To ensure that we have appropriate capital flexibility as we execute on our strategic priorities in what may continue to be a challenging market. Importantly, we continue to actively evaluate the portfolio with consideration for further divestitures that provide additional financial flexibility and debt pay down without impacting our long term aspirations. Turning to slide 11 for our consolidated outlook for the fiscal year 2023. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we continue to believe our volume performance will improve, yet acknowledge that market conditions remain uncertain. In our discussion with customers, the majority have signaled that their destocking efforts are ending, as they believe the consumer will remain resilient in the second half. Nevertheless, we have yet to see a broad based volume improvement across our business, but we remain steadfast in our focus to control what we can control to protect profitability, maximize cash flow, and drive portfolio optimization. For the full year, we now expect sales to be approximately $12.3 billion versus $12.5 billion previously. This change is largely related to energy and raw material pass-through price adjustments. In addition, we have a modest increase in unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. As we noted on our February earnings call, about 30% of our original 6% pricing guidance was related to energy inflation, much of which is pass-through via surcharges with energy prices having moderated significantly. We are maintaining our expectation of flat comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth and continue to believe adjusted operating EBITDA will be approximately $2.34 billion. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to continue to pressure sales and comparable currency neutral adjusted operating EBITDA growth which we now expect will adversely impact us 1% and 3% respectively. This incremental pressure is due to a handful of hyperinflationary currencies that have and we expect will continue to significantly devalue over the course of 2023. On a comparable currency neutral basis, all the above noted items translate into approximately 5% versus is approximately 6% previously. The sole driver once again is the energy and raw material pass-through price adjustments as we continue to believe volumes will be flat for the full year. In terms of calendarization, we believe volume will sequentially improve each quarter with a growth rebound expected in the second half of the year as the market challenges are expected to subside and our year ago comparisons are more favorable. To provide additional context, first quarter volume performance was modestly better than we anticipated, with the second quarter modestly lower. The net result is that on a first half basis we are broadly in line with our expectation, which we believe will be offset by a favorable second half. On a two year average basis, we expect first half volumes to be approximately negative 2%, reflective of destocking, and second half volumes to be up plus 2%. For the second quarter specifically, we expect sales to be approximately $3 billion to $3.1 billion, with volume performance down mid-single digits and adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $540 million to $590 million. We remain intensely focused on improving our inventory levels and driving cost savings through productivity and restructuring initiatives to ensure we generate strong cash flow for the full year. As a result, we continue to target 2023 adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion, excluding cost related integration, restructuring and geo related items. Turning to slide 12, we recognize that we continue to face a challenging environment, including reduced visibility on consumer and customer demand outlook and the path of inflation. However, we remain intently focused on what we can control with the goal of continuing to strengthen IFF's operating foundation and execution performance. As we've discussed, there are a few top operational priorities that will enable IFF to not only manage these complexities, but also to drive long-term profitable growth. Our highest long-term priority is accelerating top line growth. To achieve this goal, we are making key strategic investments in key areas of our business and continue to be more surgical in our pricing actions to ensure we recover inflationary pressures while supporting volume growth. We have also made great progress in enhancing our customer service and supply chain agility to reduce bottlenecks and increase efficiency. In the first quarter, we maintained strong service levels while also reducing our inventories, improving approximately $200 million from December '22 in conjunction with this, we will be rolling out a redesigned sales, inventory and operations planning process. Enhancing productivity also remains essential as part of our transformation. As mentioned earlier, during the quarter we successfully achieved approximately $60 million of productivity benefits and began seeing initial results from our restructuring program. I expect this benefit will rapidly increase over the balance of the year. And be a strong contributor to our EBITDA performance this year. Last, we remain laser focused on improving our cash flows and delivering our long-term deleveraging target. We expect to continue to make improvements in net working capital through the balance of 2023 and into next year. We are in parallel executing against our portfolio optimization efforts, continuing to divest noncore business, In Q2 and Q3, we expect to complete the sale of our Savory Solutions and Flavored Specialty Ingredients businesses with proceeds used to pay down debt. Going forward, this is a central part of our strategy and we continue to evaluate additional portfolio optimization opportunities to strengthen our capital structure. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Frank. Good afternoon, Gunther. Thanks for the question. I think the summarized version is we're actually tracking quite well against our objectives. And I'll sort of unpack, as you know, the two big contributors relative to our adjusted free cash flow combination of achieving our earnings guidance and then secondarily all the work on working capital. We had a very good quarter relative to our expectations around working capital. As a reminder, our full year objectives for working capital are consisted of a $200 million point on point, yearend reduction in inventory and then $100 million increase between payables and receivables for a net $100 million reduction in net working capital. The biggest driver of that, obviously, is inventory at that $200 million, that $200 million reduction is actually a $350 million volume reduction with $160 million of basically price escalation, i.e. raw material cost increases coming through. In the first quarter, focusing on inventory, we actually were over $200 million down inclusive of around $80 million of price escalation. So the volume component in the first quarter was $280 million against our full year objective of $350 million. So we're trending quite well. We will probably actually get to the full sort of, our initial level of inventory reduction by the end of the second quarter at this point in time. Payables and receivables, they're a little lumpy seasonally. We're feeling very good about achieving those objectives at the end of the year. So overall we feel very good, particularly relative to the working capital improvements. Yes. Hey. Thanks for the question. This is Glenn. Within the first quarter, the negative absorption impact was $100 million, which translates actually into 330 basis points of impact on EBITDA margin. That represented a year-over-year volume decline of about 20%. So think about our annual fixed cost base for our manufacturing base of about $2 billion. Every one point on an annualized basis is basically worth about $20 million. So hence why we're able to reduce our inventory so significantly, we took production down significantly, so I'll say a onetime event of $100 million. We are expecting, as I mentioned, to continue to make progress on reducing inventories and expecting to have mid-single digit down volume in the second quarter. That translates into another $50 million of negative absorption. We are anticipating actually positive absorption in the second half of the year as Frank mentioned. We're expecting mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year. So production volumes being up year-over-year. Again, the context of the risk associated or opportunity associated with declines or increases in manufacturing, one point on a full year basis is equal to $20 million of negative absorption. So if you think about two points in the second half, that would be the equivalency of that $20 million. We have discussed in the past. We will have to continue to consider that if we continue to see volume softer than our expectations, what will be the balance of continuing to manage cash flow and keep our inventories in the right place for production efficiency purposes versus basically the earnings profile. So they're clearly in a softer environment than anticipated. There is some risk of further negative absorption in the second half of the year. Thanks for the question. Hey Andrew, this is Glenn, thanks for the question. Agree relative to wood chopping, that's why I have a hatchet with me today. But relative to your assumption for this year, you're correct. We were a little over 4x at the beginning of the year. We will be receiving net proceeds after tax distributions transaction over $750 million, combination of this quarter and next quarter related to the sales saving solutions and FSI which will all go to debt pay down relative to getting to the 3x times or less by the end of next year. We are fully committed to that. That will be achieved through a combination of three elements. One, we continue to have opportunity to improve our working capital position. We expect to continue to make progress next year from this year. Secondarily, we do expect the earnings trajectory will improve significantly next year. Part of it is overlapping some significant items, such as $100 million of negative absorption and then getting the top line going with our productivity program. So that's the second thing either denominator improving, but that all being said, divestitures clearly play a role in getting to that less than 3x. We have been very active reviewing the portfolio. We are proceeding on multiple fronts. We are fully confident that we have an attractive set of assets that actually aren't ideal fits for our portfolio. We are past the two year anniversary of the Reverse Morris Trust considerations as of February this year of note, and we are proceeding quite well on that path. So I'd say our confidence remains high and commitment remains high to get to less than 3x. And regarding cutting the dividend, that is not on the table at all. Yes. Hey, Chris. It's Glenn again. Relative to energy, as a reminder, in our original guidance, at the beginning of the year, we had 6% gross pricing in the P&L. 30% of that, or a little less than two points, was associated with energy. About 75% of our energy prices are either directly via index or indirectly via aligned surcharge attached to energy pass-through to customers, and they are generally reviewed on a quarterly basis. We expect that as we mentioned, we're taking a point out of that just because there's been a very significant decline in energy prices globally. We believe that that will be relatively net neutral this year, in part not only because the pass-through, but secondary timing. The majority of our energy prices actually sit in inventory because they're part of production cost. So with 140 days of inventory, they sort of match by the end of the year. There should be some overlap as we roll into next year, but for this year, we're assuming that the energy net is sort of neutral from a P&L standpoint. In general, we are seeing positive deflationary trends not only in energy, but in logistics as well as in certain raw materials. So that is favorable relative to the portfolio, as we mentioned in the past, we believe that is a potential upside. It would be either late this year because generally the rolls obviously run through inventories, but could be meaningful next year. And relative to our portfolio, we would say that roughly 60 to two thirds of our portfolio have some degree of resiliency, i.e. less commoditized, more uniqueness relative to characteristic. But I would caution we're in the early days of deflation. So I think it's a little early to declare sort of significant margin capture relative to improvements in raw material and other costs as well. Thanks for the question. Hey Sopha, this is Glenn. We are expecting charges of roughly $75 million full year for the cost reduction program. That will be an annualized impact of about $100 million. We expect kind of around $72 million to hit the P&L this year. For obvious reasons, I'm not going to describe sort of the pace at which exits in the organization are happening from the standpoint. So that covers that. Can you remind me the second question again? Yes. As we had mention, the softish part of our business from a volume standpoint was in Nourish. But more specifically that really was in the ingredients portfolio, which is roughly $3 billion of Nourish on an annualized basis. So that's where it was concentrated for flavors and food designs generally were fine. Thank you. There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Frank Clyburn for closing remarks."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF\u2019s third quarter 2024 conference call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. Today\u2019s presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release. With me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our Executive Vice President, CFO and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take questions that you have at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik.\nErik Fyrwald: Well, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I\u2019m glad to be here with you all today to discuss our solid third quarter results. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll begin by providing an overview of our performance and the solid results across each of IFF\u2019s businesses, which gives us confidence to increase our full-year 2024 guidance. I will also provide commentary on our efforts to continue to strengthen IFF for now and the future. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a more detailed outlook at our third quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024, and we will then open up the call for questions. If you go to Slide 6, IFF delivered another quarter of solid results and significant bottom line improvement compared to a year ago. IFF achieved growth across all our business units with notable volume improvement across the entire portfolio. The combination of improved market conditions and our global team\u2019s passion and drive to serve our customers and address evolving needs across end markets was a major contributor to our performance. The actions we have taken this year to strengthen our business and capital structure as well as our push to drive productivity in today\u2019s dynamic marketplace are producing encouraging results. Importantly, we delivered high-single-digit volume growth with broad-based contributions across each of our businesses. Equally encouraging, comparable adjusted operating EBITDA grew by double-digits in the third quarter, primarily driven by volume performance and productivity gains. Considering our solid performance in the third quarter, specifically flowing through our over delivery in the quarter as well as our continued cautiously optimistic outlook for the fourth quarter, we are modifying our full-year 2024 financial guidance. We are making solid progress against our targets and are confident we will achieve net sales between $11.3 billion $11.4 billion which is almost $100 million higher than our previous guidance range. For EBITDA, we are tightening the range and are now targeting the high-end of our previously communicated range of $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion. Lastly, I am pleased to share that we remain on track to complete the previously announced divestiture of our Pharma Solutions business in the first half of 2025, marking another significant milestone in our portfolio optimization and deleveraging journey. Now moving to Slide 7. I want to highlight a few key achievements so far this year. While we continue to operate in a challenging end-market environment, our performance over the last nine months has bolstered our position as a preferred innovation partner and growth enabler for our customers. Over the last nine months, currency neutral sales grew 7%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Scent and high-single-digit growth in Health & Biosciences. Comparable adjusted operating EBITDA has increased 19% year-to-date, fueled by our strong recovery in sales volume growth versus prior year lows and our productivity initiatives. Since announcing our new business-led operating model, operating philosophy and strategy refresh earlier this year, our focus on getting back to the basics is translating into stronger financial performance with greater end-to-end responsibility and accountability. With a reinvigorated mindset and a simplified structure, IFF is better positioned to navigate today\u2019s complex and fast moving operating environment. Now these steps also include sharpening our focus on key end markets and increasing our investments in high growth areas for the benefit of our teams and our customers. In the third quarter, we also opened a creative center in Shanghai and have started to invest in additional creative centers in Mexico City and India. Together, these innovation hubs in important markets expand our global footprint and ensure we have the regional expertise required to serve customers on a more intimate level and address their unique needs. With our people at the heart of IFF\u2019s revised strategy, I\u2019m equally excited to announce that our employee engagement has improved significantly over the last 10 months. As I\u2019ve said before, empowering and enabling our global team to do what they do best is essential to our shared success as a global organization. And earlier this month, much of our global team had the opportunity to come together and celebrate IFF\u2019s 135 year legacy and 60th anniversary of being listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a true honor and reminder of the incredible legacy of this great Company. I have no doubt that, that legacy of IFF will continue for the next 135 years. But for now, I\u2019ll pass it on to Glenn, for a closer look at our quarterly results. Glenn?\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Erik, and thank you all for joining us today. As Erik noted, IFF had another very solid quarter achieving revenue just north of $2.9 billion, an increase of 9% on a comparable currency neutral basis. We delivered broad-based growth across Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions, with notable volume improvements across all four business units. Our ongoing productivity initiatives also contribute to a 16% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA in the quarter. Building upon our margin strength from the prior two quarters, we also realized another successful quarter of margin expansion with our comparable adjusted operating EBITDA margin of 19.4%, improving by 180 basis points versus Q3 of 2023. Adjusted EPS excluding amortization was $1.04 in the quarter, increasing 17% versus the prior year period as strong profit performance and lower interest expense were mitigated by foreign exchange impacts in other expenses. Turning to Slide 9, our improved performance was broad-based this quarter. Nourish comparable currency neutral sales increased 7% and we delivered an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 18%. This was led by Flavors\u2019 third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and modest sales improvement in Functional Ingredients. In Functional Ingredients, high-single-digit volume growth was mostly offset by our pricing actions, which were very consistent with our planned price investments this year. Overall, we are very pleased with our Functional Ingredients recovery plan that has delivered three consecutive quarters of volume growth with strong expansion in margins and EBITDA. Health & Bioscience achieved double-digit improvements in all of its businesses due to strong volume growth and productivity gains. H&B\u2019s comparable currency neutral sales increased 12% and we delivered comparable adjusted operating EBITDA of $173 million a 15% increase from the year ago period. In Scent, double-digit increases in both consumer Fragrance & Fine Fragrance as well as high-single-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients led to a strong quarter for both revenue and profit growth. Net sales in the quarter totaled $613 million up 10% on a comparable currency neutral basis and we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $127 million up 7% on a comparable basis. Lastly, Pharma Solutions returned to growth, delivering sales of $256 million, an 8% increase on a comparable currency neutral basis, while adjusted operating EBITDA surged over 32% to $62 million on a comparable basis. This notable performance was driven by strong double-digit growth in Industrial and mid-single digit growth in Core Pharma. Once again, margin expansion was primarily driven by volume and productivity gains. Turning to Slide 10, cash flow from operations totaled $702 million year-to-date, a $366 million increase from last quarter, while CapEx year-to-date totaled $303 million or roughly 3.5% of sales. Our free cash flow position totaled $399 million year-to-date, a sequential increase from $136 million last quarter. Year-to-date, we also distributed $411 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $569 million at the end of the third quarter, including $2 million in assets held for sale. Additionally, gross debt for the quarter totaled approximately $9.1 billion with a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 3.9 times, a decrease from 4.5 times at the end of 2023. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion largely in-line with last quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and into the first half of \u201825, we remain committed to achieving our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of below 3 times, following the completion of our Pharma Solutions divestiture. This sale, which again we expect to complete in the first half of \u201825, reflects our near-term focus on optimizing our portfolio and improving our leverage position to further strengthen our capital structure. On Slide 11, I\u2019d like to turn to our consolidated outlook for the full-year \u201824. Given our improved financial and operational performance in the first three quarters of the year, tempered by some caution due to continued soft-end consumer demand, we are modifying our full-year \u201824 financial guidance. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $11.3 billion to $11.4 billion up from our previously communicated range of $11.1 billion to 11.3 billion. We also now believe that volumes will be in the range of 5% to 6% growth versus our previous expectation of 3% to 5% increase. Pricing is also now expected to be roughly flat for the full-year versus 1% growth previously as real pricing remains consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year, but FX related pricing in emerging markets is expected to be slightly less than originally expected. Our outlook for the fourth quarter remains unchanged despite our performance in Q3, given macro trends as we closely monitor food, home and personal care end-markets, order phasing due to potential customers inventory adjustments at year-end and a slightly tougher year-over-year comparison. On the bottom line, we now expect to deliver full-year \u201824 adjusted operating EBITDA near the high-end of our previously communicated range of $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion. The high-end of this range includes the upside we delivered in the third quarter and assumes continued productivity improvements, a greater level of annual incentive compensation given the relative strength of our performance versus budget, and incremental reinvestments in the business with a focus on profitable long-term growth. Lastly, based on current market foreign exchange rates, we now expect that foreign exchange will have an approximately 3% full-year adverse impact to sales growth, assuming a EURO/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.12 at the time of our forecast was developed versus the previously expected range of 3% to 4%. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Erik, for closing remarks.\nErik Fyrwald: Thank you, Glenn. I am tremendously proud of what our teams have accomplished both in the last quarter and through 2024 to advance our operating philosophy, our strategic direction and our execution capabilities. Together, we are building a stronger, more resilient IFF backed by a global team whose relentless dedication to innovation and winning in the marketplace continues to energize me quarter-after-quarter. Our solid performance this year is a direct reflection of the strength of our team and the shared buy-in for our strategic vision, and I am so grateful to work alongside such talented colleagues. While I\u2019m energized by our recent performance, I am clear eyed and recognize that there is lots more work to be done. As Glenn mentioned, we remain committed to reinvesting in our businesses, particularly our highest return businesses over the long-term to ensure we are well-positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth to our shareholders. In the near-term, however, we remain laser focused on achieving our 2024 financial guidance and encouraging our global teams to unleash the full potential of IFF with our incredible customers. Thank you all for your ongoing support. I would like to now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJosh Spector: Hey, good morning, guys, and congrats on a solid quarter. I was wondering if you could walk sequentially to your 4Q guide versus 3Q. I guess when we look at it, it looks like a bit more than normal seasonality and even counting for conservatism, it seems a little bit lower than what we would have expected. So, what are the assumptions that you have behind that? And, is there anything you\u2019re seeing now that maybe gives you some pause on some of the trends or any incremental data you could share there? Thanks.\nErik Fyrwald: Thanks for the question, Josh. Let me just say that the fourth quarter has started as we expected, which is very encouraging. But, the pattern we have seen in the last few quarters is a strong start and then a bit of deceleration through the quarter. And, we\u2019ve got limited visibility to December at this point. So, we are cautious given the potential that customers could adjust inventory at the end of the year, which has happened in the last few years. But, let me just say that we want to make sure that we continue to deliver what we say we will deliver. But, the quarter started off as expected.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Your line is now open.\nNicola Tang: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a bit about Nourish. Can you help us understand what drove the sequential decline in margins despite the strong topline performance? And again, can you provide a bit more color between Flavors & Functional Ingredients and how you\u2019re thinking about the progression into Q4 as well? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: This is Glenn. Good afternoon, Nicola. I appreciate the question. Just as a reminder, typically, our high watermark for margin is Q2 for Nourish, a very positive mix as they go into the summer season here. What you see as it relates to the quarter-to-quarter progression between basically 2% and 3%, and then ultimately, from 3% to 4%, there\u2019ll be a slight contraction in margin as well. As it relates to 2% to 3%, you have sort of mix more normalizes. And then secondarily, as we\u2019ve mentioned that, we are increasing our investments in the business. So, those are beginning to basically show through relative to the margin as well. So as you look out into Q4, you should expect, because of the seasonality, i.e, lower volumes for Nourish in Q4, that we will have some degradation of 50 basis points to 90 basis points in terms of margin quarter-to-quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I know it\u2019s still early, but could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about 2025 at this point as it relates to some of the high-level variances such as volumes, price, maybe compensation expense and also cost savings flow through?\nErik Fyrwald: Thanks Ghansham. First of all, it\u2019s too early to give you any specifics. And as you know, we normally guide in February. And right now, we\u2019re finalizing our budgeting process. But, I will make a couple of comments. First of all, as you\u2019ll recall, we will have over $100 million in incentive comp reset in 2025, which is a positive for next year. And then, let me just add that we continue to work really hard on customer focus, on driving innovation and productivity to drive our performance. And, I got to say that, nine months in, I love how our teams are stepping up and driving performance, driving execution.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks. First just to check on, are you on track for reporting Flavors separately from Functional Ingredients next year? And then, where was the incremental volume strength in the quarter or actually in the fourth quarter as well? I guess it\u2019s the second half volume strength. And, do you think that was more driven by promotional activity by your customers and some easing in their pricing?\nGlenn Richter: Yes, it\u2019s a great question, John. So, relative to where we are with separation of Functional Ingredients and the Flavors business, we are on track to basically have that set up as two completely separate businesses. Actually, most of the organizational changes have been announced and implemented. We will start reporting it starting next year, which means in the first quarter. So, May of next year is when you\u2019ll see the first cut between the businesses and we plan on providing some historical context as well.\nErik Fyrwald: And just to add to that, we have announced internally we didn\u2019t see a need for a press release, but internally that we have named two Presidents, a President of what we\u2019ll now call taste and a President of what we\u2019ll call Food Ingredients.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. And, then relative to the performance in the third quarter volumes, we actually pretty much, it was fairly broad-based, John, across all the businesses. Pharma was right on track, but the rest of the businesses generally sort of exceeded expectations. We had very strong Flavors, very strong Scent and certain businesses with H&B are very, very strong. We believe it is a combination, as you\u2019re well aware, the end consumer, there\u2019s very few signs that the consumer is getting any stronger in terms of what\u2019s going on in terms of consumption. But, we do think that we\u2019re picking up share and winning in the marketplace, and that\u2019s a function of sort of the renewed focus on innovation, commercial excellence across the businesses, and the new operating model. As Erik had mentioned, the start as it relates to Q4, we\u2019re just being a little more cautious because we had been surprised in December the last couple of years.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDan Rizzo: Good morning, everyone. This is actually Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Given the progress you\u2019ve made this year, what do you think the right margin structure and ROIC is for your portfolio longer term once the farmer is gone?\nErik Fyrwald: The way I would answer that is we are focused on driving continuous improvement in both margins and ROIC, and we\u2019re tracking them very closely by business now. And, the levers that we have driving customer focus, driving innovation and productivity are all helping us gain confidence that we\u2019ll be able to continuously improve both. Also, I\u2019d just add that we are prioritizing capital allocation to our higher margin and higher return businesses, Scent, Flavors, now we\u2019re going to call it taste, and Health & Biosciences. And, we continue to have strong emphasis on driving Functional Ingredients turnaround, which we\u2019re making good progress on. So, we are focused on these two metrics, and we\u2019re doing the things to continuously improve over time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. Is there any update to the adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year? I think last time you guided to $600 million. Should that trend higher now that we\u2019re at the higher-end of the guide, or is it mostly offset by the working capital or other items?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. So, two numbers I\u2019ll give you, Patrick. Good morning. One is our reported free cash flow I\u2019m sorry, our full-year free cash flow, we expect to be basically largely unchanged versus previous guide. You sort of already mentioned the reason why the earnings trajectory is higher, but we also are building more working capital, which is almost exclusively related to higher sales, so it\u2019s sitting in receivables. So net-net, we\u2019re sort of in a neutral position for the full-year, so no change in the forecast.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nKristen Owen: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to double click on Functional Ingredients. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of order activity coming into the contracting period? And, if you could provide an additional update on the Functional Ingredients\u2019 turnaround? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Sure. Yes, this is Glenn. Thanks, Kristen, for the question. The reality is we don\u2019t typically have a long order book. And certainly, there\u2019s very this is essentially zero into next year. The contracting period largely is around pricing with our relationships from the standpoint. It is going extremely well. We feel that this is a byproduct of the now two year work we\u2019ve had in place to basically remediate the business. So, we are seeing very, very good progression in the business and expect it to continue into next year. And, there\u2019s nothing in the annual negotiation process that suggests that we\u2019re not in a very good place to sustain the momentum within the business. As a reminder, we have taken a tremendous amount of effort to fix our service issues starting two plus years ago. Our service levels are extremely high. Secondarily, we reinvested deflation and giving price back to basically be much, much more competitive in the marketplace. Third, we basically reenergized our sales pipeline, so work very closely with the front-lines and the innovation resources to identify how to win customers back and win new business. That has been working extremely well. And, those collective efforts have actually resulted us in having mid-single-digit volumes this year. We feel like we\u2019ve gained back about half of the lost volume at this point. And, at the same time, we\u2019ve been expanding margins very, both gross margin and ultimately EBITDA year-over-year growth very, very well. The last piece is we are in the beginning phases of a fundamental restructure of our global supply chain footprint. That means actually making sure that we have the assets in the best locations from a cost perspective and the best supply chain to support that. That will take several years, but we think that\u2019s the final step as we\u2019ve committed to in the past of moving this business back to the mid-teens range in terms of overall EBITDA margins CIRCA 12, 13 this year, but we should be able to get to 15 plus in the coming years. So, we feel very good. The team has done a phenomenal job, has been working non-stop to basically make this afternoon feel very good with the businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Erik, nine months into your tenure, how would you characterize the progress you\u2019ve made on the R&D organization and the innovation pipeline? And, what could that mean for new product sales in \u201825 and even \u201826? Thank you.\nErik Fyrwald: Thanks for the question, David. And, I feel very good about the progress we\u2019re making. First of all, let me start by saying that each of our BUs have developed very strong strategies with very clear priorities. And, now with R&D embedded in the BUs, we can already feel both the power and the energy created by the focus and the better connection of our R&D efforts to customer needs. And I tell you, it energizes our R&D people and it makes the whole system work better. And, just one example, our Scent team now has a very clear plan and is already taking actions to strengthen our pipeline of naturals, synthetic chemistry and biotech molecules. So, it\u2019s great to see that. What I would say on that, in terms of the impact is I think that the main impact of the new projects will be in 2026 and beyond. But, I can tell you that the energy is already helping now and will help in 2025 in terms of seeing those that pipeline strengthen and having discussions with customers and also our sales force energized by that, I think will benefit us is already benefiting us. And, I think we\u2019ll have benefits in 2025. But, the specific project benefits will really come in \u201826 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nSalvator Tiano: Thank you very much. I just want to ask a little bit about the disconnect between the very strong organic growth you\u2019re reporting and the more and the slower growing end-market. So, can you bridge a little bit the degree of outperformance that you have across the board versus slower consumer demand? And specifically on sand, it\u2019s been on a roll for several quarters and that\u2019s where I think your customers are also doing well in Fine Fragrance. But, how long can this extremely strong growth last?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey Sal, it\u2019s a good question. One, just to remind obviously everybody is that there is a bounce back effect this year from the lag of destocking. So, there\u2019s a mathematical sort of performance that the entire industry is seeing as we overlap last year. So, that\u2019s obviously explained some of the incremental growth above what is happening at the consumer level. Fine Fragrance continues to be a unique case as everyone is well aware over the last several years. Since COVID, the category has exploded. We believe that that is a function of multiple things happening at consumer level, a plethora of new brands being launched, the impact of social media, ultimately the digital channel has become a very, very meaningful channel for the growth in the business as well. And, the use of Fine Fragrance has expanded beyond sort of a special occasion as a result of that. We like everybody in the industry, have seen that hitting the Fine Fragrance space. We believe that that will continue to some degree that there still are lots of new channels and new brand opportunities and certainly regional opportunities. I would also say that we believe because we do track how we\u2019re doing in the market versus others as we are winning share. So, as Erik had mentioned, the investments we have been making relative to new geographies, adding perfumers, adding new creative centers, etcetera is the other way that basically we\u2019re winning in the business and we\u2019re very committed to continuing to do that, not only within the Scent business, but more broadly across the higher growth and higher margin businesses within IFF. So, appreciate the question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you and good morning. Can you discuss your expectations for price cost dynamics in the coming quarters? And related to that, would you touch on tariff scenarios? How do you think about potential for higher tariffs? Maybe you could talk about the experience in the past and how you\u2019re planning to manage through various international trade scenarios moving forward?\nGlenn Richter: Yes, good morning, Kevin. Generally, our price cost dynamic is flattish. We have seen throughout this year some continued deflation, not to the degree of last year, and our early outlook for next year is things are fairly stable. We believe there are certain parts of the basket that increases, but others some level of deflation. So generally, the price environment in our view is fairly static and the price cost dynamic is fairly static as a byproduct of that. Difficult to forecast at this point in time regarding tariffs. There is obviously some history here with the first Trump administration that was more focused as it relates to food and China as one country versus broad-based. So, it depends upon what if anything ultimately happens in the arena of tariffs. So, it is something that maybe yesterday people weren\u2019t very focused on. But as of this morning, members of the team are very focused on. I would note that when there was basically escalation of tariffs in China, it\u2019s probably intuitively good for our business relative our footprint, global footprint, our ability to react. As you\u2019re well aware, there\u2019s a more competitive environment within China. So, those tariffs could actually intuitively be advantageous to our overall business broadly. But obviously, stay tuned. And, as we think about kind of next year and provide guidance in February, there\u2019ll probably be more to speak about at that point.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Sison: Hey guys, nice quarter and outlook. Just on the fourth quarter, if you\u2019re at the high-end of your outlook range, it does imply that EBITDA will be down year-over-year despite positive growth. Just want a little bit of color on that and is that more conservatism? And then, quick follow-up, when you think about \u201825, a lot of companies thus far in chemical end have noted the first half not likely better than the second half. Could you sort of talk about what you\u2019re seeing from customers? And, do you think they\u2019re feeling better about next year, about the same, any sort of green shoots of improvement there? And, just kind of wanted to leave it at that. Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. So, hey, good morning, Mike. I\u2019ll take the first part, which is the year-over-year. We were 4.60 on a reported basis last year. As a reminder, we have FX and then portfolio changes from last year as well that actually turns that into around a 4.40 like-for-like. And, as you pointed out, our guide currently we get is around 4.40 for this year as well. It\u2019s very simple, honestly. It has all to do with our incentive compensation. As you know, last year on the full-year, we were below 100%. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we are materially above 100% in excess of an incremental $100 million of variable comp. That is a nearly $40 million year-over-year impact in the quarter alone. So, that sort of normalized impact is a huge impact. The rest of the equation is basically productivity is offsetting basically some modest level of inflation in investment. But, it\u2019s really that incentive comp growth year-over-year that\u2019s the biggest piece.\nErik Fyrwald: And then, Mike, to the second part of your question, we\u2019re not really seeing strong green shoot comments yet from our customer base for 2025. But, the good news is that we\u2019re taking aggressive actions to strengthen our position by getting back to basics, as we said before, heavy customer focus, heavy focus on innovation. And by the way, as customers see slowing end-markets, what they want to do is have more innovation so that they can drive growth relative to the market. And, that\u2019s when they come to us and that\u2019s a good thing. And, I\u2019ll just also say we\u2019re doing lots of customer business, lots of focus on customers and co-creation with them of leading products around the world. In the third quarter, I personally visited with other executive team members 11 countries and representing over 4 billion people and it was just great. And by the way, up till now, I\u2019ve visited about 40% of our customer base and just see how our people are in front of our customers. And, I feel a lot of energy with our teams in front of customers, whether it\u2019s our salespeople, with our perfumers or our flavorists or our biotech scientists, co-creating products. And you feel the energy, and I would love it if you guys could feel the energy. But just as an example, I was just in India and Indonesia and was super excited to not only hear about our double-digit growth across Scent, Flavors, Health & Biosciences and Food Ingredients, but met with customers that are very bullish about their growth in these high growth markets, but also about the innovation that we\u2019re bringing with these creative centers to help them grow. So tough market, but I believe that we\u2019re putting in place the right things to grow above market.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to go back to the question on end demand and maybe ask it in a bit of a different way. One is, if you could just maybe try to give some framework around how much of the sales growth is from restocking? And, then more specifically, we all can look at the big multi-national public companies volume trends and you can see it\u2019s clearly lower even if roughly half of your sales growth is attributable to destocking. So, I guess the question is, are you seeing more growth out of local and regional companies and private label relative to some of these big multi-nationals and maybe there\u2019s a bit of a shift there, reversal relative to recent years? And then, just remind us how you think about whether the customers are local, regional, private label compared to a multi-national? I recall that you\u2019re fairly agnostic. I just want to make sure that\u2019s the case. Thank you.\nErik Fyrwald: I would start by saying that both are very, very important to us. And, the multi-nationals that are focused on innovation and driving superior products are wanting more of our innovation and we\u2019re doing more projects with them and that\u2019s helpful to their growth and to our growth. But also the regionals and the locals are also growing and we\u2019re, I think, strengthening our strategies and our capabilities to serve them locally. And, that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing around the world. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building more creative centers to service both the global companies but also the locals the regionals and the locals. So, we\u2019re seeing growth opportunities across, but of course, there are some geographies and there are some segments that are growing faster than others. But we\u2019re, I think, now very clear on making sure that we\u2019re able to grow in all three customer segments.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to talk about reinvestment rates because I think initially seeing the implied EBITDA for 4Q and I know you just clarified and said it\u2019s more or less all the incentive comp dynamic. There had been a thought that some of it was reinvestment ahead of next year pulling some activity forward, which is completely typical to see from companies when there\u2019s flexibility. So, wanted to talk a bit about reinvestments for next year? This year there was a lot of flexibility created in the P&L as you had the restocking dynamics and strength on topline. So, how should we think about reinvestment next year, Erik, as you\u2019ve gotten closer and closer and closer to the business and looking to build back R&D, build back capabilities and set the stage for big pipeline in \u201826? How should we think about rates of reinvestment spending in \u201825 versus what we saw in \u201824? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Lauren, I\u2019ll start and hand it over to Erik. I\u2019ll just sort of clarify the [24] (ph) impact as we communicated last time, which is the same, is $20 million in the P&L. So, it\u2019s roughly 10 and 10 in Q3 and Q4. So, that will annualize by another $20 million in the first half of next year. That\u2019s independent of any additional level, but that\u2019s our starting point.\nErik Fyrwald: And then from there, we\u2019re planning on continuing to grow our topline and with that be able to invest the same percentage of sales in our innovation and other areas to drive growth. And that $20 million is going to commercial people, to technical sales, experts to increase more perfumers, more flavors, and R&D people. So, really strengthening our ability to drive innovation. At the same time, we\u2019re strengthening our ability to drive productivity and make sure that we\u2019re able to drive productivity in a way that we keep continuously improving our margins and our ROIC and be able to invest even more in innovation. So, I think it\u2019s a virtuous cycle that we drive the innovation, which gives us sales growth, which enables us to invest more in innovation. At the same time, we drive productivity to help our margins but also enable us to invest more in innovation. And, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve started to be able to do in 2024 and intend to continue to do in 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. You talked about being satisfied with your volumes in October. Roughly, were they up mid-single-digits that is sort of continuing the pattern of what you experienced in the third quarter? And then secondly, in functional ingredients, you have some volume growth and you have some price degradation. In general, is the EBITDA or operating profit of Functional Ingredients growing nicely for you this year or not growing or shrinking? Can you give us an idea of how that business is performing?\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey, good morning, Jeff. So, we\u2019re mid-single-digit up in the month of October. So, same pattern we\u2019ve seen for the last few quarters. As Erik noted, it sort of drops there sort of fairly significantly with the last month of the quarter rather being pretty tough. And Functional Ingredients is sort of following that pattern. Functional Ingredients from a volume metric standpoint is going to be 5% to 6% volumes this year. They had very, very strong performance. That is largely been offset with price, so currency neutral are sort of flattish to slightly up. But to remind you, the beginning of this year, there was a lot of deflation in the underlying commodities supporting the business. We basically took those dollars to reinvest back with our customers on a very targeted basis, and it\u2019s helped us not only deliver the topline turnaround results. But to your final question, gross margins are up very nicely, fairly consistent with Flavors in terms of the year-over-year and EBITDA itself is up very strongly. So last year, the business was, I\u2019ll say, CIRCA 8%, 9% EBITDA margin. It will probably finish this year north of 12%, and it\u2019s sort of on its way to our stated objective to get to sort of mid-teens over the next two years. So, hopefully that answers the question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nLisa De Neve: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just want to come back a little bit to the growth. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about segmental growth and growth cost efficient, but can you share how growth has been different across your regions and across the segments in that? And, maybe can you also share how your performance has been in China and maybe also in India, given a lot of your customers had very big volatility of delivery in these regions? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Good morning, Lisa. So, I\u2019ll provide some general perspectives and then turn it over to Erik. Generally, all of our businesses have performed well across the board. Pharma lagged as we expected. The destocking was a little bit more later in the cycle. Pharma is now back in the very strong positive territory in the second half of the year as expected. But, all of the businesses have actually done very well from the start of this year standpoint. China and India are two different stories. China, while there\u2019s been some improvement, still is a little bit choppy in terms of the growth trajectory given the local market. India is extremely strong. We are, as Erik mentioned in early comments, really doubling down on investments within India to really continue to capture that share in terms of kind of the growth opportunities. So I don\u2019t know, Erik --\nErik Fyrwald: I\u2019d just add that we\u2019re investing in creative centers in the growth markets, including India, very aggressively to ensure that we continue to grow strong in those markets.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nChris Parkinson: Great. Good morning. Could we just dig in a little bit more into the H&B result? Obviously, it\u2019s been pretty solid, but just the composition of kind of the sub-segments, the probiotics recovery, and anything that we should be thinking about and considering as we enter 2025? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Hey, good morning, Chris. Every single business within H&B had a very good performance within the quarter. Probiotics bounced back a lot. As you\u2019re well aware, over the last couple of years, there has been softness in the business, in part given the situation in China. It\u2019s our second largest market. It\u2019s very close to the size of North America. So, as goes China, it does whipsaw the business sort of back and forth, but the third quarter was a very, very strong quarter across the board.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I would now like to turn the call back to Erik for closing remarks.\nErik Fyrwald: Well, first of all, I want to thank you all for joining today. Appreciate your questions and your interest in IFF. I\u2019ve now been here for just about 10 months, and I\u2019ve got to tell you that I\u2019m more excited than ever about the prospects for our Company. I love team IFF. I love our customers. I love spending time with them. I love our innovation and really appreciate the work that our teams are doing to have delivered the first three quarters. And, I can tell you that we\u2019re all very much focused on making sure that we deliver the fourth quarter but doing it in a way that strengthens us for \u201825 to \u201826 and beyond. So, thank you very much, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Erik Fyrwald",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm glad to be here with you all today to discuss our solid third quarter results. On today's call, I'll begin by providing an overview of our performance and the solid results across each of IFF's businesses, which gives us confidence to increase our full-year 2024 guidance. I will also provide commentary on our efforts to continue to strengthen IFF for now and the future. I will then turn the call over to Glenn, who will provide a more detailed outlook at our third quarter financial results and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024, and we will then open up the call for questions. If you go to Slide 6, IFF delivered another quarter of solid results and significant bottom line improvement compared to a year ago. IFF achieved growth across all our business units with notable volume improvement across the entire portfolio. The combination of improved market conditions and our global team's passion and drive to serve our customers and address evolving needs across end markets was a major contributor to our performance. The actions we have taken this year to strengthen our business and capital structure as well as our push to drive productivity in today's dynamic marketplace are producing encouraging results. Importantly, we delivered high-single-digit volume growth with broad-based contributions across each of our businesses. Equally encouraging, comparable adjusted operating EBITDA grew by double-digits in the third quarter, primarily driven by volume performance and productivity gains. Considering our solid performance in the third quarter, specifically flowing through our over delivery in the quarter as well as our continued cautiously optimistic outlook for the fourth quarter, we are modifying our full-year 2024 financial guidance. We are making solid progress against our targets and are confident we will achieve net sales between $11.3 billion $11.4 billion which is almost $100 million higher than our previous guidance range. For EBITDA, we are tightening the range and are now targeting the high-end of our previously communicated range of $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion. Lastly, I am pleased to share that we remain on track to complete the previously announced divestiture of our Pharma Solutions business in the first half of 2025, marking another significant milestone in our portfolio optimization and deleveraging journey. Now moving to Slide 7. I want to highlight a few key achievements so far this year. While we continue to operate in a challenging end-market environment, our performance over the last nine months has bolstered our position as a preferred innovation partner and growth enabler for our customers. Over the last nine months, currency neutral sales grew 7%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Scent and high-single-digit growth in Health & Biosciences. Comparable adjusted operating EBITDA has increased 19% year-to-date, fueled by our strong recovery in sales volume growth versus prior year lows and our productivity initiatives. Since announcing our new business-led operating model, operating philosophy and strategy refresh earlier this year, our focus on getting back to the basics is translating into stronger financial performance with greater end-to-end responsibility and accountability. With a reinvigorated mindset and a simplified structure, IFF is better positioned to navigate today's complex and fast moving operating environment. Now these steps also include sharpening our focus on key end markets and increasing our investments in high growth areas for the benefit of our teams and our customers. In the third quarter, we also opened a creative center in Shanghai and have started to invest in additional creative centers in Mexico City and India. Together, these innovation hubs in important markets expand our global footprint and ensure we have the regional expertise required to serve customers on a more intimate level and address their unique needs. With our people at the heart of IFF's revised strategy, I'm equally excited to announce that our employee engagement has improved significantly over the last 10 months. As I've said before, empowering and enabling our global team to do what they do best is essential to our shared success as a global organization. And earlier this month, much of our global team had the opportunity to come together and celebrate IFF's 135 year legacy and 60th anniversary of being listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a true honor and reminder of the incredible legacy of this great Company. I have no doubt that, that legacy of IFF will continue for the next 135 years. But for now, I'll pass it on to Glenn, for a closer look at our quarterly results. Glenn? Thank you, Glenn. I am tremendously proud of what our teams have accomplished both in the last quarter and through 2024 to advance our operating philosophy, our strategic direction and our execution capabilities. Together, we are building a stronger, more resilient IFF backed by a global team whose relentless dedication to innovation and winning in the marketplace continues to energize me quarter-after-quarter. Our solid performance this year is a direct reflection of the strength of our team and the shared buy-in for our strategic vision, and I am so grateful to work alongside such talented colleagues. While I'm energized by our recent performance, I am clear eyed and recognize that there is lots more work to be done. As Glenn mentioned, we remain committed to reinvesting in our businesses, particularly our highest return businesses over the long-term to ensure we are well-positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth to our shareholders. In the near-term, however, we remain laser focused on achieving our 2024 financial guidance and encouraging our global teams to unleash the full potential of IFF with our incredible customers. Thank you all for your ongoing support. I would like to now open the call for questions. Thanks for the question, Josh. Let me just say that the fourth quarter has started as we expected, which is very encouraging. But, the pattern we have seen in the last few quarters is a strong start and then a bit of deceleration through the quarter. And, we've got limited visibility to December at this point. So, we are cautious given the potential that customers could adjust inventory at the end of the year, which has happened in the last few years. But, let me just say that we want to make sure that we continue to deliver what we say we will deliver. But, the quarter started off as expected. Thanks Ghansham. First of all, it's too early to give you any specifics. And as you know, we normally guide in February. And right now, we're finalizing our budgeting process. But, I will make a couple of comments. First of all, as you'll recall, we will have over $100 million in incentive comp reset in 2025, which is a positive for next year. And then, let me just add that we continue to work really hard on customer focus, on driving innovation and productivity to drive our performance. And, I got to say that, nine months in, I love how our teams are stepping up and driving performance, driving execution. And just to add to that, we have announced internally we didn't see a need for a press release, but internally that we have named two Presidents, a President of what we'll now call taste and a President of what we'll call Food Ingredients. The way I would answer that is we are focused on driving continuous improvement in both margins and ROIC, and we're tracking them very closely by business now. And, the levers that we have driving customer focus, driving innovation and productivity are all helping us gain confidence that we'll be able to continuously improve both. Also, I'd just add that we are prioritizing capital allocation to our higher margin and higher return businesses, Scent, Flavors, now we're going to call it taste, and Health & Biosciences. And, we continue to have strong emphasis on driving Functional Ingredients turnaround, which we're making good progress on. So, we are focused on these two metrics, and we're doing the things to continuously improve over time. Thanks for the question, David. And, I feel very good about the progress we're making. First of all, let me start by saying that each of our BUs have developed very strong strategies with very clear priorities. And, now with R&D embedded in the BUs, we can already feel both the power and the energy created by the focus and the better connection of our R&D efforts to customer needs. And I tell you, it energizes our R&D people and it makes the whole system work better. And, just one example, our Scent team now has a very clear plan and is already taking actions to strengthen our pipeline of naturals, synthetic chemistry and biotech molecules. So, it's great to see that. What I would say on that, in terms of the impact is I think that the main impact of the new projects will be in 2026 and beyond. But, I can tell you that the energy is already helping now and will help in 2025 in terms of seeing those that pipeline strengthen and having discussions with customers and also our sales force energized by that, I think will benefit us is already benefiting us. And, I think we'll have benefits in 2025. But, the specific project benefits will really come in \u201826 and beyond. And then, Mike, to the second part of your question, we're not really seeing strong green shoot comments yet from our customer base for 2025. But, the good news is that we're taking aggressive actions to strengthen our position by getting back to basics, as we said before, heavy customer focus, heavy focus on innovation. And by the way, as customers see slowing end-markets, what they want to do is have more innovation so that they can drive growth relative to the market. And, that's when they come to us and that's a good thing. And, I'll just also say we're doing lots of customer business, lots of focus on customers and co-creation with them of leading products around the world. In the third quarter, I personally visited with other executive team members 11 countries and representing over 4 billion people and it was just great. And by the way, up till now, I've visited about 40% of our customer base and just see how our people are in front of our customers. And, I feel a lot of energy with our teams in front of customers, whether it's our salespeople, with our perfumers or our flavorists or our biotech scientists, co-creating products. And you feel the energy, and I would love it if you guys could feel the energy. But just as an example, I was just in India and Indonesia and was super excited to not only hear about our double-digit growth across Scent, Flavors, Health & Biosciences and Food Ingredients, but met with customers that are very bullish about their growth in these high growth markets, but also about the innovation that we're bringing with these creative centers to help them grow. So tough market, but I believe that we're putting in place the right things to grow above market. I would start by saying that both are very, very important to us. And, the multi-nationals that are focused on innovation and driving superior products are wanting more of our innovation and we're doing more projects with them and that's helpful to their growth and to our growth. But also the regionals and the locals are also growing and we're, I think, strengthening our strategies and our capabilities to serve them locally. And, that's what I'm seeing around the world. That's why we're building more creative centers to service both the global companies but also the locals the regionals and the locals. So, we're seeing growth opportunities across, but of course, there are some geographies and there are some segments that are growing faster than others. But we're, I think, now very clear on making sure that we're able to grow in all three customer segments. And then from there, we're planning on continuing to grow our topline and with that be able to invest the same percentage of sales in our innovation and other areas to drive growth. And that $20 million is going to commercial people, to technical sales, experts to increase more perfumers, more flavors, and R&D people. So, really strengthening our ability to drive innovation. At the same time, we're strengthening our ability to drive productivity and make sure that we're able to drive productivity in a way that we keep continuously improving our margins and our ROIC and be able to invest even more in innovation. So, I think it's a virtuous cycle that we drive the innovation, which gives us sales growth, which enables us to invest more in innovation. At the same time, we drive productivity to help our margins but also enable us to invest more in innovation. And, that's what we've started to be able to do in 2024 and intend to continue to do in 2025 and beyond. I'd just add that we're investing in creative centers in the growth markets, including India, very aggressively to ensure that we continue to grow strong in those markets. Well, first of all, I want to thank you all for joining today. Appreciate your questions and your interest in IFF. I've now been here for just about 10 months, and I've got to tell you that I'm more excited than ever about the prospects for our Company. I love team IFF. I love our customers. I love spending time with them. I love our innovation and really appreciate the work that our teams are doing to have delivered the first three quarters. And, I can tell you that we're all very much focused on making sure that we deliver the fourth quarter but doing it in a way that strengthens us for \u201825 to \u201826 and beyond. So, thank you very much, and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Erik, and thank you all for joining us today. As Erik noted, IFF had another very solid quarter achieving revenue just north of $2.9 billion, an increase of 9% on a comparable currency neutral basis. We delivered broad-based growth across Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions, with notable volume improvements across all four business units. Our ongoing productivity initiatives also contribute to a 16% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA in the quarter. Building upon our margin strength from the prior two quarters, we also realized another successful quarter of margin expansion with our comparable adjusted operating EBITDA margin of 19.4%, improving by 180 basis points versus Q3 of 2023. Adjusted EPS excluding amortization was $1.04 in the quarter, increasing 17% versus the prior year period as strong profit performance and lower interest expense were mitigated by foreign exchange impacts in other expenses. Turning to Slide 9, our improved performance was broad-based this quarter. Nourish comparable currency neutral sales increased 7% and we delivered an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 18%. This was led by Flavors' third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and modest sales improvement in Functional Ingredients. In Functional Ingredients, high-single-digit volume growth was mostly offset by our pricing actions, which were very consistent with our planned price investments this year. Overall, we are very pleased with our Functional Ingredients recovery plan that has delivered three consecutive quarters of volume growth with strong expansion in margins and EBITDA. Health & Bioscience achieved double-digit improvements in all of its businesses due to strong volume growth and productivity gains. H&B's comparable currency neutral sales increased 12% and we delivered comparable adjusted operating EBITDA of $173 million a 15% increase from the year ago period. In Scent, double-digit increases in both consumer Fragrance & Fine Fragrance as well as high-single-digit growth in Fragrance Ingredients led to a strong quarter for both revenue and profit growth. Net sales in the quarter totaled $613 million up 10% on a comparable currency neutral basis and we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $127 million up 7% on a comparable basis. Lastly, Pharma Solutions returned to growth, delivering sales of $256 million, an 8% increase on a comparable currency neutral basis, while adjusted operating EBITDA surged over 32% to $62 million on a comparable basis. This notable performance was driven by strong double-digit growth in Industrial and mid-single digit growth in Core Pharma. Once again, margin expansion was primarily driven by volume and productivity gains. Turning to Slide 10, cash flow from operations totaled $702 million year-to-date, a $366 million increase from last quarter, while CapEx year-to-date totaled $303 million or roughly 3.5% of sales. Our free cash flow position totaled $399 million year-to-date, a sequential increase from $136 million last quarter. Year-to-date, we also distributed $411 million in dividends to our shareholders. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $569 million at the end of the third quarter, including $2 million in assets held for sale. Additionally, gross debt for the quarter totaled approximately $9.1 billion with a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA of 3.9 times, a decrease from 4.5 times at the end of 2023. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion largely in-line with last quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and into the first half of \u201825, we remain committed to achieving our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of below 3 times, following the completion of our Pharma Solutions divestiture. This sale, which again we expect to complete in the first half of \u201825, reflects our near-term focus on optimizing our portfolio and improving our leverage position to further strengthen our capital structure. On Slide 11, I'd like to turn to our consolidated outlook for the full-year \u201824. Given our improved financial and operational performance in the first three quarters of the year, tempered by some caution due to continued soft-end consumer demand, we are modifying our full-year \u201824 financial guidance. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $11.3 billion to $11.4 billion up from our previously communicated range of $11.1 billion to 11.3 billion. We also now believe that volumes will be in the range of 5% to 6% growth versus our previous expectation of 3% to 5% increase. Pricing is also now expected to be roughly flat for the full-year versus 1% growth previously as real pricing remains consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year, but FX related pricing in emerging markets is expected to be slightly less than originally expected. Our outlook for the fourth quarter remains unchanged despite our performance in Q3, given macro trends as we closely monitor food, home and personal care end-markets, order phasing due to potential customers inventory adjustments at year-end and a slightly tougher year-over-year comparison. On the bottom line, we now expect to deliver full-year \u201824 adjusted operating EBITDA near the high-end of our previously communicated range of $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion. The high-end of this range includes the upside we delivered in the third quarter and assumes continued productivity improvements, a greater level of annual incentive compensation given the relative strength of our performance versus budget, and incremental reinvestments in the business with a focus on profitable long-term growth. Lastly, based on current market foreign exchange rates, we now expect that foreign exchange will have an approximately 3% full-year adverse impact to sales growth, assuming a EURO/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.12 at the time of our forecast was developed versus the previously expected range of 3% to 4%. I'll now turn it back to Erik, for closing remarks. This is Glenn. Good afternoon, Nicola. I appreciate the question. Just as a reminder, typically, our high watermark for margin is Q2 for Nourish, a very positive mix as they go into the summer season here. What you see as it relates to the quarter-to-quarter progression between basically 2% and 3%, and then ultimately, from 3% to 4%, there'll be a slight contraction in margin as well. As it relates to 2% to 3%, you have sort of mix more normalizes. And then secondarily, as we've mentioned that, we are increasing our investments in the business. So, those are beginning to basically show through relative to the margin as well. So as you look out into Q4, you should expect, because of the seasonality, i.e, lower volumes for Nourish in Q4, that we will have some degradation of 50 basis points to 90 basis points in terms of margin quarter-to-quarter. Yes, it's a great question, John. So, relative to where we are with separation of Functional Ingredients and the Flavors business, we are on track to basically have that set up as two completely separate businesses. Actually, most of the organizational changes have been announced and implemented. We will start reporting it starting next year, which means in the first quarter. So, May of next year is when you'll see the first cut between the businesses and we plan on providing some historical context as well. Yes. And, then relative to the performance in the third quarter volumes, we actually pretty much, it was fairly broad-based, John, across all the businesses. Pharma was right on track, but the rest of the businesses generally sort of exceeded expectations. We had very strong Flavors, very strong Scent and certain businesses with H&B are very, very strong. We believe it is a combination, as you're well aware, the end consumer, there's very few signs that the consumer is getting any stronger in terms of what's going on in terms of consumption. But, we do think that we're picking up share and winning in the marketplace, and that's a function of sort of the renewed focus on innovation, commercial excellence across the businesses, and the new operating model. As Erik had mentioned, the start as it relates to Q4, we're just being a little more cautious because we had been surprised in December the last couple of years. Yes. So, two numbers I'll give you, Patrick. Good morning. One is our reported free cash flow I'm sorry, our full-year free cash flow, we expect to be basically largely unchanged versus previous guide. You sort of already mentioned the reason why the earnings trajectory is higher, but we also are building more working capital, which is almost exclusively related to higher sales, so it's sitting in receivables. So net-net, we're sort of in a neutral position for the full-year, so no change in the forecast. Sure. Yes, this is Glenn. Thanks, Kristen, for the question. The reality is we don't typically have a long order book. And certainly, there's very this is essentially zero into next year. The contracting period largely is around pricing with our relationships from the standpoint. It is going extremely well. We feel that this is a byproduct of the now two year work we've had in place to basically remediate the business. So, we are seeing very, very good progression in the business and expect it to continue into next year. And, there's nothing in the annual negotiation process that suggests that we're not in a very good place to sustain the momentum within the business. As a reminder, we have taken a tremendous amount of effort to fix our service issues starting two plus years ago. Our service levels are extremely high. Secondarily, we reinvested deflation and giving price back to basically be much, much more competitive in the marketplace. Third, we basically reenergized our sales pipeline, so work very closely with the front-lines and the innovation resources to identify how to win customers back and win new business. That has been working extremely well. And, those collective efforts have actually resulted us in having mid-single-digit volumes this year. We feel like we've gained back about half of the lost volume at this point. And, at the same time, we've been expanding margins very, both gross margin and ultimately EBITDA year-over-year growth very, very well. The last piece is we are in the beginning phases of a fundamental restructure of our global supply chain footprint. That means actually making sure that we have the assets in the best locations from a cost perspective and the best supply chain to support that. That will take several years, but we think that's the final step as we've committed to in the past of moving this business back to the mid-teens range in terms of overall EBITDA margins CIRCA 12, 13 this year, but we should be able to get to 15 plus in the coming years. So, we feel very good. The team has done a phenomenal job, has been working non-stop to basically make this afternoon feel very good with the businesses. Yes. Hey Sal, it's a good question. One, just to remind obviously everybody is that there is a bounce back effect this year from the lag of destocking. So, there's a mathematical sort of performance that the entire industry is seeing as we overlap last year. So, that's obviously explained some of the incremental growth above what is happening at the consumer level. Fine Fragrance continues to be a unique case as everyone is well aware over the last several years. Since COVID, the category has exploded. We believe that that is a function of multiple things happening at consumer level, a plethora of new brands being launched, the impact of social media, ultimately the digital channel has become a very, very meaningful channel for the growth in the business as well. And, the use of Fine Fragrance has expanded beyond sort of a special occasion as a result of that. We like everybody in the industry, have seen that hitting the Fine Fragrance space. We believe that that will continue to some degree that there still are lots of new channels and new brand opportunities and certainly regional opportunities. I would also say that we believe because we do track how we're doing in the market versus others as we are winning share. So, as Erik had mentioned, the investments we have been making relative to new geographies, adding perfumers, adding new creative centers, etcetera is the other way that basically we're winning in the business and we're very committed to continuing to do that, not only within the Scent business, but more broadly across the higher growth and higher margin businesses within IFF. So, appreciate the question. Yes, good morning, Kevin. Generally, our price cost dynamic is flattish. We have seen throughout this year some continued deflation, not to the degree of last year, and our early outlook for next year is things are fairly stable. We believe there are certain parts of the basket that increases, but others some level of deflation. So generally, the price environment in our view is fairly static and the price cost dynamic is fairly static as a byproduct of that. Difficult to forecast at this point in time regarding tariffs. There is obviously some history here with the first Trump administration that was more focused as it relates to food and China as one country versus broad-based. So, it depends upon what if anything ultimately happens in the arena of tariffs. So, it is something that maybe yesterday people weren't very focused on. But as of this morning, members of the team are very focused on. I would note that when there was basically escalation of tariffs in China, it's probably intuitively good for our business relative our footprint, global footprint, our ability to react. As you're well aware, there's a more competitive environment within China. So, those tariffs could actually intuitively be advantageous to our overall business broadly. But obviously, stay tuned. And, as we think about kind of next year and provide guidance in February, there'll probably be more to speak about at that point. Yes. So, hey, good morning, Mike. I'll take the first part, which is the year-over-year. We were 4.60 on a reported basis last year. As a reminder, we have FX and then portfolio changes from last year as well that actually turns that into around a 4.40 like-for-like. And, as you pointed out, our guide currently we get is around 4.40 for this year as well. It's very simple, honestly. It has all to do with our incentive compensation. As you know, last year on the full-year, we were below 100%. As we've mentioned, we are materially above 100% in excess of an incremental $100 million of variable comp. That is a nearly $40 million year-over-year impact in the quarter alone. So, that sort of normalized impact is a huge impact. The rest of the equation is basically productivity is offsetting basically some modest level of inflation in investment. But, it's really that incentive comp growth year-over-year that's the biggest piece. Yes. Lauren, I'll start and hand it over to Erik. I'll just sort of clarify the [24] (ph) impact as we communicated last time, which is the same, is $20 million in the P&L. So, it's roughly 10 and 10 in Q3 and Q4. So, that will annualize by another $20 million in the first half of next year. That's independent of any additional level, but that's our starting point. Yes. Hey, good morning, Jeff. So, we're mid-single-digit up in the month of October. So, same pattern we've seen for the last few quarters. As Erik noted, it sort of drops there sort of fairly significantly with the last month of the quarter rather being pretty tough. And Functional Ingredients is sort of following that pattern. Functional Ingredients from a volume metric standpoint is going to be 5% to 6% volumes this year. They had very, very strong performance. That is largely been offset with price, so currency neutral are sort of flattish to slightly up. But to remind you, the beginning of this year, there was a lot of deflation in the underlying commodities supporting the business. We basically took those dollars to reinvest back with our customers on a very targeted basis, and it's helped us not only deliver the topline turnaround results. But to your final question, gross margins are up very nicely, fairly consistent with Flavors in terms of the year-over-year and EBITDA itself is up very strongly. So last year, the business was, I'll say, CIRCA 8%, 9% EBITDA margin. It will probably finish this year north of 12%, and it's sort of on its way to our stated objective to get to sort of mid-teens over the next two years. So, hopefully that answers the question. Yes. Good morning, Lisa. So, I'll provide some general perspectives and then turn it over to Erik. Generally, all of our businesses have performed well across the board. Pharma lagged as we expected. The destocking was a little bit more later in the cycle. Pharma is now back in the very strong positive territory in the second half of the year as expected. But, all of the businesses have actually done very well from the start of this year standpoint. China and India are two different stories. China, while there's been some improvement, still is a little bit choppy in terms of the growth trajectory given the local market. India is extremely strong. We are, as Erik mentioned in early comments, really doubling down on investments within India to really continue to capture that share in terms of kind of the growth opportunities. So I don't know, Erik -- Yes. Hey, good morning, Chris. Every single business within H&B had a very good performance within the quarter. Probiotics bounced back a lot. As you're well aware, over the last couple of years, there has been softness in the business, in part given the situation in China. It's our second largest market. It's very close to the size of North America. So, as goes China, it does whipsaw the business sort of back and forth, but the third quarter was a very, very strong quarter across the board."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMichael DeVeau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF\u2019s second quarter 2024 conference call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s performance and business outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and our press release, both of which can be found on our website. Today\u2019s presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday. With me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our Executive Vice President, CFO and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you may have at the end. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to, Erik.\nErik Fyrwald: Well, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I\u2019m excited to join you all today and share the positive progress we are making in our strategic refresh and the solid performance IFF delivered in the second quarter. Also, during today\u2019s call, we will provide a brief update on the business-led strategic framework we are implementing across our organization. Now, over the last seven months, I\u2019ve had the great pleasure to travel to many of our facilities and have met with customers that together represent over a third of our sales and several 1,000 of our IFF team members. I\u2019ve been able to get great feedback on what makes IFF special and strategic and tactical moves our leadership team needs to make to strengthen our Company, to better serve customers and improve our performance. We have listened and are making the changes we need to unleash more of the potential for today and for the future. And, I\u2019m very pleased that the entire IFF team is rallying behind our resulting strategic refresh to make IFF better at bringing leading innovation to our customers. Now, beginning with Slide 6, IFF is building on last quarter\u2019s momentum and delivered another solid quarter, and I\u2019m pleased with our performance and our results through the first half of the year. Led by Scent, Health & Biosciences and Nourish, we delivered volume growth in the high-single digits in the second quarter. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating EBITDA increased 22%, driven by volume growth and productivity initiatives. This is a significant improvement over last year and it is great to have IFF on a better sales growth and margin expansion track. Now looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2024. Given this outlook and our solid performance to-date this year, we are raising both our sales and adjusted operating EBITDA guidance for the full-year. Glenn, will speak more about this in a few minutes. Now, it\u2019s encouraging that the steps we have taken and continue to take to refocus IFF on bringing customers\u2019 leading innovation while driving healthy productivity are yielding encouraging results. We are making solid progress advancing the business-led refresh I\u2019ve spoken about before, but we are not satisfied and we\u2019ve got a lot more work to do. But, I\u2019ve got confidence that we are on the right track toward achieving IFF\u2019s full potential. Moving to Slide 7. As I did last quarter, I would like to give a brief update on our progress as we work across the organization to refresh our strategy and focus on a business-led operating model. IFF has had a challenging last three years. Constraints on our balance sheet led the Company to underinvest in our core businesses and focused on divestitures. The Company was not structured to effectively navigate the complex and fast moving environment, and we underperformed relative to our peers. We have now had several quarters of growth as we have taken decisive actions to get our businesses back on-track. Our strategy moving forward will be driven by four key pillars: our people, our customer focus, our position as an innovation powerhouse and our operational excellence. We will engage and empower our people to deliver customer success while we drive profitable market share growth over time. We will also continue to develop sustainable new products and applications that are aligned with our customers\u2019 needs now and in the future, all while being relentless in our commitment to safety, quality and the efficiency in our operations. We have already taken several steps toward resetting and refocusing our operating model, including the announced divestiture of Pharma Solutions, which is still on-track to close in the first half of 2025, and our pivot to an end-to-end business-led operating model that will promote greater accountability and better performance. We are also working hard to improve employee engagement and are seeing positive results. Furthermore, each of our business units are building a five year strategic plan to define and close gaps where they exist versus best-in-class companies. These plans include executing a refreshed turnaround strategy for functional ingredients and leveraging health and biosciences\u2019 biotech expertise and capabilities across our Scent and Flavors platforms to enhance innovation and product development. Also, as mentioned last quarter, we are focusing on having lean corporate functions to support our business units with speed, agility and closer collaboration. Now, as we prioritize growth investments to our highest value businesses, such as Flavors, Scent and Health & Biosciences, we have already started to increase R&D and commercial investments. At the same time, we plan to increase our CapEx investments, targeting about 6% of sales for the next several years to bolster capacity and accelerate our digital transformation, including ERP implementation. We believe these investments will generate strong returns, providing us with incremental growth and efficiency opportunities that will lead us to continue to improve how we serve our customers profitably. Lastly, we are committed to delivering significant value creation for our shareholders. And with that in mind, we are on-track to achieve our raised guidance targets for the year as we continue to drive profitable growth across each of our businesses. I\u2019ll now pass it over to Glenn, for a closer look at our quarterly results, which demonstrate the continued progress and growth we are achieving. Glenn?\nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Erik, and thank you all for joining us today. As Erik noted, IFF had a strong second quarter. Revenue of just below $2.9 billion increased 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis with Scent, H&B and Nourish each growing revenue in the quarter. Volumes grew by high-single digits as our performance continued to improve sequentially across nearly every business. Our volume growth and strong gains from productivity initiatives together contributed to a 22% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA in the quarter. Our adjusted operating EBITDA margin improved by 310 basis points to 20.4% on a comparable basis, building off a strong first quarter and the first time we were over 20% since the third quarter of 2022. Turning to Slide 9. I\u2019ll dive a bit deeper into each of our segments. Nourish comparable currency neutral sales increased 4% and we delivered an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 36% on a comparable basis. This was led by a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Flavors with improvements in both volume and pricing. Functional Ingredient sales declined modestly in the quarter as high-single digit volume growth was offset by lower pricing, consistent with plan. Both Flavors and Functional Ingredients demonstrated strong year-over-year gross margin expansion. The strong profitability in Nourish was driven by volume growth and productivity improvements as well as the comparison to the one-time Locust Bean Kernel inventory write-down in the year ago period. Health & Biosciences achieved strong growth in all businesses with a noteworthy uptick in health led by a strong performance in probiotics. H&B comparable currency neutral sales increased 9%, and we delivered comparable adjusted operating EBITDA of $165 million a 14% increase from a year ago. In Scent, double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance & Fragrance Ingredients led to a strong quarter for both revenue and profit growth. Fine Fragrance also remained strong, growing mid-single digits, led by new wins and volume gains. Net sales in the quarter were $603 million up 16% on a comparable currency neutral basis, and we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $137 million up 38% on a comparable basis. Lastly, Pharma Solutions returned to volume growth with revenue of $250 million. Profitability in this segment declined in-line with our plan as we managed through unfavorable mix and one-time items. Turning to Slide 10. Cash flow from operations totaled $336 million this quarter, while CapEx year-to-date was $200 million or roughly 3.5% of sales. For the year, we expect that CapEx will be approximately $575 million as we ramp up in the second half of the year. Our free cash flow position in Q2 totaled $136 million, an increase sequentially of approximately $150 million from last quarter and a significant increase from $85 million reported in the year ago period. We paid $309 million in dividends through the end of the second quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $674 million. IFF also continued to make progress towards achieving our deleveraging goals and reduced our gross debt by over $900 million from last quarter, yielding a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4x at quarter end compared with 4.4x at the end of the first quarter. This was driven by improved operational performance, including solid working capital management as well as the closure of our Cosmetic Ingredients divestiture, which occurred early in the second quarter. It\u2019s important to note that we remain committed to achieving our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of 3x or less following the completion of the divestiture of Pharma Solutions, which we continue to expect to be completed in the first half of 2025. On Slide 11, I\u2019d like to turn to our consolidated outlook for \u201824, where we are raising both our sales and adjusted operating EBITDA guidance ranges, given our stronger than expected financial and operational performance in the first half of the year. We are now expecting net sales to be in the range of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion reflecting our expectation that volume growth will continue across the majority of our portfolio in the back half of the year, albeit at lower growth rates than the first half. Given the recent economic indicators and mixed results by CPG companies of late, we remain cautious relative to the outlook for demand in the balance of the year. Operating under this assumption, for the full-year, we now expect to achieve a 3% to 5% volume growth, up from our previously announced range of 0% to 3%. On the bottom line, we also raised our adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range to $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion up from our previously stated range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. This increase reflects our strong profitability performance in the first half of the year with a consistent view of the second half from our previously communicated guidance. It should be noted that we are also factoring in a greater level of annual incentive compensation given the relative strength of our performance versus budget and incremental second half spending related to business reinvestment. Specifically, as part of our strategy refresh, the team has identified investments that will accelerate the execution of our strategy, focus in business development, R&D and innovation that will yield results in 2025 and 2026. Based on current market exchange rates, we expect that FX will be closer to a 4% adverse impact to sales growth within our 3% to 4% range given. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $520 million to $540 million. I\u2019ll now turn back to Erik, for closing remarks.\nErik Fyrwald: Well, thank you, Glenn. As I shared at the top of the call, I am pleased with the team\u2019s solid performance throughout the first half of the year, especially as it represents a significant improvement over our prior year lows. We are moving on the right track because our teams around the world continue to relentlessly focus on efficiently meeting the needs of our customers, resulting in driving profitable growth. And, I\u2019m energized by the progress we\u2019ve made so far this year, yet I recognize that we have a lot more to do to achieve the full potential of this great company. Already, we are making progress to better meet our goals and by taking advantage of the market\u2019s tailwinds and increasing our investments in our high-growth businesses, we believe we will be positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over time. I want to especially thank the entire IFF team for delivering these results, including rallying behind our strategic refresh to advance our customer focused and innovation-led strategy. We want every IFFer to share the same passion and desire to help our customers differentiate and win in the marketplace. We are making much progress towards this goal. As I look ahead to the remainder of the year, we will remain steadfast in bringing new products and innovations to the market while simultaneously executing a turnaround strategy across our Functional Ingredients business, including with strong productivity initiatives. And, I\u2019m confident the actions we\u2019re taking and the near-term operational priorities we are executing will create a stronger IFF. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh, your line is now open.\nJosh Spector: Yes, hi, good morning, and first congrats on a really solid second quarter here. So, I wanted to ask two related pieces here. It\u2019s first really around the sequencing of EBITDA in the second half. So, the step down in 3Q versus 2Q and then your implied 4Q is a pretty material seasonal step down. So, what is driving that in your view versus the stronger 2Q? And then, related is around volumes. So, the 3% to 5% lift is clearly better than you expected, but that\u2019s largely just a reflection of, I think, 2Q flowing through. I would say volumes in the second half are up 1% to 2%. The comps maybe do get harder, but it seems like with sequentially stable, maybe moving around a little bit, that\u2019s a pretty easy bar to beat. So, what are you seeing on the volume side that we might be missing? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Hey, good morning, Josh. Thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll start with your second one and then we\u2019ll come back to the EBITDA question. We are expecting more modest volume growth in the second half of the year, specifically in the fourth quarter. We are forecasting about a 4% volume uplift year-over-year in Q3 and flattish in Q4. As a reminder, last year sequentially was negative 7%, negative 11%, negative 7% and negative 3%. We are somewhat sort of cautious on Q4, combination of, the overlap from last year and then secondarily, the end consumer continues to be very, very unique and the economic indicators, as you\u2019re well aware, are probably more negative now than they were a few months ago. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving sort of the volume expectations. The EBITDA first half versus second half is really a reflection of lower revenues in the second half. Big portion of that is seasonal. We expect that basically we will be about $400 million less revenue based on our guide in the second half of the year, than in the first half of the year. That is notably $300 million in the fourth quarter, which is always our seasonally our lowest. So, that really drives the vast majority of the change in the first half versus the second half. I will also add that we are investing about $20 million to $30 million incremental OpEx in the back half of the year. Given the performance this year, we want to reinvest to begin to accelerate growth for \u201825 and \u201826. So, that\u2019s another piece of the equation.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Nicola, your line is now open.\nNicola Tang: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. It actually feeds on quite nicely from your last answer there, Glenn. I was wondering if you could give more color on some of those incremental investments around R&D and commercial assets and capacity. Could you give a few more specific examples and how you expect that to feed through or contribute to \u201825 and \u201826? And, you gave some helpful quantification on the CapEx for the next few years in terms of this OpEx step up. Should we also extrapolate that going forward as well? Thank you.\nErik Fyrwald: Right. Thanks for the question, Nicola. And, we\u2019re very excited about the increased investment in OpEx, as Glenn mentioned, $20 million to $30 million that we\u2019re putting into the Company this year to have impact in the coming years, \u201825, \u201826 and beyond. That includes, of course, R&D, and we\u2019re increasing R&D spend in both, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Flavors. And that includes, by the way, accelerating our transformation in biotech to come out with new fragrances and flavors with our biotech capabilities that will enhance our Scent and Flavors businesses. We\u2019re also increasing the R&D to find more naturals, both for Scent and for Flavors. Obviously, a great market trend towards naturals. We\u2019re leaders in that area, and we want to continue to strengthen our leadership position. Also across all three of those businesses, we\u2019re adding commercial capability. And, in our Functional Ingredients business, we\u2019re adding more technical service capability to better sell higher-value products that we have in our Functional Ingredients portfolio. On the OpEx or excuse me, on the CapEx side, we\u2019re adding capacity, especially in Health & Biosciences, but across all three of those high growth markets of businesses, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Flavors, to ensure that we always have very reliable, high-quality supply for all of our customers around the world for all those product lines. So, we\u2019re making significant investment now, and we\u2019ll continue to ramp that up in the coming years to ensure that we continue to profitably grow very aggressively those business units. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. John, your line is now open.\nJohn Roberts: Hi, congrats on the quarter. Erik, on Slide 7, this end-to-end operating model replaces the reorganization that your predecessor has started. Is the model fully in place, or can you tell us where you are? When you\u2019ll be fully in place?\nErik Fyrwald: Yes. We\u2019re making a lot of really good progress, John. Thanks for the question. And, what I would say is that the clarity has been very well received by our people. And, I think that the uncertainty has been cleaned up. The business teams are getting put in place. They\u2019re very excited and very energized by the clarity of decision making, their ability to set strategy and then to execute all elements of the business from R&D, operations, commercial and all the functions to support that those gears working together to drive each of the business units. And, I can tell you that we\u2019re starting to feel the benefits of that by seeing the strategies being executed and being strengthened in terms of being able to take our innovation from R&D and get it through the creation and into commercial operations, produce it and then get it in there commercially. And, it\u2019ll take a while to fully drive the benefits, but we\u2019re starting to feel the strength and improvements in energy and ability to do that. The other thing that\u2019s really interesting here is with the focus business units having their strategy and by the way, from that comes the five year plan, which gives us more clarity on where we\u2019re investing. We\u2019re able to better differentiate between the units on where we put more of the investment and where we put less of the investment, where we need more productivity and where we need to focus that productivity to make sure that we\u2019re competitive cost wise and able to drive margins. And then also, as you get that clarity on each business unit, what they need to do to win, it also increases the ability of businesses to collaborate effectively. And so, that collaboration, the synergy is now much less driven corporately with corporate programs and lots of consultants and lots complexity and much more from the businesses where they know the customers and where that synergy, where that leverage makes sense. So, we\u2019re making good progress. And by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have all five units operating well, and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll start reporting the five business units.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham, your line is now open.\nGhansham Panjabi: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. Erik, I just want to go back to the strategic refresh specific to R&D. Does that entail more spending as it relates to R&D as a percentage of sales or is it more repositioning resources with an overlay of accountability? And then, also on the CapEx piece, the Company has been spending roughly $0.5 billion in CapEx post the DuPont acquisition. So, as you sort of look back, was that just maintenance CapEx basically and now you\u2019re adding growth CapEx? Is that the right sequencing to think about as you go back to your comments about 6% CapEx to sales going forward?\nErik Fyrwald: Yes, thanks for the question, very important. Let me start with the CapEx. So, we now with the strategic clarity with the business units, the clarity of our strategies, we know we have to spend more on growth investments to realize our growth ambitions, but we also have some foundational investments that we need to make that we\u2019re underinvested before in basic making sure that our plants are up to standards that we need to have them operate well, reliably with high-quality. We have some ERP investments that we need to make that are kind of that are foundational. But, on top of that, we have aggressive growth targets, and we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019ve got the facilities to deliver on those growth targets. On the R&D spend, we are absolutely increasing R&D spend as a percentage of sales in our Health & Biosciences business and will increase the R&D spend in our Flavors and Scent businesses as we grow those businesses. And, I think that will be really important to ensure that we continue to strengthen those businesses and get the full benefit of their potential. On the Functional Ingredients side, it\u2019s heavily leaning towards making sure that we\u2019ve got the right cost position, that we\u2019ve got enough productivity to turn continue to turn around that business and get it on the right track and get it competitive with its competitive set. And, we\u2019re making good progress on that, by the way. And, part of that will involve consolidation of some of our manufacturing facilities, which will take some initial CapEx, but we\u2019ll have very, very high returns. And then finally, we are pushing strengthening our productivity across the Company. When we talk about empowered business units, each of the business units also has a productivity leader now that\u2019s focused on making sure that we\u2019re driving productivity within each business unit to be able to improve margins and invest more in innovation. And then, we\u2019re talking about lean corporate functions that effectively and efficiently support the business units. And, each of those corporate functions has a productivity lead to make sure that we\u2019re fully competitive on costs for our corporate functions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Kristen, your line is now open.\nKristen Owen: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to know if we could unpack some of the volume drivers behind each of the businesses in Q2. Just help us understand the mix between end user demand, channel restock and or some of the pricing incentives that you\u2019ve talked about? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Good morning, Kristen. Thank you for the question. What we\u2019re seeing is actually no incremental improvement in the consumer. So, I know everyone sort of tracks what\u2019s happening, but neither food and beverage, [H&B] (ph) really are showing any strengthening the market. So, our volume growth we believe is a function of two things. First of all, the lack of destocking from prior year. So, it was pretty significant as you know in the first half of the year. We do not see any restocking at this point in time. I would note that Pharma\u2019s destocking lagged a bit. And all the other businesses we think were largely done at the end of last year. Pharma, largely done at the end of this quarter, so that we see the volume of trajectory for Pharma improving going forward. We also track very closely our volume performance vis-a-vis our key competitors by segment. And, we\u2019re pleased in terms of where we are generally performing at or better across the entire Board. And, we believe it\u2019s really a function of sort of three things. One is, as Erik mentioned, the innovation focus. We\u2019ve increased our intensity relative to our innovation pipeline. Secondarily, our sales pipeline, we spent a lot of energy to rebuild our pipeline and really accelerate our ability to win new business and win back business. And then third, I would have a special call out for the Ingredients business. Ingredients business has actually come back very strongly based on the remediation efforts that we launched last year into this year. Part of that, as a reminder, is taking some of the deflation that business has experienced in reinvesting in pricing at the start of the year and that\u2019s actually played out very well. We had about 7%, 8% plus volumes in the ingredients business in the second quarter alone. So, that\u2019s how we sort of characterize. Again, we\u2019re confident in terms of what we can control, but the market continues to give us pause because we\u2019re just not seeing so lot of strength in the consumer.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Patrick, your line is now open.\nPatrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. Given some of the incremental increase in OpEx and CapEx, but revised guidance upward, is there any update to free cash flow guidance for the year and any items we should be monitoring there? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Hey, good morning, Patrick. Thanks for the question. We are still guiding to the full-year of $600 million. As a reminder, when we started the year, it was $500 million. We upped our guidance to $600 million the last quarter, in part to reflect we were pointing towards the higher end of our previous guidance. We are expecting earnings to be up, as we mentioned, with the higher guidance. There will be slightly higher working capital. As the businesses are growing, basically have to make sure our inventories are in the right position to continue to support it. I would note that that $600 million of free cash flow includes roughly $350 million of Reg G items. Those are largely related to transactions, taxes, implementation costs, fees, etcetera. So, adjusting for that, taking the Reg G cost out for more like [$9.50] (ph) for the year, which is very consistent with what we guided previously as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Mike, your line is now open.\nMike Sison: Hey, guys. Nice quarter and outlook. In terms of Functional Ingredients, how has the new strategy driven the volume recovery? I think you had nice high-single digit recovery in 2Q. In addition, pricing is lower. Can you share a little bit of details on EBITDA margin? Is it up meaningfully? Did it improve? And then, just your thoughts on the second half for Functional Ingredients? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Hey, thanks, Mike, and good morning. Yes, relative to Functional Ingredients, not only is the topline performing well, the gross profit and our EBITDA trajectory is actually progressing very nicely against expectations. So, for the second quarter alone, on a like-for-like basis, including normalizing for the LBK write-off last year, so if you normalize for that, we were up about 250 basis points in terms of gross margin, which is consistent from the first quarter as well and consistent with where we think the full-year is going to be. As we mentioned last year, the business had dropped to high-single digit EBITDA margin. Our goal has been to get it to basically mid-teens. We are tracking well to be low teens this year. Generally, the volume recovery, the sales pipeline, the innovation recovery is performing very well. The last set of initiatives are really focused on the cost structure of our global manufacturing footprint. We\u2019ve begun to implement some of those initiatives in the second half of the year, but they\u2019re going to fully begin to kick in next year 2025. So, a lot of work to do. We\u2019ve actually put a lot of effort against that business, but we have another sort of full-year plus to sort of get the business back to where we think we are, but good progress today. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam, your line is now open.\nAdam Samuelson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe keying off of that last question and answer, Glenn, Erik, just a little more detail on some of the more tangible steps within the Functional Ingredients business to improve the profitability and get that where it needs to be from a margin and earnings and returns perspective. I think in the prepared remarks you did kind of refresh strategic plan there. So, is that really about facility consolidation to lower manufacturing costs? Is there intention on product and business mix across some different categories? And, can you talk about kind of how you think your volume performance in 2024, which was up nicely against kind of a very challenging 2023, compares to the end markets and peers that you look at in that space? Thanks.\nErik Fyrwald: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think we\u2019re making good progress on transforming the business and getting it back healthy. We have achieved some significant volume recovery ahead of the market by going back to customers that we had before and making sure that they realize that we\u2019re serious about reliable supply, about serving them well, about making sure that we\u2019re very customer-focused, and that\u2019s played out well. We\u2019ve had to make some price moves with the market as others have done as well, but that was as expected. Actually, has resulted in the combination of the productivity, aggressive productivity with some price giveback, we\u2019ve still enabled us to achieve our margin goal margin improvement goals in that business. So, we\u2019re very much on-track. But, it is a combination of focusing on customers, really getting the clarity of strategy for the functional ingredients business, which we\u2019ve been working hard on, which tells us where we focus our commercial efforts, what customers, what segments, what geographies and making sure that we\u2019re driving the volume so that our plants are operating well, plus a very aggressive approach on productivity to ensure that we\u2019ve got competitive costs and are able to have the target margins that we want for that business. It\u2019s a work in progress. We\u2019ve still got a lot of room to go. As Glenn mentioned, we\u2019ve got another year plus to get back to where we believe that business should be. But, I\u2019m very, very proud of the team and the progress that they\u2019re making.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David, your line is now open.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Erik, I know you\u2019ve been working on improving performance in your health business. With return to growth in the second quarter, can you share what\u2019s driving the strong performance in probiotics? And, how sustainable is that growth? Thank you.\nErik Fyrwald: Great. Thanks for the question, David. First of all, I think there\u2019s increasing emphasis on healthy, health and gut health, which is great. And, the U.S. market particularly has rebounded and is picking up nicely. And as you know, we focused a lot recently on our finished format approach, which is working very well. I would also say that we\u2019ve added significant commercial capability. Our team there has actually done a great job of bringing back some really strong sales people that left IFF in previous years and have now come back home, which is really helpful because it\u2019s great that they went out and thought that there were things were better, but now come back to IFF because they like what we\u2019re doing at IFF. And by the way, that\u2019s happening in some other areas as well. And then finally, the current performance is starting to turn and making some good progress. But, I got to tell you, we\u2019ve got a very exciting pipeline in our Health business that I think will bode well for the coming years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator, your line is now open.\nSalvator Tiano: Thank you very much. I want to ask about a couple of recent trends and how they are or the main part of your volumes. And firstly, a bunch of CPGs, seeing the segment sales you mentioned, are considering moving back to discounting products to get some volume. So, are you hearing about that that could give another boost in your volumes perhaps next year? And on the other hand, a lot has been said about the return of innovations and more SKUs by your customers post-COVID, which is helping now. How important has this been your 2024 results so far? And, is there any risk that this runs out of steam after your customers have a new product slate and they\u2019re done with this innovation focus?\nErik Fyrwald: Thanks for the question. And, what we\u2019re seeing from CPGs is that they want to strengthen their growth and profitable growth like we all do. And, the way we\u2019re hearing most about their strategy is to drive more innovation. And, that\u2019s terrific for us because we love working with our customers to enhance innovation. And, just a couple of examples of what\u2019s happening there. Obviously, the desire for better health and our ability to reduce sugar and salt content through modulation with our flavors in a way that gets you the same taste, but significantly lower sugar or salt levels is really strong and is one of the key drivers of our Flavors business, which is doing very well. We also, in the Scent business, are working with our Fine Fragrance customers, for example, to enhance the ability to trigger emotions that the fine fragrance companies want to have. Just an example of that is Charlotte Tilbury wanted to come out with a range of products that triggers different emotions for consumers. And, we used our AI tool, our IFF ScentCube algorithm, with her and her team to develop this line of fragrances that one product brings joy, another product brings energy, another product brings relaxation, another product brings romance, a whole slate of products, innovative products. But, if you go online on TikTok and you search for Charlotte Tilbury, she talks about how exciting it was to develop these great products, which are doing extremely well together with IFF to make them happen. And, then we\u2019re seeing other innovation, which helps to drive cost productivity, such as cocoa prices are very high. We have cocoa extender capabilities in our Flavors and our biosciences businesses that are helping companies reduce significantly the amount of cocoa they use but having the same exact same taste at lower cost. And, then one other example, I think, is really exciting is that we recently, with a very large global food company, developed and they have launched a lactose-free milk in China, where our enzymes take out the lactose and turn it into fiber and so you get lactose-free milk that is lower calorie and healthier for you. And as you know, there are many, many lactose intolerant consumers in China, so a big market. So, this focus on innovation and our ability to work with our customers to bring great innovation that helps them drive their growth profitably is really paying off.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark, your line is now open.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks and good morning everybody. I guess two clarifications. One, just on the outlook over balance of the year. The volume outlook to be weaker in 4Q. Is it something that you are theorizing? Is it something that you have line-of-sight on? It sounds like from your guidance that 3Q and July has gotten off to solid start. So, I guess I\u2019m curious just how you disaggregate those two pieces 3Q versus 4Q? And then, as we go into next year, are there any one-offs to consider like incentive comp? I think you had mentioned resets this year, so things to think about going into next year? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Hey, good morning, Mark. Thanks for the questions. Q4, we have very little visibility at this point in time. We have a very good view towards the third quarter book. Obviously, July is in the bank, and we have a good view to the current month and then September. So, there\u2019s not a lot of data points at this point in time to sort of give us any direction on Q4. Beyond, we are overlapping an improvement from prior year. So, we\u2019re negative 7% in Q3 of last year versus negative 3%. And again, we do think that the consumer dynamics basically suggest that end market demand will be flattish. We don\u2019t see restocking happening either. We think that the CPG firms are conservative. They\u2019re not going to restock until they see a strength in the market. So, all those factors basically just make us cautious on the fourth quarter until we begin to see the order book emerge. One off is a good question. The annual incentive plan is a very significant variable this year out of plan. Because of the very strong performance across all of our businesses, we are accruing an incremental $100 million this year of AIP. That\u2019s actually $140 million aggregate versus prior year. So, think about our guide of $2.1 million to $2.17 million that includes $100 million that will be normalized for next year as you just go into next year and get back to 100% sort of payout from standpoint. That\u2019s the most significant there really are -- there\u2019s always puts and takes and other items relative to where we are, but that\u2019s probably the most significant item by far within our P&L. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin, your line is now open.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Thank you and good morning. You\u2019re making some pretty good progress on the balance sheet in the quarter and it appears as though that\u2019ll most likely continue with the EBITDA upgrade and of course the pending pharma deal. So, my question would be if we were to jump ahead Erik to a time when the balance sheet is fully repaired, so to speak, are there other things that you have in mind that you\u2019d like to do strategically if capital were not a constraint?\nErik Fyrwald: Thanks for the question. And absolutely, our plans are to continue to significantly strengthen our Health & Biosciences business, our Flavors and our Scent businesses. We see a lot of opportunity with organic investments, both in R&D, commercial capability, digital capability, as well as CapEx opportunities to expand capacity and make sure that we always have enough products to sell all around the world. And then also, I foresee us returning sometime next year to really looking at bolt on acquisition opportunities and collaboration opportunities with companies that bring complementary capabilities, especially technologies that would be useful for us. So, we will we\u2019re already working on our strategies, and you\u2019ll see us get more proactive in these areas.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. I think it\u2019s also important to emphasize given, I\u2019ll say, our jaded history here relative to acquisitions is we feel like we have a phenomenal portfolio in place. We\u2019re going to prioritize the organic. And as Erik mentioned, the focus really is on bolt-ins, small acquisitions that provide either a complementary technology, a geographic strength, etcetera, as a way to continue to progress the business. At this point, anything large would be completely out of the question.\nErik Fyrwald: Yes. And I think if you look at my experience, which the last 16 years as a CEO, we\u2019ve had a lot of positive experience with bolt on acquisitions that clearly fill a strategic gap and are integrated well, thoughtfully, carefully and done in a way that enhances the company\u2019s performance immediately, doesn\u2019t distract, doesn\u2019t take us backwards like you\u2019ve seen that\u2019s happened over the last six years here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. Lisa, your line is now open.\nLisa De Neve: Hi, everyone, and thank you for taking my questions. I have one follow-up and one question. So, one follow-up on the CapEx program, sorry, one more. Can you just please provide some detail on your digital investments including the ERP system? And can you please share how this will improve or impact your organization? And also whether there\u2019s any risks to execute and implementing on the CRP system in particular? And the second question I have is really how has your position with local and regional customers versus multinational customers evolved over the last couple of years? And can you share your exposure to these type of customers and how dynamic they are multinationals at the moment? Thank you.\nGlenn Richter: Great. So, let me take the first question first and just tell you that we are taking an ERP approach that is very step by step and very careful to minimize wasted investment and also to minimize risk of implementation.\nErik Fyrwald: Just give you a couple of examples. So, the first step in our corporate ERP system development was implementing something called CFIN, our finance system, which we\u2019ve done already. It\u2019s already in place. We\u2019ve done the improvements, and it\u2019s getting better and better and enabling us to better do our closes with less people and less complexity and less corrections. The next step was just implemented in this past week called Workday for the HR systems. That\u2019s going as planned so far, going very fine. And then we\u2019ll do additional steps in the coming three years. So, we\u2019re doing it step by step to spread out the investment and spread out the manpower the focus required on it and to make sure that we do it well with minimum risk.\nGlenn Richter: If I could just add two comments. So, we will be converting we\u2019re currently on three incidences of SAP. We will be converting them probably over the next five years into a single pipe, if you will. We will be leveraging one of the legacy IFF pipe, if you will. That\u2019s going to be approximately $250 million over that five year period to get that done. It\u2019s very important to also add to Erik\u2019s comments is we actually have already separated one of our ERPs, we\u2019re on four a little over a year ago with a divestiture basically of our microbial control business and we want to get basically pharma out of the way before we sort of launch on the ERP conversion. So, think about this the second half of the year, once pharma is done, we\u2019ll be in a good shape. It\u2019s about $50 million a year over the next five years.\nErik Fyrwald: Now on your second question, the way I would look at it, I\u2019ve just been all around the world, and I\u2019ve met with customers representing over a third, probably about 40% of our revenues with our people, and many of them top to top discussions with major global multinationals, regionals and locals, talking about what we do well, what we need to do better and how we can even more closely work together on innovation, cocreation of their product lines. And I tell you, I\u2019m very excited about the desire of customers, global multinationals, regionals, locals to work with us, to tap into our innovation and our people capability to do that is really, really strong. And so what I believe is that our history with the large multinationals, our understanding of the markets around the world of what works has enhanced our ability to better serve them as we focus more on customers, as a core part of what we do in our innovation powerhouse, but also as we increase our commercial capability, better serve them and the regionals and the globals.\nGlenn Richter: Excuse me, the regionals and the locals, which will enhances our ability to drive our growth rates ahead of the market. And that\u2019s a core part of our strategies for each of our business units.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren, your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, two quick questions. One was just, you guys have historically given forward quarter guidance for sales and EBITDA and you didn\u2019t for 3Q. So, I was just kind of curious, should we expect a change in that policy and approach? And then secondly, it was just on gross margins, if we could walk through the bridge to get to the 500 basis points of margin expansion beyond lapping the LBK? Like was deflation raw materials a benefit? I know you mentioned productivity gains a bunch in the release and the slides, but just how should we maybe think about gross margin progression in the back half and any detail on some of those productivity programs could be helpful too? Thanks.\nGlenn Richter: Yes. Good morning, Lauren. We actually did provide outlook for Q3. So, we guided top line of $2.75 to $2.85 and then relative to EBITDA $5.20 to $5.40 for the quarter. So, that\u2019s the outlook for the quarter. Relative to progression on gross margin for the balance of the year, we had more significant upside in the first half of the year because of absorption LBK and other items. We still are forecasting a solid improvement year-over-year in terms of our gross margin for the second half of the year. And, it\u2019s going to be driven by volumes won\u2019t be quite up as much. So, that\u2019s a little bit of let\u2019s say a difference versus the first half. But, the productivity programs are continuing to deliver consistently quarter-to-quarter in the second half versus the first half. The net raw material basket is generally flattish in terms of where we are running from the first half to the second half going. So, we don\u2019t really see any significant upsides relative to that nor do we see downside at this point in time. So, hopefully that\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Jeff, your line is now open.\nJeff Zekauskas: Two questions. Was there a diminishment of your volume growth in July or how were your volumes in July? How do they compare to the second quarter? And, to try Lauren\u2019s question once again, your cost of goods sold was down 9% on flat to down sales. How much were your raw materials down? I know you said that they would be flat sequentially into the second half.\nGlenn Richter: Sequentially, yes. So I\u2019ll answer. Our total net price in the business largely concentrated in Functional Ingredients is around 2.5% in the first half of the year versus prior. That\u2019s equivalent to basically the reduction in raw materials year-over-year. So, we basically use that to reinvest. Again, that\u2019s largely concentrated in Functional Ingredients. So, the other businesses are relatively flat year-over-year from a raw material standpoint. July started off well. I would note that we have a very good start of the quarter. However, Jeff, in the last two quarters, the pattern has been a very, very strong first month and then it diminishes second and third, generally the third month of the quarter, and this is our outlook, tends to be the softest. We believe is this is just consistent with our customers sort of managing their inventories tighter at the end of the quarter. So a good, good start in terms of July, but that\u2019s been consistent with what we\u2019ve seen as a pattern in the last couple of quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence, your line is now open.\nDan Rizzo: Hi, guys. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Just one question. So I mean, can we expect any more potential divestitures? Are there certain businesses where maybe you\u2019re making them or improving them just so you can sell them because they\u2019re non-core?\nErik Fyrwald: We are focused right now on the divestiture of pharmaceuticals and doing that well. We\u2019re also going through this strategy refresh for each of our other businesses. And today, our total focus is on performance and performing those well, enhancing the growth rates of our Health & Biosciences, fragrances, Scent business and Flavors businesses and turning around our Functional Ingredients business. As I mentioned before, as we separate pharmaceuticals, we\u2019ll give you an update if there\u2019s any change in our strategy. But right now, we\u2019re totally focused on performing well in 2024 and strengthening for \u201825 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no questions registered at this time. So, I will pass the call back over to Erik for closing remarks.\nErik Fyrwald: Just let me thank everybody for joining the call today. I\u2019m very proud of our IFF team and the improvements that we\u2019re making to deliver not only today but to strengthen our innovation and our productivity and our customer focus to not only deliver in the second half but further strengthen for \u201825, \u201826 and beyond. So, thank you for your interest in IFF, and have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Erik Fyrwald",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today and share the positive progress we are making in our strategic refresh and the solid performance IFF delivered in the second quarter. Also, during today's call, we will provide a brief update on the business-led strategic framework we are implementing across our organization. Now, over the last seven months, I've had the great pleasure to travel to many of our facilities and have met with customers that together represent over a third of our sales and several 1,000 of our IFF team members. I've been able to get great feedback on what makes IFF special and strategic and tactical moves our leadership team needs to make to strengthen our Company, to better serve customers and improve our performance. We have listened and are making the changes we need to unleash more of the potential for today and for the future. And, I'm very pleased that the entire IFF team is rallying behind our resulting strategic refresh to make IFF better at bringing leading innovation to our customers. Now, beginning with Slide 6, IFF is building on last quarter's momentum and delivered another solid quarter, and I'm pleased with our performance and our results through the first half of the year. Led by Scent, Health & Biosciences and Nourish, we delivered volume growth in the high-single digits in the second quarter. On a comparable basis, adjusted operating EBITDA increased 22%, driven by volume growth and productivity initiatives. This is a significant improvement over last year and it is great to have IFF on a better sales growth and margin expansion track. Now looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2024. Given this outlook and our solid performance to-date this year, we are raising both our sales and adjusted operating EBITDA guidance for the full-year. Glenn, will speak more about this in a few minutes. Now, it's encouraging that the steps we have taken and continue to take to refocus IFF on bringing customers' leading innovation while driving healthy productivity are yielding encouraging results. We are making solid progress advancing the business-led refresh I've spoken about before, but we are not satisfied and we've got a lot more work to do. But, I've got confidence that we are on the right track toward achieving IFF's full potential. Moving to Slide 7. As I did last quarter, I would like to give a brief update on our progress as we work across the organization to refresh our strategy and focus on a business-led operating model. IFF has had a challenging last three years. Constraints on our balance sheet led the Company to underinvest in our core businesses and focused on divestitures. The Company was not structured to effectively navigate the complex and fast moving environment, and we underperformed relative to our peers. We have now had several quarters of growth as we have taken decisive actions to get our businesses back on-track. Our strategy moving forward will be driven by four key pillars: our people, our customer focus, our position as an innovation powerhouse and our operational excellence. We will engage and empower our people to deliver customer success while we drive profitable market share growth over time. We will also continue to develop sustainable new products and applications that are aligned with our customers' needs now and in the future, all while being relentless in our commitment to safety, quality and the efficiency in our operations. We have already taken several steps toward resetting and refocusing our operating model, including the announced divestiture of Pharma Solutions, which is still on-track to close in the first half of 2025, and our pivot to an end-to-end business-led operating model that will promote greater accountability and better performance. We are also working hard to improve employee engagement and are seeing positive results. Furthermore, each of our business units are building a five year strategic plan to define and close gaps where they exist versus best-in-class companies. These plans include executing a refreshed turnaround strategy for functional ingredients and leveraging health and biosciences' biotech expertise and capabilities across our Scent and Flavors platforms to enhance innovation and product development. Also, as mentioned last quarter, we are focusing on having lean corporate functions to support our business units with speed, agility and closer collaboration. Now, as we prioritize growth investments to our highest value businesses, such as Flavors, Scent and Health & Biosciences, we have already started to increase R&D and commercial investments. At the same time, we plan to increase our CapEx investments, targeting about 6% of sales for the next several years to bolster capacity and accelerate our digital transformation, including ERP implementation. We believe these investments will generate strong returns, providing us with incremental growth and efficiency opportunities that will lead us to continue to improve how we serve our customers profitably. Lastly, we are committed to delivering significant value creation for our shareholders. And with that in mind, we are on-track to achieve our raised guidance targets for the year as we continue to drive profitable growth across each of our businesses. I'll now pass it over to Glenn, for a closer look at our quarterly results, which demonstrate the continued progress and growth we are achieving. Glenn? Well, thank you, Glenn. As I shared at the top of the call, I am pleased with the team's solid performance throughout the first half of the year, especially as it represents a significant improvement over our prior year lows. We are moving on the right track because our teams around the world continue to relentlessly focus on efficiently meeting the needs of our customers, resulting in driving profitable growth. And, I'm energized by the progress we've made so far this year, yet I recognize that we have a lot more to do to achieve the full potential of this great company. Already, we are making progress to better meet our goals and by taking advantage of the market's tailwinds and increasing our investments in our high-growth businesses, we believe we will be positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over time. I want to especially thank the entire IFF team for delivering these results, including rallying behind our strategic refresh to advance our customer focused and innovation-led strategy. We want every IFFer to share the same passion and desire to help our customers differentiate and win in the marketplace. We are making much progress towards this goal. As I look ahead to the remainder of the year, we will remain steadfast in bringing new products and innovations to the market while simultaneously executing a turnaround strategy across our Functional Ingredients business, including with strong productivity initiatives. And, I'm confident the actions we're taking and the near-term operational priorities we are executing will create a stronger IFF. And with that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Right. Thanks for the question, Nicola. And, we're very excited about the increased investment in OpEx, as Glenn mentioned, $20 million to $30 million that we're putting into the Company this year to have impact in the coming years, \u201825, \u201826 and beyond. That includes, of course, R&D, and we're increasing R&D spend in both, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Flavors. And that includes, by the way, accelerating our transformation in biotech to come out with new fragrances and flavors with our biotech capabilities that will enhance our Scent and Flavors businesses. We're also increasing the R&D to find more naturals, both for Scent and for Flavors. Obviously, a great market trend towards naturals. We're leaders in that area, and we want to continue to strengthen our leadership position. Also across all three of those businesses, we're adding commercial capability. And, in our Functional Ingredients business, we're adding more technical service capability to better sell higher-value products that we have in our Functional Ingredients portfolio. On the OpEx or excuse me, on the CapEx side, we're adding capacity, especially in Health & Biosciences, but across all three of those high growth markets of businesses, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Flavors, to ensure that we always have very reliable, high-quality supply for all of our customers around the world for all those product lines. So, we're making significant investment now, and we'll continue to ramp that up in the coming years to ensure that we continue to profitably grow very aggressively those business units. Thank you. Yes. We're making a lot of really good progress, John. Thanks for the question. And, what I would say is that the clarity has been very well received by our people. And, I think that the uncertainty has been cleaned up. The business teams are getting put in place. They're very excited and very energized by the clarity of decision making, their ability to set strategy and then to execute all elements of the business from R&D, operations, commercial and all the functions to support that those gears working together to drive each of the business units. And, I can tell you that we're starting to feel the benefits of that by seeing the strategies being executed and being strengthened in terms of being able to take our innovation from R&D and get it through the creation and into commercial operations, produce it and then get it in there commercially. And, it'll take a while to fully drive the benefits, but we're starting to feel the strength and improvements in energy and ability to do that. The other thing that's really interesting here is with the focus business units having their strategy and by the way, from that comes the five year plan, which gives us more clarity on where we're investing. We're able to better differentiate between the units on where we put more of the investment and where we put less of the investment, where we need more productivity and where we need to focus that productivity to make sure that we're competitive cost wise and able to drive margins. And then also, as you get that clarity on each business unit, what they need to do to win, it also increases the ability of businesses to collaborate effectively. And so, that collaboration, the synergy is now much less driven corporately with corporate programs and lots of consultants and lots complexity and much more from the businesses where they know the customers and where that synergy, where that leverage makes sense. So, we're making good progress. And by the end of the year, we'll have all five units operating well, and that's when we'll start reporting the five business units. Yes, thanks for the question, very important. Let me start with the CapEx. So, we now with the strategic clarity with the business units, the clarity of our strategies, we know we have to spend more on growth investments to realize our growth ambitions, but we also have some foundational investments that we need to make that we're underinvested before in basic making sure that our plants are up to standards that we need to have them operate well, reliably with high-quality. We have some ERP investments that we need to make that are kind of that are foundational. But, on top of that, we have aggressive growth targets, and we're going to make sure that we've got the facilities to deliver on those growth targets. On the R&D spend, we are absolutely increasing R&D spend as a percentage of sales in our Health & Biosciences business and will increase the R&D spend in our Flavors and Scent businesses as we grow those businesses. And, I think that will be really important to ensure that we continue to strengthen those businesses and get the full benefit of their potential. On the Functional Ingredients side, it's heavily leaning towards making sure that we've got the right cost position, that we've got enough productivity to turn continue to turn around that business and get it on the right track and get it competitive with its competitive set. And, we're making good progress on that, by the way. And, part of that will involve consolidation of some of our manufacturing facilities, which will take some initial CapEx, but we'll have very, very high returns. And then finally, we are pushing strengthening our productivity across the Company. When we talk about empowered business units, each of the business units also has a productivity leader now that's focused on making sure that we're driving productivity within each business unit to be able to improve margins and invest more in innovation. And then, we're talking about lean corporate functions that effectively and efficiently support the business units. And, each of those corporate functions has a productivity lead to make sure that we're fully competitive on costs for our corporate functions. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think we're making good progress on transforming the business and getting it back healthy. We have achieved some significant volume recovery ahead of the market by going back to customers that we had before and making sure that they realize that we're serious about reliable supply, about serving them well, about making sure that we're very customer-focused, and that's played out well. We've had to make some price moves with the market as others have done as well, but that was as expected. Actually, has resulted in the combination of the productivity, aggressive productivity with some price giveback, we've still enabled us to achieve our margin goal margin improvement goals in that business. So, we're very much on-track. But, it is a combination of focusing on customers, really getting the clarity of strategy for the functional ingredients business, which we've been working hard on, which tells us where we focus our commercial efforts, what customers, what segments, what geographies and making sure that we're driving the volume so that our plants are operating well, plus a very aggressive approach on productivity to ensure that we've got competitive costs and are able to have the target margins that we want for that business. It's a work in progress. We've still got a lot of room to go. As Glenn mentioned, we've got another year plus to get back to where we believe that business should be. But, I'm very, very proud of the team and the progress that they're making. Great. Thanks for the question, David. First of all, I think there's increasing emphasis on healthy, health and gut health, which is great. And, the U.S. market particularly has rebounded and is picking up nicely. And as you know, we focused a lot recently on our finished format approach, which is working very well. I would also say that we've added significant commercial capability. Our team there has actually done a great job of bringing back some really strong sales people that left IFF in previous years and have now come back home, which is really helpful because it's great that they went out and thought that there were things were better, but now come back to IFF because they like what we're doing at IFF. And by the way, that's happening in some other areas as well. And then finally, the current performance is starting to turn and making some good progress. But, I got to tell you, we've got a very exciting pipeline in our Health business that I think will bode well for the coming years. Thanks for the question. And, what we're seeing from CPGs is that they want to strengthen their growth and profitable growth like we all do. And, the way we're hearing most about their strategy is to drive more innovation. And, that's terrific for us because we love working with our customers to enhance innovation. And, just a couple of examples of what's happening there. Obviously, the desire for better health and our ability to reduce sugar and salt content through modulation with our flavors in a way that gets you the same taste, but significantly lower sugar or salt levels is really strong and is one of the key drivers of our Flavors business, which is doing very well. We also, in the Scent business, are working with our Fine Fragrance customers, for example, to enhance the ability to trigger emotions that the fine fragrance companies want to have. Just an example of that is Charlotte Tilbury wanted to come out with a range of products that triggers different emotions for consumers. And, we used our AI tool, our IFF ScentCube algorithm, with her and her team to develop this line of fragrances that one product brings joy, another product brings energy, another product brings relaxation, another product brings romance, a whole slate of products, innovative products. But, if you go online on TikTok and you search for Charlotte Tilbury, she talks about how exciting it was to develop these great products, which are doing extremely well together with IFF to make them happen. And, then we're seeing other innovation, which helps to drive cost productivity, such as cocoa prices are very high. We have cocoa extender capabilities in our Flavors and our biosciences businesses that are helping companies reduce significantly the amount of cocoa they use but having the same exact same taste at lower cost. And, then one other example, I think, is really exciting is that we recently, with a very large global food company, developed and they have launched a lactose-free milk in China, where our enzymes take out the lactose and turn it into fiber and so you get lactose-free milk that is lower calorie and healthier for you. And as you know, there are many, many lactose intolerant consumers in China, so a big market. So, this focus on innovation and our ability to work with our customers to bring great innovation that helps them drive their growth profitably is really paying off. Thanks for the question. And absolutely, our plans are to continue to significantly strengthen our Health & Biosciences business, our Flavors and our Scent businesses. We see a lot of opportunity with organic investments, both in R&D, commercial capability, digital capability, as well as CapEx opportunities to expand capacity and make sure that we always have enough products to sell all around the world. And then also, I foresee us returning sometime next year to really looking at bolt on acquisition opportunities and collaboration opportunities with companies that bring complementary capabilities, especially technologies that would be useful for us. So, we will we're already working on our strategies, and you'll see us get more proactive in these areas. Yes. And I think if you look at my experience, which the last 16 years as a CEO, we've had a lot of positive experience with bolt on acquisitions that clearly fill a strategic gap and are integrated well, thoughtfully, carefully and done in a way that enhances the company's performance immediately, doesn't distract, doesn't take us backwards like you've seen that's happened over the last six years here. Just give you a couple of examples. So, the first step in our corporate ERP system development was implementing something called CFIN, our finance system, which we've done already. It's already in place. We've done the improvements, and it's getting better and better and enabling us to better do our closes with less people and less complexity and less corrections. The next step was just implemented in this past week called Workday for the HR systems. That's going as planned so far, going very fine. And then we'll do additional steps in the coming three years. So, we're doing it step by step to spread out the investment and spread out the manpower the focus required on it and to make sure that we do it well with minimum risk. Now on your second question, the way I would look at it, I've just been all around the world, and I've met with customers representing over a third, probably about 40% of our revenues with our people, and many of them top to top discussions with major global multinationals, regionals and locals, talking about what we do well, what we need to do better and how we can even more closely work together on innovation, cocreation of their product lines. And I tell you, I'm very excited about the desire of customers, global multinationals, regionals, locals to work with us, to tap into our innovation and our people capability to do that is really, really strong. And so what I believe is that our history with the large multinationals, our understanding of the markets around the world of what works has enhanced our ability to better serve them as we focus more on customers, as a core part of what we do in our innovation powerhouse, but also as we increase our commercial capability, better serve them and the regionals and the globals. We are focused right now on the divestiture of pharmaceuticals and doing that well. We're also going through this strategy refresh for each of our other businesses. And today, our total focus is on performance and performing those well, enhancing the growth rates of our Health & Biosciences, fragrances, Scent business and Flavors businesses and turning around our Functional Ingredients business. As I mentioned before, as we separate pharmaceuticals, we'll give you an update if there's any change in our strategy. But right now, we're totally focused on performing well in 2024 and strengthening for \u201825 and beyond. Just let me thank everybody for joining the call today. I'm very proud of our IFF team and the improvements that we're making to deliver not only today but to strengthen our innovation and our productivity and our customer focus to not only deliver in the second half but further strengthen for \u201825, \u201826 and beyond. So, thank you for your interest in IFF, and have a great day."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you, Erik, and thank you all for joining us today. As Erik noted, IFF had a strong second quarter. Revenue of just below $2.9 billion increased 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis with Scent, H&B and Nourish each growing revenue in the quarter. Volumes grew by high-single digits as our performance continued to improve sequentially across nearly every business. Our volume growth and strong gains from productivity initiatives together contributed to a 22% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA in the quarter. Our adjusted operating EBITDA margin improved by 310 basis points to 20.4% on a comparable basis, building off a strong first quarter and the first time we were over 20% since the third quarter of 2022. Turning to Slide 9. I'll dive a bit deeper into each of our segments. Nourish comparable currency neutral sales increased 4% and we delivered an adjusted operating EBITDA increase of 36% on a comparable basis. This was led by a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Flavors with improvements in both volume and pricing. Functional Ingredient sales declined modestly in the quarter as high-single digit volume growth was offset by lower pricing, consistent with plan. Both Flavors and Functional Ingredients demonstrated strong year-over-year gross margin expansion. The strong profitability in Nourish was driven by volume growth and productivity improvements as well as the comparison to the one-time Locust Bean Kernel inventory write-down in the year ago period. Health & Biosciences achieved strong growth in all businesses with a noteworthy uptick in health led by a strong performance in probiotics. H&B comparable currency neutral sales increased 9%, and we delivered comparable adjusted operating EBITDA of $165 million a 14% increase from a year ago. In Scent, double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance & Fragrance Ingredients led to a strong quarter for both revenue and profit growth. Fine Fragrance also remained strong, growing mid-single digits, led by new wins and volume gains. Net sales in the quarter were $603 million up 16% on a comparable currency neutral basis, and we delivered adjusted operating EBITDA of $137 million up 38% on a comparable basis. Lastly, Pharma Solutions returned to volume growth with revenue of $250 million. Profitability in this segment declined in-line with our plan as we managed through unfavorable mix and one-time items. Turning to Slide 10. Cash flow from operations totaled $336 million this quarter, while CapEx year-to-date was $200 million or roughly 3.5% of sales. For the year, we expect that CapEx will be approximately $575 million as we ramp up in the second half of the year. Our free cash flow position in Q2 totaled $136 million, an increase sequentially of approximately $150 million from last quarter and a significant increase from $85 million reported in the year ago period. We paid $309 million in dividends through the end of the second quarter, and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $674 million. IFF also continued to make progress towards achieving our deleveraging goals and reduced our gross debt by over $900 million from last quarter, yielding a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4x at quarter end compared with 4.4x at the end of the first quarter. This was driven by improved operational performance, including solid working capital management as well as the closure of our Cosmetic Ingredients divestiture, which occurred early in the second quarter. It's important to note that we remain committed to achieving our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of 3x or less following the completion of the divestiture of Pharma Solutions, which we continue to expect to be completed in the first half of 2025. On Slide 11, I'd like to turn to our consolidated outlook for \u201824, where we are raising both our sales and adjusted operating EBITDA guidance ranges, given our stronger than expected financial and operational performance in the first half of the year. We are now expecting net sales to be in the range of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion reflecting our expectation that volume growth will continue across the majority of our portfolio in the back half of the year, albeit at lower growth rates than the first half. Given the recent economic indicators and mixed results by CPG companies of late, we remain cautious relative to the outlook for demand in the balance of the year. Operating under this assumption, for the full-year, we now expect to achieve a 3% to 5% volume growth, up from our previously announced range of 0% to 3%. On the bottom line, we also raised our adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range to $2.1 billion to $2.17 billion up from our previously stated range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. This increase reflects our strong profitability performance in the first half of the year with a consistent view of the second half from our previously communicated guidance. It should be noted that we are also factoring in a greater level of annual incentive compensation given the relative strength of our performance versus budget and incremental second half spending related to business reinvestment. Specifically, as part of our strategy refresh, the team has identified investments that will accelerate the execution of our strategy, focus in business development, R&D and innovation that will yield results in 2025 and 2026. Based on current market exchange rates, we expect that FX will be closer to a 4% adverse impact to sales growth within our 3% to 4% range given. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $520 million to $540 million. I'll now turn back to Erik, for closing remarks. Hey, good morning, Josh. Thanks for the questions. I'll start with your second one and then we'll come back to the EBITDA question. We are expecting more modest volume growth in the second half of the year, specifically in the fourth quarter. We are forecasting about a 4% volume uplift year-over-year in Q3 and flattish in Q4. As a reminder, last year sequentially was negative 7%, negative 11%, negative 7% and negative 3%. We are somewhat sort of cautious on Q4, combination of, the overlap from last year and then secondarily, the end consumer continues to be very, very unique and the economic indicators, as you're well aware, are probably more negative now than they were a few months ago. So, that's what's driving sort of the volume expectations. The EBITDA first half versus second half is really a reflection of lower revenues in the second half. Big portion of that is seasonal. We expect that basically we will be about $400 million less revenue based on our guide in the second half of the year, than in the first half of the year. That is notably $300 million in the fourth quarter, which is always our seasonally our lowest. So, that really drives the vast majority of the change in the first half versus the second half. I will also add that we are investing about $20 million to $30 million incremental OpEx in the back half of the year. Given the performance this year, we want to reinvest to begin to accelerate growth for \u201825 and \u201826. So, that's another piece of the equation. Good morning, Kristen. Thank you for the question. What we're seeing is actually no incremental improvement in the consumer. So, I know everyone sort of tracks what's happening, but neither food and beverage, [H&B] (ph) really are showing any strengthening the market. So, our volume growth we believe is a function of two things. First of all, the lack of destocking from prior year. So, it was pretty significant as you know in the first half of the year. We do not see any restocking at this point in time. I would note that Pharma's destocking lagged a bit. And all the other businesses we think were largely done at the end of last year. Pharma, largely done at the end of this quarter, so that we see the volume of trajectory for Pharma improving going forward. We also track very closely our volume performance vis-a-vis our key competitors by segment. And, we're pleased in terms of where we are generally performing at or better across the entire Board. And, we believe it's really a function of sort of three things. One is, as Erik mentioned, the innovation focus. We've increased our intensity relative to our innovation pipeline. Secondarily, our sales pipeline, we spent a lot of energy to rebuild our pipeline and really accelerate our ability to win new business and win back business. And then third, I would have a special call out for the Ingredients business. Ingredients business has actually come back very strongly based on the remediation efforts that we launched last year into this year. Part of that, as a reminder, is taking some of the deflation that business has experienced in reinvesting in pricing at the start of the year and that's actually played out very well. We had about 7%, 8% plus volumes in the ingredients business in the second quarter alone. So, that's how we sort of characterize. Again, we're confident in terms of what we can control, but the market continues to give us pause because we're just not seeing so lot of strength in the consumer. Hey, good morning, Patrick. Thanks for the question. We are still guiding to the full-year of $600 million. As a reminder, when we started the year, it was $500 million. We upped our guidance to $600 million the last quarter, in part to reflect we were pointing towards the higher end of our previous guidance. We are expecting earnings to be up, as we mentioned, with the higher guidance. There will be slightly higher working capital. As the businesses are growing, basically have to make sure our inventories are in the right position to continue to support it. I would note that that $600 million of free cash flow includes roughly $350 million of Reg G items. Those are largely related to transactions, taxes, implementation costs, fees, etcetera. So, adjusting for that, taking the Reg G cost out for more like [$9.50] (ph) for the year, which is very consistent with what we guided previously as well. Hey, thanks, Mike, and good morning. Yes, relative to Functional Ingredients, not only is the topline performing well, the gross profit and our EBITDA trajectory is actually progressing very nicely against expectations. So, for the second quarter alone, on a like-for-like basis, including normalizing for the LBK write-off last year, so if you normalize for that, we were up about 250 basis points in terms of gross margin, which is consistent from the first quarter as well and consistent with where we think the full-year is going to be. As we mentioned last year, the business had dropped to high-single digit EBITDA margin. Our goal has been to get it to basically mid-teens. We are tracking well to be low teens this year. Generally, the volume recovery, the sales pipeline, the innovation recovery is performing very well. The last set of initiatives are really focused on the cost structure of our global manufacturing footprint. We've begun to implement some of those initiatives in the second half of the year, but they're going to fully begin to kick in next year 2025. So, a lot of work to do. We've actually put a lot of effort against that business, but we have another sort of full-year plus to sort of get the business back to where we think we are, but good progress today. Thanks, Mike. Hey, good morning, Mark. Thanks for the questions. Q4, we have very little visibility at this point in time. We have a very good view towards the third quarter book. Obviously, July is in the bank, and we have a good view to the current month and then September. So, there's not a lot of data points at this point in time to sort of give us any direction on Q4. Beyond, we are overlapping an improvement from prior year. So, we're negative 7% in Q3 of last year versus negative 3%. And again, we do think that the consumer dynamics basically suggest that end market demand will be flattish. We don't see restocking happening either. We think that the CPG firms are conservative. They're not going to restock until they see a strength in the market. So, all those factors basically just make us cautious on the fourth quarter until we begin to see the order book emerge. One off is a good question. The annual incentive plan is a very significant variable this year out of plan. Because of the very strong performance across all of our businesses, we are accruing an incremental $100 million this year of AIP. That's actually $140 million aggregate versus prior year. So, think about our guide of $2.1 million to $2.17 million that includes $100 million that will be normalized for next year as you just go into next year and get back to 100% sort of payout from standpoint. That's the most significant there really are -- there's always puts and takes and other items relative to where we are, but that's probably the most significant item by far within our P&L. Thank you. Yes. I think it's also important to emphasize given, I'll say, our jaded history here relative to acquisitions is we feel like we have a phenomenal portfolio in place. We're going to prioritize the organic. And as Erik mentioned, the focus really is on bolt-ins, small acquisitions that provide either a complementary technology, a geographic strength, etcetera, as a way to continue to progress the business. At this point, anything large would be completely out of the question. Great. So, let me take the first question first and just tell you that we are taking an ERP approach that is very step by step and very careful to minimize wasted investment and also to minimize risk of implementation. If I could just add two comments. So, we will be converting we're currently on three incidences of SAP. We will be converting them probably over the next five years into a single pipe, if you will. We will be leveraging one of the legacy IFF pipe, if you will. That's going to be approximately $250 million over that five year period to get that done. It's very important to also add to Erik's comments is we actually have already separated one of our ERPs, we're on four a little over a year ago with a divestiture basically of our microbial control business and we want to get basically pharma out of the way before we sort of launch on the ERP conversion. So, think about this the second half of the year, once pharma is done, we'll be in a good shape. It's about $50 million a year over the next five years. Excuse me, the regionals and the locals, which will enhances our ability to drive our growth rates ahead of the market. And that's a core part of our strategies for each of our business units. Yes. Good morning, Lauren. We actually did provide outlook for Q3. So, we guided top line of $2.75 to $2.85 and then relative to EBITDA $5.20 to $5.40 for the quarter. So, that's the outlook for the quarter. Relative to progression on gross margin for the balance of the year, we had more significant upside in the first half of the year because of absorption LBK and other items. We still are forecasting a solid improvement year-over-year in terms of our gross margin for the second half of the year. And, it's going to be driven by volumes won't be quite up as much. So, that's a little bit of let's say a difference versus the first half. But, the productivity programs are continuing to deliver consistently quarter-to-quarter in the second half versus the first half. The net raw material basket is generally flattish in terms of where we are running from the first half to the second half going. So, we don't really see any significant upsides relative to that nor do we see downside at this point in time. So, hopefully that's helpful. Sequentially, yes. So I'll answer. Our total net price in the business largely concentrated in Functional Ingredients is around 2.5% in the first half of the year versus prior. That's equivalent to basically the reduction in raw materials year-over-year. So, we basically use that to reinvest. Again, that's largely concentrated in Functional Ingredients. So, the other businesses are relatively flat year-over-year from a raw material standpoint. July started off well. I would note that we have a very good start of the quarter. However, Jeff, in the last two quarters, the pattern has been a very, very strong first month and then it diminishes second and third, generally the third month of the quarter, and this is our outlook, tends to be the softest. We believe is this is just consistent with our customers sort of managing their inventories tighter at the end of the quarter. So a good, good start in terms of July, but that's been consistent with what we've seen as a pattern in the last couple of quarters."

        "content": "Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IFF first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to introduce Michael DeVeau, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. \nMichael Deveau: Thank you. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Welcome to IFF's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. A copy of the release can be found on our IR website at ir.iff.com. Please note that this call is being recorded live and will be available for replay. \n During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's performance and outlook. These statements are based on how we see things today and contain elements of uncertainty. For additional information concerning the factors that can cause actual results to differ materially, please refer to our cautionary statement and risk factors contained in our 10-K and press release. \n Today's presentation will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude those items that we believe affect comparability. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective GAAP measures is set forth in the press release that we issued yesterday. \n With me on the call today is our CEO, Erik Fyrwald; and our Executive Vice President, CFO and Business Transformation Officer, Glenn Richter. We will begin with prepared remarks and then take any questions you have at the end. \n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Erik. \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Well, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today to discuss our solid performance in the first quarter and what we are seeing across the business so far this year. Today, we'll focus on our financial results, our outlook for the balance of the year and our increased confidence in our reiterated guidance, where we now see us trending toward the upper end. \n Now before moving forward, I want to acknowledge Glenn, who today is announcing his plan to retire at the end of 2024 after 3 successful years with the company. During his tenure, Glenn has driven multiple actions to improve our balance sheet and position the company for financial success. We've benefited from his experience and commitment to transformation and his ongoing leadership to position IFF to drive long-term profitable market share growth. He has also been very helpful to me already as I've come on to the IFF team. \n Now with this announcement, we have started a succession plan to evaluate internal and external candidates to succeed Glenn. The Board and I are grateful for all Glenn has helped IFF accomplish and look forward to his continued leadership as we identify a successor and ensure a smooth transition. \n Now turning to Slide 6. We are off to a good start at IFF. We achieved volume growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2022 as volumes grew mid-single digit in the first quarter of 2024 with strong contributions from Scent, Nourish and Health & Biosciences. We are also encouraged by the double-digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth as we not only benefited from volume growth but also from productivity gains across our businesses. \n At the same time, we made important progress focusing our portfolio with closing the divestiture of the cosmetics ingredients business and the announced sale of our Pharma Solutions business. We expect to complete the pharma transaction in the first half of 2025. The proceeds from these divestitures will help further strengthen our capital structure, address our deleveraging goal of 3x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA and refocus us on high-growth areas of our business. \n With our solid performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of 2024 and now expect full year 2024 results to trend toward the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges. It's still early in the year and there's a lot more work to be done, but we are focused on building on our momentum to energize our team and return to sustainable profitable growth. \n Turning to Slide 7. Let me take a step back for a moment and share what I've learned during my first 90 days here at IFF. Now I've spent time getting to know our teams all over the world and meeting with many of our customers. And I'm grateful for the productive discussions. \n And what I found is that IFF has lots of top talent and incredible innovation capabilities. But we're not yet realizing our full potential. With a new leadership perspective on our priorities and a renewed focus on execution by our executive leadership team, we are getting back to basics, and I'm optimistic about what we will do from here. \n First, we are strengthening our balance sheet and capital structure to create the flexibility we need to achieve our long-term goals. My assessment is we have not consistently delivered on our financial commitments largely due to a need for more strategic and organization operating model clarity to enable us to better execute against our goals. \n I think we are now getting the clarity we need and have taken some decisive steps in the first quarter to help us start to realize more of our potential. We recently rightsized our quarterly dividend to align with the market and our long-term cash flow generation and have made divestiture moves, including cosmetics and Pharma Solutions, to focus our portfolio and drive debt reduction. \n We also recently announced and are implementing our refocused IFF operating model, which is now business-led, supported by lean functions. This includes the appointment of Ana Paula Mendon\u00e7a, who has dedicated her career to the advancement of fragrance at IFF, as the President of Scent. This enables Simon Herriott to focus his full attention on driving profitable growth in our Health & Biosciences business unit. We will also put more focus on our Flavors and Functional Ingredients units within our Nourish division. \n With this operating model change, we have also changed the reporting structure of several of our functions, including R&D, operations, finance and HR, to go directly into our business unit presidents, so they have the full end-to-end responsibility and accountability for business execution. Their goals will include delivering growth above market with a margin structure that gets us in line with or better than leading peers. \n Now to make this work, we have also established an operating system which is a simple set of management processes that collectively define how IFF makes decisions and creates value, provides a framework for standardized processes, responsibilities and metrics and defines the tools to help managers drive continuous improvement. We believe this will create greater visibility to track performance, so we drive execution to deliver results in the current period in ways that strengthen us for the coming years. \n We are also introducing an operating philosophy based on four main pillars: number one, customer focus to drive profitable market share growth; number two, innovation powerhouse to create sustainable new products and other innovations customers value and do this faster; number three, operational excellence to lead our relentless focus on safety, quality, continuous improvement and competitive cost structures; and four, people, people who are engaged across the organization. \n We expect that our business-empowered model and operating system will enhance collaboration to profitably win with customers, and by doing so, deliver strong financial performance over time. And while it's still early, I am pleased and encouraged by the energy and commitment of our teams all around the world. \n With that, I'll now pass it over to Glenn to dive deeper into our results for the first quarter. Glenn? \nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Erik, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Erik mentioned earlier, we're encouraged by the momentum across our business as we start the year, and we are excited to continue to build on these positive early signals throughout 2024 and beyond. \n In the first quarter, IFF generated roughly $2.9 billion in sales. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, sales increased 5% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly revenue performance was led by mid-single-digit volume growth with sequential improvements across most of our businesses, including Scent, Health & Biosciences and Nourish. \n Pricing was modestly positive, inclusive of FX-related pricing in emerging markets, in particular the Argentine peso, where we, like the industry, have indexed pricing to U.S. and/or euro exchange rates that drive pricing changes. Absent of this benefit, pricing would have been negative in the quarter, largely in line with our plan. \n We delivered strong profitability in the quarter with adjusted operating EBITDA of $578 million. This represents a 20% increase on a comparable year-over-year basis, led by volume growth and the contribution from productivity initiatives. As a result, margins improved by approximately 310 basis points to nearly 20% adjusted operating margin in the quarter. \n Turning now to Slide 9. I'll dive deeper into the business performance across our segments. In Nourish, sales increased by 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with strong double-digit growth in Flavors with improvements in both volume and price. And we saw very strong growth in our Flavors business across nearly all markets. \n Functional Ingredients volume was up low single digits, the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall, comparable currency-neutral sales declined year-over-year due to our planned pricing actions. In terms of profitability, productivity gains and volume growth drove a 13% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA with solid gross margin improvements in both Flavors and Functional Ingredients. \n Our Health & Biosciences segment had another strong quarter with both top and bottom line growth. Solid performance in our H&B portfolio, led by double-digit sales growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition and Grain Processing and mid-single-digit growth in Home & Personal Care, drove a 6% increase in comparable currency-neutral sales. Improved volume and productivity gains led to a 21% increase in year-over-year comparable adjusted operating EBITDA. \n Scent delivered another excellent quarter, including 16% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance and Fragrance Ingredients and mid-single-digit growth in Fine Fragrances. The segment also excel in terms of profitability, primarily led by volume growth and productivity improvements, which delivered an outstanding adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 55% on a comparable basis. \n Lastly, in Pharma Solutions, while we saw some improvements from productivity initiatives, these were offset by lower volumes driven as expected due to continued destocking trends, which began late last year. It's worth noting that part of the destocking trend in the first quarter was market-related and the other is due to Pharma Solutions' initiative to reduce reliance on distributors and convert more of its core excipients business into a direct distribution model. \n We believe the shift to a more direct approach will enhance our customer relationships, reduce supply chain complexity and provide greater access to technical resources while also improving margins. Also, as mentioned, we agreed to divest the Pharma Solutions business as part of our portfolio optimization efforts and are confident the business will be positioned to thrive and succeed in partnership with Roquette. \n Now on Slide 10, I'd like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position. Cash flow from operations totaled $99 million this quarter while CapEx was $118 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. In the first quarter, normal seasonality impacted our free cash flow results. As a reminder, Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year as we make annual cash bonus payments in March. \n Our free cash flow position totaled negative $19 million in the quarter versus negative $48 million in the year-ago period. We also paid $207 million in dividends through the end of the first quarter. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $764 million, including $32 million in assets held for sale. \n IFF continues to make progress in our deleveraging efforts and reduced our gross debt by almost $1 billion versus year ago for a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4x at quarter end. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion. \n Please note that the proceeds from the sale of LMC of $810 million were received in April and consequently not reflected in the quarterly results. With the announced Pharma Solutions transaction, we are confident that we will achieve our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of 3x following the transaction close, which we expect will be completed in the first half of 2025. \n On Slide 11, I'd like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Based on our improved financial and operational performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic about the year ahead and, as Erik mentioned, now expect results to trend towards the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges. This reflects our belief that volumes will also be towards the high end of our previously announced 0% to 3% with improving trends across the majority of our portfolio. \n We also saw pricing increases due to FX-related pricing in emerging markets in the first quarter, and therefore, raised our previously announced pricing guidance to approximately 1% for the full year 2024 versus previous expectation that pricing would decline approximately 2.5%. With these foreign exchange rate changes, we now expect currency will have an adverse impact of 3% to 4% versus 0% to 1% as previously expected on our sales growth, which is essentially offsetting the FX pricing contribution. \n On the bottom line, for 2024, we are now trending towards the high end of our previously announced adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. This assumes continued improvements in volumes as well as strong productivity. While it is still early in the year, volume trends are encouraging, and consequently, we have increased confidence in our ability to achieve our full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion, driven by improved volumes with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $500 million to $525 million. \n I'll now turn it back to Erik for closing remarks. \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Thank you, Glenn. Now as I shared at the top of the call, my first 90 days on Team IFF have been energizing as I see so much potential. We have great talent and capabilities across our global teams, and our solid top and bottom line results from the first quarter show that we are building positive momentum. And it's an honor to lead IFF during this transformative time, and I am encouraged by our positive start to the year and our outlook. \n Yet we still have a lot of work to do. As the market continues to be very competitive, we are committed to bringing products and innovation that differentiate us from our peers and give customers what they need to win and, in turn, helps them and us drive sustainable profitable growth. And with a solid start to the year, I'm excited to see what we can accomplish going forward. \n And with that, I'd like to now open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. \nMatthew Hettwer: This is Matthew Hettwer on for Kevin. It's nice to see a strong start to the year. Erik, could you give us some additional context and detail regarding how you've seen the individual businesses react to your new operating philosophy through the first 90 days? \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matthew. As you probably know, I've been on a listening tour or a discussion tour since right after the January 11 announcement of the change of my joining IFF. And it's been really great to hear from our employees all around the world and our customers all around the world. And what I've discerned from that is that we've had multiple companies coming together with different operating models, different philosophies. \n And there was significant uncertainty about the organization structure and how we were going to do things. And what we've done is the executive leadership team has come together very nicely, and I'm very proud of the team, and we've been able to together clarify the structure and operational model that we have going forward and the four pillars that we're focused on to drive our performance. \n We've had town halls all around the world, both live and by video. We've touched all our employees. We've spent special time with our leadership. And I think we've gotten really clear on how we're moving the company forward. And what I love about it is I feel the engagement of our people around the world. I feel their energy growing. \n I think there's great acceptance and enthusiasm for the empowered business unit model, for the focus on customers that the job of all of us is to support our teams to win with customers and help us profitably grow our market share and then also drive our innovation that, at the core, we're an innovation company, and we need to make sure that we have leading innovation that we're bringing to our customers, and it's innovation that customers value. \n And then finally, that we also have healthy productivity, productivity that helps us strengthen the company and invest more in growth and in innovation and doing that with smart productivity, things like reducing consultants, reducing layers, driving functional shared service centers, where it makes sense, using technology, information technology. So my feeling is that there's great capabilities, great people in this company. And the executive leadership team is coming together to try and do all we can to unleash that full potential of our people all around the world. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. \nMing Tang: Firstly, Erik, you talked there about sort of the change in operating model. Can you talk a little bit about portfolio? And following the announcement to divest Pharma Solutions, do you intend to pursue any further divestments? Or is that it for now? \n And then if I could squeeze in another one for Glenn on cash flow, are you still confident in your free cash flow target of $500 million for the year or $700 million on an adjusted basis? And is there potentially upside, given the upward revision, was it the high end, that you see in terms of the EBITDA guidance? And could you explain what drove the increase in trade receivables in the quarter? \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Okay. I'll start and then hand it over to Glenn. And thanks for the question, Nicola -- or questions. So on the portfolio, first of all, the Pharma Solutions business will be with us for another year. And we see a lot of opportunity to further strengthen the performance of Pharma Solutions over the next year and then beyond that with Roquette. \n But then we have the other four business units that we're going to really focus on driving forward, of course, with Nourish, both the Flavors and the Functional Ingredients. We have the Scent business and we have the Health & Biosciences business. All our focus now is on supporting those businesses to perform well, to drive profitable market share growth, to drive healthy productivity, to make sure that we're bringing leading innovation and deliver the best performance we can in the second quarter, full year 2024, but do it in ways that strengthen us for '25 and beyond. \n We're also going through a strategy review process for each of the businesses. And we'll take a look at what it takes to win in each of those businesses in the coming years and what we have to do investment-wise and making sure that each of the businesses has the right portfolio to win going forward. So you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters and years. But right now, our focus is all on making sure we've got the right strategy, the right capabilities in each business, the right collaboration, culture across businesses and are winning with customers by bringing leading innovation. Glenn? \nGlenn Richter: Thanks, Erik. Thanks for the question, Nicola. We're actually trending more favorable in terms of our full year outlook for free cash flow and adjusted as well. As mentioned, a combination of earnings momentum -- actually, working capital is actually performing better than planned, and we expect actually some improvement and then just some timing on taxes. We're probably going to be closer to $600 million versus the $500 million. \n I would note that, that also includes higher Reg G costs related to pharma. So we gave you a $200 million number in Feb that did not include pharma for obvious reasons. The heavy lifting, as Erik mentioned, is the balance of this year separating systems, legal entities, et cetera. That's roughly about $100 million. So on an adjusted basis, $900 million on a free cash flow reported basis, directionally, $600 million. Thanks for the question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. \nJoshua Spector: I wanted to ask on your expectations of volume cadence. I mean, clearly, very strong first quarter, so congrats on that. But I think some of the comps on a year-over-year basis actually get a bit easier. So is there something you'd call out that you would say is a headwind we should consider? Or would you characterize your view as just conservatism? \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Thanks, Josh. And let me start and then Glenn can give you more details. But as I see it, still fairly new coming into the company, clearly, CPG company volumes are still soft in the U.S. and the EU. And so we can't expect a whole lot of market tailwind growth. I do think we've seen the end of most of the destocking outside of Pharma Solutions. And Glenn alluded to the Pharma Solutions destocking, both a market destocking and our change in channel strategy. But bottom line is we can expect a lot of growth from the marketplace, although there are some emerging markets that we're going after that are seeing very attractive volume growth. \n But overall, our focus has to be growth through bringing leading innovation and winning business with customers. And I've heard a lot already about commercial projects that we're winning. But we're also going to increase the focus and understanding the projects that we didn't win. Why didn't we win them? What does it take for us to be even more successful with our customers and win even more projects and bring that leading innovation so that customers are growing their market share profitably and we're growing with them? Glenn? \nGlenn Richter: Thanks, Erik. Again, Josh, I think, as Erik mentioned, until we see a strengthening in the consumer environment, which has yet to appear, and until we have a few more months underneath our belts, it's sort of hard for us to be sort of incredibly optimistic on the second half. As a reference point, the first half volumes of circa 4% to 5% and the second half, basically 1% to 2%. \n As a reminder, the first half of last year, because of the aggressive destocking, was down 9% and the second half, down 5%. So a little bit of it is the lapping as well as we sort of think about providing guidance. But I think the end market, as Erik said, we need to see greater strength there before we're sort of more confident in higher volume growth in the second half. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. \nMichael Sison: Really nice start to the year. When I think about the first quarter EBITDA run rate and EBITDA margins, really good improvement of 20%. Guidance would sort of imply that the levels fall sequentially. So any sort of one-time positives during the first quarter that wouldn't reoccur? And just curious if demand and volume levels remain here, why wouldn't EBITDA margin stay sort of in this 20% range for the rest of the year? And congrats on retirement, Glenn. \nGlenn Richter: Thank you, Mike. So good question. So 20% for Q1, sort of the implied balance of the year is around 18.5%. That 150 basis points of change, half of that is related to volume and mix, inclusive of LMC. So LMC, you take out about $12 million per quarter and about $25 million of revenue. So it's relatively high margin. So everything normalized, that gets you from the 20% down to basically 19% in a quarter. \n The residual 75 basis points really is a little bit more net price-to-cost realization in Q1 versus the forecast and then just some timing of expenses. But to answer your direct question, if volumes were to maintain, then we should be somewhere in the 19%, probably 19%-plus range, for the balance of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Eric Zhang ] on for Patrick. What are your expectations for price/cost for the full year? The price guide seems to be a bit -- seems to be a small net positive if you net out FX. Are there any areas where you're getting structural pricing? Or is this just less giveback than you expected? \nGlenn Richter: Yes, Eric, you're right. I mean, the full year, we're expecting a small net positive, as I mentioned, little more biased towards Q1 than the balance of the year. Our pricing actions, which were largely givebacks this year, were highly focused in the Functional Ingredients space. We are tracking well against the expectations that we set for the year. We do believe that the improved performance in the business is in part related to these pricing actions on top of the other actions. And we don't see sort of any additional kind of pricing for the balance year at this point in time. \n And then in general, if we look at sort of the inflationary environment for the balance of the year, it's pretty stable. I think commodities are flattish to maybe a tad up. Generally, energy is trending down, particularly in Europe. And logistics is trending slightly up, particularly ocean freight, given what's happening in the Red Sea. But generally, stability and, as we mentioned, a little more positive net price in the first quarter than the balance of the year. Thank you, Eric. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. \nDavid Begleiter: Erik, does the improvement in Functional Ingredients market turn in this business? And looking forward, can the entirety of this business return to prior level of sales and earnings? Or is there some portion of business that will not due to low-cost Asian competition? \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Thanks for the question, David, and glad to be back with you again after some years. Absolutely, it marks the beginning of improvement in the Functional Ingredients business and very pleased to see that after a long, tough spell. And what I would say is that we are putting more focus on the Functional Ingredients business. And I'm very pleased to see the start of what the team are working really hard to make a sustained turnaround.\n And in addition to better execution, which is happening, we are doing a strategy refresh and looking at all the product families and our systems approach across the Functional Ingredients business. And we are focused very much right now on delivering a strong improvement in 2024 but also what it takes to make sure that, that improvement continues into 2025, starting with the second quarter '24, then the third quarter, but the full year of this year, but doing -- making sure that we're doing the right things to strengthen for '25 and beyond. \n And you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters. But it is the start of a turnaround. I'm very pleased with the progress that the team is making, the actions they're taking both with customers and on productivity. And we'll see how good we can do in '24 and then we'll focus on 25, but making progress. \nGlenn Richter: Yes. And I would just add to that, David, as we've mentioned in the past, we've stated we didn't think we're going to get to sort of full recovery until '25. We're pleased by the start of this year. A lot of the service elements are 100% back to where they should be. Pricing actions have been effective, more innovation in the pipeline.\n The last piece of the equation is on the cost side. And we're going through a very extensive review of our manufacturing and procurement operations. That probably will be implemented late this year into early next year as the final piece to get to the margin structure in terms of where we need to be. Thanks for the question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. \nAdam Samuelson: Would love to get your perspective on volume trends by region in the first quarter and if there's anything you would call out as notable areas of outsized strength or weakness versus the portfolio as a whole up mid-single digits. And I think we could probably exclude pharma from that discussion. And again, given that first quarter performance, is there anything where the regional performance would differ materially kind of over the balance of the year? \nGlenn Richter: Adam, good question. Regionally, we have seen greater strength in the combination of Asia and LatAm, so more of the emerging markets from a volume standpoint and sort of across the board, generally a little softer in North America and in EMEA. That's probably not dissimilar than what others are seeing in the marketplace.\n If we look by business, Scent had a phenomenal start to the year, 9%-plus volumes, Nourish and H&B in the 4% range. As we think about the balance of the year, we're not planning on Scent continuing at these very, very high levels, so some softening from these and then a little bit softer for H&B and Nourish and then pharma actually improving because they were down about 9% in Q1 and actually getting to flattish as we move into Q2 and the balance of the year. But generally, where we're seeing the regional balance, more emerging market, we're expecting that to continue at least through the second quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. \nJohn Roberts: Best wishes, Glenn, thanks for all your help. Erik, IFF has had more opportunities than most companies to promote from within for the CEO and CFO positions. Do you think there's anything that needs to change in the organization to develop a deeper bench, so the C-suite transitions are smoother? Or is there just a culture on the Board to look outside for C-suite positions? \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Well, thanks for the question, John. And I think it's a really important one. To me, the most important thing we do as leaders is make sure that we have the right talent in the company, that we develop the right talent and we give them the opportunities through promotion to continue to advance their careers. And so I always prefer internal promotions. But sometimes external talent needs to come in to fill gaps or when we don't have the right talent inside.\n But I can tell you that, like at Syngenta, I very much want to have my successor come from inside when I do retire at some point. And also, I'll just point out that the one significant executive leadership change that we've made so far was Ana Paula Mendon\u00e7a being promoted to run the Scent division as President of Scent. And if you look at her background and if you talk to the people across the company and customers, there was great enthusiasm for her promotion, and I like that. So I will continue to work with the executive leadership team and with the Board to make sure that we're developing the right talent inside the company to make sure that we promote from within wherever we can. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. \nGhansham Panjabi: I guess, Erik, first off, on the -- as you sort of meet with customers and go on your listening tour, et cetera, how would you sort of objectively assess the moats of the residual businesses that are going to be part of IFF going forward? And then just related to that, in terms of Scent, what did drive the first quarter in terms of high performance, especially Consumer Fragrances? Was that sort of share gains? And if it was, what was that driven by? \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Thanks, [ Laurence ]. It's also good to be back with you. We had some history that dates back quite a ways. The way I would say it is that in the businesses that are remaining, we've got a lot of great innovation capability and a lot of really terrific people that understand customers, have consumer insight capability. So we have the people and the capabilities, including the innovation capabilities, to be very successful.\n And what I would say is -- and even talking to our people but also our customers, we haven't realized our full potential. And that's what it's about. It's the leadership team working to unleash the full potential by making things, decision-making clear, by having businesses be end-to-end, be able to drive clarity in their strategy and then clarity in their execution, but at the same time, having a collaborative culture so that we can collaborate across businesses, wherever it makes sense, to enhance our ability to bring solutions to customers or to drive healthy productivity. \n And so I believe that we're doing well with that, but we've got a lot more potential to unleash. And I think if you talk to people across the company, I think you'll find a lot of enthusiasm about what IFF is doing and what more we can do going forward.\n Specifically on Scent, I think Scent has been a unit that has stayed focused largely on customers, that has brought a lot of innovation to customers. I've spent a lot of time with the perfumers in this company. We've got world-class perfumers. And I just am so proud to be part of this company with such great perfumers that our customers value. I've spent time with CEOs of leading CPG companies that have named our perfumers by name because they're so important to their success. \n And so making sure that we're bringing not only our perfumers but the whole team around the perfumers to help co-create great new fragrances and fine fragrances or great new consumer products, whether they're shampoos or detergents, laundry detergents or dishwash detergents or floor cleaners or body wash, whatever it is, the scent, I've learned, is such a critical part of the success of the consumer product.\n And our great perfumers and the teams around them, bringing great scent technology and great formulations to help the customers develop leading consumer products, has really been what's driven the growth. So I expect under Ana's leadership and with the super team that she's got, I expect that continued strong performance to continue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. \nSalvator Tiano: If I remember correctly, you had talked about $150 million productivity gains for the year. So can you talk a little bit -- can you quantify what was the benefit in Q1? What do you expect for the rest of the year? And given obviously the strong gains in the first quarter, is this number upsized for the rest of the year? \nGlenn Richter: Good question, Salvator. We are trending at around $200 million full year in terms of productivity and, hence, some of our commentary about guiding towards the higher range of our EBITDA guide. And that's about $50 million per quarter. So it's fairly ratable in terms of kind of the achievement. I would note, as we've said in previous calls, we have made tremendous progress with our operations and procurement leadership teams in really driving a very disciplined approach that is taking cost out, everything from SKU rationalization to literally looking plant-by-plant in terms of best practices. And behind that -- and by the way, there's plenty of additional opportunities. As I mentioned, we're taking a [ zero-based ] approach to our ingredients platform, which will provide additional opportunities. \n And behind that, we've really been looking at opportunities within RSA that have been focused on leveraging our global shared services, really focusing on our indirect spend, so getting every dollar out we need and then continuing to advance technology as a way to basically automate eliminate work. So that piece of it is actually picking up speed as well. So we feel very good about $200 million. And I would suggest, as we look out into the future, we're going to continue to deliver pretty strong productivity numbers. Thanks for the question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa De Neve with Morgan Stanley. \nLisa Hortense De Neve: Congratulations on the strong first quarter. My first question, so with the announcement of the pharma division, which is expected to complete in the first half of next year, can you just share where you see potential scope for optimizing your balance sheet position and maybe where you see some debt that could be reduced or be up for redemption or that may not require any refinancing?\n And then I'm going to sneak in a second question. So during the presentation, you mentioned that your finance and HR departments, amongst others, are now directly feeding into your divisions. Can you shed some light on their compensation structure of the variable pay they may or may not receive and what key KPIs they have to deliver on this? \nGlenn Richter: Sure. Lisa, this is Glenn. So we're in the early innings of deciding sort of our liability management strategy. As you know, we will bring in circa net proceeds of $2.4 billion from pharma. Coincidentally, we have maturities cumulatively for '25 and '26 that are $2.4 billion. But we're actually taking a more holistic look, and we're actually going to be balancing the trade-off between interest cost savings, notional debt repayment, so how we think about basically bringing in some of the cheaper debt, as well as refinancing risk. \n So we'll think about bringing some towers down as part of that. So there'll be more to come as we get closer to finalizing the close of the deal. But we are sort of thinking about not just the immediate maturities but how to optimize the structure going forward. So with that, Erik, I'm happy to take the next question. Do you want to take the next question? \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Yes. So on the functions feeding into the business units, reporting into the business units, it's clearly being done so that the business units can drive their performance. And there will be no changes to the 2024 plan because everybody is set and clear about it and we're not making changes. \n But effective in 2025, those functions that we're reporting corporately that will be reporting into the business units will be incentivized on the business unit performance. As a large part of their incentives, they also, of course, continue to have a corporate element to encourage overall corporate performance and collaboration across business units. And the more senior level the people are, the more their corporate component.\n But clearly, what we want to drive is business unit alignment and everybody on that business team driving their business unit's performance but also collaborating to enhance their business unit's performance and the total company performance. I would also say that there will continue to be corporate functional leadership that ensure that we're doing functional best practices across the business units and that each of the functional people have great career opportunities across the company. \n So it will be a combination. But clearly, each business unit is going to be highly incented to drive the performance of that business with collaboration that enhances their business performance and the business performance of the other businesses. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. \nMark Astrachan: Two clarifications and a question. So it sounds like there was a lot of benefit in Scent volumes in the quarter. I guess, that partly explains the big EBITDA number and growth rate on a year-on-year basis. So is it fair to say that, that, specifically the Scent EBITDA growth, will normalize as we head through the year?\n And I guess, broader picture, same thing on the total business. And if you could maybe tell us how much you think the 1Q volume growth had to do with channel refill from the reversal of destocking and how much is really what your customers are ordering from you, that would be helpful. \nGlenn Richter: Yes. So your second question, Mark, hard to definitively understand kind of what's going on downstream in terms of the supply chain. However, I think in general, there was a little bit of volume that went from Q4 into Q1, but directionally probably less than 0.5 point. We were reducing prices, as you know, in certain segments. So customers decided to push some orders into Q1. But I think it's fairly de minimis. In general, the feeling is that there's not any restocking in the marketplace. There's an absence of destocking. But there's no view, I think, generally, in terms of the customers are restocking at this point in time.\n In terms of your question on Scent volumes, Scent had a very strong first quarter. Note that it was stronger in consumer versus fine. So that makes that sort of mix-neutral versus the enterprise from the standpoint. And as mentioned, we just -- we're not anticipating that those high single-digit volume gains will continue through the balance of the year. So that is a piece that's basically reflected in our balance of the year guide being lower from a volume standpoint. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: I had two questions. First was just on the Nourish performance in the quarter and volumes being up. Food industry volumes are still quite weak. So I was just kind of curious if you could square for us your performance outside of inventory rebuilding versus kind of what we're seeing in end market demand.\n And then the second thing was, Erik, very helpful to hear kind of the update on org structure and the direction you're moving in. I was curious though, that's a little bit backwards question, the org structure that was in the process of being set up, and Glenn, you were obviously a part of that, I understand the notion that it's not -- it's been deemed not the right path forward, but there were surely merits to that plan. \n There were elements there that were going to bring something positive or there was an intention. So I'm just curious what, if anything, you think you could give up or forgo in not pursuing that model and if there are ways to kind of bring that into the structure org that you're going to be setting up? If that didn't make sense, I can try to clarify. \nJon Erik Fyrwald: No, no, I'll start and then Glenn can add to it. First of all, in the organization structure, the idea was to have market-based organization structure. So for example, Health & Biosciences would have been split up into four different units. As we've come together as an executive leadership team and talked about it, the belief is that you gain the most by having -- making sure that your innovation, that your R&D engine is -- stays within the business and the manufacturing and the commercial so that you have that end-to-end and you're going to customers with expertise that they can connect all the way back to R&D and what we call IC&D, the innovation, creation and design capabilities that we bring, that really needs to stay within a business and be there end-to-end.\n Now we have different businesses that hit the same markets. So Home & Personal Care, both our biosciences business and our Scent business have a lot in common with customers. So we'll continue to have a global key account leader for large accounts that will represent the company, but then we'll have experts from the business units coming into that account and working with that account, which is what the accounts want. They want both that overall IFF relationship, which by the way, will include the presidents of the businesses, will include me and others, but that coordinated. But they want to see the experts that really know the innovation details that can bring that innovation to them. And that's what these end-to-end business units will enable us to bring. \nGlenn Richter: Yes. So if I can add, the original premise, which actually predates me, Lauren, was that combining Flavors and Ingredients would represent a significant \"revenue synergy opportunity\" through cross-sell. And the axis was put on synergies as opposed to how do you optimize the individual businesses. That is being shifted the other way, where the reality is these businesses will run much, much better with a single focus either on Flavors or Ingredients.\n As Erik said, there are other mechanisms to help cross-sell, particularly with the global key accounts, as a way to develop long-term plans, et cetera. But we've seen it just firsthand in terms of the more that we get our Ingredients team sort of focused on only Ingredients, it does deliver results. So I think that's the big shift from 3-plus years ago, when the view was put together.\n And to your first question, very early innings, by the way, although cautiously optimistic. Our trends in terms of our Flavors business were 4-plus percent volumes and the Ingredients business were 3.5%. From what we can measure in terms of our competitive set on both sides of the house, we feel that we're at parity or gaining share based on the quarterly results. I would caution, particularly on the Ingredients business, it is early. There's a lot of remediation in that business. But it's encouraging that we're starting off relative to our peers in a good place. \nJon Erik Fyrwald: And what I would just add to that is, I think Flavors, it was really a good pipeline that the commercial team was able to land. And in Ingredients, it was a combination of a strengthening pipeline but also pricing actions that led to regain some share that was lost due to overpricing increases. And now we've recovered some of that with some price givebacks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. \nLaurence Alexander: Just want to follow up on the comments about sort of the inventory dynamics downstream. If you look a little bit further out, what are you hearing from customers about either them shifting their innovation strategies and therefore having more demand pull for your product or longer term, they're needing to reset inventory levels in terms of working capital days or other metrics? And then would that be a net tailwind or headwind for you from current levels? \nJon Erik Fyrwald: So in the last -- since I've joined, I think I've met with more than 20 customers, maybe 30 customers. And very consistently, what we're hearing back is that they're pivoting from being able to grow with price increases to now needing innovation and innovation being more important than ever. \n And that's a good part of why it's so important for us to have end-to-end business units that can bring that innovation quickly and aggressively because that's what our customers want so that they can continue to profitably grow their business. They have to have more innovation. That's what they're looking for, that's what they need and that's what we're going to deliver. So that's how they're going to grow and that's how we're going to grow. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. \nJeffrey Zekauskas: Given your revenue forecast for the second quarter, which at the midpoint is down about 5%, are your April volumes down 5%, on a sequential basis, that is? Or can you talk about what's happened sequentially? And then second, when you look at your first quarter performance versus your fourth quarter performance, your revenues were up about $200 million and your cost of goods sold was up, I don't know, maybe $30 million. Can you discuss what the dynamic is behind that, which allowed your... \nGlenn Richter: And Jeff, that second part of your question, was it Q4 to Q1? What was your reference point? \nJeffrey Zekauskas: Yes, exactly right. Yes, because there's not much change in cost of goods sold and revenues were up a couple of hundred million. \nGlenn Richter: Yes, yes, yes. Well, there are a number of timing elements in the fourth quarter and sort of the mix of the business in the fourth quarter vis-\u00e0-vis Q1. Generally, the productivity and net price dynamics are very similar, so I'd say the fundamentals were. But you really have some mix dynamics and then some one-time items related to that as we think about Q4 to Q1.\n Yes, you referenced, I think, the decline. Decline sequentially is about $100 million from Q1 to Q2. About 1/4 of that basically is associated with the absence of LMC in the mix. The other part is just sort of the outlook in the business, a little bit of seasonality in terms of the business as well. Versus prior year, to remind you, this time last year, we had savory solutions, we had FSI. We also had LMC in the mix. So there's a pretty substantial sort of reduction in revenue on a year-over-year comparison.\n Volumetrically, your question about what we're seeing in the second quarter, we're obviously well into the middle of the quarter at this point. We're anticipating a 5% to 6% all-in volume growth versus the 4% for Q1. April was an extremely good month. But last year, it was an extremely lousy month. So there's a bit of an overlap from that standpoint. But May and at least the June book at this point is trending towards that basically sort of, call it, 5%-plus in terms of the performance for the quarter. Thanks, Jeff. \nOperator: There are no questions registered at this time. So I will pass the call back over to Erik for concluding remarks. \nJon Erik Fyrwald: Thank you all for joining today. Let me just close with two comments. First of all, Glenn did announce his pending retirement. But I just want to make sure, he's not leaving yet. There's lots more work to do. And we're enjoying him as part of the ELT, executive leadership team, to get us unleashing our full potential.\n Second point is it's really great being part of Team IFF. We've got terrific people, great innovation capabilities. And we're going to do all we can to unleash our full potential and try to delight our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Thank you very much. \nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jon Erik Fyrwald",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to join you all today to discuss our solid performance in the first quarter and what we are seeing across the business so far this year. Today, we'll focus on our financial results, our outlook for the balance of the year and our increased confidence in our reiterated guidance, where we now see us trending toward the upper end. \n Now before moving forward, I want to acknowledge Glenn, who today is announcing his plan to retire at the end of 2024 after 3 successful years with the company. During his tenure, Glenn has driven multiple actions to improve our balance sheet and position the company for financial success. We've benefited from his experience and commitment to transformation and his ongoing leadership to position IFF to drive long-term profitable market share growth. He has also been very helpful to me already as I've come on to the IFF team. \n Now with this announcement, we have started a succession plan to evaluate internal and external candidates to succeed Glenn. The Board and I are grateful for all Glenn has helped IFF accomplish and look forward to his continued leadership as we identify a successor and ensure a smooth transition. \n Now turning to Slide 6. We are off to a good start at IFF. We achieved volume growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2022 as volumes grew mid-single digit in the first quarter of 2024 with strong contributions from Scent, Nourish and Health & Biosciences. We are also encouraged by the double-digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth as we not only benefited from volume growth but also from productivity gains across our businesses. \n At the same time, we made important progress focusing our portfolio with closing the divestiture of the cosmetics ingredients business and the announced sale of our Pharma Solutions business. We expect to complete the pharma transaction in the first half of 2025. The proceeds from these divestitures will help further strengthen our capital structure, address our deleveraging goal of 3x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA and refocus us on high-growth areas of our business. \n With our solid performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of 2024 and now expect full year 2024 results to trend toward the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges. It's still early in the year and there's a lot more work to be done, but we are focused on building on our momentum to energize our team and return to sustainable profitable growth. \n Turning to Slide 7. Let me take a step back for a moment and share what I've learned during my first 90 days here at IFF. Now I've spent time getting to know our teams all over the world and meeting with many of our customers. And I'm grateful for the productive discussions. \n And what I found is that IFF has lots of top talent and incredible innovation capabilities. But we're not yet realizing our full potential. With a new leadership perspective on our priorities and a renewed focus on execution by our executive leadership team, we are getting back to basics, and I'm optimistic about what we will do from here. \n First, we are strengthening our balance sheet and capital structure to create the flexibility we need to achieve our long-term goals. My assessment is we have not consistently delivered on our financial commitments largely due to a need for more strategic and organization operating model clarity to enable us to better execute against our goals. \n I think we are now getting the clarity we need and have taken some decisive steps in the first quarter to help us start to realize more of our potential. We recently rightsized our quarterly dividend to align with the market and our long-term cash flow generation and have made divestiture moves, including cosmetics and Pharma Solutions, to focus our portfolio and drive debt reduction. \n We also recently announced and are implementing our refocused IFF operating model, which is now business-led, supported by lean functions. This includes the appointment of Ana Paula Mendonc\u0327a, who has dedicated her career to the advancement of fragrance at IFF, as the President of Scent. This enables Simon Herriott to focus his full attention on driving profitable growth in our Health & Biosciences business unit. We will also put more focus on our Flavors and Functional Ingredients units within our Nourish division. \n With this operating model change, we have also changed the reporting structure of several of our functions, including R&D, operations, finance and HR, to go directly into our business unit presidents, so they have the full end-to-end responsibility and accountability for business execution. Their goals will include delivering growth above market with a margin structure that gets us in line with or better than leading peers. \n Now to make this work, we have also established an operating system which is a simple set of management processes that collectively define how IFF makes decisions and creates value, provides a framework for standardized processes, responsibilities and metrics and defines the tools to help managers drive continuous improvement. We believe this will create greater visibility to track performance, so we drive execution to deliver results in the current period in ways that strengthen us for the coming years. \n We are also introducing an operating philosophy based on four main pillars: number one, customer focus to drive profitable market share growth; number two, innovation powerhouse to create sustainable new products and other innovations customers value and do this faster; number three, operational excellence to lead our relentless focus on safety, quality, continuous improvement and competitive cost structures; and four, people, people who are engaged across the organization. \n We expect that our business-empowered model and operating system will enhance collaboration to profitably win with customers, and by doing so, deliver strong financial performance over time. And while it's still early, I am pleased and encouraged by the energy and commitment of our teams all around the world. \n With that, I'll now pass it over to Glenn to dive deeper into our results for the first quarter. Glenn? Thank you, Glenn. Now as I shared at the top of the call, my first 90 days on Team IFF have been energizing as I see so much potential. We have great talent and capabilities across our global teams, and our solid top and bottom line results from the first quarter show that we are building positive momentum. And it's an honor to lead IFF during this transformative time, and I am encouraged by our positive start to the year and our outlook. \n Yet we still have a lot of work to do. As the market continues to be very competitive, we are committed to bringing products and innovation that differentiate us from our peers and give customers what they need to win and, in turn, helps them and us drive sustainable profitable growth. And with a solid start to the year, I'm excited to see what we can accomplish going forward. \n And with that, I'd like to now open it up for questions. Yes. Thanks for the question, Matthew. As you probably know, I've been on a listening tour or a discussion tour since right after the January 11 announcement of the change of my joining IFF. And it's been really great to hear from our employees all around the world and our customers all around the world. And what I've discerned from that is that we've had multiple companies coming together with different operating models, different philosophies. \n And there was significant uncertainty about the organization structure and how we were going to do things. And what we've done is the executive leadership team has come together very nicely, and I'm very proud of the team, and we've been able to together clarify the structure and operational model that we have going forward and the four pillars that we're focused on to drive our performance. \n We've had town halls all around the world, both live and by video. We've touched all our employees. We've spent special time with our leadership. And I think we've gotten really clear on how we're moving the company forward. And what I love about it is I feel the engagement of our people around the world. I feel their energy growing. \n I think there's great acceptance and enthusiasm for the empowered business unit model, for the focus on customers that the job of all of us is to support our teams to win with customers and help us profitably grow our market share and then also drive our innovation that, at the core, we're an innovation company, and we need to make sure that we have leading innovation that we're bringing to our customers, and it's innovation that customers value. \n And then finally, that we also have healthy productivity, productivity that helps us strengthen the company and invest more in growth and in innovation and doing that with smart productivity, things like reducing consultants, reducing layers, driving functional shared service centers, where it makes sense, using technology, information technology. So my feeling is that there's great capabilities, great people in this company. And the executive leadership team is coming together to try and do all we can to unleash that full potential of our people all around the world. Thank you. Okay. I'll start and then hand it over to Glenn. And thanks for the question, Nicola -- or questions. So on the portfolio, first of all, the Pharma Solutions business will be with us for another year. And we see a lot of opportunity to further strengthen the performance of Pharma Solutions over the next year and then beyond that with Roquette. \n But then we have the other four business units that we're going to really focus on driving forward, of course, with Nourish, both the Flavors and the Functional Ingredients. We have the Scent business and we have the Health & Biosciences business. All our focus now is on supporting those businesses to perform well, to drive profitable market share growth, to drive healthy productivity, to make sure that we're bringing leading innovation and deliver the best performance we can in the second quarter, full year 2024, but do it in ways that strengthen us for '25 and beyond. \n We're also going through a strategy review process for each of the businesses. And we'll take a look at what it takes to win in each of those businesses in the coming years and what we have to do investment-wise and making sure that each of the businesses has the right portfolio to win going forward. So you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters and years. But right now, our focus is all on making sure we've got the right strategy, the right capabilities in each business, the right collaboration, culture across businesses and are winning with customers by bringing leading innovation. Glenn? Thanks, Josh. And let me start and then Glenn can give you more details. But as I see it, still fairly new coming into the company, clearly, CPG company volumes are still soft in the U.S. and the EU. And so we can't expect a whole lot of market tailwind growth. I do think we've seen the end of most of the destocking outside of Pharma Solutions. And Glenn alluded to the Pharma Solutions destocking, both a market destocking and our change in channel strategy. But bottom line is we can expect a lot of growth from the marketplace, although there are some emerging markets that we're going after that are seeing very attractive volume growth. \n But overall, our focus has to be growth through bringing leading innovation and winning business with customers. And I've heard a lot already about commercial projects that we're winning. But we're also going to increase the focus and understanding the projects that we didn't win. Why didn't we win them? What does it take for us to be even more successful with our customers and win even more projects and bring that leading innovation so that customers are growing their market share profitably and we're growing with them? Glenn? Thanks for the question, David, and glad to be back with you again after some years. Absolutely, it marks the beginning of improvement in the Functional Ingredients business and very pleased to see that after a long, tough spell. And what I would say is that we are putting more focus on the Functional Ingredients business. And I'm very pleased to see the start of what the team are working really hard to make a sustained turnaround.\n And in addition to better execution, which is happening, we are doing a strategy refresh and looking at all the product families and our systems approach across the Functional Ingredients business. And we are focused very much right now on delivering a strong improvement in 2024 but also what it takes to make sure that, that improvement continues into 2025, starting with the second quarter '24, then the third quarter, but the full year of this year, but doing -- making sure that we're doing the right things to strengthen for '25 and beyond. \n And you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters. But it is the start of a turnaround. I'm very pleased with the progress that the team is making, the actions they're taking both with customers and on productivity. And we'll see how good we can do in '24 and then we'll focus on 25, but making progress. Well, thanks for the question, John. And I think it's a really important one. To me, the most important thing we do as leaders is make sure that we have the right talent in the company, that we develop the right talent and we give them the opportunities through promotion to continue to advance their careers. And so I always prefer internal promotions. But sometimes external talent needs to come in to fill gaps or when we don't have the right talent inside.\n But I can tell you that, like at Syngenta, I very much want to have my successor come from inside when I do retire at some point. And also, I'll just point out that the one significant executive leadership change that we've made so far was Ana Paula Mendonc\u0327a being promoted to run the Scent division as President of Scent. And if you look at her background and if you talk to the people across the company and customers, there was great enthusiasm for her promotion, and I like that. So I will continue to work with the executive leadership team and with the Board to make sure that we're developing the right talent inside the company to make sure that we promote from within wherever we can. Thanks, [ Laurence ]. It's also good to be back with you. We had some history that dates back quite a ways. The way I would say it is that in the businesses that are remaining, we've got a lot of great innovation capability and a lot of really terrific people that understand customers, have consumer insight capability. So we have the people and the capabilities, including the innovation capabilities, to be very successful.\n And what I would say is -- and even talking to our people but also our customers, we haven't realized our full potential. And that's what it's about. It's the leadership team working to unleash the full potential by making things, decision-making clear, by having businesses be end-to-end, be able to drive clarity in their strategy and then clarity in their execution, but at the same time, having a collaborative culture so that we can collaborate across businesses, wherever it makes sense, to enhance our ability to bring solutions to customers or to drive healthy productivity. \n And so I believe that we're doing well with that, but we've got a lot more potential to unleash. And I think if you talk to people across the company, I think you'll find a lot of enthusiasm about what IFF is doing and what more we can do going forward.\n Specifically on Scent, I think Scent has been a unit that has stayed focused largely on customers, that has brought a lot of innovation to customers. I've spent a lot of time with the perfumers in this company. We've got world-class perfumers. And I just am so proud to be part of this company with such great perfumers that our customers value. I've spent time with CEOs of leading CPG companies that have named our perfumers by name because they're so important to their success. \n And so making sure that we're bringing not only our perfumers but the whole team around the perfumers to help co-create great new fragrances and fine fragrances or great new consumer products, whether they're shampoos or detergents, laundry detergents or dishwash detergents or floor cleaners or body wash, whatever it is, the scent, I've learned, is such a critical part of the success of the consumer product.\n And our great perfumers and the teams around them, bringing great scent technology and great formulations to help the customers develop leading consumer products, has really been what's driven the growth. So I expect under Ana's leadership and with the super team that she's got, I expect that continued strong performance to continue. Yes. So on the functions feeding into the business units, reporting into the business units, it's clearly being done so that the business units can drive their performance. And there will be no changes to the 2024 plan because everybody is set and clear about it and we're not making changes. \n But effective in 2025, those functions that we're reporting corporately that will be reporting into the business units will be incentivized on the business unit performance. As a large part of their incentives, they also, of course, continue to have a corporate element to encourage overall corporate performance and collaboration across business units. And the more senior level the people are, the more their corporate component.\n But clearly, what we want to drive is business unit alignment and everybody on that business team driving their business unit's performance but also collaborating to enhance their business unit's performance and the total company performance. I would also say that there will continue to be corporate functional leadership that ensure that we're doing functional best practices across the business units and that each of the functional people have great career opportunities across the company. \n So it will be a combination. But clearly, each business unit is going to be highly incented to drive the performance of that business with collaboration that enhances their business performance and the business performance of the other businesses. No, no, I'll start and then Glenn can add to it. First of all, in the organization structure, the idea was to have market-based organization structure. So for example, Health & Biosciences would have been split up into four different units. As we've come together as an executive leadership team and talked about it, the belief is that you gain the most by having -- making sure that your innovation, that your R&D engine is -- stays within the business and the manufacturing and the commercial so that you have that end-to-end and you're going to customers with expertise that they can connect all the way back to R&D and what we call IC&D, the innovation, creation and design capabilities that we bring, that really needs to stay within a business and be there end-to-end.\n Now we have different businesses that hit the same markets. So Home & Personal Care, both our biosciences business and our Scent business have a lot in common with customers. So we'll continue to have a global key account leader for large accounts that will represent the company, but then we'll have experts from the business units coming into that account and working with that account, which is what the accounts want. They want both that overall IFF relationship, which by the way, will include the presidents of the businesses, will include me and others, but that coordinated. But they want to see the experts that really know the innovation details that can bring that innovation to them. And that's what these end-to-end business units will enable us to bring. And what I would just add to that is, I think Flavors, it was really a good pipeline that the commercial team was able to land. And in Ingredients, it was a combination of a strengthening pipeline but also pricing actions that led to regain some share that was lost due to overpricing increases. And now we've recovered some of that with some price givebacks. So in the last -- since I've joined, I think I've met with more than 20 customers, maybe 30 customers. And very consistently, what we're hearing back is that they're pivoting from being able to grow with price increases to now needing innovation and innovation being more important than ever. \n And that's a good part of why it's so important for us to have end-to-end business units that can bring that innovation quickly and aggressively because that's what our customers want so that they can continue to profitably grow their business. They have to have more innovation. That's what they're looking for, that's what they need and that's what we're going to deliver. So that's how they're going to grow and that's how we're going to grow. Thank you all for joining today. Let me just close with two comments. First of all, Glenn did announce his pending retirement. But I just want to make sure, he's not leaving yet. There's lots more work to do. And we're enjoying him as part of the ELT, executive leadership team, to get us unleashing our full potential.\n Second point is it's really great being part of Team IFF. We've got terrific people, great innovation capabilities. And we're going to do all we can to unleash our full potential and try to delight our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Glenn Richter",
            "content": "Thank you, Erik, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Erik mentioned earlier, we're encouraged by the momentum across our business as we start the year, and we are excited to continue to build on these positive early signals throughout 2024 and beyond. \n In the first quarter, IFF generated roughly $2.9 billion in sales. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, sales increased 5% year-over-year. Our strong quarterly revenue performance was led by mid-single-digit volume growth with sequential improvements across most of our businesses, including Scent, Health & Biosciences and Nourish. \n Pricing was modestly positive, inclusive of FX-related pricing in emerging markets, in particular the Argentine peso, where we, like the industry, have indexed pricing to U.S. and/or euro exchange rates that drive pricing changes. Absent of this benefit, pricing would have been negative in the quarter, largely in line with our plan. \n We delivered strong profitability in the quarter with adjusted operating EBITDA of $578 million. This represents a 20% increase on a comparable year-over-year basis, led by volume growth and the contribution from productivity initiatives. As a result, margins improved by approximately 310 basis points to nearly 20% adjusted operating margin in the quarter. \n Turning now to Slide 9. I'll dive deeper into the business performance across our segments. In Nourish, sales increased by 3% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with strong double-digit growth in Flavors with improvements in both volume and price. And we saw very strong growth in our Flavors business across nearly all markets. \n Functional Ingredients volume was up low single digits, the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall, comparable currency-neutral sales declined year-over-year due to our planned pricing actions. In terms of profitability, productivity gains and volume growth drove a 13% increase in comparable adjusted operating EBITDA with solid gross margin improvements in both Flavors and Functional Ingredients. \n Our Health & Biosciences segment had another strong quarter with both top and bottom line growth. Solid performance in our H&B portfolio, led by double-digit sales growth in Cultures & Food Enzymes, Animal Nutrition and Grain Processing and mid-single-digit growth in Home & Personal Care, drove a 6% increase in comparable currency-neutral sales. Improved volume and productivity gains led to a 21% increase in year-over-year comparable adjusted operating EBITDA. \n Scent delivered another excellent quarter, including 16% growth in comparable currency-neutral sales, driven by double-digit growth in Consumer Fragrance and Fragrance Ingredients and mid-single-digit growth in Fine Fragrances. The segment also excel in terms of profitability, primarily led by volume growth and productivity improvements, which delivered an outstanding adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 55% on a comparable basis. \n Lastly, in Pharma Solutions, while we saw some improvements from productivity initiatives, these were offset by lower volumes driven as expected due to continued destocking trends, which began late last year. It's worth noting that part of the destocking trend in the first quarter was market-related and the other is due to Pharma Solutions' initiative to reduce reliance on distributors and convert more of its core excipients business into a direct distribution model. \n We believe the shift to a more direct approach will enhance our customer relationships, reduce supply chain complexity and provide greater access to technical resources while also improving margins. Also, as mentioned, we agreed to divest the Pharma Solutions business as part of our portfolio optimization efforts and are confident the business will be positioned to thrive and succeed in partnership with Roquette. \n Now on Slide 10, I'd like to discuss our cash flow and leverage position. Cash flow from operations totaled $99 million this quarter while CapEx was $118 million or roughly 4.1% of sales. In the first quarter, normal seasonality impacted our free cash flow results. As a reminder, Q1 is usually the lowest cash flow quarter of the year as we make annual cash bonus payments in March. \n Our free cash flow position totaled negative $19 million in the quarter versus negative $48 million in the year-ago period. We also paid $207 million in dividends through the end of the first quarter. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $764 million, including $32 million in assets held for sale. \n IFF continues to make progress in our deleveraging efforts and reduced our gross debt by almost $1 billion versus year ago for a net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4x at quarter end. Our trailing 12-month credit adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.2 billion. \n Please note that the proceeds from the sale of LMC of $810 million were received in April and consequently not reflected in the quarterly results. With the announced Pharma Solutions transaction, we are confident that we will achieve our net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA target of 3x following the transaction close, which we expect will be completed in the first half of 2025. \n On Slide 11, I'd like to now turn to our outlook for 2024. Based on our improved financial and operational performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic about the year ahead and, as Erik mentioned, now expect results to trend towards the higher end of our previously announced guidance ranges. This reflects our belief that volumes will also be towards the high end of our previously announced 0% to 3% with improving trends across the majority of our portfolio. \n We also saw pricing increases due to FX-related pricing in emerging markets in the first quarter, and therefore, raised our previously announced pricing guidance to approximately 1% for the full year 2024 versus previous expectation that pricing would decline approximately 2.5%. With these foreign exchange rate changes, we now expect currency will have an adverse impact of 3% to 4% versus 0% to 1% as previously expected on our sales growth, which is essentially offsetting the FX pricing contribution. \n On the bottom line, for 2024, we are now trending towards the high end of our previously announced adjusted operating EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. This assumes continued improvements in volumes as well as strong productivity. While it is still early in the year, volume trends are encouraging, and consequently, we have increased confidence in our ability to achieve our full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion, driven by improved volumes with an adjusted operating EBITDA of approximately $500 million to $525 million. \n I'll now turn it back to Erik for closing remarks. Thanks, Erik. Thanks for the question, Nicola. We're actually trending more favorable in terms of our full year outlook for free cash flow and adjusted as well. As mentioned, a combination of earnings momentum -- actually, working capital is actually performing better than planned, and we expect actually some improvement and then just some timing on taxes. We're probably going to be closer to $600 million versus the $500 million. \n I would note that, that also includes higher Reg G costs related to pharma. So we gave you a $200 million number in Feb that did not include pharma for obvious reasons. The heavy lifting, as Erik mentioned, is the balance of this year separating systems, legal entities, et cetera. That's roughly about $100 million. So on an adjusted basis, $900 million on a free cash flow reported basis, directionally, $600 million. Thanks for the question. Thanks, Erik. Again, Josh, I think, as Erik mentioned, until we see a strengthening in the consumer environment, which has yet to appear, and until we have a few more months underneath our belts, it's sort of hard for us to be sort of incredibly optimistic on the second half. As a reference point, the first half volumes of circa 4% to 5% and the second half, basically 1% to 2%. \n As a reminder, the first half of last year, because of the aggressive destocking, was down 9% and the second half, down 5%. So a little bit of it is the lapping as well as we sort of think about providing guidance. But I think the end market, as Erik said, we need to see greater strength there before we're sort of more confident in higher volume growth in the second half. Thank you, Mike. So good question. So 20% for Q1, sort of the implied balance of the year is around 18.5%. That 150 basis points of change, half of that is related to volume and mix, inclusive of LMC. So LMC, you take out about $12 million per quarter and about $25 million of revenue. So it's relatively high margin. So everything normalized, that gets you from the 20% down to basically 19% in a quarter. \n The residual 75 basis points really is a little bit more net price-to-cost realization in Q1 versus the forecast and then just some timing of expenses. But to answer your direct question, if volumes were to maintain, then we should be somewhere in the 19%, probably 19%-plus range, for the balance of the year. Yes, Eric, you're right. I mean, the full year, we're expecting a small net positive, as I mentioned, little more biased towards Q1 than the balance of the year. Our pricing actions, which were largely givebacks this year, were highly focused in the Functional Ingredients space. We are tracking well against the expectations that we set for the year. We do believe that the improved performance in the business is in part related to these pricing actions on top of the other actions. And we don't see sort of any additional kind of pricing for the balance year at this point in time. \n And then in general, if we look at sort of the inflationary environment for the balance of the year, it's pretty stable. I think commodities are flattish to maybe a tad up. Generally, energy is trending down, particularly in Europe. And logistics is trending slightly up, particularly ocean freight, given what's happening in the Red Sea. But generally, stability and, as we mentioned, a little more positive net price in the first quarter than the balance of the year. Thank you, Eric. Yes. And I would just add to that, David, as we've mentioned in the past, we've stated we didn't think we're going to get to sort of full recovery until '25. We're pleased by the start of this year. A lot of the service elements are 100% back to where they should be. Pricing actions have been effective, more innovation in the pipeline.\n The last piece of the equation is on the cost side. And we're going through a very extensive review of our manufacturing and procurement operations. That probably will be implemented late this year into early next year as the final piece to get to the margin structure in terms of where we need to be. Thanks for the question. Adam, good question. Regionally, we have seen greater strength in the combination of Asia and LatAm, so more of the emerging markets from a volume standpoint and sort of across the board, generally a little softer in North America and in EMEA. That's probably not dissimilar than what others are seeing in the marketplace.\n If we look by business, Scent had a phenomenal start to the year, 9%-plus volumes, Nourish and H&B in the 4% range. As we think about the balance of the year, we're not planning on Scent continuing at these very, very high levels, so some softening from these and then a little bit softer for H&B and Nourish and then pharma actually improving because they were down about 9% in Q1 and actually getting to flattish as we move into Q2 and the balance of the year. But generally, where we're seeing the regional balance, more emerging market, we're expecting that to continue at least through the second quarter. Good question, Salvator. We are trending at around $200 million full year in terms of productivity and, hence, some of our commentary about guiding towards the higher range of our EBITDA guide. And that's about $50 million per quarter. So it's fairly ratable in terms of kind of the achievement. I would note, as we've said in previous calls, we have made tremendous progress with our operations and procurement leadership teams in really driving a very disciplined approach that is taking cost out, everything from SKU rationalization to literally looking plant-by-plant in terms of best practices. And behind that -- and by the way, there's plenty of additional opportunities. As I mentioned, we're taking a [ zero-based ] approach to our ingredients platform, which will provide additional opportunities. \n And behind that, we've really been looking at opportunities within RSA that have been focused on leveraging our global shared services, really focusing on our indirect spend, so getting every dollar out we need and then continuing to advance technology as a way to basically automate eliminate work. So that piece of it is actually picking up speed as well. So we feel very good about $200 million. And I would suggest, as we look out into the future, we're going to continue to deliver pretty strong productivity numbers. Thanks for the question. Sure. Lisa, this is Glenn. So we're in the early innings of deciding sort of our liability management strategy. As you know, we will bring in circa net proceeds of $2.4 billion from pharma. Coincidentally, we have maturities cumulatively for '25 and '26 that are $2.4 billion. But we're actually taking a more holistic look, and we're actually going to be balancing the trade-off between interest cost savings, notional debt repayment, so how we think about basically bringing in some of the cheaper debt, as well as refinancing risk. \n So we'll think about bringing some towers down as part of that. So there'll be more to come as we get closer to finalizing the close of the deal. But we are sort of thinking about not just the immediate maturities but how to optimize the structure going forward. So with that, Erik, I'm happy to take the next question. Do you want to take the next question? Yes. So your second question, Mark, hard to definitively understand kind of what's going on downstream in terms of the supply chain. However, I think in general, there was a little bit of volume that went from Q4 into Q1, but directionally probably less than 0.5 point. We were reducing prices, as you know, in certain segments. So customers decided to push some orders into Q1. But I think it's fairly de minimis. In general, the feeling is that there's not any restocking in the marketplace. There's an absence of destocking. But there's no view, I think, generally, in terms of the customers are restocking at this point in time.\n In terms of your question on Scent volumes, Scent had a very strong first quarter. Note that it was stronger in consumer versus fine. So that makes that sort of mix-neutral versus the enterprise from the standpoint. And as mentioned, we just -- we're not anticipating that those high single-digit volume gains will continue through the balance of the year. So that is a piece that's basically reflected in our balance of the year guide being lower from a volume standpoint. Yes. So if I can add, the original premise, which actually predates me, Lauren, was that combining Flavors and Ingredients would represent a significant \"revenue synergy opportunity\" through cross-sell. And the axis was put on synergies as opposed to how do you optimize the individual businesses. That is being shifted the other way, where the reality is these businesses will run much, much better with a single focus either on Flavors or Ingredients.\n As Erik said, there are other mechanisms to help cross-sell, particularly with the global key accounts, as a way to develop long-term plans, et cetera. But we've seen it just firsthand in terms of the more that we get our Ingredients team sort of focused on only Ingredients, it does deliver results. So I think that's the big shift from 3-plus years ago, when the view was put together.\n And to your first question, very early innings, by the way, although cautiously optimistic. Our trends in terms of our Flavors business were 4-plus percent volumes and the Ingredients business were 3.5%. From what we can measure in terms of our competitive set on both sides of the house, we feel that we're at parity or gaining share based on the quarterly results. I would caution, particularly on the Ingredients business, it is early. There's a lot of remediation in that business. But it's encouraging that we're starting off relative to our peers in a good place. And Jeff, that second part of your question, was it Q4 to Q1? What was your reference point? Yes, yes, yes. Well, there are a number of timing elements in the fourth quarter and sort of the mix of the business in the fourth quarter vis-a\u0300-vis Q1. Generally, the productivity and net price dynamics are very similar, so I'd say the fundamentals were. But you really have some mix dynamics and then some one-time items related to that as we think about Q4 to Q1.\n Yes, you referenced, I think, the decline. Decline sequentially is about $100 million from Q1 to Q2. About 1/4 of that basically is associated with the absence of LMC in the mix. The other part is just sort of the outlook in the business, a little bit of seasonality in terms of the business as well. Versus prior year, to remind you, this time last year, we had savory solutions, we had FSI. We also had LMC in the mix. So there's a pretty substantial sort of reduction in revenue on a year-over-year comparison.\n Volumetrically, your question about what we're seeing in the second quarter, we're obviously well into the middle of the quarter at this point. We're anticipating a 5% to 6% all-in volume growth versus the 4% for Q1. April was an extremely good month. But last year, it was an extremely lousy month. So there's a bit of an overlap from that standpoint. But May and at least the June book at this point is trending towards that basically sort of, call it, 5%-plus in terms of the performance for the quarter. Thanks, Jeff."
