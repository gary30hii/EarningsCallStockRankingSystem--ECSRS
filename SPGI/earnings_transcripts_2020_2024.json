At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Boyer: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q4 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit’s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions. With that, it’s my pleasure the call to -- turn the call over to Lance.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Lance, you’re on mute.\nLance Uggla: Oh, sorry. There we go. The first mute of the year. There we go. If everybody can go mute on the teams, there we go. Okay. So I will start fresh. Thank you, Eric, and happy New Year and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 earnings call. We achieved a lot in 2020, solid financial results proving the resiliency of our business model; greater levels of innovation across the company; higher employee satisfaction scores; and finally, we announced a strategic merger with S&P Global, which will create the leading global information services provider. Overall, we finished the year ahead of expectations and are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are updating our adjusted EPS by $0.03 due to our share repurchase restriction because of the pending merger. Now onto the financial highlights for the quarter and the year. When we speak to Q4 and fiscal year results, they are normalized to exclude the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth rates for organic revenue and adjusted EPS. Organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter and the year, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was 160 basis points in the quarter and 250 basis points for the year, and adjusted EPS growth was 11% in the quarter and 13% for the year. In terms of our core industry verticals, I'll provide Q4 and full-year 2020 highlights and our outlook for 2021. First, our Financial Services segment had organic revenue growth of 6% in Q4 and 5% for the full-year. In 2020, within information, we continue to benefit from the innovation and demand for our pricing, reference data and valuations offerings. The successful launch of new regulatory solutions, notably our SFTR reporting platform, and we had strong growth from indices led by our fixed income and newly launched ESG indices. Within Solutions, we continue to invest in our leading products and integration capabilities, launched private debt investment lifecycle solution and experienced robust growth from continued expansion of our managed corporate action solutions. Within Processing, we invested in our core OTC and loan settlement platforms to help the industry facilitate the IBOR transition and regulatory requirements. We also successfully service the industry through one of the most volatile periods in recent history. In 2021, we expect organic growth within financial services in the 6% to 8% range. Within information, growth will be led by increasing customer demand and new products within our pricing, reference data and valuation services businesses. We also expect continued strength for our regulatory reporting and compliance offerings. Within this business, we'll integrate our recent acquisition of Cappitech, which will help solidify our leading industry position. Now within Solutions, we expect high growth across our diversified offerings, and a rebound in managed services and implementation of projects. In particular, we are looking for a strong year from our onboarding and compliance management tools, expansion of our portfolio and data management solutions into new sectors and continued high growth in private market offerings. We also expect normalized levels of equity and debt issuance that will drive solid performance in our syndication and book building businesses. Processing is expected to be slightly up year-over-year with mixed market conditions in both loans and derivative markets. Now let's move on to transportation, with organic revenue growth in the quarter of 2% and a decline of 2% for the year. In 2020, the pandemic had a major impact on the automotive industry. And we responded proactively to the crisis by working with our customers and continue to see the rebound in our business with recurring organic growth of 6% in Q4. During the pandemic, we also increased our focus on driving adoption of newer products, such as CARFAX for Life, while accelerating product innovation across our portfolios in areas such as marketing audiences, enhanced compliance simulation and Mastermind now available for used cars. Our Maritime & Trade business had a solid year, excluding the impact of the cancellation of our TPM conference. In 2021, we expect organic growth within transportation in the 12% to 15% range. We expect our automotive business to revert to its longer-term growth range. Although economic uncertainty remains, our dealer-facing businesses have strong momentum going into 2021, and the strong retention rates we've maintained through 2020 attest to the critical nature of our products. Product support in our OEM and supplier customers will recover more gradually as the industry adjusts to lower long-term volumes coming out of COVID. In addition to the underlying growth in the business, we expect to see a one-time pickup in organic growth from pricing being at normal levels for the full-year, specifically within CARFAX and Mastermind businesses. And final -- finally, Maritime & Trade will continue to see accelerating subscription growth, driven by product innovation in our risk and compliance and commodities analytics businesses. Moving on to resources, where organic decline was 11% in the quarter and negative 5% for the full-year. In 2020, our upstream business was impacted by the industry undergoing severe CapEx reductions, leading to cost pressure within our customer base and bankruptcies, particularly in North America. Our downstream organic revenue growth proved resilient, when normalizing for our events. Growth within our gas, power and renewables businesses were driven by customer expansion into areas such as wind, battery, solar, and hydrogen services. This was somewhat offset by lower non-recurring revenue within consulting. We also completed the integration of the agribusiness and acquired truView, a small upstream analytics company. And in 2021, we expect organic revenue results within resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits. Our downstream businesses are expected to return to mid-single-digit organic growth, driven by continued demand for our pricing, chemical information, the release of additional plastic circularity products, a new database of estimated energy chain emissions and from the realization of synergies from the agribusiness integrations. Within our upstream businesses, we expect customer CapEx spend to continue to be constrained for our annual contract value, which will bottom in Q1. In 2021, we excite -- are excited to launch our new predictive analytics tools that will marry our upstream and midstream global data sets with our proprietary insights and research and will drive additional forward growth. Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter, and 1% normalized for the impact of BPVC for the full year. Product design proved its resilience with organic growth in the low single digits, normalized for BPVC, while TMT and ECR performed as expected. In 2021, we expect our organic revenue growth to be in the mid single digits. Moving on to some of our recently announced strategic initiatives. We entered into a 50-50 joint venture with shared control with CME to combine our post trade services, including trade processing and risk mitigation operations. The venture is going to incorporate our MarkitSERV business and CME's optimization business. Through the combination, we will achieve increased operating efficiencies and new revenue opportunities by being able to better service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rates, FX, equity and credit asset classes. We expect the deal to close in the summer and to be neutral to our adjusted earnings in the near-term. And finally, we announced the strategic merger with S&P Global, which joins two world class organizations with unique highly complementary assets. This combination creates a pro forma company with increased scale world class products in core markets and strong joint offerings in the high growth adjacencies, including ESG and energy transition, private assets and small and medium enterprises, counterparty risk management, supply chain and trade and alternative data are unique and complementary assets will leverage cutting edge innovation and technology capability including the IHS Markit Data Lake, and S&P Global's Kensho to enhance the customer value proposition. For IHS Markit shareholders, employees and customers, merging with S&P Global was the best strategic fit to create the most long-term value. Post the merger announcement, Doug Peterson, CEO of S&P Global announced his executive team for the pro forma company, which includes the following members of my Executive team. First, Adam Kansler will lead the combined S&P Global market intelligence business and the IHS Markit Financial Services segment. Edouard Tavernier will lead the Transportation segment. Sari Granat will be the combined company's Chief Admin Officer and General Counsel; and Sally Moore will lead Strategic Alliances and will have responsibility for Corporate Development and Strategy. Other members of my Executive team and myself have also agreed to help with the integration for 12 to 18 months post the close. I believe Doug has assembled a great executive team that will bring together members of both companies, including -- and then give the leadership and -- sorry, Doug has assembled a great executive team that will bring together members of both companies leadership, and will be a great first step in merging the two companies. And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Gear: Great. Thank you, Lance. We have a strong finish to the year with results ahead of our expectations. Our Q4 financial performance included revenue of $1.107 billion, with organic growth of 0% and all-in revenue of negative 1%, GAAP net income of $151 million and GAAP EPS of $0.38; adjusted EBITDA of $465 million, an increase a 3% with margins of 42.0% and adjusted EPS was $0.72, an increase of $0.07 or 11%. We were pleased with the finish of the year, and a solid revenue and profit performance we delivered throughout 2020. Relative to revenue, our Q4 organic revenue growth of 0% included recurring organic growth of 2% and nonrecurring organic growth of negative 11%. Moving to segment performance, Financial Services revenue growth was 7%, including 6% organic and 1% FX. Recurring organic was 6%, while nonrecurring organic growth was 9%. Our information business organic was 4% led by strength in our pricing indices and equities information products. Our processing organic was 1% as we saw a return to growth in loan markets offset by a slight decline in derivatives processing. Solutions organic was 10% due primarily to strong performance in our corporate actions, private markets and digital businesses. Transportation had revenue decline of negative 4% including 2% organic, flat FX and divestiture of negative 6%. Organic growth was comprised of 6% recurring and negative 9% nonrecurring. Resources revenue declined 11%, including negative 11% organic and flat FX. Recurring organic was negative 8% and nonrecurring organic was negative 32%. Our Q4 ACV decreased $22 million and our full-year ACV decreased $74 million, down 9% versus prior year. We ended the year with ACV of $719 million, which now include agri of approximately $30 million. CMS revenue declined 2%, including 0%, our benchmarking business divestiture impact of negative 1% and flat FX, recurring organic was 2% and nonrecurring organic growth was negative 13%. Turning now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was $465 million, up 3%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.0%, up 160 basis points. Moving to segment profitability, Financial Services adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.7%, up 260 basis points; Transportations margin was 45.3%, up 350 basis points; Resources margin was 40.2%, down 200 basis points and CMS margin was 24.7%, up 20 basis points. GAAP net income was $151 million or $0.38 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $0.72 per diluted share, a $0.07 or 11% improvement over the prior year. Our full-year adjusted tax rate was 18%.Q4 free cash flow was $275 million. Our full year free cash flow was $940 million and represented a conversion rate of 51%. As a reminder, our full year conversion rate was impacted by several nonrecurring items. Turning to the balance sheet, our year-end debt balance was $4.9 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis, and we closed the quarter with $126 million of cash. At year end, our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.2 billion. Our Q4 fully diluted weighted average share count was 400.5 million shares, and our full year was 401.5 million shares. We completed the 200 million ASR in November of 2020. Our full-year share repurchases were approximately $1.1 billion or 14.6 million shares at an average price of $73.71. The merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares, and therefore our share repurchase program is currently suspended. Other than for the purchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation. We paid a dividend of $67 million in Q4 for an FY 2020 total of $270 million of dividends. The merger agreement allows for the continued paying of a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future. And we are recommending to our Board for the approval in our January 2021 meeting to increase a quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.20 per share, effective for the Q1 2021 dividend payment. Moving to full year of financial results. When we speak to full-year results they are normalized to exclude the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture, and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth raised for organic revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Total full-year revenue was $4.288 billion, which represent a decline of negative 3%, 0% organic, negative 2%, [technical difficulty] flat FX. Turning now to reported profits, adjusted EBITDA was $1.837 billion, up 8% versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.8% with reported margin expansion of 250 basis points. GAAP net income was $871 million with GAAP EPS of $2.17, and adjusted EPS was $2.84, a 13% increase versus prior year. In terms of guidance, we are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, and updating our adjusted EPS for a $0.03 impact due to our inability to repurchase shares as a result of the pending merger. Our 2021 guidance is as follows. Revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%. Adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points, and adjusted EPS of $3.11 to $3.16 per year. Finally, we do expect cash conversion in the mid 60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. We managed through the many challenges of 2020 very well and are positioned to have a strong 2021. We're excited about the merger with S&P Global, and believe it will create long-term value for shareholders, new insights and capabilities for customers and greater opportunities for employees. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support and our colleagues around the world for their dedication and focus through what was a very challenging 2020. Operator, we're ready to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, pardon me, congratulations. Lance or Jonathan, what do you think about kind of the joint venture you announced with CME seems really interesting. Is there more opportunity, just given the unique data sets to cultivate beyond CME into other opportunities? And just, I think, it underscores the strategic rationale for the S&P deal. Is there more opportunity from a client perspective, any initial reactions around the announced acquisition and then just additional opportunities that you're seeing similar to kind of what you do with CME?\nLance Uggla: Okay. Why don't I start, then I'll pass it to Adam, who did the transaction for us. But this was something that when we originally thought about selling MarkitSERV, we actually thought that there would be a impetus to buyers that wanted to find ways to consolidate the assets. But I think given that the assets are primarily held by strategics and consortia and a variety of industry-owned relationships, it -- I think, it proved a tall order for any private equity firm to create that consolidation. And so post that, we looked at the strategic assets across the industry. And, of course, between ourselves and CME, we have the majority of the OTC processing assets. And so, therefore, the synergies for both on the cost side, but also in terms of the servicing the customer and creating incremental margin for investment stood out really strong. And we think that the consolidation of processing assets across the industry is something that this -- the CME IHS Markit transaction as a JV is a first step. But why don’t I pass it over to Adam, who can give you some incremental color. Adam?\nAdam Kansler: Sure. Thanks, Lance. There will be much more to come over the next few months as we bring the two businesses together. But as a sort of as a high level answer to your question, you have a very common set of customers, common set of workflows and a lot of the same data enriching the workflows that the customers use on multiple platforms across the CME assets and ours. So this opportunity to bring it together, you'll have a much more complete dataset across all of those workflows, certainly within the derivatives markets, giving you the opportunity to build additional analytical tools, workflow tools, and things that allow our customers to manage their risk and processes more efficiently. I think they've -- the customer set has found for many years that maintain these data sets and these workflows in multiple places is highly inefficient, it's expensive and it causes breaks in some circumstances. So this is an opportunity to improve the risk management profile for our customer set, bring efficiency, bring their costs down and bring a better set of tools. So there will certainly be innovation and new applications and tools against those data sets and in bringing those workflows together over time.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Adam. Next question.\nKevin McVeigh: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nManav Patnaik: Yes. Good morning, guys. I just want to focus on the resources business. So if I got the ACV right, if you exclude the agri business, it is down 9% and that's decelerated again for the third quarter in a row. So I was just curious why you’re confident that things going to bottom in Q1 here?\nLance Uggla: Jonathan, do you want to start and then pass that to Brian or vice versa?\nJonathan Gear: Sure. I'll go ahead and start and then pass on to Brian Crotty. Manav, so we've – the resources really is playing out as we expect it back in Q2 of this year when we saw the impact coming in on upstream. And we're seeing a two-tier world, obviously, where upstream business challenged by the external markets and the downstream business performing pretty much in line on the subscription side. The -- with the ACV as we kind of we need to lap a full 12 months from the restructuring of the marketplace, which took place in kind of mid-Q2. As we know and as we've discussed on previous calls, we've kind of leaned into this pretty heavily, worked closely with our customers and industry customers around us, but it does take a full 12 months. So as we look forward, we -- Q4 performed as we expected. We expect further decline of Q1, but Q1 for ACV being – bottoming out and then building in Q2. But I'll pass over to Brian for any specific color that he's seeing. Brian, I don't think we can -- I don't think we can hear, Brian. I think you're …\nBrian Crotty: Oh, okay. Sorry. Yes, I said, Jonathan, you're exactly right. When I look at the ACVs, it's really upstream that drove the decline in ACV. When you look out at the next year, you can see …\nLance Uggla: You’re going to mute the other one, Brian. Use the other call. All right, thank you.\nBrian Crotty: Can you hear me now? I’m sorry.\nLance Uggla: Yes.\nBrian Crotty: Okay. Yes, when you look at the ACVs on the rest of the group, you can see them improving steadily. And even upstream, we hit bottom in Q1 and then we steadily improve and get positive ACV in Q2, Q3 and Q4.\nLance Uggla: Right. Thanks. Thanks, Brian and Jonathan. Now next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe I'll stick with resources. One of the key questions I get from people around the S&P transaction is just thinking through potential synergies. And with resources it's not so clear to me and I think the other is exactly where those will be. Since you acquired Opus a couple years ago, which is a similar business model to a lot of Platts. Can you just help us understand what synergies adding Opus to your portfolio has done -- delivered for the resources business? Has it help innovation? Has it help create new data sets? Have there been some real clear benefits to business and especially the top line from adding that to your portfolio over the last couple of years? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Maybe I can start, Brian, and then I'll hand it to you. So first off, if you look at our business, it's a 50% upstream, consulting data analytics. And, of course, that business is different than the S&P global business. And so there aren't the numerous product synergies, but there's definitely scale with customers and new customer opportunities for opportunity. As you shift down through chemicals, agriculture, Opus, all the pricing, McCloskey Coal indices, as you get into the pricing and indices, of course, all of those services, where we have synergies between them, have the same opportunity set with the Platts teams. So we're quite excited about the mid and downstream synergies around the pricing and new services, ex where there's overlap and we'll have to address that within the closing of the merger. But that's a small piece of the revenue. Brian, do you want to add to that?\nBrian Crotty: Yes. I think for us, it gives us a whole new customer base as well. When you look at wholesalers, convenience store marketers, even penetrates us more into traders. So I think that was a good thing for the Opus acquisition. Also, pricing services tend to have stickier renewal rates. And then the strong news component gives us a lower end product to up-sell higher end services. So I think strategically it was a very good acquisition.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Hey, thanks. Thanks, Brian. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. On the transportation outlook, is it the typical annual pricing increase in CARFAX and AMM? Or is there some catch up since I don't think you got your typical increase this year? And what's the timing of that? And then any comment on kind of forward visibility on nonrecurring within transportation. I know that, like the timing of recall campaigns can impact that, but just as we think about getting back to the growth that you're projecting? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Edouard, do you want to pick that one?\nEdouard Tavernier: Yes, happy to pick it up. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. So on the pricing side, there will be price increases in 2021, and we will proceed carefully. Let's remember that across North America, we're still in the middle of the pandemic. So we are still reflected on exactly the right time to introduce a price increase. So that currently is planned, but it will be a normal pricing increase and no particular catch ups. We are very focused on the health of our customers and dealer partners. In terms of the forward visibility, as you mentioned, Jeff, a lot of our transactional revenues are tied to things like marketing spend by the industry, as well as activity in the recall business. Now we're seeing some of those spend items come back, they were higher in Q4 than in Q3, and we're seeing a lot of good marketing activity coming through in Q1. So we are confident, they are on their way back. But as Lance mentioned in the introductory comments, and it will take a bit longer for them to reverse to normalized trends. We expect that in the second half of the next year.\nJeff Meuler: Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hey. Just a quick one on the guidance. I know, largely unchanged, but the margin upside pretty consistent with prior years. Any things to point out there on a segment basis or on a seasonal basis that we should be aware of as we think about 2021, or pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past?\nLance Uggla: Okay. Sure, Alex. Yes, we'll do, Alex. Thanks for the question. In terms of the 100 basis points margin performance, again, that's really just building, as you know and in last fiscal year, a very usual fiscal year for us many, many ways. But we did make some structural changes in our costs, and we're seeing a flow through there. That's less than normal growth rates that we're seeing on the 6% to 8% total that helps drive that overall margin. I think you will see particular as we flow through -- I would look at FY '21 as a relatively normal year. The comparison to '20 is where it gets a bit harry at times from quarter-to-quarter. So Q2, in transportation, for example, was a particularly challenging time for us. I think you'll see some odd seasonality on year-on-year comparisons there. But I would think of FY '21 really a pretty normal year for us.\nAlex Kramm: Makes sense. Thanks.\nJonathan Gear: Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, Jon. Could you just -- I know you just said on transport, the May quarter will have this kind of disproportional pop to make the 12% to 15% organic revenue growth for the year. Could you just be a little more directional and kind of in the -- kind of current quarter, how that's trending, knowing that the May quarter will be kind of disproportional year-over-year comparison?\nJonathan Gear: Sure. We will do, Andrew. And I will kind of call you to take a look at the supplemental, you kind of see what happened in FY '20, and then I’ll kind of tell you to see what’s going to happen FY '21. But if we just go back over on what happened last year, as a reminder, when COVID hit, we gave significant price concessions voluntarily, particularly in transportation in Q2 a little bit, I would also add Andrew, in Q3, it leaked a little bit into Q3. As we look forward now right now, so first the industry overall has seen a strong recovery in the second half of 2020. In fact, I just tried to buy -- turning safety and I try to buy a used car, it's very hard to find a used car right now and speaks to the strength of the industry. But I did use CARFAX basically to find a great car, I would recommend it to you, Andrew. But if you look for the industry has recovered there. So as we see that performance in FY '21, we're seeing a pretty healthy industry, particularly at the dealership level. As Edouard mentioned, we do work closely and support the health of our dealer customers. So we're being careful as to how we look at value capture the price increase the timing around that. But right now we're seeing our customers doing pretty well and that's reflected in kind of our expectations. But Edouard anything else you want to comment on?\nEdouard Tavernier: No, I think you covered the key points, Jonathan. There is a seasonality effect, right. If you look at 2020, we took a significant haircut in Q2 on revenues, even as we work in on our cost base in Q3, revenue started coming back in when costs were low, and that it creates some seasonality in the margin accretion. And you're going to see some of that play out in 2021 in the comps. But otherwise, you captured all the key points, Jonathan. Thank you.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nLance Uggla: Thanks. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. So my question is on the S&P strategic rationale and revenue synergies, as both teams have had chance to spend some more time. Can you just talk about the ability to develop new product and improve commercialization of inflows Data Lake by combining it with S&P's Kensho as well as the power of combining inflows Data Lake with S&P's market intelligence platform? And if you can talk about just the new product development as well as improved distribution of data asset, how that can help going forward. Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Sure. Okay. Well, we'll maybe focus this question around market intelligence and financial services, because that is the area where we have substantive product related synergies. And it really -- and I'll pass it to Adam to add on to this as well. But if we start with the Data Lake and Kensho, the Data Lake is where I just mark it has been 3 years organizing all of its alternative data sets into a common library with ease of access for both our internal use, as well as now to commercialize to customers. So we've done the heavy lifting to organize those datasets. S&P Global acquired the Kensho assets, which are advanced analytics data science experts, which have scale and size, that are very excited to begin -- to be able to begin working with the information alternative data sets that we have to help provide new forms of decision-making schools, decision-making signals, as well as trading signals, alerts and just deeper decision making tools and ways that without the organized data sets tied to advanced analytics platform like Kensho, you don't have the same opportunity to do so. So that's the first thing. The second thing is market intelligence is a platform that has hundreds of thousands of users that are active on the platform. And that gives us an opportunity for direct distribution, as well as the buildup of tools and services to be offered on the platform. And I'll let Adam add on to that because there's several other ways the two financial services groups that Adam will lead have revenue synergies mapped out and excited about going forward. Adam?\nAdam Kansler: Yes, thanks, Lance. A lot of this was discussed by both Doug and Lance at the time of the merger. And I think a lot of those themes remain true, and as we've continued to explore and get ready for integration, a lot of those original themes have played out. And that's really looking at the scale of data and insights available to the combined business. The ability to put the massive data sets and content available through the market intelligence platform into some of the technology solutions we offer to our customers in their reg and compliance, risk management workflows should be a real game changer in their ability to make decisions and us to give them a very efficient platform for consuming those wide ranging datasets. If you look for -- look at a corporate customer group, automotive, oil and gas, engineering companies will have the opportunity to give them both financial market and risk capabilities they need to run their business, but also data tools capabilities, let them thrive in their core markets with deep industry specific expertise, market insight and including things like asset valuations which we have been able to give before because of the -- really -- that expertise that we're now bringing to that core customer set that's a user of the market intelligence products. So that -- those are sort of the key areas. It's really the combination of a cross asset cross industry data set with workflow solutions already touching many of those same customers.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Adam. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Lance, just kind of two questions I want to sneak in. First is just the Data Lake went fully live I think in the summer, I just want to ask you to comment a little about what the uptake from customers were? Did it really validate the fact that you'll be able to improve the selling motion over there that seems to be a key kind of point that you're hoping to capitalize on with Kensho being able to use a lot of the stuff that's in the Data Lake? And then just maybe for Jonathan, what are you assuming for events in the year? Are you assuming that we're not going to go back to any live events and what would be events revenue be in kind of a normalized year? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Let me start with that. Yes, so the Data Lake we launched the commercialization in the first half of 2020. And we started off with several proof-of-concepts with bigger active large users, hedge funds, banks that have big decision making, strategies around the use of alternative data. And so far, we started to commercialize those relationships, turn them into longer term contracts. Contracts are reasonably sized with term and give the customers the ability to be able to access parts or all of the library for defined decision-making purposes. So -- and then sometimes, the ability to create some form of redistribution that fits into their own products and services that wouldn't cannibalize our datasets. So we're building out two things. One, the pipeline of customers. Two, we've now started to convert the customers, I don't want to say we've converted 100 customers, but we've definitely have converted 10 customers in the year, so that's starting to pick up. We have a great pipeline and we have numerous ways of creating the commercial set. Somebody is typing -- oh, you must be typing your notes, right?\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Yes, I put that up. Sorry about that. I don’t want to just come in through.\nLance Uggla: That’s all right. Okay. So then the next bit that I'd like to say is that, for us the Data Lake gives us a speed of development of new products, but also this ability to attach our content with our customers content and give them new unique ways of leveraging and utilizing the data sets. So we see a bunch of efficiencies, and a bunch of commercial activities, of which we've started to get a positive trend going on those already. Of the second part of the questions on the events, I'll pass it over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Gear: Great. Thanks, Lance. So on the events, as we know, we offer events throughout the year. But Q2 is our heavy, heavy events month from a revenue perspective, where we have our three large flagship events of CERAWeek, the World Petrochemical Conference and the TPM Conference in our Maritime segment. We are not planning on holding those physical events this year. So when we look at our forecast -- revenue forecast for the year, we've taken that -- we’ve anticipated no revenue from physical events. We are, however, holding virtual events in those three events. The revenue from those is significantly lower, Shlomo. So don't expect to see a significant pop there. But I think it's important way for our teams to continue to lead the industry and lead in with our customers and help connect the industry during these times. So again, you won't see any revenue -- significant revenue from events for us in FY '21, but we will be holding the events virtually.\nLance Uggla: Can I add, Jonathan, as we -- one of the things I'd say, Shlomo, that I was quite impressed with is with the -- with virtual events we do have experience running CERAWeek India last year, which we did with positive revenue. And so we're applying that virtual model to the bigger CERAWeek event for 2021. And I have to say that the customer take up in terms of participating on in the events, as well as sponsoring and participating from a commercial perspective, has been reasonable. And so I've been quite impressed with the team's work. I know, they've involved me with some of the discussions in building some of the panels up et cetera. But they're doing a great job and I know they won't be able to produce the revenue they did physically, but they sure are building some momentum to add some revenue, positive revenue for virtual events as well. And let's see how that plays out in the quarter going into next quarter, but they'll definitely have a number. Thanks. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nHamzah Mazari: Happy New Year. My question is just on the S&P transaction expected to close second half. Any next steps or milestones, any delays you expect from an antitrust perspective? Are there divestitures you have to do? How long do you expect the HSR process to take, sort of any color around that would be great, Lance? Thank you so much.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Well, first off, our expectation is that it will close in the second half. We don't see anything specifically. That's going to create any substantive hurdles. So all the hurdles that we knew going into it in terms of the business overlap within our Platts and Opus's businesses are there, and the teams are working to address those. And so my view is, there shouldn't be any significant roadblocks or hurdles. We'd expect to close in the second half and expect the teams to work with the regulatory bodies to determine the precise nature of the overlap of any assets, which is substantive is insignificant in terms of size across the transaction. I don't know, Jonathan, anything else you want to add or is that …?\nJonathan Gear: I think you have it right, Lance. We've already started engaging with the government regulators, it's a very positive engagement there. And I mean, as Lance said, I just reiterate what he said, we see no surprises this year. Given the size of this transaction, it of course requires appropriate review by government agencies. But there's nothing I think that we see, nor have we heard any feedback that would cause us any concern. And it's just the nature of the size of it, I think it will be second half completed.\nHamzah Mazari: Thank you so much.\nLance Uggla: Excellent. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Diving a bit deeper into transportation, you expect organic growth to be in the 12% to 15% range in 2021. And you mentioned dealers are performing relatively well. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the health of dealers and OEMs? And what needs to change at the customer level for you to hit your targets? Also, can you discuss a bit whether you've seen any negative impact from the full reversal now of earlier pricing concessions and transportation?\nLance Uggla: Edouard?\nEdouard Tavernier: Yes. Hi, George. Thanks for the question. So in terms of what we've assumed in our forecast in our plans is a continuation of current rates, right, which means a market in the U.S is probably down roughly 10% year-on-year. It means continuing challenges with inventories and it means by and large, significant volumes of both used cars and new cars and most dealers remaining open, even if there are kind of local business restrictions. So we have factored in all of those risks. And we can execute on our plan and our forecast within the current market environment. In terms of what we're seeing in the dealer market and signposts about the health, I would say a couple of things. Like, in the end, many dealers had a very strong 2020 because even though volumes were down, because they have to lower costs and because inventories were very low, the margins by and large, were high and dealers remained profitable throughout 2020. So in fact, most dealers are in pretty good shape coming in into 2021 and expects to remain in pretty good shape. They expect prices to remain pretty solid throughout the year. What they do see is uncertainty, right, and that uncertainty means there is risk. It means they're not bringing in all of the costs back into the dealership. And it means that there may be some ups and downs throughout the year. By and large that is the market environment we are seeing today, and that is the environment in which we can execute on our plan. George, that was the first question. Can you just remind me what the second question was?\nGeorge Tong: Yes. If there has been any negative impact from the full reversal now of pricing concessions?\nEdouard Tavernier: Yes, it's a great question. Thanks for asking it. So I think we mentioned on the Q3 call, that as we were removing the pricing concessions, we would be tracking the retention rates very, very closely through Q3 and Q4. Well, the great news is, it remained very, very strong, right. So our cancellation rates have remained low, even as we took out the option to suspend service and we're very happy about this. If you remember back in Q2, when the crisis struck, we said, the most important thing for our business is to make sure that when we come out of the crisis, we come out with customer relationships that are even stronger than they were coming into the crisis. That's why we made hard decisions. That's why we took the short-term kind of revenue hit because we believe that we had to do to get through the pandemic. I think we're coming out of it in the right place with very strong customer relationships with critical products and with high retention rates.\nLance Uggla: Thank you, Edouard. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line at Jeff Silber with BMO. Your line is now open.\nJeff Silber: Thank you so much. I've had a few investors ask me this question, so I'll just ask you. Can you talk a little bit about morale and internal turnover at your company since the merger announcement, especially in light of last month's announcement of the new divisional structure for the combined company? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Okay. So, no, it's a good question. So there's not a lot of product sales, management overlaps in terms of the products and services that both companies offer. And we have a lot of opportunity for revenue synergies, where we're going to have to apply new people to work on the new opportunity sets. So therefore, the synergies come across all of the shared services. And of course, in a merger like this, we put in retention in order to keep the team's well motivated, intact with performance, successful performance, related retention that ties into us executing the deal really well. And that goes across the executives, including myself that will stay on post closing to help make sure the deals have success. And other people across the shared services that may not be having long-term roles, but their short-term roles are very important and therefore we structure in compensation to help make that happen. I have to say, as we went into the end of the year, post the merger announcement, we really had -- and the pandemic, we've really been operating that the absolute highest satisfaction levels in the firm that we've ever had. It's been a real pleasure, motivating people through the pandemic, getting the teams working on, running the company in a tough time doing the merger. And post the merger, we've announced our hub platform, JV with CME, our Cappitech acquisition, there's no stopping. And this is the company that's going into a close of a merger in the second half. We're still doing the things that IHS Markit has been designed to do and does very well. And so, no, I'm very pleased with how everybody has responded, the morale and how we're treating employees that may be without a long-term job post the close.\nJeff Silber: Can you disclose the dollar -- Oh, I'm sorry. just the [multiple speakers]?\nLance Uggla: The dollar amount of the synergy?\nJeff Silber: Of the retention. Yes, the retentions.\nLance Uggla: Yes, I think it's all done. Jonathan, do you want to talk whatever has been disclosed there?\nJonathan Gear: So then that was -- I was over talked obviously. The dollar amount of the retention on fees.\nLance Uggla: Yes, please. Yes, our total retention pools across the two companies.\nJonathan Gear: Sure. So we created a $60 million retention pool, which we had announced at the time of the merger. And that's a cash pool being used to retained that jobs, which could potentially be at risk. Now, I'll emphasize potentially, as you can imagine, you do a merger like this, a lot of excitement at the individual level, people worry about what it means for me personally. And that retention pool really allows, as Lance said, it basically buys time for people to kind of see what their future looks like kind of going forward and kind of derisk the delivery of this year. But the $60 million pool which we've -- which we began to roll out shortly after announcing the merger.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.\nLance Uggla: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you. I was hoping you could speak a little bit more to the Hub announcement you made last week, certainly a handful of major players coming together for that initiative. And so I'm wondering if you could speak to the specific set of middle and/or back office solutions the company is targeting? I think there's already a handful of skilled players in that space, so I want to make sure I understand where and the asset manager operation stack hub plan to play? And then also how hub will be differentiated versus some of the incumbents in that space. Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Right. Okay. Well, hub initiates out of two very large customers that were looking at opportunities to create efficiencies with respect to technology going forward. And those were announced in the press release PIMCO and Man Group. And they have a very close relation given the PIMCO CEO, was formerly the Man Group CEO. So close relationship and both CEOs looking at the forward use of two new technologies to create efficiencies in the total cost of ownership of the solutions that they're needed. And so Hub's initial job is to build a foundation of client transaction and reference data, storage for the management of the activities of the middle and back office of an asset manager. So therefore reducing the inefficiencies that happen from using multiple different systems. And you know it -- it's early stage. Microsoft as a partner is, of course, a choice of Azure with respect to the build and advisory on the build. McKinsey, of course, great partner who has worked -- who are working with asset managers who are trying to make their forward technology decisions. And State Street, great partner because they manage the outsourced back office for PIMCO and ourselves, who have a lot of experience that data management and the build out of financial services technologies. So it's really a joint venture of [indiscernible], where we have many, many owners who are going to own a build of a foundation technology, that will help bring asset management total cost of ownership down across the middle and back office functional needs to better manage those datasets. And it will be a platform that connect -- will connect to all the industry administrators over time. Various software assets, OMS, PMS risk management, risk attribution pricing, a real integrated hub, hence the name that looks to reduce the costs of management data with respect to a big asset manager. And the two asset managers that are announced in the transaction, of course, they have a lot of knowledge and IP themselves, and will be putting that expertise to work as we look at the forward plans of Hub. I don't know, Adam, if you want to add anything else, or we can pause there and -- okay, so we'll go for the next question. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. ESG is a high growth area and it will be an important part of your future with S&P. And for S&P, we know that their ESG revenue is about $60 million annualized growing at about 40%. How big is your ESG revenue and how fast is it growing? And are there any specific products or areas that you can talk about that you're focused on for this year, in particular? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Right. That's a good question, Toni. Our revenues as Doug and I mentioned in the combination are slightly larger, but they're a little bit different than what you'd call the purebred ESG revenues because we don't have an ESG rating products per se, we have a whole bunch of products that really play into the E of ESG, and will be naturally combined and will create synergies with the S&P products. So for example, we have a carbon registry, which is where we’re -- where we have voluntary emissions receipts that are used for carbon offsets. We also build carbon auction platforms Costa Rica, California, Quebec, to name a few. And those auction platforms for pricing of carbon locally in a state or a region or a country are increasingly important and we'll continue to build those out. And then within our energy and transportation businesses, of course, we have a lot of geo-location data around all the energy-related assets, which are important to the climate discussions going forward. We have a lot of data with respect to some of the land use around agriculture. We have, of course, knowledge of the tailpipe emissions of all the automotive fleets. So we have these, what you would call is within all of our businesses, we have parts of the E of ESG. And when we combine that with the ESG rating services, the Trucost, the RobecoSAM's of S&P Global, we start to have a much more significant circa $125 million to $150 million of kind of base revenues that need to be brought together and then continued to grow at double digits. Doug has mentioned the 40% publicly. We've never really talked about our growth rate, but it's also strong double digits.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Toni. Next question, maybe our final one.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate you squeezing me in here at the end. Lance, actually wanted to ask a question about financial services, which has been such a steady business for you and specifically in solutions and Ipreo, can you give us an update on sort of performance of alternatives broadly? And then I wonder, if you might talk a little bit about a couple of trends. And I wonder if you're participating here, if you have any thoughts, and those would be Bitcoin, and the emergence of SPACs as funding vehicles, are those areas where you think Ipreo can monetize over time along with alternatives?\nLance Uggla: Now, those are both good questions, and I'll start and then Adam can conclude. So first off, our financial services business has proved even through this tough year of the pandemic to provide us strong mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth. And I don't see that waning going forward. And I think with the synergies has an opportunity to accelerate. Ipreo, as an acquisition and now hopefully embedded part of our financial services business is accretive to our growth. And it's accretive to our growth, because of the market activity that occurred this year through the pandemic, but equally the alternatives business, which brings me to that second part of your question, which is I think we're one of two platforms that significantly plays in the alternative space, private equity, private debt and the provision of services that will help the GP LP relationship managed more effectively. And that strong double-digit growth for us, whether it's valuations, whether it's reporting, whether it's our new index JV, we've got some real exciting growth assets and ones that we can continue to build on. We don't have any plans at the moment, I don't know about S&P Global, but ourselves. With respect to Bitcoin, maybe Adam is going to correct me in a moment but I'll leave him to do so, but not that nothing big and significant. Of course, we have every millennial that works for us, thinks we should have a major pricing data services, software, in participation around a marketplace that is really legitimizing itself. So we've got to take it seriously. And so, I expect pricing and data services, et cetera that we normally would provide any OTC pricing or contracts, those types of things, we'll be looking to value and participate. The second part, which you mentioned was facts. Well, to me, facts are just another form of a new issue. So therefore the Ipreo teams through their activities, stay on top of all the new issuance. And so as SPAC participates into the marketplace, if there's any follow on equity activity, et cetera, of course, they would be participating. But in terms of this setup for management, that's not something that we do. But I imagine the data sets, et cetera will be ones as they continue to grow that we've got to keep track of. Adam, do you want to add anything else to that?\nAdam Kansler: I think you covered things well, Lance. Maybe two quick comments. First on the Ipreo acquisition, I mean that really is fully integrated today. So we don't look at it separately, but each of those businesses is continued to perform really well, really providing central market infrastructure in a couple of places in highly volatile and really complicated financial markets over this past year, and it performed incredibly well and brought transparency and enhanced capabilities. And that includes, you mentioned SPACs, the level of issuance in the SPAC market, many of those transactions, again carried through our platforms. In the alternatives segment of that Ipreo business, combination with our existing capabilities like valuation, data management, the expansion into credit asset classes has proven to be consistent with where the markets are going. The increased flow of capital into those spaces, has positioned those businesses well to be market leaders in providing portfolio management tools, risk management tools, in particular data management tools. We go forward to both GP and LP community, those businesses have grown well up into the double digits over this past year. And we see that for the next several years ahead. And the last point I'd make is around crypto. Though not a singular focus for us, we obviously are responding to our customers needs to be able to value those products. You'll see last November, we announced a partnership with a firm called Lukka. We have several other tactical partnerships, so we do collect a lot of different pricing and reference data and other valuation information around cryptocurrencies in order to help customers value portfolios that may include cryptocurrencies. So it's an area we'll continue to focus not just on the valuations side, but probably even moving into the index side and near future as well.\nLance Uggla: Okay, thanks. Thanks, Adam, and thanks everybody for your questions today. I'll turn it back to the Eric, operator.\nEric Boyer: We thank you for your interest in IHS Markit. This call can be accessed via replay 855-859-2056 or international dial-in 404-537-3406, conference ID 8089142, beginning in about 2 hours and running through January 20, 2021.

            "name": "Adam Kansler",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Lance. There will be much more to come over the next few months as we bring the two businesses together. But as a sort of as a high level answer to your question, you have a very common set of customers, common set of workflows and a lot of the same data enriching the workflows that the customers use on multiple platforms across the CME assets and ours. So this opportunity to bring it together, you'll have a much more complete dataset across all of those workflows, certainly within the derivatives markets, giving you the opportunity to build additional analytical tools, workflow tools, and things that allow our customers to manage their risk and processes more efficiently. I think they've -- the customer set has found for many years that maintain these data sets and these workflows in multiple places is highly inefficient, it's expensive and it causes breaks in some circumstances. So this is an opportunity to improve the risk management profile for our customer set, bring efficiency, bring their costs down and bring a better set of tools. So there will certainly be innovation and new applications and tools against those data sets and in bringing those workflows together over time. Yes, thanks, Lance. A lot of this was discussed by both Doug and Lance at the time of the merger. And I think a lot of those themes remain true, and as we've continued to explore and get ready for integration, a lot of those original themes have played out. And that's really looking at the scale of data and insights available to the combined business. The ability to put the massive data sets and content available through the market intelligence platform into some of the technology solutions we offer to our customers in their reg and compliance, risk management workflows should be a real game changer in their ability to make decisions and us to give them a very efficient platform for consuming those wide ranging datasets. If you look for -- look at a corporate customer group, automotive, oil and gas, engineering companies will have the opportunity to give them both financial market and risk capabilities they need to run their business, but also data tools capabilities, let them thrive in their core markets with deep industry specific expertise, market insight and including things like asset valuations which we have been able to give before because of the -- really -- that expertise that we're now bringing to that core customer set that's a user of the market intelligence products. So that -- those are sort of the key areas. It's really the combination of a cross asset cross industry data set with workflow solutions already touching many of those same customers. I think you covered things well, Lance. Maybe two quick comments. First on the Ipreo acquisition, I mean that really is fully integrated today.

            "name": "Lance Uggla",
            "content": "Oh, sorry. There we go. The first mute of the year. There we go. If everybody can go mute on the teams, there we go. Okay. So I will start fresh. Thank you, Eric, and happy New Year and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 earnings call. We achieved a lot in 2020, solid financial results proving the resiliency of our business model; greater levels of innovation across the company; higher employee satisfaction scores; and finally, we announced a strategic merger with S&P Global, which will create the leading global information services provider. Overall, we finished the year ahead of expectations and are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. We are updating our adjusted EPS by $0.03 due to our share repurchase restriction because of the pending merger. Now onto the financial highlights for the quarter and the year. When we speak to Q4 and fiscal year results, they are normalized to exclude the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth rates for organic revenue and adjusted EPS. Organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter and the year, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was 160 basis points in the quarter and 250 basis points for the year, and adjusted EPS growth was 11% in the quarter and 13% for the year. In terms of our core industry verticals, I'll provide Q4 and full-year 2020 highlights and our outlook for 2021. First, our Financial Services segment had organic revenue growth of 6% in Q4 and 5% for the full-year. In 2020, within information, we continue to benefit from the innovation and demand for our pricing, reference data and valuations offerings. The successful launch of new regulatory solutions, notably our SFTR reporting platform, and we had strong growth from indices led by our fixed income and newly launched ESG indices. Within Solutions, we continue to invest in our leading products and integration capabilities, launched private debt investment lifecycle solution and experienced robust growth from continued expansion of our managed corporate action solutions. Within Processing, we invested in our core OTC and loan settlement platforms to help the industry facilitate the IBOR transition and regulatory requirements. We also successfully service the industry through one of the most volatile periods in recent history. In 2021, we expect organic growth within financial services in the 6% to 8% range. Within information, growth will be led by increasing customer demand and new products within our pricing, reference data and valuation services businesses. We also expect continued strength for our regulatory reporting and compliance offerings. Within this business, we'll integrate our recent acquisition of Cappitech, which will help solidify our leading industry position. Now within Solutions, we expect high growth across our diversified offerings, and a rebound in managed services and implementation of projects. In particular, we are looking for a strong year from our onboarding and compliance management tools, expansion of our portfolio and data management solutions into new sectors and continued high growth in private market offerings. We also expect normalized levels of equity and debt issuance that will drive solid performance in our syndication and book building businesses. Processing is expected to be slightly up year-over-year with mixed market conditions in both loans and derivative markets. Now let's move on to transportation, with organic revenue growth in the quarter of 2% and a decline of 2% for the year. In 2020, the pandemic had a major impact on the automotive industry. And we responded proactively to the crisis by working with our customers and continue to see the rebound in our business with recurring organic growth of 6% in Q4. During the pandemic, we also increased our focus on driving adoption of newer products, such as CARFAX for Life, while accelerating product innovation across our portfolios in areas such as marketing audiences, enhanced compliance simulation and Mastermind now available for used cars. Our Maritime & Trade business had a solid year, excluding the impact of the cancellation of our TPM conference. In 2021, we expect organic growth within transportation in the 12% to 15% range. We expect our automotive business to revert to its longer-term growth range. Although economic uncertainty remains, our dealer-facing businesses have strong momentum going into 2021, and the strong retention rates we've maintained through 2020 attest to the critical nature of our products. Product support in our OEM and supplier customers will recover more gradually as the industry adjusts to lower long-term volumes coming out of COVID. In addition to the underlying growth in the business, we expect to see a one-time pickup in organic growth from pricing being at normal levels for the full-year, specifically within CARFAX and Mastermind businesses. And final -- finally, Maritime & Trade will continue to see accelerating subscription growth, driven by product innovation in our risk and compliance and commodities analytics businesses. Moving on to resources, where organic decline was 11% in the quarter and negative 5% for the full-year. In 2020, our upstream business was impacted by the industry undergoing severe CapEx reductions, leading to cost pressure within our customer base and bankruptcies, particularly in North America. Our downstream organic revenue growth proved resilient, when normalizing for our events. Growth within our gas, power and renewables businesses were driven by customer expansion into areas such as wind, battery, solar, and hydrogen services. This was somewhat offset by lower non-recurring revenue within consulting. We also completed the integration of the agribusiness and acquired truView, a small upstream analytics company. And in 2021, we expect organic revenue results within resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits. Our downstream businesses are expected to return to mid-single-digit organic growth, driven by continued demand for our pricing, chemical information, the release of additional plastic circularity products, a new database of estimated energy chain emissions and from the realization of synergies from the agribusiness integrations. Within our upstream businesses, we expect customer CapEx spend to continue to be constrained for our annual contract value, which will bottom in Q1. In 2021, we excite -- are excited to launch our new predictive analytics tools that will marry our upstream and midstream global data sets with our proprietary insights and research and will drive additional forward growth. Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was 0% for the quarter, and 1% normalized for the impact of BPVC for the full year. Product design proved its resilience with organic growth in the low single digits, normalized for BPVC, while TMT and ECR performed as expected. In 2021, we expect our organic revenue growth to be in the mid single digits. Moving on to some of our recently announced strategic initiatives. We entered into a 50-50 joint venture with shared control with CME to combine our post trade services, including trade processing and risk mitigation operations. The venture is going to incorporate our MarkitSERV business and CME's optimization business. Through the combination, we will achieve increased operating efficiencies and new revenue opportunities by being able to better service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rates, FX, equity and credit asset classes. We expect the deal to close in the summer and to be neutral to our adjusted earnings in the near-term. And finally, we announced the strategic merger with S&P Global, which joins two world class organizations with unique highly complementary assets. This combination creates a pro forma company with increased scale world class products in core markets and strong joint offerings in the high growth adjacencies, including ESG and energy transition, private assets and small and medium enterprises, counterparty risk management, supply chain and trade and alternative data are unique and complementary assets will leverage cutting edge innovation and technology capability including the IHS Markit Data Lake, and S&P Global's Kensho to enhance the customer value proposition. For IHS Markit shareholders, employees and customers, merging with S&P Global was the best strategic fit to create the most long-term value. Post the merger announcement, Doug Peterson, CEO of S&P Global announced his executive team for the pro forma company, which includes the following members of my Executive team. First, Adam Kansler will lead the combined S&P Global market intelligence business and the IHS Markit Financial Services segment. Edouard Tavernier will lead the Transportation segment. Sari Granat will be the combined company's Chief Admin Officer and General Counsel; and Sally Moore will lead Strategic Alliances and will have responsibility for Corporate Development and Strategy. Other members of my Executive team and myself have also agreed to help with the integration for 12 to 18 months post the close. I believe Doug has assembled a great executive team that will bring together members of both companies, including -- and then give the leadership and -- sorry, Doug has assembled a great executive team that will bring together members of both companies leadership, and will be a great first step in merging the two companies. And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan. Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. We managed through the many challenges of 2020 very well and are positioned to have a strong 2021. We're excited about the merger with S&P Global, and believe it will create long-term value for shareholders, new insights and capabilities for customers and greater opportunities for employees. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support and our colleagues around the world for their dedication and focus through what was a very challenging 2020. Operator, we're ready to open the lines for questions. Okay. Why don't I start, then I'll pass it to Adam, who did the transaction for us. But this was something that when we originally thought about selling MarkitSERV, we actually thought that there would be a impetus to buyers that wanted to find ways to consolidate the assets. But I think given that the assets are primarily held by strategics and consortia and a variety of industry-owned relationships, it -- I think, it proved a tall order for any private equity firm to create that consolidation. And so post that, we looked at the strategic assets across the industry. And, of course, between ourselves and CME, we have the majority of the OTC processing assets. And so, therefore, the synergies for both on the cost side, but also in terms of the servicing the customer and creating incremental margin for investment stood out really strong. And we think that the consolidation of processing assets across the industry is something that this -- the CME IHS Markit transaction as a JV is a first step. But why don't I pass it over to Adam, who can give you some incremental color. Adam? Thanks, Adam. Next question. Jonathan, do you want to start and then pass that to Brian or vice versa? You're going to mute the other one, Brian. Use the other call. All right, thank you. Yes. Right. Thanks. Thanks, Brian and Jonathan. Now next question. Maybe I can start, Brian, and then I'll hand it to you. So first off, if you look at our business, it's a 50% upstream, consulting data analytics. And, of course, that business is different than the S&P global business. And so there aren't the numerous product synergies, but there's definitely scale with customers and new customer opportunities for opportunity. As you shift down through chemicals, agriculture, Opus, all the pricing, McCloskey Coal indices, as you get into the pricing and indices, of course, all of those services, where we have synergies between them, have the same opportunity set with the Platts teams. So we're quite excited about the mid and downstream synergies around the pricing and new services, ex where there's overlap and we'll have to address that within the closing of the merger. But that's a small piece of the revenue. Brian, do you want to add to that? Hey, thanks. Thanks, Brian. Next question. Okay. Edouard, do you want to pick that one? Thanks, Edouard. Next question. Okay. Sure, Alex. Yes, we'll do, Alex. Thanks for the question. In terms of the 100 basis points margin performance, again, that's really just building, as you know and in last fiscal year, a very usual fiscal year for us many, many ways. But we did make some structural changes in our costs, and we're seeing a flow through there. That's less than normal growth rates that we're seeing on the 6% to 8% total that helps drive that overall margin. I think you will see particular as we flow through -- I would look at FY '21 as a relatively normal year. The comparison to '20 is where it gets a bit harry at times from quarter-to-quarter. So Q2, in transportation, for example, was a particularly challenging time for us. I think you'll see some odd seasonality on year-on-year comparisons there. But I would think of FY '21 really a pretty normal year for us. Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Thanks. Next question. Sure. Okay. Well, we'll maybe focus this question around market intelligence and financial services, because that is the area where we have substantive product related synergies. And it really -- and I'll pass it to Adam to add on to this as well. But if we start with the Data Lake and Kensho, the Data Lake is where I just mark it has been 3 years organizing all of its alternative data sets into a common library with ease of access for both our internal use, as well as now to commercialize to customers. So we've done the heavy lifting to organize those datasets. S&P Global acquired the Kensho assets, which are advanced analytics data science experts, which have scale and size, that are very excited to begin -- to be able to begin working with the information alternative data sets that we have to help provide new forms of decision-making schools, decision-making signals, as well as trading signals, alerts and just deeper decision making tools and ways that without the organized data sets tied to advanced analytics platform like Kensho, you don't have the same opportunity to do so. So that's the first thing. The second thing is market intelligence is a platform that has hundreds of thousands of users that are active on the platform. And that gives us an opportunity for direct distribution, as well as the buildup of tools and services to be offered on the platform. And I'll let Adam add on to that because there's several other ways the two financial services groups that Adam will lead have revenue synergies mapped out and excited about going forward. Adam? Thanks, Adam. Next question. Okay. Let me start with that. Yes, so the Data Lake we launched the commercialization in the first half of 2020. And we started off with several proof-of-concepts with bigger active large users, hedge funds, banks that have big decision making, strategies around the use of alternative data. And so far, we started to commercialize those relationships, turn them into longer term contracts. Contracts are reasonably sized with term and give the customers the ability to be able to access parts or all of the library for defined decision-making purposes. So -- and then sometimes, the ability to create some form of redistribution that fits into their own products and services that wouldn't cannibalize our datasets. So we're building out two things. One, the pipeline of customers. Two, we've now started to convert the customers, I don't want to say we've converted 100 customers, but we've definitely have converted 10 customers in the year, so that's starting to pick up. We have a great pipeline and we have numerous ways of creating the commercial set. Somebody is typing -- oh, you must be typing your notes, right? That's all right. Okay. So then the next bit that I'd like to say is that, for us the Data Lake gives us a speed of development of new products, but also this ability to attach our content with our customers content and give them new unique ways of leveraging and utilizing the data sets. So we see a bunch of efficiencies, and a bunch of commercial activities, of which we've started to get a positive trend going on those already. Of the second part of the questions on the events, I'll pass it over to Jonathan. Can I add, Jonathan, as we -- one of the things I'd say, Shlomo, that I was quite impressed with is with the -- with virtual events we do have experience running CERAWeek India last year, which we did with positive revenue. And so we're applying that virtual model to the bigger CERAWeek event for 2021. And I have to say that the customer take up in terms of participating on in the events, as well as sponsoring and participating from a commercial perspective, has been reasonable. And so I've been quite impressed with the team's work. I know, they've involved me with some of the discussions in building some of the panels up et cetera. But they're doing a great job and I know they won't be able to produce the revenue they did physically, but they sure are building some momentum to add some revenue, positive revenue for virtual events as well. And let's see how that plays out in the quarter going into next quarter, but they'll definitely have a number. Thanks. Next question. Okay. Well, first off, our expectation is that it will close in the second half. We don't see anything specifically. That's going to create any substantive hurdles. So all the hurdles that we knew going into it in terms of the business overlap within our Platts and Opus's businesses are there, and the teams are working to address those. And so my view is, there shouldn't be any significant roadblocks or hurdles. We'd expect to close in the second half and expect the teams to work with the regulatory bodies to determine the precise nature of the overlap of any assets, which is substantive is insignificant in terms of size across the transaction. I don't know, Jonathan, anything else you want to add or is that ...? Excellent. Next question. Edouard? Thank you, Edouard. Next question. Okay. So, no, it's a good question. So there's not a lot of product sales, management overlaps in terms of the products and services that both companies offer. And we have a lot of opportunity for revenue synergies, where we're going to have to apply new people to work on the new opportunity sets. So therefore, the synergies come across all of the shared services. And of course, in a merger like this, we put in retention in order to keep the team's well motivated, intact with performance, successful performance, related retention that ties into us executing the deal really well. And that goes across the executives, including myself that will stay on post closing to help make sure the deals have success. And other people across the shared services that may not be having long-term roles, but their short-term roles are very important and therefore we structure in compensation to help make that happen. I have to say, as we went into the end of the year, post the merger announcement, we really had -- and the pandemic, we've really been operating that the absolute highest satisfaction levels in the firm that we've ever had. It's been a real pleasure, motivating people through the pandemic, getting the teams working on, running the company in a tough time doing the merger. And post the merger, we've announced our hub platform, JV with CME, our Cappitech acquisition, there's no stopping. And this is the company that's going into a close of a merger in the second half. We're still doing the things that IHS Markit has been designed to do and does very well. And so, no, I'm very pleased with how everybody has responded, the morale and how we're treating employees that may be without a long-term job post the close. The dollar amount of the synergy? Yes, I think it's all done. Jonathan, do you want to talk whatever has been disclosed there? Yes, please. Yes, our total retention pools across the two companies. Thank you. Next question. Right. Okay. Well, hub initiates out of two very large customers that were looking at opportunities to create efficiencies with respect to technology going forward. And those were announced in the press release PIMCO and Man Group. And they have a very close relation given the PIMCO CEO, was formerly the Man Group CEO. So close relationship and both CEOs looking at the forward use of two new technologies to create efficiencies in the total cost of ownership of the solutions that they're needed. And so Hub's initial job is to build a foundation of client transaction and reference data, storage for the management of the activities of the middle and back office of an asset manager. So therefore reducing the inefficiencies that happen from using multiple different systems. And you know it -- it's early stage. Microsoft as a partner is, of course, a choice of Azure with respect to the build and advisory on the build. McKinsey, of course, great partner who has worked -- who are working with asset managers who are trying to make their forward technology decisions. And State Street, great partner because they manage the outsourced back office for PIMCO and ourselves, who have a lot of experience that data management and the build out of financial services technologies. So it's really a joint venture of [indiscernible], where we have many, many owners who are going to own a build of a foundation technology, that will help bring asset management total cost of ownership down across the middle and back office functional needs to better manage those datasets. And it will be a platform that connect -- will connect to all the industry administrators over time. Various software assets, OMS, PMS risk management, risk attribution pricing, a real integrated hub, hence the name that looks to reduce the costs of management data with respect to a big asset manager. And the two asset managers that are announced in the transaction, of course, they have a lot of knowledge and IP themselves, and will be putting that expertise to work as we look at the forward plans of Hub. I don't know, Adam, if you want to add anything else, or we can pause there and -- okay, so we'll go for the next question. Thank you. Right. That's a good question, Toni. Our revenues as Doug and I mentioned in the combination are slightly larger, but they're a little bit different than what you'd call the purebred ESG revenues because we don't have an ESG rating products per se, we have a whole bunch of products that really play into the E of ESG, and will be naturally combined and will create synergies with the S&P products. So for example, we have a carbon registry, which is where we're -- where we have voluntary emissions receipts that are used for carbon offsets. We also build carbon auction platforms Costa Rica, California, Quebec, to name a few. And those auction platforms for pricing of carbon locally in a state or a region or a country are increasingly important and we'll continue to build those out. And then within our energy and transportation businesses, of course, we have a lot of geo-location data around all the energy-related assets, which are important to the climate discussions going forward. We have a lot of data with respect to some of the land use around agriculture. We have, of course, knowledge of the tailpipe emissions of all the automotive fleets. So we have these, what you would call is within all of our businesses, we have parts of the E of ESG. And when we combine that with the ESG rating services, the Trucost, the RobecoSAM's of S&P Global, we start to have a much more significant circa $125 million to $150 million of kind of base revenues that need to be brought together and then continued to grow at double digits. Doug has mentioned the 40% publicly. We've never really talked about our growth rate, but it's also strong double digits. Thanks, Toni. Next question, maybe our final one. Now, those are both good questions, and I'll start and then Adam can conclude. So first off, our financial services business has proved even through this tough year of the pandemic to provide us strong mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth. And I don't see that waning going forward. And I think with the synergies has an opportunity to accelerate. Ipreo, as an acquisition and now hopefully embedded part of our financial services business is accretive to our growth. And it's accretive to our growth, because of the market activity that occurred this year through the pandemic, but equally the alternatives business, which brings me to that second part of your question, which is I think we're one of two platforms that significantly plays in the alternative space, private equity, private debt and the provision of services that will help the GP LP relationship managed more effectively. And that strong double-digit growth for us, whether it's valuations, whether it's reporting, whether it's our new index JV, we've got some real exciting growth assets and ones that we can continue to build on. We don't have any plans at the moment, I don't know about S&P Global, but ourselves. With respect to Bitcoin, maybe Adam is going to correct me in a moment but I'll leave him to do so, but not that nothing big and significant. Of course, we have every millennial that works for us, thinks we should have a major pricing data services, software, in participation around a marketplace that is really legitimizing itself. So we've got to take it seriously. And so, I expect pricing and data services, et cetera that we normally would provide any OTC pricing or contracts, those types of things, we'll be looking to value and participate. The second part, which you mentioned was facts. Well, to me, facts are just another form of a new issue. So therefore the Ipreo teams through their activities, stay on top of all the new issuance. And so as SPAC participates into the marketplace, if there's any follow on equity activity, et cetera, of course, they would be participating. But in terms of this setup for management, that's not something that we do. But I imagine the data sets, et cetera will be ones as they continue to grow that we've got to keep track of. Adam, do you want to add anything else to that? Okay, thanks. Thanks, Adam, and thanks everybody for your questions today. I'll turn it back to the Eric, operator."

            "name": "Jonathan Gear",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Lance. We have a strong finish to the year with results ahead of our expectations. Our Q4 financial performance included revenue of $1.107 billion, with organic growth of 0% and all-in revenue of negative 1%, GAAP net income of $151 million and GAAP EPS of $0.38; adjusted EBITDA of $465 million, an increase a 3% with margins of 42.0% and adjusted EPS was $0.72, an increase of $0.07 or 11%. We were pleased with the finish of the year, and a solid revenue and profit performance we delivered throughout 2020. Relative to revenue, our Q4 organic revenue growth of 0% included recurring organic growth of 2% and nonrecurring organic growth of negative 11%. Moving to segment performance, Financial Services revenue growth was 7%, including 6% organic and 1% FX. Recurring organic was 6%, while nonrecurring organic growth was 9%. Our information business organic was 4% led by strength in our pricing indices and equities information products. Our processing organic was 1% as we saw a return to growth in loan markets offset by a slight decline in derivatives processing. Solutions organic was 10% due primarily to strong performance in our corporate actions, private markets and digital businesses. Transportation had revenue decline of negative 4% including 2% organic, flat FX and divestiture of negative 6%. Organic growth was comprised of 6% recurring and negative 9% nonrecurring. Resources revenue declined 11%, including negative 11% organic and flat FX. Recurring organic was negative 8% and nonrecurring organic was negative 32%. Our Q4 ACV decreased $22 million and our full-year ACV decreased $74 million, down 9% versus prior year. We ended the year with ACV of $719 million, which now include agri of approximately $30 million. CMS revenue declined 2%, including 0%, our benchmarking business divestiture impact of negative 1% and flat FX, recurring organic was 2% and nonrecurring organic growth was negative 13%. Turning now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was $465 million, up 3%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.0%, up 160 basis points. Moving to segment profitability, Financial Services adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.7%, up 260 basis points; Transportations margin was 45.3%, up 350 basis points; Resources margin was 40.2%, down 200 basis points and CMS margin was 24.7%, up 20 basis points. GAAP net income was $151 million or $0.38 per share. Our adjusted EPS was $0.72 per diluted share, a $0.07 or 11% improvement over the prior year. Our full-year adjusted tax rate was 18%.Q4 free cash flow was $275 million. Our full year free cash flow was $940 million and represented a conversion rate of 51%. As a reminder, our full year conversion rate was impacted by several nonrecurring items. Turning to the balance sheet, our year-end debt balance was $4.9 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis, and we closed the quarter with $126 million of cash. At year end, our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.2 billion. Our Q4 fully diluted weighted average share count was 400.5 million shares, and our full year was 401.5 million shares. We completed the 200 million ASR in November of 2020. Our full-year share repurchases were approximately $1.1 billion or 14.6 million shares at an average price of $73.71. The merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares, and therefore our share repurchase program is currently suspended. Other than for the purchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share-based compensation. We paid a dividend of $67 million in Q4 for an FY 2020 total of $270 million of dividends. The merger agreement allows for the continued paying of a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future. And we are recommending to our Board for the approval in our January 2021 meeting to increase a quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.20 per share, effective for the Q1 2021 dividend payment. Moving to full year of financial results. When we speak to full-year results they are normalized to exclude the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture, and the cancellation of Q2 events on growth raised for organic revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Total full-year revenue was $4.288 billion, which represent a decline of negative 3%, 0% organic, negative 2%, [technical difficulty] flat FX. Turning now to reported profits, adjusted EBITDA was $1.837 billion, up 8% versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.8% with reported margin expansion of 250 basis points. GAAP net income was $871 million with GAAP EPS of $2.17, and adjusted EPS was $2.84, a 13% increase versus prior year. In terms of guidance, we are reiterating our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, and updating our adjusted EPS for a $0.03 impact due to our inability to repurchase shares as a result of the pending merger. Our 2021 guidance is as follows. Revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%. Adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points, and adjusted EPS of $3.11 to $3.16 per year. Finally, we do expect cash conversion in the mid 60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance. Sure. I'll go ahead and start and then pass on to Brian Crotty. Manav, so we've – the resources really is playing out as we expect it back in Q2 of this year when we saw the impact coming in on upstream. And we're seeing a two-tier world, obviously, where upstream business challenged by the external markets and the downstream business performing pretty much in line on the subscription side. The -- with the ACV as we kind of we need to lap a full 12 months from the restructuring of the marketplace, which took place in kind of mid-Q2. As we know and as we've discussed on previous calls, we've kind of leaned into this pretty heavily, worked closely with our customers and industry customers around us, but it does take a full 12 months. So as we look forward, we -- Q4 performed as we expected. We expect further decline of Q1, but Q1 for ACV being – bottoming out and then building in Q2. But I'll pass over to Brian for any specific color that he's seeing. Brian, I don't think we can -- I don't think we can hear, Brian. I think you're ... Thank you. Sure. We will do, Andrew. And I will kind of call you to take a look at the supplemental, you kind of see what happened in FY '20, and then I'll kind of tell you to see what's going to happen FY '21. But if we just go back over on what happened last year, as a reminder, when COVID hit, we gave significant price concessions voluntarily, particularly in transportation in Q2 a little bit, I would also add Andrew, in Q3, it leaked a little bit into Q3. As we look forward now right now, so first the industry overall has seen a strong recovery in the second half of 2020. In fact, I just tried to buy -- turning safety and I try to buy a used car, it's very hard to find a used car right now and speaks to the strength of the industry. But I did use CARFAX basically to find a great car, I would recommend it to you, Andrew. But if you look for the industry has recovered there. So as we see that performance in FY '21, we're seeing a pretty healthy industry, particularly at the dealership level. As Edouard mentioned, we do work closely and support the health of our dealer customers. So we're being careful as to how we look at value capture the price increase the timing around that. But right now we're seeing our customers doing pretty well and that's reflected in kind of our expectations. But Edouard anything else you want to comment on? Great. Thanks, Lance. So on the events, as we know, we offer events throughout the year. But Q2 is our heavy, heavy events month from a revenue perspective, where we have our three large flagship events of CERAWeek, the World Petrochemical Conference and the TPM Conference in our Maritime segment. We are not planning on holding those physical events this year. So when we look at our forecast -- revenue forecast for the year, we've taken that -- we've anticipated no revenue from physical events. We are, however, holding virtual events in those three events. The revenue from those is significantly lower, Shlomo. So don't expect to see a significant pop there. But I think it's important way for our teams to continue to lead the industry and lead in with our customers and help connect the industry during these times. So again, you won't see any revenue -- significant revenue from events for us in FY '21, but we will be holding the events virtually. I think you have it right, Lance. We've already started engaging with the government regulators, it's a very positive engagement there. And I mean, as Lance said, I just reiterate what he said, we see no surprises this year. Given the size of this transaction, it of course requires appropriate review by government agencies. But there's nothing I think that we see, nor have we heard any feedback that would cause us any concern. And it's just the nature of the size of it, I think it will be second half completed. So then that was -- I was over talked obviously. The dollar amount of the retention on fees. Sure. So we created a $60 million retention pool, which we had announced at the time of the merger. And that's a cash pool being used to retained that jobs, which could potentially be at risk. Now, I'll emphasize potentially, as you can imagine, you do a merger like this, a lot of excitement at the individual level, people worry about what it means for me personally. And that retention pool really allows, as Lance said, it basically buys time for people to kind of see what their future looks like kind of going forward and kind of derisk the delivery of this year. But the $60 million pool which we've -- which we began to roll out shortly after announcing the merger."

            "content": "Oh, okay. Sorry. Yes, I said, Jonathan, you're exactly right. When I look at the ACVs, it's really upstream that drove the decline in ACV. When you look out at the next year, you can see ... Can you hear me now? I'm sorry. Okay. Yes, when you look at the ACVs on the rest of the group, you can see them improving steadily. And even upstream, we hit bottom in Q1 and then we steadily improve and get positive ACV in Q2, Q3 and Q4. Yes. I think for us, it gives us a whole new customer base as well. When you look at wholesalers, convenience store marketers, even penetrates us more into traders. So I think that was a good thing for the Opus acquisition. Also, pricing services tend to have stickier renewal rates. And then the strong news component gives us a lower end product to up-sell higher end services. So I think strategically it was a very good acquisition."

            "name": "Edouard Tavernier",
            "content": "Yes, happy to pick it up. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. So on the pricing side, there will be price increases in 2021, and we will proceed carefully. Let's remember that across North America, we're still in the middle of the pandemic. So we are still reflected on exactly the right time to introduce a price increase. So that currently is planned, but it will be a normal pricing increase and no particular catch ups. We are very focused on the health of our customers and dealer partners. In terms of the forward visibility, as you mentioned, Jeff, a lot of our transactional revenues are tied to things like marketing spend by the industry, as well as activity in the recall business. Now we're seeing some of those spend items come back, they were higher in Q4 than in Q3, and we're seeing a lot of good marketing activity coming through in Q1. So we are confident, they are on their way back. But as Lance mentioned in the introductory comments, and it will take a bit longer for them to reverse to normalized trends. We expect that in the second half of the next year. No, I think you covered the key points, Jonathan. There is a seasonality effect, right. If you look at 2020, we took a significant haircut in Q2 on revenues, even as we work in on our cost base in Q3, revenue started coming back in when costs were low, and that it creates some seasonality in the margin accretion. And you're going to see some of that play out in 2021 in the comps. But otherwise, you captured all the key points, Jonathan. Thank you. Yes. Hi, George. Thanks for the question. So in terms of what we've assumed in our forecast in our plans is a continuation of current rates, right, which means a market in the U.S is probably down roughly 10% year-on-year. It means continuing challenges with inventories and it means by and large, significant volumes of both used cars and new cars and most dealers remaining open, even if there are kind of local business restrictions. So we have factored in all of those risks. And we can execute on our plan and our forecast within the current market environment. In terms of what we're seeing in the dealer market and signposts about the health, I would say a couple of things. Like, in the end, many dealers had a very strong 2020 because even though volumes were down, because they have to lower costs and because inventories were very low, the margins by and large, were high and dealers remained profitable throughout 2020. So in fact, most dealers are in pretty good shape coming in into 2021 and expects to remain in pretty good shape. They expect prices to remain pretty solid throughout the year. What they do see is uncertainty, right, and that uncertainty means there is risk. It means they're not bringing in all of the costs back into the dealership. And it means that there may be some ups and downs throughout the year. By and large that is the market environment we are seeing today, and that is the environment in which we can execute on our plan. George, that was the first question. Can you just remind me what the second question was? Yes, it's a great question. Thanks for asking it. So I think we mentioned on the Q3 call, that as we were removing the pricing concessions, we would be tracking the retention rates very, very closely through Q3 and Q4. Well, the great news is, it remained very, very strong, right. So our cancellation rates have remained low, even as we took out the option to suspend service and we're very happy about this. If you remember back in Q2, when the crisis struck, we said, the most important thing for our business is to make sure that when we come out of the crisis, we come out with customer relationships that are even stronger than they were coming into the crisis. That's why we made hard decisions. That's why we took the short-term kind of revenue hit because we believe that we had to do to get through the pandemic. I think we're coming out of it in the right place with very strong customer relationships with critical products and with high retention rates."

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Eric Boyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Boyer: Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q3 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter based on non-GAAP measures are adjusted numbers, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit’s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions. With that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance Uggla. Lance?\nLance Uggla: Okay, thank you, Eric and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 earnings call. Today, we will review our Q3 performance, outlook for the rest of the year and provide an update on our 2021 expectations that we introduced on the call in the second quarter. In Q3, we delivered solid results as the markets we operate in have begun to recover at varying speeds. We are positioned to deliver results for the year that include recurring organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth on a normalized basis. As a company, we have used the COVID environment to become more efficient by rethinking how we collaborate, service our customers and innovate. We have adapted to a virtual work environment and are effectively utilizing technology to connect in new ways with colleagues and customers. We expect this experience to have permanent changes in how we operate going forward, including more flexible work arrangements, a reduced office footprint, less travel and increased productivity. The early cost management as a result of COVID accelerated some longer term actions that have enabled us to actually increase our overall investments in growth-related activities during 2020 over prior years. This gives us further confidence in our ability to achieve our organic growth commitments in 2021 and beyond. Let’s move on to the quarter’s results. When we speak to normalized results, we will be excluding the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture [chains] [ph] on growth rates for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as well as the Q3 biennial BPVC on organic revenue growth. Let’s look at the financial highlights in the quarter: revenue of $1.07 billion, which is flat on a normalized organic basis; adjusted EBITDA of $486 million and margin of 45.3%, up 460 basis points year-over-year due to strong and early cost management and adjusted EPS of $0.77, up 16% over the prior year on a normalized basis. Let me provide some segment commentary for our Q3 and rest of year assumptions. Financial services provided steady organic growth of 4%, with 5% recurring growth. Performance was as expected led by a rebound in solutions and solid growth in information somewhat offset by lower Q3 volumes in processing. Information’s key areas of strength, included our core pricing services, valuation services and index businesses. Within solutions, we had a boost from the equity and municipal markets activity and some recovery in our managed services and implementation projects that were delayed due to COVID. Strong performers in solutions included our monitoring services for private markets and loans and corporate actions data and services. As expected, processing was impacted by lower volatility within our derivatives business and lower loan volume year-over-year. Going forward, we continue to expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment in 2020 with steady Q4 growth in information and solutions and a return to growth within processing. Transportation in Q3 had a strong start to its recovery with organic revenue growth that was flat, but recurring revenue growth, up 5%. Revenue from CARFAX and automotiveMastermind, both returned to growth as pricing for our new and used car dealer customers returned to normal levels as those markets began to rebound. Our dealer retention rates have remained very strong. And we are pleased that our CARFAX for Life free trials during the downturn are seeing strong conversion into paying customers. Now, remember CARFAX for Life, which helps dealers with their service loyalty, operates in a large TAM of over $2 billion and will be an exciting growth driver for our automotive business over the coming years. As expected, we did experience a slower recovery in our new car business, servicing OEMs and parts manufacturers as our customers work through lower new car inventories as a result of their Q2 COVID-related production shutdowns. Nonetheless, even in this part of our portfolio, we expect to grow our subscription base in 2020 as the impact has been mainly in the non-recurring items of revenue. Our maritime and trade business also performed as expected and we are gaining good traction from our new product offerings serving the trade finance commodities markets. Our organic revenue growth guidance for transportation for the year has improved slightly to a decline now of low single-digits for the year. Let’s move over to resources, which reported an organic revenue decline of 9% with the recurring down 5%. Downstream recurring organic growth was strong, while non-recurring revenue was impacted by lower global demand. Our upstream revenue was impacted by customers experiencing operation – operational and financial challenges. And we have partnered with our customers to balance near-term flexibility with longer term agreements, which support future revenue growth, while helping those customers through a difficult time. We have successfully increased the percentage of our upstream data revenue under long-term contracts to now over 50%. We expect normalized organic revenue growth for resources in 2020 to be negative mid single-digits. CMS organic revenue growth normalized for the BPVC was low single-digits as expected, with growth in product design somewhat offset by weakness in ECR and TMT businesses. For the year, we continue to expect normalized organic revenue growth in the low single-digits. Overall, I am very pleased and I feel we are well positioned to deliver solid earnings growth this year and return to strong organic revenue growth in 2021, which I will discuss after Jonathan goes over our Q3 results in more detail. Jonathan?\nJonathan Gear: Great. Thank you, Lance. Diving into Q3 results, we delivered revenue of $1.07 billion, which represents an organic decline of 1% and total revenue decline of 4%. Normalized organic growth was 0% with recurring growth of 2%. Net income of $163 million and a GAAP EPS of $0.41. Our adjusted EBITDA of $486 million, an increase of 9% on a normalized basis with a margin of 45.3%. This represents a margin expansion of 460 basis points and we also delivered adjusted EPS of $0.77, an increase of 16% on a normalized basis. Moving on to revenue, our Q3 normalized organic of 0% included recurring organic growth of 2% and a non-recurring organic decline of 22% or 18% normalized. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by three items, slower delivery of software implementations driven by COVID, continued lower OEM auto activities and finally lower energy consulting and software sales. Moving on to segment performance, our financial services segment drove organic growth of 4%, including 5% recurring in the quarter. Information and solutions in particular has strong performances delivering 4% and 7% organic growth, while processing had an 8% organic decline due to the expected lower volumes year-over-year. Within processing, we do expect a return to growth in Q4 and for the year to be in low single-digits. Our transportation segment delivered organic growth of 0% in the quarter. This included growth of 5% recurring as pricing returned to more normalized levels for our dealer customers and a decline of 12% in non-recurring, primarily driven by continued delays in digital marketing and recall. Our resources segment had 9% organic decline, which is comprised of 5% recurring decline and 39% non-recurring decline. Q3 organic ACV decreased by $34 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is negative 6% and has been heavily impacted by challenges in the North American energy market as Lance discussed. Our CMS segment delivered 1% normalized organic growth per BPVC, including 2% recurring and a decline of 12% normalized non-recurring. Moving now to profits and margins adjusted EBITDA was $486 million, up $33 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 9% on a normalized basis, with a margin of 45.3%, up 460 basis points. Moving on to our segments, financial services adjusted EBITDA was $226 million, with a margin of 50.7%, up 430 basis points. Financial services margin was driven by strong revenue flow-through benefiting from our Q2 cost reductions. We do expect some moderation in financial services margin in Q4 due both to increased investments and a shift in product mix. Transportation’s adjusted EBITDA was $154 million, with a margin of 51.4%, up 880 basis points driven by a return of dealer revenue and a slower return of variable cost. We do expect margins in Q4 to moderate as expenses tied to revenue come back with a return of growth and also increase investment spending, which will drive future growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $86 million, with a margin of 41.5%, a decrease of 230 basis points and CMS adjusted EBITDA was $31 million, with a margin of 25.7%, up 330 basis points. This large increase was driven by the rationalization of a TMT product group, post a divestiture and cost control measures across product design and ECR. Our adjusted EPS was $0.77 per diluted share, an increase of 16% on a normalized basis and 15% in total and our GAAP tax rate was 20% with adjusted tax rate of 18%. Moving on to Q3 free cash flow, we delivered $339 million. As a reminder, our trailing 12-month conversion rate has been impacted by several non-recurring items, including the following. A one-time tax payment in Q4 2019 associated with changes in the U.S. tax provisions. The settlement of our U.S. and UK pension plans Q1 payroll taxes associated with the exercising of a majority of their remaining outstanding options and finally one-time cost tied to the cost reduction efforts in Q2 of this year. Turning to the balance sheet, our Q3 ending debt balance was $5.0 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis and 2.6x net of cash. We continued to manage our balance sheets to provide liquidity and flexibility. We closed the quarter with $157 billion of cash and our Q3 un-drawn revolver balance was approximately $1.182 billion representing a great liquidity position. Our Q3 weighted average diluted share count was 401 million shares and reflected the pause of our repurchase program, which we announced in March. As we indicated during our Q2 earnings call, we did anticipate and expect to return to share buybacks and we announced a redemption of this program in August. We subsequently launched a $200 million ASR on September 1. Moving on to guidance, we remain very confident in our 2020 ranges. We are now trending to the midpoint of our revenue range of $4.28 billion to $4.3 billion. This represents a normalized organic growth rate for the year of between 0% and 1% led by recurring organic growth of 2% to 3%. On adjusted EBITDA, we were also trending to the midpoint of our range of $1.825 billion to 1.835 billion. This represents a margin of 42.7% and applies quarter-over-quarter contraction as our variable costs are reintroduced due to the improving revenue and also due to increased product investment. For adjusted EPS, we are trending to the high-end of our $2.76 to $2.78 range, which represents 10% year-on-year growth. And finally, we do expect free cash flow to run at 50% of adjusted EBITDA. And now, I will pass the call back to Lance to talk about 2021.\nLance Uggla: Okay, thanks, Jonathan. 2020 has been really an unprecedented period for operating a global information services company. And consistent with Q2, I want to provide comfort in the return to normal in 2021. So as usual, we will provide our formal guidance in November, but remain comfortable with the overall 2021 framework that we have already provided you on our Q2 call. The one item to point out is our decision not to hold physical events in 2021 and to move to a virtual model, which we have talked about as a possibility on the last call. Overall, we are looking for a strong year in 2021. Let me tell you what that includes. So, organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, so that now accounts the lack of physical events, so strong organic revenue growth in 2021. In financial services, be in line with the firm’s growth still in the 6% to 8% range, transportation organic growth, we are now looking at 12% to 15% as we finished 2020 stronger than expected, although the absolute revenue that we are going to have, the amount of that revenue remains relatively the same, resources organic growth of down low single-digits to account for the events and CMS in the mid single-digits. For adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, the ranges remain the same, which imply 100 basis points of margin expansion and 13% to 15% earnings growth. In closing, I feel very good about how we are managing the COVID challenges, while continuing to make the right long-term decisions for the company, shareholders and the communities that we operate in and serve. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their support and our colleagues around the world for their continued efforts during these unique times that we find ourselves managing through. So now operator, we are ready to open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, guys. Good morning. Good to see you...\nLance Uggla: Hi, Gary.\nGary Bisbee: …rebound, particularly transportation revenue, I guess my question is around the fiscal ‘20 guidance and I heard your commentary about spend beginning to come back. But if we look at revenue, EBITDA and earnings, in all three cases, it implies not a lot of sequential improvement in revenue growth and sort of in a big step up in cost sequentially. I guess anymore color you can provide and really as we think about margins, any color you can provide on the level of permanent cost savings that have come out of your initial comments plans on that versus what was sort of deferred spending, we should see coming back? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Right, right. So, well the costs that we don’t see coming back in 2021. So let’s start off any offices that we closed, of course those are permanent closures. And as I said earlier in the call, we continue to reexamine our forward footprint and we do see with the flexible work arrangements that we feel will carry on forward, we can reduce our footprint and so we will continue to protect those fixed costs that have come out and we will add to that. The second big move that was made through COVID was the move from contract based employees into permanent employees and we used the COVID period to provide that organizational design and change and those are permanent savings that aren’t going to come back at lower – just lower cost per head, and so those are – that would be the second place. The third place I would say is that some of the variable costs with respect to travel and entertainment that have come out this year, we would expect some of those to return but not all of them and maybe less than we had originally thought. So, we see a continued reduction there in terms of that overall spend. Where else, where we have done, where we have made moves on salaries, those types of moves, we have started to bring some of the salaries back to our employees. And as we go into next year, ex the top executives of the company, myself and the reports, I would expect those to be back to normal. And so I don’t know Jonathan, any other fixed takeouts? I would say generally one last one before I hand it to Jonathan, I would say that organizational design, so our ability to flex our global location strategy has been a permanent change that I just think in this COVID period through attrition and the early works done in our investment strategies throughout the year, the teams have really pushed our location strategy and those are permanent reductions in average head cost - average cost per head globally. Jonathan, do you want to add anything that I missed there?\nJonathan Gear: Yes, sure thing, Lance. So first, it’s, I mean, you covered it well, but the two things I would add is when we think about the cost reductions we took in Q2, three categories, there is a fixed cost, which are gone permanently, and as Lance said is this perfect opportunity or this future opportunities to continue to work our cost structure, there is a natural variable cost that comes with revenue going up and down. And the third is the revenue that we – are the variable costs we chose to kind of squeeze up – squeeze down quite a bit in Q2. And what happened in Q3 is a good news story frankly is the revenue, particularly in transportation came back faster than we expected and faster than as been our ramp back on that variable cost that we have squeezed. The other thing I would call out is investments. We did open up some additional investments starting in Q3 heading into Q4. It certainly will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. But Gary, when it comes back to when you see in Q4, you are going to see the margin at the second level come down a bit really is the fact that our revenue performance was a bit better in Q3 than we expected certainly in transportation.\nLance Uggla: Hey, thanks, Jonathan. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Lance, you have talked a lot about some of the structural changes in your cost base. I guess what I was wondering is in terms of other items, whether it’s your portfolio mix or maybe try to convert some recurring revenue to subscription, are there any other things there you feel like structurally you need to change in the business?\nLance Uggla: No, I think the – I think when you look at the energy markets, I think you have got just to look forward into 2021, then we have got a negative mid single-digit this year and we are talking low single-digit next year. I really think you have got to look at the supply and demand around the energy markets. So, upstream will remain under pressure, you are going to have lower CapEx and you are going to have some bankruptcies. So, my view is the $600 million of upstream revenues is the only place I feel is structurally challenged as we go into 2021 and the remaining $400 million of energy should be expected to grow high single-digit 7% to 10%. So, my view is that – that’s something that we are going to have to manage through in 2021. The team has done a great job this year in terming out about 50% of the revenues to multiyear contracts. But in that discounting, some of that will flow into ‘21. They have managed bankruptcies and most importantly, they have stepped up for our key customers and helped them through a tough period. So, I actually think the energy guys really had to work hard this year to deliver the results they have delivered, but structurally, they still will be challenged on that $600 million, out of our whatever $4.6 billion, that $600 million is going to still be challenged next year, but the downstream and renewables and agriculture and OPIS and chemicals, all are healthy, recurring revenue growth expected and overall ACV positive. So, I am pleased with the performance there.  Outside of that, we have managed our portfolio well. We have increased our investments in all other parts of the business. And so when I lay out the 6% to 8% organic growth yet next year margin expansion flowing through to 13% to 15% EPS growth, I feel like we are in a really good position looking forward in 2021. And hence a complete lockdown, which would bring the new car market in automotive and the dealer footprint, constrained. Ex that, my view is this we have given you a real good look into ‘21 and throughout ‘20 we have given you the revenue guidance. We have told you what we are going to do on expenses, we managed earnings, we told you what’s going to go into 2021. And so I really feel the team has done an exceptional job here and set us up great for ‘21, so no real big changes to our normal operating plan. Jonathan, do you want to add, I think that covered most of it, anything else? No, okay. Next question?\nJonathan Gear: I think you covered it, Lance. Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Okay, thanks. Yes. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nBill Warmington: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So on…\nLance Uggla: Hey, Bill.\nBill Warmington: On annual – on annual contract value for energy, I wanted to ask in terms of the – it sounds like you made a number of improvements on that segment shifting upstream clients to longer term contracts. You are talking about 2021 low single-digit negative organic revenue growth for resources. I wanted to ask what you thought the trajectory of the curve was going to look like for the annual contract value growth and it tipped negative to minus 6% this quarter. When do you think it bottoms and starts moving up?\nLance Uggla: Yes. Brian, do you want to move up Brian on here? Brian, do you want to handle that one? You are not – you are muted, Brian.\nBrian Crotty: Alright, sorry about that. So Bill, when you look at ACV, right now through the quarter, our upstream group is showing negative ACV, but all the other groups are already showing positive. So, we see a lot of strength in our especially in our clean-tech kind of gas business, good demand for LNG analytics, good demand in plastics and that’s just going to continue through FY ‘21, Lance mentioned bankruptcies, there is also closures that also have been affecting upstream ACV. So, in addition to bankruptcies, you had about 40 companies that have also just shutdown. You saw yesterday, Devon merged with WPX. So, those are factoring into the ACV, but the companies that went into bankruptcy are also coming out of bankruptcy now. So you have companies like Denbury, Whiting Sanches, those companies are now emerging and they are buying our services.\nLance Uggla: Thanks. Thanks, Brian. No, I think the energy guys have, really managed that shift in business from upstream into the mid and downstream. And we just got to continue to do that. Here. We have got great customer relations, very deep. All customers, you heard shell announcement yesterday in terms of energy transition, and their focus, you heard BP talk about their net zero targets and where they are headed. We have got a lot to offer customers in and around clean tech renewables. And so my view is, is if I look at the TAM, for non fossil fuel driven energy analytics, data, scenario analysis, climate scenarios, ESG, my view is, we are the best firm in the world positioned to drive revenue growth into those segments as we go forward. So all I can tell you is I expect the mid and downstream to grow high single digits to double digits. And I expect that the upstream will wane through ‘21 with recovery into ‘22 and beyond, from a much lower base. And so really, we got to be the architects of that shift in change. But we have done this before, and it, the upstream is $300 million, less than $300 million of data now and about $300 million of analytics and thought leadership so it’s not that it’s not a big problem for the overall firm, but it is a challenge for Brian and his team and they are doing a great job. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thanks and good morning and first fully recognize your two largest segments performed well. So apologies for piling on with another resources question. But the magnitude of the step down and recurring was pretty sizable relative to what we usually see in a subscription based business. So I guess what I am wondering is, are there temporary pricing concessions that quickly come back in resources like you had in transport? Because normally, when I think about trading off for longer term contracts, it’s more that you get the annual price escalator that kicks in, as you trip over on an annual basis. So but are there temporary pricing concessions or anything else you could say? And then, yes, I guess just to clarify, Lance, is the guidance for the outlook for 2021 resources. Is it down low single digits? I think I heard you say that on the call, it’s down single-digits down?\nLance Uggla: Down low, yes, down low single-digits. So one, two or three to me would be low single-digits in terms of a negative number. And so let me go to the first part of your question. So, I guess, well, first of all, I wouldn’t compare what’s going on in the energy markets to anything anywhere else in the firm. So transportation, here recurring revenue – we have had declines in some non-recurring revenue like recalls. So, government regulatory pressure has waned through COVID and therefore the recall agenda has been slowed down, but in the future, we expect recall to be an active part of our business and we will take the lion’s share of that when it comes our way. The second thing we would say is that with less cars on the lots and less cars being manufactured in ‘20 deal the cars in some ways, I hate to say sell themselves, because there is a lack of supply and therefore easier to sell the cars, less money spent on marketing and audience building. That’s a short-term issue. And then in the used car market, we have seen that accelerate back and all other products showing good demand, our forecasting and ability to deal with shifts in types of cars being manufactured and drive trains, etcetera position us really well. So, don’t compare energy with automotive or transportation. When you get into energy, I really think if you are sitting in my shoes today, I think of this very simply. We got whatever $4.6 billion, $4.7 billion of revenues in IHS Markit. I take it down to the $600 million of upstream, which is less than 300 of data and pre-merger was more than 400. This data in upstream, the declining market and it’s going to find its base and grow from there. So, in our 3-year contracts, after year 1, we put in 7% to 8% growth on average into those datasets. But this is miniscule in the picture of IHS Markit. So, it’s not a dial mover, it helps, but it’s not going to move the dial. So, I think you have to take that $600 million of data and say, okay, number one, the world as long as anybody is on this call is going to live plus all your children are still going to be using fossil fuels. So, we do have $600 million of revenue that’s going to support that piece of the world economies. So, whether it’s 70 million, 80 million or 100 million barrels a day, we need fossil fuels and nobody is connecting, turning on their lights getting to work moving around without some piece of their – the world’s needs in fossil fuels. So, we are going to find our home in data somewhere around $200 million, $250million will be the world leaders will continue to support all of our customers and we are going to help them and leverage that position into energy transition and I feel really lucky that we have got financial markets, transportation and energy right at the core and the epicenter of decisions that are going to happen to drive the energy transition and the beyond zero, net zero world that we are heading to. The second thing I would say is the existing players that remain. So, all the sovereign oil companies, big national oil companies that still have committed resources and of course the small entrepreneurial exploration activities need help in analytics, cost management, they want the thought leadership, they want to understand pricing, forecasting, etcetera. So, I think that our analytics, so the non-data piece of upstream will wane a bit into ‘21 through bankruptcies in difficult times, but again should return to a more normalized, whereas high single-digits, but I would say looking forward, I think of 3% to 5%, mid single-digit growth. So net-net, take the whole firm, you’ve got to take resources, the billion of revenues next year, put it at low negative single-digits and expect it to be low to mid single-digits in ‘22 led by the continued transition both organically or through bolt-on acquisitions that are going to drive our future energy growth and that’s it. That’s how I am running the firm. That’s how the team has been instructed to manage the challenges. And when I put that together across the whole firm, been there before and we just got to execute well. I have got a great team. We have got great customers. And I think from a shareholder perspective, we do exactly what we tell we are going to – we tell you we are going to do and therefore you have got great transparency into our capabilities. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. Hey, Lance or Jonathan, as you walk through some of the expense savings, some of that sounds obviously more structural as you think about, does that come to talk to potential increases to come to that 100 basis point target or do you reinvest that back into the business, which would kind of fuel organic growth or a combination of both. Is there anyway to maybe frame what that potential can be and how you redeploy it across the enterprise?\nJonathan Gear: Yes. Well, COVID, given us a real great vision into our cost footprint in terms of real estate, in terms of where we can hire people to effectively do the jobs in the company, so what’s the location and our ability to actively manage 16,000 people working from home. And I guess nowadays, if somebody is in New York City, in the Finger Lakes, working in Taos, New Mexico or in their summer home in south of France, I can’t really tell anymore, their backgrounds or walls mostly or fake backgrounds, where they want to quote one. And so really we have become experts at managing in this virtual new world and that’s given us a chance to really look at our forward organizational design and I believe through attrition, so not having to let people go. But just managing attrition and managing a forward location strategy, leveraging technology, there is no issue with us thinking that we can expand 100 basis points per annum. Now, your second bit is can you have more and my view is an information services company that’s diversified like we are and diversified means that if you do five things, usually one out of the five is you have got to be focused and it’s a bit challenged and we have always had that. My view is, as we can grow steadily at mid single-digits, 5% to 8% or 6% to 8%, I really feel good about our ability to manage our revenue levers, but they all include services that over time wane in growth as they become saturated and those products end up falling to 2% to 3%, 1% to 3% revenue growth, see, you have got to be fueling the new growth products. So, investment is key. This year, we have invested $7.5 million more than we invested in the previous year in what we call investments in organic growth, both within each of the divisions, but even layering some additional expense over top. So, the teams got to invest. So my view is as I look forward, I don’t really want to expand margin faster than 100 basis points if it’s ever going to cost me a slippage on organic growth below 5%. So, therefore I want to invest, make sure that we push to the high-end of our organic revenue growth range, do it consistently, invest smartly, measure our approach and you know what 100 basis points margin expansion is good margin expansion and it helps us give you double-digit earnings growth that you can expect for the next 3 to 5 years. And I guess at merger, we were negative 2% to flat on revenue growth and 0% to 2%, 2% to 4%, 4% to 6%, 5% to 7%. We made a couple acquisitions, we pushed to 6% to 8%, haven’t missed a thing. We promised 100 basis points every year, you never missed it, promised double-digit earnings growth every year. So, the fact is, is just expect that’s what we are going to do and we will manage through the $600 million of resources challenge, put it behind us drive on grow the new business organically and make sure that we deliver the returns, a vibrant company service our customers well, I think all the metrics are strong and bode well for ‘21. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Good morning, Lance. I wanted to hear more about Ipreo, which I know is now sub-segment into solutions and info. How did Ipreo contribute to organic revenue here in the third quarter and should Ipreo still have a double-digit organic revenue profile over the medium term and why?\nLance Uggla: I will start. I think Adam is on with me, not sure, but I will start and then if he comes on he can join in with me. Okay. So first off, alternative markets, super strong private markets growth, we have got the leading asset in that space, Andrew. And as far as I can see forward, we are going to grow double-digits in that alternative space. So a piece of that came from Ipreo, which was the eye level piece. We were already doing valuations. We were already doing private debt markets, WSO compliance etcetera. So that net-net altogether, I don’t see any of that waning. And if anything, we are continuing to build into that. On the actual volumes across munis, equities, fixed income in terms of the Ipreo businesses and the corporate solutions, I will let Adam give you some color on. Adam?\nAdam Kansler: Sure. Thanks, Lance. Just maybe as a starting point, we have deeply integrated Ipreo into our businesses at this point. So, we are not forward measuring organic growth within that subset of business part of a much larger whole. Performance has been good over the years, as Lance mentioned, capital markets continue to be open volumes have been strong there. The private markets business is growing at or above our expectations of it. So I think we continue to see it as a large contributor to our growth and I think even looking out farther we think those areas will [Technical Difficulty]\nLance Uggla: Adam, in my remarks, I called out munis in the quarter, like just in terms of volumes, how are the muni markets through this year?\nAdam Kansler: So municipal markets have been strong as local governments look to address their own capital requirements and low interest rate environments. Most municipalities have looked to refinance their debt and those have been very strong markets over the last 6 months even. Equities markets, that will just get us obviously that’s all when the COVID pandemic first hit, but as everyone on this call knows over the last month, we have seen accelerated equity markets again and we are seeing extended volumes there and the equity markets are one where volume is helpful for us. Lot of those relationships are volume dependent, for good reason so…\nLance Uggla: Okay, good. Thanks, Adam. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the solid quarter and good to see the rebound in transportation. And Lance thanks for providing the details on the CARFAX for Life. Maybe if I can have a two-pronged question just on the auto dealership, you have introduced a lot of new products recently over the last few years. Can you just talk about the penetration for, let’s say, AMM or carfax.com in your existing dealer customer base, how much room runway do you have and how do you accelerate that? And then quickly on the OEM side, you provide some good color there on the recall and digital marketing, when should we start to see that come back as well? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Okay, good. Well, I have got Edouard on with me. Edouard, do you want to take that one?\nEdouard Tavernier: Yes, Ashish, thanks for your question and great point. So, we do work with a vast majority of dealers in the North American market one way or the other. The great news is we have a portfolio of products as you mentioned with different levels of penetration for each of those products. So if you take a mature product like CARFAX advantage, then we are approaching kind of maximum penetration. The great news is we have products like CARFAX used car listings or CARFAX for Life, which has plenty of runway and which we see growing for a number of years ahead of us, same story for Mastermind. Mastermind has been growing its penetration rapidly over the past 2 years, but frankly, we still have most of the markets to go after and we are continuing to introduce new offerings like our used car capability this summer, which gives us plenty more growth for the future.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hey, thank you for taking my question. So Lance, the clear message over the last several years has definitely been that you are focused on the long-term or sustainable organic growth. And in that vein, can you talk a little bit about the nature of the stepped up investments that you have made during COVID, more of the move towards getting the technology to be cloud-native where you are kind of the 3-year plan and what’s going on with kind of the data lake commercializing just kind of an overall update and where you are in the investments?\nLance Uggla: Okay, excellent. Okay, so I will break that in two and then if Adam, sorry, if Yaacov wants to come in after me, if I leave anything out on the data lake or our tech journey, be happy for you to add to that Yaacov. So the first thing I would say, is, every year since merger, we have increased the absolute dollars we have spend on organic growth investments. So all of our divisions have, in their regular planning cycle, are incrementally investing in their business. But every year, we also run almost like a shark tank approach to what we call incremental investments that can be above our, or internal rate of return, targets for investing in every year, that number has been higher since merger. So we are getting increasing confidence in our ability to invest, and then execute a result that leads to an expanded organic growth. And I have mentioned a bit and maybe we do an investor day, we could really dig into our internal vitality score. And our vitality score is our measurement of this year’s organic revenue coming from internal investments made over the last three years, or it’s longer than the last three years, they have never been less than double the firm’s organic growth results. So if we produce, 5% organic growth, we would leave it in if it was better than 10%. Because sometimes our investments take a bit longer to come in but if they’re operating at double our firm growth, we feel they are still adding to the vitality of the company. Every single year, since merger, the vitality measurement has improved. The absolute dollars of vitality revenue and the percentage of revenue from vitality has improved. So I feel really good that organic growth investment in IHS Markit has a great cadence and a great story. And it’s really impressive, I was with a reg and compliance head, John Barneson, the other day at a board update on organic, some of the new investments we have made and described the product with circa $1 million of investment over the last year, that’s already has run-rate of heading over $5 million and we will have actual revenue next year of $10 million. Now not every investment we make of 1 million drives 10 million in new revenue. If that was the case, we would be growing at 10%, but the fact is, is the better we get at organic investment, the better this company is. It attracts more – it cracks better people, it’s more exciting to work in, it’s got more of a buzz and people feel they are part of investing in their products with technology to be better. So, I am super happy with that. And I wish I had $50 million every year to incrementally add, but the fact is, we don’t have that, but incrementally, we are continuing to invest at what I would say is a growing cadence, well measured, well managed. The second thing I would say when we merged emerged with IHS Markit and IHS. And after merger you find, you have got technical debt, you have got old technology stacks that you don’t want to just connect to new technology, you actually want to rip them out, throw them away and build something brand new. And that’s been Yaacov’s job. And Yaacov has taken the last 3.5 years building out a world class data lake with a $0.5 billion partnership with Amazon, which puts us completely cloud native. It’s a long-term 7-year deal, which is the data lake is built and now all the products are going cloud-native and the connectivity of all of our key datasets to product development to customers out of the data lake into our cloud-native strategy is changing the profile of IHS Markit substantively. And so those investments are made. They are in our numbers. We have managed to do the CapEx OpEx switch, which is very difficult for companies. We map that into our investments with Amazon. And I just think the team here again, not to keep bragging about them, but this big shifts in info security cloud-native software and data lake architecture, that’s what the best companies in the world are doing and our teams have orchestrated that. Yaacov, maybe you just want to tell our shareholders and our analysts here just a little bit about how you see the journey improving our client connectivity, our organic revenue growth, project development and just anything, maybe 5 minutes that you want to add around our cadence for excellence.\nYaacov Mutnikas: Thank you, Lance. So, I will just talk about, I will start with the data lake just to give an update on that and if there is time, I will go into technology. So first of all, after extensive internal use of data lake by internal IHS Markit advanced analytics team and some of the business lines, we went to market in May this year, making multi-tenant data lake available to our clients as well as extended our reach to potential partners. We have several sign clients, we have got roughly 15 clients in serious evaluation and we have got 150 active client conversations. We are leveraging our existing broad-based sales force and account management teams in reaching our client base worldwide. We are now building out a multimillion dollar engagement pipeline vis-à-vis data lake and our client. Our client engagements in the context span their financial services, energy and automotive client base since data lake is domain agnostic. We have ingested into the data lake the entirety of IHS Markit structured and semi-structured data, this process is ongoing and it is automated from day one since our data footprint is expanded by way of adding new business domains, e.g., agribusiness and similar. At the end of November, we will release the next version of data lake, which will contain around just shy of 1 million unstructured data items, e.g., research documents and analyst reports that will be catalog, discoverable and curated in a similar way per structured data content. In addition, we will provide some advanced features such as document summarization and other advanced machine learning and AI feature engineering based benefits. This type of functionality forms part and parcel of our unstructured data ingest pipeline. By the end of 2020, we will achieve decentralization and discoverability of our data estate across structured and unstructured data and provide same functionalities to our clients. There is one more step I would like to mention for us to deliver to complete the data lake journey as in connecting relevant the data dots across our entire data estate. So, I will pause here for a moment.\nLance Uggla: Yes, great, so a lot going on and great question. But key for us has been this tech investment over the last 3 years and we are seeing the results. And I think the team has done a great job. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes on the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate you squeezing me in here towards the end of the long productive call. My question is high level, Lance, around pricing. And I am thinking about a few areas. CARFAX for Life stands out as a monetization opportunity. I am also wondering about pricing trends and pricing power within your financial services business and broadly, if 6% to 8% of the organic revenue growth goal, is it possible to parse out how much of that is coming from price recognizing that you are pricing for value?\nLance Uggla: Yes, I think historically, we have always said, 1% or 2% of our overall growth across the whole firm comes from price. And I don’t know if Jonathan if you want to add any further detail on that, but I think that generally when you look across the whole firm, we get about 1% to 2% organic growth for the – related to price. Jonathan, do you want to add to that?\nJonathan Gear: Yes, I will just be real brief, Andrew. So when you think about our buildup on the subs line, I was going to start the year at 100%, we have cancellations for whatever reason, our renewal rate has been kind of low to mid 90s and then you build up from there. And as Lance said, pricing we do and it does vary by end markets, the condition of the end markets, think about option right now, it’s more difficult to capture the capture price, given the challenges there. But typically about a couple of points that you get from price, the biggest driver really get on the buildup is really on cross-selling and up-selling products and certainly the focus, as we have talked about this call is around introducing – divesting dollars into innovation and driving new products into that customer base and into our channel, but think about just for your modeling purposes about a couple.\nLance Uggla: Okay, thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. I was just hoping if you could just talk about how you are thinking about free cash flow conversion for next year. I think you are talking about 50% for this year. So any puts and takes to think about around free cash flow for next year. I know you have sort of the EBITDA framework you laid out?\nLance Uggla: Yes. So 60 to 65, we return back into the 60s, mainly, we had some one-offs this year with the pensions that we posed profitably the teams did a good job there. We had some of the restructuring for COVID. So, the tax costs that were left over from the Trump changes, I think our view is as we go into 2021, we will be back 60% plus. Jonathan, is that accurate?\nJonathan Gear: It is. And I will just add to it, Lance, as several one-offs this year, those items you mentioned, the pension being a third. And we also had some COVID-related impacts to working capital, working capital typically is positive as we sign a new contract and bill upfront and the support some of our clients took in auto and auto OEMs and energy we have supported slightly different payment terms. But looking forward to next year as we have cycled through, look what happened with our contracts, the one-time items will flush through we expect to be back up to mid 60s next year.\nHamzah Mazari: Great, thank you.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nSeth Weber: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for keeping the call going. Just real quickly on the financial services business. Solutions flip back positive here in the quarter. I know, last quarter, you talked about the pipeline being strong. Do you feel like we have turned the corner here in the solutions business and can you just give us any kind of forward commentary for how your customers are thinking about that business? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Yes. No, definitely, installing software solutions through COVID has been strained, but the team did do a good job getting us through 2020. We have a strongest pipeline we have ever had across the business. And Adam might want to add a few details into that picture. Adam?\nAdam Kansler: Yes, thanks, Lance. It is an historically lumpy business. You do see variations quarter to quarter, but we have continued to deliver into that high single-digit and in some cases touching double-digit growth through that group. Over this past year, we have actually been focusing more on larger, more comprehensive relationships with our customers. We have focused our product teams on being able to develop those capabilities, so we could provide customers even more value in larger solutions we are seeing and that’s hard to pull through and Lance talked about an exciting pipeline. Really not just more deals, but larger deals and I think once we get past the COVID interruption, because obviously it interrupts our customers’ ability to do larger implementations, I think as we pull through that, we will see continued acceleration there.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Adam. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hey, good morning. Maybe just to round it out on capital allocation and returns, I don’t think we have touched upon this today. You mentioned the $200 million ASR some folks have reached out to me and said they thought that was a little bit small. So maybe just talk about how you think about buybacks in general beyond that $200 million? And then M&A, you mentioned on the resources you are still thinking about tuck-ins, is that across the board in other segments as well or how is the environment looking for you in general as you think about M&A in this environment and coming out of it?\nLance Uggla: Okay, no, good question. We haven’t had that one for a bit. So, first off on buybacks, we have committed the 50% to 75%. So that’s – nothing has changed on that. I think you can look forward at us and be thinking $200 million to $300 million a quarter is a reasonable cadence for buybacks. Well, maintaining our leverage, sub three times. I think that leads us, half a billion plus, in terms of bolt on acquisitions, and anything above that would require us to, increase our leverage before delivering again. And so we, are good acquirers we, we make great acquisitions in the past. And we are always monitoring the markets. But if you ask me, the return on invested capital on organic growth, versus acquisitions, I would say when the teams are doing their jobs we should always be going after the organic growth. And we definitely increased our cadence of organic growth over the last, three, four years, so I am pleased that we don’t need to acquire to support our long term objectives. What I would say, is, scale matters. And I feel a lot better about being a $30 billion dollar company versus being a $10 billion company. And I think that scale matters didn’t top difficult worlds that we operate in. And so we have done a great job to grow the company, grow our free cash flow, and then use it accordingly. And so the dividend is great for our shareholders, they like that certain cash flow, share buybacks is another way to pay back. And we think given 50% to 75% of our cash, our cash back to shareholders is a good strategy. And if great M&A is there, we have got ample room for bolt-ons. And we have some room on leverage if we wanted to do something a bit bigger. So I can’t say more than that, except that our strategy of that combination is voted well. And we are very cautious on the return on invested capital of all those different strategic alternatives. And so, if COVID brings the cost of assets down, somewhat, that could be good, but actually are multiple, I would love to see our multiple, two or three turns better. So things look a lot cheaper to us. So that is where we are, I wouldn’t expect any strategic change, short term, but you should expect this to always look at what’s best for the company, and best for the long term goals of the company and shareholders. Next question, we must be getting near the end operator.\nOperator: We do have three questions left in the queue. Our next question comes from…\nLance Uggla: Okay, we will answer all three of them.\nOperator: Perfect. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much for squeezing me. And I will be quick. I know you are not giving 2021 guidance towards year end, but if we look at the quarters and using your outlook for the year, does it make sense that you will see year-over-year growth and margin expansion in your fiscal first quarter next year? That’s the last comp, pre-COVID? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Yes. Okay. Jonathan, do you want to grab that in terms of our forward model?\nJonathan Gear: Sure. So – and I will be staying on top of my head a bit here, Jeff, but for Q1 year-over-year of ‘21 compared to ‘20, I think we likely will see some margin expansion just because a lot of our cost reduction took place, going to be an impact in Q2, Q3, Q4. And so Q1 year- over-year is going to be before all the COVID impact that takes place. Certainly, for the year, we do expect to drive over the course of the year, continued margin expansion.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks a lot. Can you talk about any potential implications you are thinking about from the upcoming U.S. election? If there is a Biden win, maybe that helps globalization, but it could impact resources and maybe transportation given more stringent climate policies or do you view that as the transitions happening anyway, so maybe it’s not as big of a factor? And then actually, if you could help us think about the implications of the energy transition for transportation, I know we just saw the California ban on sales of gasoline powered cars starting in 2035. So, just what are you providing to your auto customers in terms of helping with those policies? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Right, okay. Thanks, Toni. So I think Biden drives green. And so in terms of energy transition, everything we are doing around supply chain, maritime measurement of the ESG of the maritime fleet, our ESG advisory and products around our indices into financial markets, I think Biden pushing a green agenda forward is good for us. I also think that Biden, pushing a regulatory compliance driven agenda is also good for a firm like ours. So those two things are things that might bode well. I think that, more free flowing, globalization and better global relationships could be a win for IHS Markit as well. But I have to say volatility and challenging marketplaces, fuel financial markets, services providers, and that hasn’t heard us through COVID. In terms of the automotive sector, Edouard can add to it, but people need as much advice and solutions, and used in new car advice around shifts to ease as they do on combustion engines. And we do provide a lot of services around the drive train and that shift from combustion TVs. But, Edouard, do you want to drive a little bit deeper detail on that?\nEdouard Tavernier: Yes, a couple of quick words turn in response to your question. So as Lance said policy and regulatory uncertainty drives and need for data for decision making by our customers. And so in that sense, this is a interesting environments to create new data assets and new products. You mentioned the California ban. You could have mentioned also the EU revised targets for emissions reduction by 2030, which were published last week. And all of this creates a need for large scale simulation of what does this mean for my business? What does it mean for my portfolio, Lance mentioned innovation. So I would say this whole area of emissions compliance, and electrification is probably the most innovative area of our portfolio. I will give you a couple of examples, next month, where we are releasing a monthly rolling forecast of compliance versus EU, China and U.S. regulations, which is a new tracking and monitoring tool for customers. And in January, we are very excited about this. We are launching a simulation tool that will allow our customers, parts makers as well as carmakers to really run a variety of simulations on the portfolio, their competitors’ portfolio to understand how they achieve compliance cost effectively, so very exciting area for us for customers and the place in which we are focusing a lot of resources.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that you can grow steadily 5% to 8% or 6% to 8% organically driven by consistent if not elevated investments. Is this an increased your long-term organic growth framework? And then related to your long-term framework, you talked about several drivers of permanent cost savings. How did those permanent savings impact your framework for long-term EBITDA margins in the 45% to 47% range?\nLance Uggla: Yes, so 5% to 7% had been our long-term forecast for driving the firm. And then when we acquired Ipreo, we boosted the – no sorry, we are 4% to 6% and when we acquired Ipreo, we boosted financial service to 6% to 8%. And therefore we raise the overall organic growth forecast of the firm, to 5% to 7%. And I still believe 5% to 7%, the right level of conservatism in terms of what we provide to shareholders, our expectations across the firm. And I have to tell you that there is nobody in the firm that doesn’t want to be at the high end or beating that range, but there is always something that across our company that might put us in 6%, instead of 7% or 5%, instead of 6% and so hence the 5% to 7%. As we go through the year, you can see from our forecast right now on revenue, we have got to pin down to like a $5 million spread. So, we know our revenues and our ability to keep them very, very well. So, I think 5% to 7% is the right level. As we grow things like alternatives, renewable energy, energy transition, our asset management related platform activities, our roles and reg and compliance, these are areas that’s growing double-digit. As those grow and gain additional cadence in the firm and investments play through, I expect those areas to push us up to the higher end. And I would love one day to come on here and say 6 days. But for 2021, we can say 6-day, because we are coming off a 4-year in terms of comps. And so really, I think 6 or 8 next year is not, it’s just it’s not the highest order. It’s a return from a really challenge year. And therefore, I think the more interesting year is 2022, are we back in line for the 5% to 7%. And I have to say hand in my heart, I think we have got more than enough target addressable market to do that. So I don’t worry about our long-term ability to grow revenue, I think we are leading edge with our customers, where we have got great employment practices, even proved right through COVID. With our diversity and inclusion measurements, our community scores with our employees and our community scores with our customers. So feels buoyant, feels good, I feel great about that. When you grow at the top end of the range, you start to grow margin, automatically. But we have a business that’s very global, can easily work from home, can easily deliver many of our solutions virtually and leadership virtually, we just got to use more technology. So we have been investing in more technology. And therefore, I see no problem with IHS Markit being one of those 50% margin companies, like many of our peers, they do a damn good job, they manage expenses, they grow revenue, and they find their home around that high 40% to 50% margin. And I expect us to be there as well. And I don’t want to rush it, because I want to make sure that we are constantly investing in those new market opportunities. And I think we are doing that just fine. And then when you look down through earnings this year, we have always had double-digit earnings, I just said earlier in the call, 13% to 15% because all of a sudden we were fully termed out on our debt. So, no rising interest costs, good management of depreciation, excellent tax team that’s given us a good adjusted tax rate. And so I have to say that all of those mechanisms are in place. And so as the last call of the day, all I can say to you is, I will reiterate again, competence in revenue growth, competence in expense management, competence in the double-digit earnings growth. Our portfolio has been adjusted over the 3 to 4 years since merger. We will continue to fuel the strengths and lessen impacts of challenge markets, we will grow through that. And we have ample opportunity with the free cash flow we have to invest back into our shareholders or into the company for new opportunities. So I think we are – nothing has s really changed except that we have been through the most surreal period of our lives. It’s been tough for customers. We have helped them. It’s been tough for employees and we have reached out to them and delivered for our teams. It’s been tough to build new products virtually, but the teams have managed to do it. So, next year, the only thing I can say to you is, if we get a complete shutdown or lockdown and we have to keep people at home locked up and they are not out on the dealer floors, they are not out buying cars, there is nobody out drilling for oil, the financial markets will continue to operate, they have proven they can do that. It will be another tough year. And I will give you crystal clear transparency in what we are doing every quarter. But I actually think the world is heading towards an eased lockdown situation, not that they are not going to lockdown regional, I think there is going to be all sorts of regional lockdowns. But I don’t see us coming to a complete standstill again in terms of our forward forecast. And if that happens, when we give you our guidance in November, we will have to update it. But at the moment, I think you have got as much knowledge as I do and I hope the transparency is appreciated and thank you for all your support. At this point, Eric, we will end the call.\nEric Boyer: Yes, we thank you for your interest in IHS Markit.

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Lance. Just maybe as a starting point, we have deeply integrated Ipreo into our businesses at this point. So, we are not forward measuring organic growth within that subset of business part of a much larger whole. Performance has been good over the years, as Lance mentioned, capital markets continue to be open volumes have been strong there. The private markets business is growing at or above our expectations of it. So I think we continue to see it as a large contributor to our growth and I think even looking out farther we think those areas will [Technical Difficulty] So municipal markets have been strong as local governments look to address their own capital requirements and low interest rate environments. Most municipalities have looked to refinance their debt and those have been very strong markets over the last 6 months even. Equities markets, that will just get us obviously that's all when the COVID pandemic first hit, but as everyone on this call knows over the last month, we have seen accelerated equity markets again and we are seeing extended volumes there and the equity markets are one where volume is helpful for us. Lot of those relationships are volume dependent, for good reason so... Yes, thanks, Lance. It is an historically lumpy business. You do see variations quarter to quarter, but we have continued to deliver into that high single-digit and in some cases touching double-digit growth through that group.

Today, we will review our Q3 performance, outlook for the rest of the year and provide an update on our 2021 expectations that we introduced on the call in the second quarter. In Q3, we delivered solid results as the markets we operate in have begun to recover at varying speeds. We are positioned to deliver results for the year that include recurring organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth on a normalized basis. As a company, we have used the COVID environment to become more efficient by rethinking how we collaborate, service our customers and innovate. We have adapted to a virtual work environment and are effectively utilizing technology to connect in new ways with colleagues and customers. We expect this experience to have permanent changes in how we operate going forward, including more flexible work arrangements, a reduced office footprint, less travel and increased productivity. The early cost management as a result of COVID accelerated some longer term actions that have enabled us to actually increase our overall investments in growth-related activities during 2020 over prior years. This gives us further confidence in our ability to achieve our organic growth commitments in 2021 and beyond. Let's move on to the quarter's results. When we speak to normalized results, we will be excluding the impact of the aerospace and defense divestiture [chains] [ph] on growth rates for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as well as the Q3 biennial BPVC on organic revenue growth. Let's look at the financial highlights in the quarter: revenue of $1.07 billion, which is flat on a normalized organic basis; adjusted EBITDA of $486 million and margin of 45.3%, up 460 basis points year-over-year due to strong and early cost management and adjusted EPS of $0.77, up 16% over the prior year on a normalized basis. Let me provide some segment commentary for our Q3 and rest of year assumptions. Financial services provided steady organic growth of 4%, with 5% recurring growth. Performance was as expected led by a rebound in solutions and solid growth in information somewhat offset by lower Q3 volumes in processing. Information's key areas of strength, included our core pricing services, valuation services and index businesses. Within solutions, we had a boost from the equity and municipal markets activity and some recovery in our managed services and implementation projects that were delayed due to COVID. Strong performers in solutions included our monitoring services for private markets and loans and corporate actions data and services. As expected, processing was impacted by lower volatility within our derivatives business and lower loan volume year-over-year. Going forward, we continue to expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment in 2020 with steady Q4 growth in information and solutions and a return to growth within processing. Transportation in Q3 had a strong start to its recovery with organic revenue growth that was flat, but recurring revenue growth, up 5%. Revenue from CARFAX and automotiveMastermind, both returned to growth as pricing for our new and used car dealer customers returned to normal levels as those markets began to rebound. Our dealer retention rates have remained very strong. And we are pleased that our CARFAX for Life free trials during the downturn are seeing strong conversion into paying customers. Now, remember CARFAX for Life, which helps dealers with their service loyalty, operates in a large TAM of over $2 billion and will be an exciting growth driver for our automotive business over the coming years. As expected, we did experience a slower recovery in our new car business, servicing OEMs and parts manufacturers as our customers work through lower new car inventories as a result of their Q2 COVID-related production shutdowns. Nonetheless, even in this part of our portfolio, we expect to grow our subscription base in 2020 as the impact has been mainly in the non-recurring items of revenue. Our maritime and trade business also performed as expected and we are gaining good traction from our new product offerings serving the trade finance commodities markets. Our organic revenue growth guidance for transportation for the year has improved slightly to a decline now of low single-digits for the year. Let's move over to resources, which reported an organic revenue decline of 9% with the recurring down 5%. Downstream recurring organic growth was strong, while non-recurring revenue was impacted by lower global demand. Our upstream revenue was impacted by customers experiencing operation – operational and financial challenges. And we have partnered with our customers to balance near-term flexibility with longer term agreements, which support future revenue growth, while helping those customers through a difficult time. We have successfully increased the percentage of our upstream data revenue under long-term contracts to now over 50%. We expect normalized organic revenue growth for resources in 2020 to be negative mid single-digits. CMS organic revenue growth normalized for the BPVC was low single-digits as expected, with growth in product design somewhat offset by weakness in ECR and TMT businesses. For the year, we continue to expect normalized organic revenue growth in the low single-digits. Overall, I am very pleased and I feel we are well positioned to deliver solid earnings growth this year and return to strong organic revenue growth in 2021, which I will discuss after Jonathan goes over our Q3 results in more detail. Jonathan? Okay, thanks, Jonathan. 2020 has been really an unprecedented period for operating a global information services company. And consistent with Q2, I want to provide comfort in the return to normal in 2021. So as usual, we will provide our formal guidance in November, but remain comfortable with the overall 2021 framework that we have already provided you on our Q2 call. The one item to point out is our decision not to hold physical events in 2021 and to move to a virtual model, which we have talked about as a possibility on the last call. Overall, we are looking for a strong year in 2021. Let me tell you what that includes. So, organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, so that now accounts the lack of physical events, so strong organic revenue growth in 2021. In financial services, be in line with the firm's growth still in the 6% to 8% range, transportation organic growth, we are now looking at 12% to 15% as we finished 2020 stronger than expected, although the absolute revenue that we are going to have, the amount of that revenue remains relatively the same, resources organic growth of down low single-digits to account for the events and CMS in the mid single-digits. For adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, the ranges remain the same, which imply 100 basis points of margin expansion and 13% to 15% earnings growth. In closing, I feel very good about how we are managing the COVID challenges, while continuing to make the right long-term decisions for the company, shareholders and the communities that we operate in and serve. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their support and our colleagues around the world for their continued efforts during these unique times that we find ourselves managing through. So now operator, we are ready to open up the lines for questions. Hi, Gary. Right, right. So, well the costs that we don't see coming back in 2021. So let's start off any offices that we closed, of course those are permanent closures. And as I said earlier in the call, we continue to reexamine our forward footprint and we do see with the flexible work arrangements that we feel will carry on forward, we can reduce our footprint and so we will continue to protect those fixed costs that have come out and we will add to that. The second big move that was made through COVID was the move from contract based employees into permanent employees and we used the COVID period to provide that organizational design and change and those are permanent savings that aren't going to come back at lower – just lower cost per head, and so those are – that would be the second place. The third place I would say is that some of the variable costs with respect to travel and entertainment that have come out this year, we would expect some of those to return but not all of them and maybe less than we had originally thought. So, we see a continued reduction there in terms of that overall spend. Where else, where we have done, where we have made moves on salaries, those types of moves, we have started to bring some of the salaries back to our employees. And as we go into next year, ex the top executives of the company, myself and the reports, I would expect those to be back to normal. And so I don't know Jonathan, any other fixed takeouts? I would say generally one last one before I hand it to Jonathan, I would say that organizational design, so our ability to flex our global location strategy has been a permanent change that I just think in this COVID period through attrition and the early works done in our investment strategies throughout the year, the teams have really pushed our location strategy and those are permanent reductions in average head cost - average cost per head globally. Jonathan, do you want to add anything that I missed there? Hey, thanks, Jonathan. Next question? No, I think the – I think when you look at the energy markets, I think you have got just to look forward into 2021, then we have got a negative mid single-digit this year and we are talking low single-digit next year. I really think you have got to look at the supply and demand around the energy markets. So, upstream will remain under pressure, you are going to have lower CapEx and you are going to have some bankruptcies. So, my view is the $600 million of upstream revenues is the only place I feel is structurally challenged as we go into 2021 and the remaining $400 million of energy should be expected to grow high single-digit 7% to 10%. So, my view is that – that's something that we are going to have to manage through in 2021. The team has done a great job this year in terming out about 50% of the revenues to multiyear contracts. But in that discounting, some of that will flow into ‘21. They have managed bankruptcies and most importantly, they have stepped up for our key customers and helped them through a tough period. So, I actually think the energy guys really had to work hard this year to deliver the results they have delivered, but structurally, they still will be challenged on that $600 million, out of our whatever $4.6 billion, that $600 million is going to still be challenged next year, but the downstream and renewables and agriculture and OPIS and chemicals, all are healthy, recurring revenue growth expected and overall ACV positive. So, I am pleased with the performance there.  Outside of that, we have managed our portfolio well. We have increased our investments in all other parts of the business. And so when I lay out the 6% to 8% organic growth yet next year margin expansion flowing through to 13% to 15% EPS growth, I feel like we are in a really good position looking forward in 2021. And hence a complete lockdown, which would bring the new car market in automotive and the dealer footprint, constrained. Ex that, my view is this we have given you a real good look into ‘21 and throughout ‘20 we have given you the revenue guidance. We have told you what we are going to do on expenses, we managed earnings, we told you what's going to go into 2021. And so I really feel the team has done an exceptional job here and set us up great for ‘21, so no real big changes to our normal operating plan. Jonathan, do you want to add, I think that covered most of it, anything else? No, okay. Next question? Okay, thanks. Yes. Next question. Hey, Bill. Yes. Brian, do you want to move up Brian on here? Brian, do you want to handle that one? You are not – you are muted, Brian. Thanks. Thanks, Brian. No, I think the energy guys have, really managed that shift in business from upstream into the mid and downstream. And we just got to continue to do that. Here. We have got great customer relations, very deep. All customers, you heard shell announcement yesterday in terms of energy transition, and their focus, you heard BP talk about their net zero targets and where they are headed. We have got a lot to offer customers in and around clean tech renewables. And so my view is, is if I look at the TAM, for non fossil fuel driven energy analytics, data, scenario analysis, climate scenarios, ESG, my view is, we are the best firm in the world positioned to drive revenue growth into those segments as we go forward. So all I can tell you is I expect the mid and downstream to grow high single digits to double digits. And I expect that the upstream will wane through ‘21 with recovery into ‘22 and beyond, from a much lower base. And so really, we got to be the architects of that shift in change. But we have done this before, and it, the upstream is $300 million, less than $300 million of data now and about $300 million of analytics and thought leadership so it's not that it's not a big problem for the overall firm, but it is a challenge for Brian and his team and they are doing a great job. Next question? Down low, yes, down low single-digits. So one, two or three to me would be low single-digits in terms of a negative number. And so let me go to the first part of your question. So, I guess, well, first of all, I wouldn't compare what's going on in the energy markets to anything anywhere else in the firm. So transportation, here recurring revenue – we have had declines in some non-recurring revenue like recalls. So, government regulatory pressure has waned through COVID and therefore the recall agenda has been slowed down, but in the future, we expect recall to be an active part of our business and we will take the lion's share of that when it comes our way. The second thing we would say is that with less cars on the lots and less cars being manufactured in ‘20 deal the cars in some ways, I hate to say sell themselves, because there is a lack of supply and therefore easier to sell the cars, less money spent on marketing and audience building. That's a short-term issue. And then in the used car market, we have seen that accelerate back and all other products showing good demand, our forecasting and ability to deal with shifts in types of cars being manufactured and drive trains, etcetera position us really well. So, don't compare energy with automotive or transportation. When you get into energy, I really think if you are sitting in my shoes today, I think of this very simply. We got whatever $4.6 billion, $4.7 billion of revenues in IHS Markit. I take it down to the $600 million of upstream, which is less than 300 of data and pre-merger was more than 400. This data in upstream, the declining market and it's going to find its base and grow from there. So, in our 3-year contracts, after year 1, we put in 7% to 8% growth on average into those datasets. But this is miniscule in the picture of IHS Markit. So, it's not a dial mover, it helps, but it's not going to move the dial. So, I think you have to take that $600 million of data and say, okay, number one, the world as long as anybody is on this call is going to live plus all your children are still going to be using fossil fuels. So, we do have $600 million of revenue that's going to support that piece of the world economies. So, whether it's 70 million, 80 million or 100 million barrels a day, we need fossil fuels and nobody is connecting, turning on their lights getting to work moving around without some piece of their – the world's needs in fossil fuels. So, we are going to find our home in data somewhere around $200 million, $250million will be the world leaders will continue to support all of our customers and we are going to help them and leverage that position into energy transition and I feel really lucky that we have got financial markets, transportation and energy right at the core and the epicenter of decisions that are going to happen to drive the energy transition and the beyond zero, net zero world that we are heading to. The second thing I would say is the existing players that remain. So, all the sovereign oil companies, big national oil companies that still have committed resources and of course the small entrepreneurial exploration activities need help in analytics, cost management, they want the thought leadership, they want to understand pricing, forecasting, etcetera. So, I think that our analytics, so the non-data piece of upstream will wane a bit into ‘21 through bankruptcies in difficult times, but again should return to a more normalized, whereas high single-digits, but I would say looking forward, I think of 3% to 5%, mid single-digit growth. So net-net, take the whole firm, you've got to take resources, the billion of revenues next year, put it at low negative single-digits and expect it to be low to mid single-digits in ‘22 led by the continued transition both organically or through bolt-on acquisitions that are going to drive our future energy growth and that's it. That's how I am running the firm. That's how the team has been instructed to manage the challenges. And when I put that together across the whole firm, been there before and we just got to execute well. I have got a great team. We have got great customers. And I think from a shareholder perspective, we do exactly what we tell we are going to – we tell you we are going to do and therefore you have got great transparency into our capabilities. Next question? I will start. I think Adam is on with me, not sure, but I will start and then if he comes on he can join in with me. Okay. So first off, alternative markets, super strong private markets growth, we have got the leading asset in that space, Andrew. And as far as I can see forward, we are going to grow double-digits in that alternative space. So a piece of that came from Ipreo, which was the eye level piece. We were already doing valuations. We were already doing private debt markets, WSO compliance etcetera. So that net-net altogether, I don't see any of that waning. And if anything, we are continuing to build into that. On the actual volumes across munis, equities, fixed income in terms of the Ipreo businesses and the corporate solutions, I will let Adam give you some color on. Adam? Adam, in my remarks, I called out munis in the quarter, like just in terms of volumes, how are the muni markets through this year? Okay, good. Thanks, Adam. Next question? Okay, good. Well, I have got Edouard on with me. Edouard, do you want to take that one? Thanks, Edouard. Next question. Okay, excellent. Okay, so I will break that in two and then if Adam, sorry, if Yaacov wants to come in after me, if I leave anything out on the data lake or our tech journey, be happy for you to add to that Yaacov. So the first thing I would say, is, every year since merger, we have increased the absolute dollars we have spend on organic growth investments. So all of our divisions have, in their regular planning cycle, are incrementally investing in their business. But every year, we also run almost like a shark tank approach to what we call incremental investments that can be above our, or internal rate of return, targets for investing in every year, that number has been higher since merger. So we are getting increasing confidence in our ability to invest, and then execute a result that leads to an expanded organic growth. And I have mentioned a bit and maybe we do an investor day, we could really dig into our internal vitality score. And our vitality score is our measurement of this year's organic revenue coming from internal investments made over the last three years, or it's longer than the last three years, they have never been less than double the firm's organic growth results. So if we produce, 5% organic growth, we would leave it in if it was better than 10%. Because sometimes our investments take a bit longer to come in but if they're operating at double our firm growth, we feel they are still adding to the vitality of the company. Every single year, since merger, the vitality measurement has improved. The absolute dollars of vitality revenue and the percentage of revenue from vitality has improved. So I feel really good that organic growth investment in IHS Markit has a great cadence and a great story. And it's really impressive, I was with a reg and compliance head, John Barneson, the other day at a board update on organic, some of the new investments we have made and described the product with circa $1 million of investment over the last year, that's already has run-rate of heading over $5 million and we will have actual revenue next year of $10 million. Now not every investment we make of 1 million drives 10 million in new revenue. If that was the case, we would be growing at 10%, but the fact is, is the better we get at organic investment, the better this company is. It attracts more – it cracks better people, it's more exciting to work in, it's got more of a buzz and people feel they are part of investing in their products with technology to be better. So, I am super happy with that. And I wish I had $50 million every year to incrementally add, but the fact is, we don't have that, but incrementally, we are continuing to invest at what I would say is a growing cadence, well measured, well managed. The second thing I would say when we merged emerged with IHS Markit and IHS. And after merger you find, you have got technical debt, you have got old technology stacks that you don't want to just connect to new technology, you actually want to rip them out, throw them away and build something brand new. And that's been Yaacov's job. And Yaacov has taken the last 3.5 years building out a world class data lake with a $0.5 billion partnership with Amazon, which puts us completely cloud native. It's a long-term 7-year deal, which is the data lake is built and now all the products are going cloud-native and the connectivity of all of our key datasets to product development to customers out of the data lake into our cloud-native strategy is changing the profile of IHS Markit substantively. And so those investments are made. They are in our numbers. We have managed to do the CapEx OpEx switch, which is very difficult for companies. We map that into our investments with Amazon. And I just think the team here again, not to keep bragging about them, but this big shifts in info security cloud-native software and data lake architecture, that's what the best companies in the world are doing and our teams have orchestrated that. Yaacov, maybe you just want to tell our shareholders and our analysts here just a little bit about how you see the journey improving our client connectivity, our organic revenue growth, project development and just anything, maybe 5 minutes that you want to add around our cadence for excellence. Yes, great, so a lot going on and great question. But key for us has been this tech investment over the last 3 years and we are seeing the results. And I think the team has done a great job. Next question. Yes, I think historically, we have always said, 1% or 2% of our overall growth across the whole firm comes from price. And I don't know if Jonathan if you want to add any further detail on that, but I think that generally when you look across the whole firm, we get about 1% to 2% organic growth for the – related to price. Jonathan, do you want to add to that? Okay, thank you. Next question. Yes. So 60 to 65, we return back into the 60s, mainly, we had some one-offs this year with the pensions that we posed profitably the teams did a good job there. We had some of the restructuring for COVID. So, the tax costs that were left over from the Trump changes, I think our view is as we go into 2021, we will be back 60% plus. Jonathan, is that accurate? Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Yes. No, definitely, installing software solutions through COVID has been strained, but the team did do a good job getting us through 2020. We have a strongest pipeline we have ever had across the business. And Adam might want to add a few details into that picture. Adam? Thanks, Adam. Next question. Okay, no, good question. We haven't had that one for a bit. So, first off on buybacks, we have committed the 50% to 75%. So that's – nothing has changed on that. I think you can look forward at us and be thinking $200 million to $300 million a quarter is a reasonable cadence for buybacks. Well, maintaining our leverage, sub three times. I think that leads us, half a billion plus, in terms of bolt on acquisitions, and anything above that would require us to, increase our leverage before delivering again. And so we, are good acquirers we, we make great acquisitions in the past. And we are always monitoring the markets. But if you ask me, the return on invested capital on organic growth, versus acquisitions, I would say when the teams are doing their jobs we should always be going after the organic growth. And we definitely increased our cadence of organic growth over the last, three, four years, so I am pleased that we don't need to acquire to support our long term objectives. What I would say, is, scale matters. And I feel a lot better about being a $30 billion dollar company versus being a $10 billion company. And I think that scale matters didn't top difficult worlds that we operate in. And so we have done a great job to grow the company, grow our free cash flow, and then use it accordingly. And so the dividend is great for our shareholders, they like that certain cash flow, share buybacks is another way to pay back. And we think given 50% to 75% of our cash, our cash back to shareholders is a good strategy. And if great M&A is there, we have got ample room for bolt-ons. And we have some room on leverage if we wanted to do something a bit bigger. So I can't say more than that, except that our strategy of that combination is voted well. And we are very cautious on the return on invested capital of all those different strategic alternatives. And so, if COVID brings the cost of assets down, somewhat, that could be good, but actually are multiple, I would love to see our multiple, two or three turns better. So things look a lot cheaper to us. So that is where we are, I wouldn't expect any strategic change, short term, but you should expect this to always look at what's best for the company, and best for the long term goals of the company and shareholders. Next question, we must be getting near the end operator. Okay, we will answer all three of them. Yes. Okay. Jonathan, do you want to grab that in terms of our forward model? Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Right, okay. Thanks, Toni. So I think Biden drives green. And so in terms of energy transition, everything we are doing around supply chain, maritime measurement of the ESG of the maritime fleet, our ESG advisory and products around our indices into financial markets, I think Biden pushing a green agenda forward is good for us. I also think that Biden, pushing a regulatory compliance driven agenda is also good for a firm like ours. So those two things are things that might bode well. I think that, more free flowing, globalization and better global relationships could be a win for IHS Markit as well. But I have to say volatility and challenging marketplaces, fuel financial markets, services providers, and that hasn't heard us through COVID. In terms of the automotive sector, Edouard can add to it, but people need as much advice and solutions, and used in new car advice around shifts to ease as they do on combustion engines. And we do provide a lot of services around the drive train and that shift from combustion TVs. But, Edouard, do you want to drive a little bit deeper detail on that? Thanks, Edouard. Next question. Yes, so 5% to 7% had been our long-term forecast for driving the firm. And then when we acquired Ipreo, we boosted the – no sorry, we are 4% to 6% and when we acquired Ipreo, we boosted financial service to 6% to 8%. And therefore we raise the overall organic growth forecast of the firm, to 5% to 7%. And I still believe 5% to 7%, the right level of conservatism in terms of what we provide to shareholders, our expectations across the firm. And I have to tell you that there is nobody in the firm that doesn't want to be at the high end or beating that range, but there is always something that across our company that might put us in 6%, instead of 7% or 5%, instead of 6% and so hence the 5% to 7%. As we go through the year, you can see from our forecast right now on revenue, we have got to pin down to like a $5 million spread. So, we know our revenues and our ability to keep them very, very well. So, I think 5% to 7% is the right level. As we grow things like alternatives, renewable energy, energy transition, our asset management related platform activities, our roles and reg and compliance, these are areas that's growing double-digit. As those grow and gain additional cadence in the firm and investments play through, I expect those areas to push us up to the higher end. And I would love one day to come on here and say 6 days. But for 2021, we can say 6-day, because we are coming off a 4-year in terms of comps. And so really, I think 6 or 8 next year is not, it's just it's not the highest order. It's a return from a really challenge year. And therefore, I think the more interesting year is 2022, are we back in line for the 5% to 7%. And I have to say hand in my heart, I think we have got more than enough target addressable market to do that. So I don't worry about our long-term ability to grow revenue, I think we are leading edge with our customers, where we have got great employment practices, even proved right through COVID. With our diversity and inclusion measurements, our community scores with our employees and our community scores with our customers. So feels buoyant, feels good, I feel great about that. When you grow at the top end of the range, you start to grow margin, automatically. But we have a business that's very global, can easily work from home, can easily deliver many of our solutions virtually and leadership virtually, we just got to use more technology. So we have been investing in more technology. And therefore, I see no problem with IHS Markit being one of those 50% margin companies, like many of our peers, they do a damn good job, they manage expenses, they grow revenue, and they find their home around that high 40% to 50% margin. And I expect us to be there as well. And I don't want to rush it, because I want to make sure that we are constantly investing in those new market opportunities. And I think we are doing that just fine. And then when you look down through earnings this year, we have always had double-digit earnings, I just said earlier in the call, 13% to 15% because all of a sudden we were fully termed out on our debt. So, no rising interest costs, good management of depreciation, excellent tax team that's given us a good adjusted tax rate. And so I have to say that all of those mechanisms are in place. And so as the last call of the day, all I can say to you is, I will reiterate again, competence in revenue growth, competence in expense management, competence in the double-digit earnings growth. Our portfolio has been adjusted over the 3 to 4 years since merger. We will continue to fuel the strengths and lessen impacts of challenge markets, we will grow through that. And we have ample opportunity with the free cash flow we have to invest back into our shareholders or into the company for new opportunities. So I think we are – nothing has s really changed except that we have been through the most surreal period of our lives. It's been tough for customers. We have helped them. It's been tough for employees and we have reached out to them and delivered for our teams. It's been tough to build new products virtually, but the teams have managed to do it. So, next year, the only thing I can say to you is, if we get a complete shutdown or lockdown and we have to keep people at home locked up and they are not out on the dealer floors, they are not out buying cars, there is nobody out drilling for oil, the financial markets will continue to operate, they have proven they can do that. It will be another tough year. And I will give you crystal clear transparency in what we are doing every quarter. But I actually think the world is heading towards an eased lockdown situation, not that they are not going to lockdown regional, I think there is going to be all sorts of regional lockdowns. But I don't see us coming to a complete standstill again in terms of our forward forecast. And if that happens, when we give you our guidance in November, we will have to update it. But at the moment, I think you have got as much knowledge as I do and I hope the transparency is appreciated and thank you for all your support. At this point, Eric, we will end the call."

            "content": "Great. Thank you, Lance. Diving into Q3 results, we delivered revenue of $1.07 billion, which represents an organic decline of 1% and total revenue decline of 4%. Normalized organic growth was 0% with recurring growth of 2%. Net income of $163 million and a GAAP EPS of $0.41. Our adjusted EBITDA of $486 million, an increase of 9% on a normalized basis with a margin of 45.3%. This represents a margin expansion of 460 basis points and we also delivered adjusted EPS of $0.77, an increase of 16% on a normalized basis. Moving on to revenue, our Q3 normalized organic of 0% included recurring organic growth of 2% and a non-recurring organic decline of 22% or 18% normalized. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by three items, slower delivery of software implementations driven by COVID, continued lower OEM auto activities and finally lower energy consulting and software sales. Moving on to segment performance, our financial services segment drove organic growth of 4%, including 5% recurring in the quarter. Information and solutions in particular has strong performances delivering 4% and 7% organic growth, while processing had an 8% organic decline due to the expected lower volumes year-over-year. Within processing, we do expect a return to growth in Q4 and for the year to be in low single-digits. Our transportation segment delivered organic growth of 0% in the quarter. This included growth of 5% recurring as pricing returned to more normalized levels for our dealer customers and a decline of 12% in non-recurring, primarily driven by continued delays in digital marketing and recall. Our resources segment had 9% organic decline, which is comprised of 5% recurring decline and 39% non-recurring decline. Q3 organic ACV decreased by $34 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is negative 6% and has been heavily impacted by challenges in the North American energy market as Lance discussed. Our CMS segment delivered 1% normalized organic growth per BPVC, including 2% recurring and a decline of 12% normalized non-recurring. Moving now to profits and margins adjusted EBITDA was $486 million, up $33 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 9% on a normalized basis, with a margin of 45.3%, up 460 basis points. Moving on to our segments, financial services adjusted EBITDA was $226 million, with a margin of 50.7%, up 430 basis points. Financial services margin was driven by strong revenue flow-through benefiting from our Q2 cost reductions. We do expect some moderation in financial services margin in Q4 due both to increased investments and a shift in product mix. Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $154 million, with a margin of 51.4%, up 880 basis points driven by a return of dealer revenue and a slower return of variable cost. We do expect margins in Q4 to moderate as expenses tied to revenue come back with a return of growth and also increase investment spending, which will drive future growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $86 million, with a margin of 41.5%, a decrease of 230 basis points and CMS adjusted EBITDA was $31 million, with a margin of 25.7%, up 330 basis points. This large increase was driven by the rationalization of a TMT product group, post a divestiture and cost control measures across product design and ECR. Our adjusted EPS was $0.77 per diluted share, an increase of 16% on a normalized basis and 15% in total and our GAAP tax rate was 20% with adjusted tax rate of 18%. Moving on to Q3 free cash flow, we delivered $339 million. As a reminder, our trailing 12-month conversion rate has been impacted by several non-recurring items, including the following. A one-time tax payment in Q4 2019 associated with changes in the U.S. tax provisions. The settlement of our U.S. and UK pension plans Q1 payroll taxes associated with the exercising of a majority of their remaining outstanding options and finally one-time cost tied to the cost reduction efforts in Q2 of this year. Turning to the balance sheet, our Q3 ending debt balance was $5.0 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7x on a bank covenant basis and 2.6x net of cash. We continued to manage our balance sheets to provide liquidity and flexibility. We closed the quarter with $157 billion of cash and our Q3 un-drawn revolver balance was approximately $1.182 billion representing a great liquidity position. Our Q3 weighted average diluted share count was 401 million shares and reflected the pause of our repurchase program, which we announced in March. As we indicated during our Q2 earnings call, we did anticipate and expect to return to share buybacks and we announced a redemption of this program in August. We subsequently launched a $200 million ASR on September 1. Moving on to guidance, we remain very confident in our 2020 ranges. We are now trending to the midpoint of our revenue range of $4.28 billion to $4.3 billion. This represents a normalized organic growth rate for the year of between 0% and 1% led by recurring organic growth of 2% to 3%. On adjusted EBITDA, we were also trending to the midpoint of our range of $1.825 billion to 1.835 billion. This represents a margin of 42.7% and applies quarter-over-quarter contraction as our variable costs are reintroduced due to the improving revenue and also due to increased product investment. For adjusted EPS, we are trending to the high-end of our $2.76 to $2.78 range, which represents 10% year-on-year growth. And finally, we do expect free cash flow to run at 50% of adjusted EBITDA. And now, I will pass the call back to Lance to talk about 2021. Yes, sure thing, Lance. So first, it's, I mean, you covered it well, but the two things I would add is when we think about the cost reductions we took in Q2, three categories, there is a fixed cost, which are gone permanently, and as Lance said is this perfect opportunity or this future opportunities to continue to work our cost structure, there is a natural variable cost that comes with revenue going up and down. And the third is the revenue that we – are the variable costs we chose to kind of squeeze up – squeeze down quite a bit in Q2. And what happened in Q3 is a good news story frankly is the revenue, particularly in transportation came back faster than we expected and faster than as been our ramp back on that variable cost that we have squeezed. The other thing I would call out is investments. We did open up some additional investments starting in Q3 heading into Q4. It certainly will benefit us in 2021 and beyond. But Gary, when it comes back to when you see in Q4, you are going to see the margin at the second level come down a bit really is the fact that our revenue performance was a bit better in Q3 than we expected certainly in transportation. I think you covered it, Lance. Thanks. Yes. Well, COVID, given us a real great vision into our cost footprint in terms of real estate, in terms of where we can hire people to effectively do the jobs in the company, so what's the location and our ability to actively manage 16,000 people working from home. And I guess nowadays, if somebody is in New York City, in the Finger Lakes, working in Taos, New Mexico or in their summer home in south of France, I can't really tell anymore, their backgrounds or walls mostly or fake backgrounds, where they want to quote one. And so really we have become experts at managing in this virtual new world and that's given us a chance to really look at our forward organizational design and I believe through attrition, so not having to let people go. But just managing attrition and managing a forward location strategy, leveraging technology, there is no issue with us thinking that we can expand 100 basis points per annum. Now, your second bit is can you have more and my view is an information services company that's diversified like we are and diversified means that if you do five things, usually one out of the five is you have got to be focused and it's a bit challenged and we have always had that. My view is, as we can grow steadily at mid single-digits, 5% to 8% or 6% to 8%, I really feel good about our ability to manage our revenue levers, but they all include services that over time wane in growth as they become saturated and those products end up falling to 2% to 3%, 1% to 3% revenue growth, see, you have got to be fueling the new growth products. So, investment is key. This year, we have invested $7.5 million more than we invested in the previous year in what we call investments in organic growth, both within each of the divisions, but even layering some additional expense over top. So, the teams got to invest. So my view is as I look forward, I don't really want to expand margin faster than 100 basis points if it's ever going to cost me a slippage on organic growth below 5%. So, therefore I want to invest, make sure that we push to the high-end of our organic revenue growth range, do it consistently, invest smartly, measure our approach and you know what 100 basis points margin expansion is good margin expansion and it helps us give you double-digit earnings growth that you can expect for the next 3 to 5 years. And I guess at merger, we were negative 2% to flat on revenue growth and 0% to 2%, 2% to 4%, 4% to 6%, 5% to 7%. We made a couple acquisitions, we pushed to 6% to 8%, haven't missed a thing. We promised 100 basis points every year, you never missed it, promised double-digit earnings growth every year. So, the fact is, is just expect that's what we are going to do and we will manage through the $600 million of resources challenge, put it behind us drive on grow the new business organically and make sure that we deliver the returns, a vibrant company service our customers well, I think all the metrics are strong and bode well for ‘21. Next question? Yes, I will just be real brief, Andrew. So when you think about our buildup on the subs line, I was going to start the year at 100%, we have cancellations for whatever reason, our renewal rate has been kind of low to mid 90s and then you build up from there. And as Lance said, pricing we do and it does vary by end markets, the condition of the end markets, think about option right now, it's more difficult to capture the capture price, given the challenges there. But typically about a couple of points that you get from price, the biggest driver really get on the buildup is really on cross-selling and up-selling products and certainly the focus, as we have talked about this call is around introducing – divesting dollars into innovation and driving new products into that customer base and into our channel, but think about just for your modeling purposes about a couple. It is. And I will just add to it, Lance, as several one-offs this year, those items you mentioned, the pension being a third. And we also had some COVID-related impacts to working capital, working capital typically is positive as we sign a new contract and bill upfront and the support some of our clients took in auto and auto OEMs and energy we have supported slightly different payment terms. But looking forward to next year as we have cycled through, look what happened with our contracts, the one-time items will flush through we expect to be back up to mid 60s next year. Sure. So – and I will be staying on top of my head a bit here, Jeff, but for Q1 year-over-year of ‘21 compared to ‘20, I think we likely will see some margin expansion just because a lot of our cost reduction took place, going to be an impact in Q2, Q3, Q4. And so Q1 year- over-year is going to be before all the COVID impact that takes place. Certainly, for the year, we do expect to drive over the course of the year, continued margin expansion."

So Bill, when you look at ACV, right now through the quarter, our upstream group is showing negative ACV, but all the other groups are already showing positive. So, we see a lot of strength in our especially in our clean-tech kind of gas business, good demand for LNG analytics, good demand in plastics and that's just going to continue through FY ‘21, Lance mentioned bankruptcies, there is also closures that also have been affecting upstream ACV. So, in addition to bankruptcies, you had about 40 companies that have also just shutdown. You saw yesterday, Devon merged with WPX. So, those are factoring into the ACV, but the companies that went into bankruptcy are also coming out of bankruptcy now. So you have companies like Denbury, Whiting Sanches, those companies are now emerging and they are buying our services."

            "content": "Thank you, Lance. So, I will just talk about, I will start with the data lake just to give an update on that and if there is time, I will go into technology. So first of all, after extensive internal use of data lake by internal IHS Markit advanced analytics team and some of the business lines, we went to market in May this year, making multi-tenant data lake available to our clients as well as extended our reach to potential partners. We have several sign clients, we have got roughly 15 clients in serious evaluation and we have got 150 active client conversations. We are leveraging our existing broad-based sales force and account management teams in reaching our client base worldwide. We are now building out a multimillion dollar engagement pipeline vis-à-vis data lake and our client. Our client engagements in the context span their financial services, energy and automotive client base since data lake is domain agnostic. We have ingested into the data lake the entirety of IHS Markit structured and semi-structured data, this process is ongoing and it is automated from day one since our data footprint is expanded by way of adding new business domains, e.g., agribusiness and similar. At the end of November, we will release the next version of data lake, which will contain around just shy of 1 million unstructured data items, e.g., research documents and analyst reports that will be catalog, discoverable and curated in a similar way per structured data content. In addition, we will provide some advanced features such as document summarization and other advanced machine learning and AI feature engineering based benefits. This type of functionality forms part and parcel of our unstructured data ingest pipeline. By the end of 2020, we will achieve decentralization and discoverability of our data estate across structured and unstructured data and provide same functionalities to our clients. There is one more step I would like to mention for us to deliver to complete the data lake journey as in connecting relevant the data dots across our entire data estate. So, I will pause here for a moment."

            "name": "Edouard Tavernier",
            "content": "Yes, Ashish, thanks for your question and great point. So, we do work with a vast majority of dealers in the North American market one way or the other. The great news is we have a portfolio of products as you mentioned with different levels of penetration for each of those products. So if you take a mature product like CARFAX advantage, then we are approaching kind of maximum penetration. The great news is we have products like CARFAX used car listings or CARFAX for Life, which has plenty of runway and which we see growing for a number of years ahead of us, same story for Mastermind. Mastermind has been growing its penetration rapidly over the past 2 years, but frankly, we still have most of the markets to go after and we are continuing to introduce new offerings like our used car capability this summer, which gives us plenty more growth for the future. Yes, a couple of quick words turn in response to your question. So as Lance said policy and regulatory uncertainty drives and need for data for decision making by our customers. And so in that sense, this is a interesting environments to create new data assets and new products. You mentioned the California ban. You could have mentioned also the EU revised targets for emissions reduction by 2030, which were published last week. And all of this creates a need for large scale simulation of what does this mean for my business? What does it mean for my portfolio, Lance mentioned innovation. So I would say this whole area of emissions compliance, and electrification is probably the most innovative area of our portfolio. I will give you a couple of examples, next month, where we are releasing a monthly rolling forecast of compliance versus EU, China and U.S. regulations, which is a new tracking and monitoring tool for customers. And in January, we are very excited about this. We are launching a simulation tool that will allow our customers, parts makers as well as carmakers to really run a variety of simulations on the portfolio, their competitors' portfolio to understand how they achieve compliance cost effectively, so very exciting area for us for customers and the place in which we are focusing a lot of resources."

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Eric Boyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nEric Boyer: Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q2 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter based on non-GAAP measures are adjusted numbers, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit's filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. Before we get started, I want to direct your attention to our supplemental slides posted on our IR website which we will be referencing today. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions. With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance Uggla. Lance?\nLance Uggla: Okay, thank you, Eric and thank you everybody for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings call. In light of the recent events in the U.S., specifically, the murder of George Floyd, I want to say that IHS Markit stands in solidarity with our black colleagues and with all of those who face discrimination in our communities around the world. I’ve learned a lot in the last few weeks and have much more to learn.  At IHS Markit, we are committed to inclusivity and equality. We will not tolerate any racial prejudice in our workplace and we’ll take aggressive actions in the coming weeks and months to improve diversity inclusion in our firm and in the communities around us. These actions will not be temporary reactions to current events, but long-term commitments to change.  As expected, Q2 was a challenging quarter due to the COVID pandemic. However, I am extremely pleased with the way the organization responded and are positioned to deliver results within the scenario ranges we provided on our Q1 call. This includes, recurring organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth on a normalized basis.  Through our strong cost management, we have also protected profit against further revenue downside and funded investments for our growth initiatives. A great result in a challenging period. And I personally want to thank my team globally for their hard work and dedication in this new adjusted work model.  For today’s financial discussion, when we speak to the normalized results, we are excluding the impact of the Aerospace and Defense divestiture, as well as the events cancellation on growth rates for revenue, EBITDA, and EPS.  So let’s start with the financial highlights in the quarter. Revenue of $1.08 billion, down 3% on a normalized organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $454 million and margin of 44.2%, which is up 320 basis points year-over-year due to strong cost management and adjusted EPS of $0.69, up 11% over the prior year, again on a normalized basis.  On our Q1 call, we provided 2020 guidance based upon macro and market recovery assumptions and we suggested three potential scenarios, a Q3, a Q4 and a 2021 recovery. We can say since our call, in Q1 in March, we now have clarity on how our markets and customers are reacting, giving us a lot of confidence in our revenue assumptions.  Additionally, our cost actions executed early in the year have given us strong line of sight into adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS for the year. As such, we are now comfortable providing a tight guidance range for 2020 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS.  Now let me provide some segment commentary for our Q2 and rest of the year assumptions. Financial Services provided strong resilience for the firm with Q2 organic growth of 3%. This was achieved with very strong results from Information and Processing, somewhat offset by temporary slower growth in Solutions.  Information’s key areas of strength included pricing and valuation services, indices and equities information.  Within Processing, derivatives business benefited from increased market volatility which led to higher volumes.  Solutions was pressured from a hard year-over-year comparison. Last year in Q2 was a 15% quarter and some services of course being delayed through the COVID period in terms of implementation.  Going forward, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the year with continued strength in Information, improving growth in Solutions as customers are resuming their normal operations and Processing to normalize to pre-COVID volume levels.  Transportation in Q2 reported a normalized organic revenue decline of 16%. Revenue from the Used Car portion of our auto business was impacted by our voluntary price release for dealer customers, a pause in new sales activity and some cancellations. Our New Car business was negatively impacted around new sales activity and a pause in non-recurring services around recall and marketing.  Our Maritime and Trade business performed as expected. Our revenue guidance for Transportation is now for a decline of low to mid-single-digits for the year. We expect our Used Car business to benefit as consumer demand continues to improve and our New Car business to be somewhat negatively impacted as customers remain in conservation mode until late second half.  Within Maritime and Trade, we assume a gradual improvement over the second half with the shipping industry, as global trade begins to improve.  Now moving to Resources, which reported a normalized organic revenue decline of 1%, our downstream organic growth was offset by a challenged upstream environment. The industry remains on pace for global CapEx reductions in the 30% range for the year in line with our previous expectations. As such, we expect normalized organic revenue growth for the year to be negative low-single-digits.  CMS organic revenue growth was low-single-digits as expected with strength in product design, somewhat offset by weakness in our TMT business. For the year, we continue to expect organic growth in the low-single-digits excluding the impact of the boiler pressure vessel code.  Moving to our cost actions, I have to say I am very pleased with the speed and level of cost reductions that were achieved focusing on both near-term necessities and long-term optimization. We exceeded our initial objectives.  Overall, we are well positioned to deliver solid earnings growth this year and to return to strong organic revenue growth in 2021, which I’ll detail after Jonathan goes over our Q2 results.  Jonathan?\nJonathan Gear : Great. Thanks, Lance. Q2 results included the following: Revenue of $1.03 billion, organic decline of 7%, and total revenue decline of 10%; normalized organic decline was 3%; net income of $71 million and a GAAP EPS of $0.18; adjusted EBITDA of $454 million, which is an increase of 9% on a normalized basis, with margins of 44.2%. This represents a margin expansion of 320 basis points, and finally, adjusted EPS of $0.69, an increase of 11% on a normalized basis.  Regarding revenue, our Q2 normalized organic decline of 3% included recurring organic growth of 1% and non-recurring organic decline of 26%. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by a tough year-on-year comp in Financial Services, lower OEM auto activities and lower Energy Consulting.  Now moving on to segment performance; our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 3%, including 6% recurring in the quarter. Information and Processing had their strong performances delivering 7% and 8% organic growth respectively, while Solutions had a 3% organic decline due to a difficult comp to prior year’s quarter and lower software and consulting delivery driven by COVID delays.  Our Transportation segment delivered normalized organic decline of 16% in the quarter. This included a decline of 10% recurring and a decline of 31% in non-recurring, primarily driven by delays in digital marketing, recalls and the retail portion of our Used Car business. Our resources segment had 1% organic decline normalized for events which is comprised of 1% recurring growth and 15% in non-recurring declines.  Q2 organic ACV decreased by $20 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is negative 0.7% Our CMS segment delivered 2% total growth, including 2% recurring and flat non-recurring.  Turning now to profits and margins, our adjusted EBITDA was $434 million, down $11 million versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 9% on a normalized basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.2%, which is up 320 basis points.  Moving to segment profitability, Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $231 million with a margin of 52.2%, up 470 basis points. Financial Services margin was driven by strong revenue flow through benefiting from prior year’s cost reductions and a favorable product mix. We do expect some moderation in Financial Services margin in the second half due to increased investments and a shift in our product mix.  Transportation’s adjusted EBITDA was $102 million with a margin of 41.8%, which is down 120 basis points, driven by the dealer pricing concessions which we have discussed.  Resources’ adjusted EBITDA was $96 million with a margin of 43.9%, an increase of 10 basis points. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $35 million with a margin of 29%, up 710 basis points. This large increase was driven by the rationalization of the TMT Resources post the divestiture last year and great cost control measures across product design and ECR.  Moving on to adjusted EPS, our adjusted EPS was $0.69 per diluted share, a decline of $0.02 or 3%, albeit an increase of 11% once normalized for the ADS divestiture and the events to cancellation. Our GAAP tax rate was 6% and our adjusted tax rate was 18%. Our Q2 free cash flow was $209 million.  As a reminder, our trailing twelve month conversion rate was impacted by several non-recurring items and I would call out the following: one-time tax payments in Q4 2019 associated with the changes in the U.S tax provisions; the Q2 settlement of our U.S. and UK pension plans; Q1 payroll taxes associated with the exercising of a majority of the remaining outstanding options; and finally, one-time costs associated with our cost reduction efforts.  Turning to balance sheet, our Q2 ending debt balance was $5.4 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 3.0 times on a bank covenant basis, 2.9 times net of cash, which is in line with the top-end of our capital policy. We continue to manage our balance sheet to provide liquidity and flexibility in this environment.  We closed the quarter with $208 million of cash and our Q2 undrawn revolver balance with approximately $750 million representing a great liquidity position. In Q2, we closed a very small acquisition that extends our Derivatives processing capabilities within APAC and made a small investment in an AI-based retail fuel pricing solution. In June, we also divested our small product tear down business within TMT.  Our Q2 weighted average diluted share count was 400 million shares. We repurchased 252 million of shares in the quarter including completing our $215 million Q2 ASR at an average price of $62.20. Year-to-date, share repurchase is $852 million. We expect to return to share buybacks later this year or early next year while maintaining our capital policy of operating within the two to three times gross leverage range.  Moving on to guidance, as Lance stated, we entered the second half with strong visibility to revenues and a very clear line of sight to earnings. Based on this, we are comfortable providing a tighter guidance range, which assumes no additional major lock-ins.  Our full year guidance is as follows: revenue of 4.28 billion to $4.3 billion, this represents an organic growth rate normalized for the year of between 0% and 1%; adjusted EBITDA of $1.825 billion to $1.835 billion; this represents a margin of 42.7%; adjusted EPS of $2.76 to $2.78 representing 10% year-on-year growth and we expect free cash flow to run at 50% of adjusted EBITDA.  And now I will turn the call back to Lance to go through our outlook for 2021. \nLance Uggla: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. I feel very confident in our 2020 guidance as shown by the tight ranges that Jonathan just provided you. Looking forward to 2021, I want to once again break with the traditional practice and actually give you a deep insight into our 2021 planning forecasts.  We’ll look to taking these ranges as we enter 2021 and our starting point for 2021 is that we are going to have a gradual global economic recovery, no further major lock-ins and by major lock-ins complete world shutting down as we have seen in Q2, there may be small regional lock-ins like we’ve recently seen in Beijing, but that will be well managed and very conservative events revenue. Okay.  So top-line, we expect organic revenue growth next year of 7% to 9%, which includes the following assumptions by segment.  So first, Financial Services revenues will return to its longer term organic revenue growth range of 6% to 8%. Strength will continue in Information. We’ll return to our high-single-digit growth in Solutions, which is well supported by strong backlog and pipeline of orders. And Processing revenues moderate back to more normal levels. Transportation, we are expecting to grow in the range of 14% to 16%.  Now this sounds high, but this is well supported by our usual growth of high-single-digits, plus a favorable year-over-year benefit due to 2020 dealer price concessions that were made and the resumption of a more normalized OEM service level.  In Resources, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%. And this is assuming continued downstream strength, which we are seeing on a growing portion of our energies division, offset by weakness in upstream as a result of lower 2020 bookings being fully reflected in our annual recurring revenue.  And then finally CMS, which has actually done a great job post-merger and is now expected to maintain itself in mid-single-digit organic growth range.  Okay, let’s take a look at EBITDA. Here the team has done a lot of work in this COVID period but we still expect approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion next year. This will put us within the mid-40s range solidly that we set as our intermediate goal when announcing the merger and we remain confident from this range of margin in our ability to continue margin expansion going forward.  Some of this has come from the illuminated additional opportunities for margin expansion that we witnessed through the COVID period and working from home.  And finally, we expect adjusted EPS growth in 2021 to be in the 13% to 15% range. And that’s 10% to 12% when normalized for the impact of events. So make sure you think about the events and that impacts and that puts us solidly into our 10% to 12% range. But next year, we’ll be 13% to 15% without normalizing the events.  Now as in our 2020 forecast provided on our Q1 call, we are also providing an expected floor to our 2021 forecast. So how are we thinking about the downside to that 7% to 9% scenario? The floor accounts for a potential second lock-down that would be similar in magnitude to the one just experienced.  In this instance, our organic revenue growth would be approximately 5%. So we’d see an adjustment and that’s really about automotive lockdown and adjusted EPS growth would be in the high-single-digits. And that combination of revenue and expense marriage in automotive around the lockdown is now well understood through Q2.  In conclusion, we’d make tough decisions to protect our earnings, growth during this challenging period, which I am pleased the team has done an excellent job on. And we’ve created capacity to invest in substantive opportunities that will enable us to deliver within our longer-term organic revenue range of 5% to 7% for the continuing years to come.  While the world still faces uncertainty, we’ll continue to provide unparalleled transparency into how we are managing the business to help U.S. shareholders navigate these challenging investment times. We are firmly positioned to deliver strong results through this uncertainty, demonstrated by our 2020 tight guidance range that Jonathan provided and the outlook for even stronger performance in 2021.  Operator, we are ready to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. \nGary Bisbee : Hey guys. Good morning. \nLance Uggla: Hi, Gary. \nGary Bisbee : I guess, I am going to try to sneak in a two-parter here on Transportation. The first part, just how are you seeing the business trend in recent weeks as we are seeing the reopening begin to flow through and I would expect to impact the dealerships?  And the second part, is there a lot of discussion in the press about auto sales moving online or a lot of the process for dealers moving online? I guess, just any thoughts on how your portfolio is impacted or plays in that transition of we see this continue both new and/or Used Cars seeing more of the process of going online? Thank you. \nLance Uggla: Okay. Great. Those are good questions. I’ve got my management team with me on today. So, Edouard Tavernier runs all transportation on and I’ll let Edouard take that and I’ll add to it if needed. Edouard?\nEdouard Tavernier : Great. Thank you, Lance and thanks, Gary for the questions. I’ll take your two-parter. On the first part, obviously, we saw a strong drop-off in activity in late March, which lasted through end of April. But since late April, we have seen as you suggested an earlier than expected recovery in both used car sales and new car sales.  At this point in time, the used car sales market is solid. The outlook remains solid for the rest of the year. There is a little bit of pent-up demand that’s supporting us and that we have seen a corresponding increase in the volume of activity at CARFAX in particular. \ncost drop despite: So, we still see a challenging environment in the new car markets and in particular some inventory challenges through Q3. So, two stories here, used car versus new cars, but we have seen dealers coming back online and stronger levels of activity.  On your second question, you are right that this has been one significant shift in the market in the past few months, it has been a move to online retailing by dealers. We have aggressively embraced online retailing and we are supporting them in a number of ways. We have some great digital market assets with which we support automotive dealers.  And then automotiveMastermind business unit with its sales and marketing platform has been helping dealers who were working online drive leads to their staffs who were working remotely and in that sense, we are participating in this shift to online retailing as much as we can. \nLance Uggla: Excellent. Thanks, Edouard. Next question? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. \nManav Patnaik : Hey. Good morning guys. \nLance Uggla: Hi, Manav. \nManav Patnaik : Lance, I just wanted to understand your guidance for the floor at 5% in 2021, maybe the assumption behind that – correctly means basically a similar shutdown to what we’re seeing this year. And so, just curious why the revenue resiliency is so much stronger, is that easier comps? Or how should we think about how you cut through that?\nLance Uggla: Yes, well, if I look at next year at 7% to 9% and putting a black swan scenario at 5%, it’s at least 2% below the range which is about $90 million of revenue. So it’s quite substantive and that would more than offset what we’ve seen in this global shutdown here around our automotive business. So, my view is, is that, that’s a solid planning tool that I use with my teams in terms of budgeting and looking on a forward basis.  And I felt that instead of just sharing with you the 7% to 9%, and waiting for the question, what if there is another wave? Well, to me, how I challenge their numbers is if there was a substantive quarterly or several months shutdown globally again, what would that look like? My personal view as we plan is that there will be some second and third waves like we’ve just seen in Beijing.  But I believe communities, governments, hospitals, a whole bunch of therapeutics and other things are starting to emerge and the management of the waves will be more contained and the return to business and resumption to business will be faster. So, I do think the 5% floor is a solid floor and one that provides our shareholders with the peak to how we think in terms of a second wave.  But really our confidence is in the 7% to 9% and actually performing the businesses that we run, that we know how to run and returning to a more normalized approach to running our business. Jonathan, did you want to add anything else to that? \nJonathan Gear: Well, I think you know that well, Lance. And I’ll just mathematically – it kind of goes back to your point is the year-on-year comp will kind of help us in that point. But I think the key thing as Lance said, we now have a clear line of sight to our own customers about how they would behave in a similar type shutdown.  The impact as Lance said, would be primarily in automotive and we have a view both on how the customers will react and also how we can react and support customers to even provide commerce in a semi-shutdown situation. \nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. \nBill Warmington : Good morning everyone. \nLance Uggla: Hi, Bill. \nBill Warmington : So, a question for you on the cost cuts and maybe if you could talk a little bit about the cuts that you have been making on a permanent basis, those that you’ve been making on a variable basis so far, you hinted at the potential for doing some additional ones going forward.  And then, I am asking this in the context of what gives you confidence that those cost reductions are not going to harm the revenue growth potential of the business going forward?\nLance Uggla: Right. Yes, no, I think that’s – those are fair points and I think since merger, I think we’ve been consistent in our approach to margin expansion heading to the mid-40s and we probably would have thought we’d be there in another couple of years, not now.  But the pandemic for us, we have a called action in terms of my leadership team early in the year and we took the appropriate measures to protect our long-term earnings growth and also to protect 2020 against the potential for an even longer period of lockdown.  And so, I think the teams did a good job. Now a big piece of the cuts in 2020 came around compensation cuts. Those will return and start to resume probably for some of the – not necessarily my direct reports, but potentially their direct reports. I’ll look to get a return to normal salary levels at the appropriate time in the second half of this year.  For my reports and myself, I think the prudent is to see most of this year past and look at a return and resumption into next year depending on the second half performance. We have a large cash bonus to all that gave us some short-term reprieve for 2020. But as we perform at those levels in 2021, it will need to come back in.  We took action on early on some leases that were coming up and on some smaller offices where we said we’ll have a changed footprint going forward. So those are more permanent cuts that require a little bit of restructuring.  We executed those very rapidly with a SWAT team. We have the automotive cuts, actually are mainly around the marketing costs and so when the revenue declined, of course, those costs came into play, but as revenue grows, they will come back in together in parallel.  So, no harm done there. And then I think the biggest thing that I am really proud for my team is the cuts that they made around a large portion of our staff that was being hired on a contract basis, which in a lot of times is an expensive way to staff, but sometimes accelerates initiatives and it’s easy also to manage them. And I really worked hard with my teams to put into place replacement units.  So, take the contractor savings, but then immediately permission the restructuring into somewhere a better cost footprints. And the team has done a great job. Those are permanent cost changes and won’t come back, but no challenge on our initiatives. We cut a few underperforming initiatives that maybe only do when there is a pandemic, but we actually made some tough calls.  And so, net-net, I don’t see any issues with any of our forward initiatives. I am pleased with the performance to support our current products. And I feel we’ve got the appropriate staff levels to support our ongoing business and the appropriate investments.  I still believe though, Bill, that there is a margin expansion to continue from the mid-40s to the upwards from 44 to say, 47 over the next few years as we continue to manage this much more adjustable footprint.  And we are doing a lot of surveying, a lot of studying, a lot of managing with our teams and I do see substantive savings forward for the redevelopment of our footprint as leases expire and we look forward into the coming years. So, that’s where we stand. So the business is strong.  The teams are motivated. I think the glimpse, the scores that we have for employee satisfaction in the firm have been the highest since our merger. And that they are at levels that I thought only Google and tech companies could achieve, but here we go. We’ve got a really satisfied workforce that’s delivering great results.  Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. \nJeff Meuler : Yes. Thank you. So, I guess, follow-up on transport or auto and the question is – and the answer maybe in your new car solid forecast which it looks like you still have done pretty materially. But it looks like you are kind of lofting the high-end of the guidance down for 2020. But then the 2021 outlook looks good in kind of two year CAGR.  So, I guess, just any more detail on what are you seeing that’s leading both to kind of taking the top-end of the guidance range for transport in 2020. And then more importantly, at this stage, what’s giving you the confidence in that reacceleration to that magnitude in 2021? Thanks. \nLance Uggla: Edouard, do you want to take that? \nEdouard Tavernier: Yes. Great. Thanks for the questions. So what do I see in as in an industry which broadly speaking in a better condition today than it was going into the 2008 to 2010 great recession. And so, the signals that we are getting from our customers, our partners, the OEMs and the suppliers is that they are pushing back discretionary expenditure they are holding on for cash, but they see the market recovery in 2021 and beyond and they believe in the growth of the industry.  So what we are seeing from our standpoint is that along that discretionary spending which would result in one-time revenues this year are being pushed out into Q4 and into 2021. That’s why we see a moderate outlook for the second half of the year, especially driven by the new car business. But we feel good about the recovery outlook in 2021. \nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard. Nothing to add. I’ll go to the next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. \nKevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. Hey Lance and Jonathan, if you see – this was been kind of a targeted conversation – most of margin extensions given some of the cost savings, it feels like that’s a little bit more structural, is still that 100 basis points and you are able to reinvest more in the business, just trying to accelerate the growth or should we expect a structural higher level of margin expansion as a result of some of the expenses that you’ve been able to really leverage as a result of COVID? \nLance Uggla: Yes, maybe I’ll start and I’ll pass it to Jonathan. So, I have a personal view that that since merger, that shifting from a high 30s, 40% margin and heading towards a 50% margin, that was a task that was in hand for us to do and that over the next five to seven years, we’d execute it.  And so, here we sit at 44% margin looking forward into 2021 and my personal view, understanding if all our cost levers, technology and how it can save us money forward through use of the cloud, cloud-based services, and supporting a work from home and more flexible infrastructure that can support a more flexible work footprint, means that, we have opportunities to do two things.  One, to change our footprint and take cost out over time without being disruptive, and two, through general attrition be able to continue to build our staff into better cost locations and to be better cost locations are Raleigh versus New York, our Manchester versus London, our Gurgaon versus Milan or it’s Gdansk versus Frankfurt.  So we have – and even our CARFAX team has built up a great office across the border in Windsor, Ontario and achieved substantive cost savings in their forward planning. So when I look at our footprint, Kevin, my view is, until I say stop, it’s a 100 basis points a year and we have to be able and at 5% or better top-line growth with 3% general wage inflation, we are able to generate the appropriate amount of investments for our type of business and we’ll continue to do so.  And I think the teams – the team and ourselves, it’s our fourth year post-merger. I think we’ve got a great cadence at executing and we haven’t missed yet and I don’t think we’ll be missing going forward. Jonathan?\nJonathan Gear: Yes, just to add a couple points, Lance. I think you hit the major ones is, I mean, first, I will say as Lance said, the easiest way to margin expansion is through a top-line organic growth and it what made this year so unusual as we manage to deliver over 200 basis points or will deliver expansion despite the fact it’s a challenging environment.  And to me, it’s really the actions by our teams across the world in addressing cost in Q2 here, particularly the permanent cost, as Lance mentioned earlier on, we actually overshot the target that we had. And overshooting it gave us, obviously first, confidence in this year’s number, but equally it gave us ability to invest more right now as we do in the second half and to initiatives which are going to drive growth and drive margin in future years.  So, that really has, has given us more flexibility than we normally have. But I think as Lance said, I think our focus is on, as we continue to grow with the nature of our business model that does drive through the margin expansion and that we will keep driving until we think we have a – until we tell you otherwise. \nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nLance Uggla: Hi, Andrew. \nAndrew Steinerman : Good morning. Good morning, it’s Andrew. In terms of the second half fiscal 2020 organic revenue growth recovery that’s embedded in the fiscal 2020 guide, could you just give us a sense of how much revenue lift is already underway in the current quarter? So I am talking about the third quarter. \nLance Uggla: Jonathan, do you want to grab that?\nJonathan Gear: Yes, I’ll go ahead and tackle it, Andrew. So, I mean, the biggest – as you look to the lift, the biggest change is, the biggest change is obviously in Transportation. And this key signal which Edouard covered there is really the recovery of the used car market. And if you recall, we had this call 90 days ago, we talked about the uncertainty about the lock-ins would lock is lift or not and also when they did lift, what was consumer behavior be like.  And I think we’ve answered the second part of that question. The consumer behavior in the U.S. around used car purchases actually was pent-up and so we are seeing this resurgence come back. So that’s driving a lot of confidence we have, particularly around the used car portion of our Transportation business.  And as Edouard also said I think we’ve built in the appropriate amount of moderation around the new cars as OEMs has kind of build back-up inventory and then we should move sites, Financial Services had a very, very strong Q2 as they had a very strong Q1 and they continue to see the build into it.  And the third element within Resources, Brian and the team, I think have done an incredible job of working closely with our customers, particularly in upstream, understanding the risk we have in our portfolio. They are working directly with our clients. And as a result are at a very detailed level, we have line of sight to the revenue build out second half for the year.  So, I think at this point, Andrew, it’s an order in the year where arguably there is most uncertainty. I’d actually feel very, very good right now in terms of our revenue and margin for the rest of the year. \nLance Uggla: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. Next question? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open. \nAndrew Jeffrey : Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. My question is around the Financial Services business and Ipreo, in particular, Lance, I wonder if you can give us an update on your thinking of – thinking around your positioning in alternatives and how that’s driving structural growth for Ipreo?  And a sort of an add-on, can you just comment specifically on an apparently resurgent IPO market and how much that factors into your pretty sanguine outlook for Financial Services in the back half and into next year?\nLance Uggla: Yes. Okay. And, Adam is also with me on the call. So, I’ll ask him to add to what I have to say. So, first off, I have to say the Ipreo assets have all performed very well through this period. The one piece that hasn’t have the opportunity to perform well, but is definitely having its increasing share of activities is the equities portion of the Ipreo revenues.  But when you get to alternatives in private markets, the private markets piece of Ipreo is growing in the 25% to 30% range. And when I look at our valuations business, that’s pinned against, that is growing in the 50% plus range.  And so, I really think that our move into alternatives, our team have really taken a leadership role and we are one of a – couple of assets out there that will continue to benefit in that growth in alternatives, as well as the need for the independence around reporting in valuations and the tools that the other marketplaces that are more well developed have established.  Adam, maybe you want to talk a little bit about munis, debt, equity issuance and then the investor services business and how they are performing and the prospects looking forward. \nAdam Kansler: Sure. Thanks, Lance. I think you described it well. I think the way to think about the overall set of businesses is to think about the balance across asset classes. So, strong IPO markets. Obviously, desirable because you have a lot of new issuers coming into the market and that gives us opportunity to provide a range of services.  But when IPO markets are slow in the current period, what we’ve seen is a significant uptick in fixed income, municipal issuance, and global activity in markets is actually been quite strong post the initial shock of the COVID shutdowns even into the early periods of June, late May, we are starting to see the IPO market even start to tick back up with a lot of activity in the last few weeks.  So the numbers in our view of the business is, with asset classes largely offsetting each other, a resumption of normal levels of issuance in the IPO market which I hope drive some other businesses, but then you’ll see a bit of maybe moderation in the highly active fixed income markets that we’ve seen over the last few weeks.  So, when you roll it altogether, you kind of have a balanced portfolio through the year, we think sustains the growth that we’ve seen. \nLance Uggla: Good. Thanks – thanks, Adam. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open. \nHamzah Mazari : Hey. Good morning. My question is just on capital allocation. You touched on buybacks. You did your first transaction, a very small software deal this year. Has the outlook on M&A changed in terms of doing more tuck-ins as you are seeing sort of more visibility into a recovery. You’ve cut a ton of cost, margin profile is up, any thoughts if you already do more transactions? \nLance Uggla: Okay. Well, I think I said in the last quarter’s call that I felt the investments in some of our key organic growth initiatives looking forward were anchored around two or three key things across all our businesses. So, continued diversification of resources, we are very focused on climate and energy transition.  We see it as a big TAM, a growth market and one that we’ve been investing in and those specific assets have been growing north of 10% in our current Resources division. So, we are very keen to continue to invest there. We invested through in acquisition into agriculture in our agro business. We also expect forward high-single-digits to double-digit growth there as we’ve invested in the business, re-staffed and Brian is working with the team to set it on a correct path going forward.  So that’s organic and that’s a large TAM that we are focused on. We don’t see us needing to acquire further although there could be small tuck-ins associated to energy transition and climate-related activities. When I – we go into automotive, here Edouard is very focused with CARFAX and AMM teams on automotive, kind of OEM Mastermind which is looking at those digital marketing dollars and the spend.  And you look at the amount for the first time ever, I think digital marketing spend has now surpassed everything else, I read it in the – I think it was the Financial Times or one of the U.S. papers yesterday and we are very well positioned to pull our assets together organically to drive OEM targeting of incentives and marketing dollars.  And again, Edouard is very focused on that organically. The continuation in financial markets with asset managers looking to cut costs, we’ve been working on, I mentioned in Q2 asset management platform to draw together key market participants in the design host and build of new solutions for asset managers. That’s all organic.  So, when I look at that, I go, I’ve got and we continue to invest and we have substantive organic complementary growth to our existing business. We don’t really need a lot of acquisitions. So therefore, I can see capital resuming at the upper-end of our range in terms of share buybacks forward. And keeping our leverage below three times and going to the maximum on that.  And Jonathan and the team, Granat working for him that runs treasury, they are on top of that. They manage it and my view is, is use any excess capital for share buybacks. I don’t see a big acquisition slew needed to support our long-term growth initiatives. Jonathan, do you want to add anything else or? \nJonathan Gear: No, I think you captured it Lance and I just emphasize what you said, we remain committed to our capital policy of remaining under three times, because it’s very important to us. And as we spend, the less on M&A, you have to deploy more on buybacks kind of where the cash goes. \nLance Uggla: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nSeth Weber : Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just, I think, I just wanted to go back to the transport segment for a second. I just want to make sure I am understanding the messaging, could you just have the dealer price concessions continued?  Did they continue I guess into June and is that the expectation that could still bleed into the third quarter? I am just trying to understand really, whether transportation margins can turn positive on a year-over-year basis in the back half of the year? Thank you. \nLance Uggla: Edouard? Nigel, keep going on this one. \nEdouard Tavernier: Yes, sure. So, we have already removed the vast majority of our pricing concessions and we still have a few in place to support some segments of the markets that these will have been phased out completely by the month of August. Did that answer the question? \nLance Uggla: Yes. Thank you, Edouard. I was on mute. Thanks. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open. \nAlex Kramm : Hey. Good morning everyone. Just on the prepared remarks you talked about some cancellations. I think it was primarily on resources, I think when you gave the ACV as well, but can you just talk about cancellation more broadly, what you saw in the second quarter across the business?  I mean, anything that you would describe as customers are using this time to look at their spend and seeing some things that may not be as mission critical as they thought? Or has it been fairly limited any color would be great. Thanks. \nLance Uggla: I am going to start and then let Brian add in here in a moment. I would always refer, I referred to actually in the written script I referred to – I think it was within automotive small cancellations. And I don’t think anything significant to discuss. But in the Energy space and really across the firm, I took a stance with the team in beginning of Q2 that look, this is an opportunity.  I just market we’ve got a great reputation to work with our customers. We are going to have some troubled customers and I want us to be at upfront in price concessions and wherever we can increase the price concessions for longer term contracts. And I think the team did really well and where there was opportunities for us to execute longer term contracts and help our customers through a tough year, I think the team did that.  And so, it’s going to have an impact within 2020, but also when I fit in our energy minus two, plus two, I am going to have that now dragging through into 2021 with the benefit coming back in 2022, 2023, 2024, because the contract extensions were in general for, three, five, seven years or longer. And so, I think the team did a great job and it’s exactly what a good firm should do in this environment.  But I don’t actually see any long-term challenges beyond what we’ve modeled. Now within the Permian, and that lack of CapEx, lower energy prices, private equity and lenders looking for higher hurdle rates on their returns, I think there is a continued challenge. And therefore, we modeled that challenge into our numbers.  And Brian, maybe you want to top up that commentary that I just gave with some of your specifics on how you are viewing the energy recovery and some of the moves we’ve made through this tough period. \nBrian Crotty: You know it all Lance, you hit it on the head. I think it’s largely a North America issue. You have your production cost there higher than the price of crude. You are seeing bankruptcies go up. But what we are doing is, we are working with customers on price. So that we keep them and we get growth in our longer-term contracts.  And again, in our international business for example, that’s actually growing in the upstream. So, I think the real focus for us has been trying to take care of those North America customers that are under a lot of pressure right now. \nLance Uggla: Thanks, Brian. Next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. \nShlomo Rosenbaum : Thank you for taking my question. I am in there?\nLance Uggla: Sorry, I got you. Yes, I got you. \nShlomo Rosenbaum : Just want to sneak in one, just back on the transport, just to make sure the 10% on the recurring revenue decline in the quarter, that was all just from the dealer concessions. There wasn’t anything else that was really significant in terms of that, that just being phased out at this point of time?\nLance Uggla: Yes, that’s correct. \nShlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Thank you. \nLance Uggla: Thanks, Shlomo. Next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. \nGeorge Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Do you expect Resources’ organic growth to be down 2%, up 2% in fiscal 2021 was downstream strength offset by weakness in upstream due to lower 2020 bookings being fully reflected in revenues. Can you describe how OPEC discussions and oil prices need to evolve over the next year for you to achieve this target?\nLance Uggla: Yes, I’ll start and again Brian you can add if I don’t have it all covered. So, I guess the minus two to plus two, remember, I’ve given you a – what isn’t normally done by a company. In Q2, we gave you the scenarios – previously we gave you the scenarios for 2020, now what I am doing is giving you my forecasting tools that I am doing throughout this July, August period, so that I am ready for a December 1 start.  And currently, 6% to 8% Financial Services, mid-teens in Transportation recovering off of that low comp, which really is high-single-digits. Energy is a bit different. So, Energy, the whole supply/demand equation that went completely out of whack really caused some structural issues in that upstream marketplace and you know we have about $300 million which used to be $400 plus million of premerger of upstream data revenues that are very important to our customers and very sticky.  But if the customer is not there, they are not buying any data. And the fact is, some of those structural supply/demand shifts in our view will cause some customers to disappear, but also some of our larger customers we gave price concessions to. Price concessions cost us in 2020, because they are not for full year. We get the full year impact in 2021. So that continues to cost us.  And then, we built in growth going forward on our contracts from years two through years seven and even longer. So, I think the team has done a good job for that and that gives us a real nice certainty on the way forward. And as you get your data revenues in upstream become about $250 million of $1 billion business and above $4.5 billion company it starts to become an issue of small challenges.  But in 2021, the minus two to plus two reflects the rolling out of that, those revenue concessions that were made, some customers disappearing. And our CapEx down 30%. On the other hand, the rest of the business has opportunities to grow at 7% to 11%. And in the planning period, I can’t tell you whether I am going to be precise to 7%, 9%, 10%.  What I can tell you that rate of the moment, the combination of all I know about our Resources business would have us no worse than negative two and likely no better than plus two unless we – unless the $400 million of other revenues grew closer to double-digits. And in planning, that’s now how I plan and how I manage the firm with the division heads.  I manage for certainty for reasonableness of error for strong customer pipeline and renewals with our customers and that’s what Brian and his team are doing. Brian, do you want to add anything to that? \nBrian Crotty: Yes, the only thing I would mention is, there is a swing in events if we have events or we don’t have events, that’s going to definitely impact the range, as well. \nLance Uggla: Now, that’s a story, Brian. I missed that. Yes, so, right now, in our forecast, we put – we haven’t put events returning at the 2019 level. And honestly what, there is some people – if I guess if I was the U.S. President, I’d put full events in for 2021. But in fact, my personal view is that, in analysis with my team, we see some virtual events definitely and some smaller events potentially to come together.  But we haven’t put that back in. And if you remember right, at the time of last quarter when I disclosed some of the challenges with the events, you are talking a $40 million that’s 4% of growth in that division, or 4% of the revenue potential coming back in that division. And I don’t think it’s right to put that back in. Jonathan, do you want to add to that? Just to make sure I didn’t boggle any numbers there. \nJonathan Gear: No, no. You had it right. But it’s that – I mean, I just call out what Brian said, is on the high-end of the range, we assume events coming back strong and on a low-end, we would assume events coming back in a very moderate fashion. So that is a swing item in that range. \nLance Uggla: Right. And would you – in our top range, would we see events returning to 2019 level or a little less or a little more? \nJonathan Gear: It’s a little less. A little less than the 2019 levels, you assumed. \nLance Uggla: Yes, yes. Okay. So that’s how I said. Good. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nToni Kaplan : Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk about the sales cycle within Solutions? And I assume the pipeline is strong, but just trying to get a sense of, if there is any improvement in new sales conversions at this point. It sounded like some of your comments that COVID implementation delays are over. But just wanted to try and understand about customers’ willingness to pull the trigger on new sales.\nLance Uggla: Okay. No. Good question. I’ll start, Adam, if can ready to follow-up here. So, Solutions sales for us, I have to say, even though the number is not reflecting in this quarter, actually if you normalize the year-over-year on last year’s big Q2, I think normalize over eight or ten quarters, we are probably running at 9%, 10%.  So it’s a – it might delay this, normalize Solutions still very strong. The pipeline is also at an all-time high. So therefore, there is lots of interest in the pipeline. And we generally feel that we’ll return slowly for the rest of this year and better into next year, those customers closing that pipeline and putting it into production. And so, I think if I look forward, I view Solutions as a strong growth contributor to Financial Services back to pre-COVID levels.  Adam, do you want to add some of the highlights, low lights, some of the challenges and just your forecast of how we look at 2021? \nAdam Kansler: Yes. I think you summed it up well, Lance. The interesting thing I think from the COVID experience is a lot of our customer base has looked at the Solutions that they use to maintain most efficient and risk management tools and it’s actually accelerated some of their decision-making and implementing lot of the types of solutions that we offer.  And that’s been the biggest driver of the growth in pipeline. Coupled with six months to a year ago, we really formalized to bringing together of a lot of our solutions and looking at larger packages of services for our customers where our solutions can work with each other and give customers larger overall opportunity for efficiency.  So, I think through this period, it’s been a little bit of an accelerant. There will be a little delay in that, because these are larger deals that takes a little bit more time to close. But customers are quite interested in doing that. I think what you saw through the early part of Q2 is, larger software implementations as customers were adjusting to work from home environments and our markets have largely stayed open. Financial Markets have been active and operating through this period.  But in adjusting to working from home, some of the larger software implementations maybe got delayed by four to six weeks, all of which have basically restarted at this point. That gives you a little bit of an insight into what that little low might have looked like and why we are pretty optimistic about the forward path. \nLance Uggla: Good. Thanks – thanks, Adam. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nAshish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. I just want to drill down further on the automotiveMastermind growth opportunities. The company launched AMM for CPU and used car vehicle actually earlier this year. So my question is just, what is the current penetration of AMM at existing dealership using CARFAX? And is it possible to quantify the cross-sell opportunity both for new cars, as well as the used car sales?  And just to follow-up to that question, AMM was growing at least 30% prior to the crisis and can AMM growth reaccelerate to strong double-digit going forward as we come out of the crisis? Thanks. \nLance Uggla: Good. Thanks. Edouard? \nEdouard Tavernier: Right. So, I will start with the end of your question, Ashish, which is the growth of Mastermind. So, we actually saw accelerating growth in the past few quarters until Q1. You may remember in Q1, Mastermind delivered 36% organic growth year-on-year. So really, really strong acceleration and now I’ll pick-up on your first point, which is what is driving that growth?  And it is actually the synergies that we’ve been building between Mastermind and other parts of the automotive organization. So to give you few examples, we now have the Conquest capability in Mastermind that is built using organ safer that we have in our automotive business. We have a service to sales capability in Mastermind that is built using CARFAX and Transient data.  And as you just said, we are launching in July a pre-owned kind of used car capability which is perfect timing for the market, because that is the activity that will support many dealers in the second half of the year and again, we use – we launched this used car capability leveraging assets we have within other parts of the automotive kind of portfolio.  So, Mastermind is a growth story, which is anchored on our automotive data as a foundation and we expect that growth to resume quickly as the market opens up towards the end of this year. \nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard. Next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open. \nAndrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. In terms of the events business, you obviously touched on the range of potential outcomes you’ve embedded in 2021 guidance earlier. But I am just curious, how you are thinking about the longer term impacts of the pandemic and clients’ willingness to travel to and attend conferences? Is it’s a business you think is permanently impaired or is it something that will just take some time to ramp back and review? Thanks. \nLance Uggla: Yes. No, I guess, I have a personal view and I imagine if we pooled everybody on the phone, we’d all have slightly different views. One I’ve been quite pleased with the virtual dialogue going on in IHS Markit with our customers. So, we have no issues with supporting our products and our services, our research, our datasets, out data science.  And therefore, I feel we are really lucky to be so resilient against COVID. Our revenue globally from events is probably about 1% of what we do. So therefore, it’s – we’ve taken that impact. It’s in the numbers and so, to put it back into the numbers at any reasonable scenario, my view is that, there is got to be a vaccine to support that.  Otherwise, I think there is going to be a mixed bag of people want to fly, want to on subways, want to be in crowded rooms, speakers want to be in crowded rooms themselves as they help companies provide thought leadership. So my own view is that, we should expect at our 9% scenario, something a little less than 19% as Jonathan said.  So, we are at 45, maybe it’s 35 to 40. Maybe it’s 30. But it’s not as high. And at our low-end of the scenario, little to no events and in our black swan, a 5% growth – my view would definitely be none. So, as I look forward and sculpt our business, I am very careful with the teams to be not looking at substantive.  I want to maintain our flagship big CERAWeek, Chem Week, TPM. Those are three flagship events. We are also leaders now around the climate dialogue. We got to support that. We will be world-class virtually. We’ll have small meetings and small events where our customers want us to. And if there is a vaccine or a trend back to bigger gatherings, we will be prepared to go.  But, it’s not something I put a lot of face in for 2021. But a lot of that’s more personal than it is a total view of IHS Markit. But you will get in our forecast numbers, you should know that events will be a tempered revenue that is never going to be the reason for us to hit numbers. Jonathan? \nJonathan Gear: Yes, you always had one point you said at Lance is, in Q2 we announced the event cancellation we talked about $0.09 of EPS impact. That was a result of losing all the revenue while still having all the cost. And as Lance said, I think the events, particularly those three flagships are important to us for branding reasons, thought leadership and [a sense of almost] community within the industries we serve. But financially, the events themselves are frankly not that important to our profitability at the end of the day. \nLance Uggla: Good. Thanks, Jonathan. And, I – all I can say is for our teams that lead those events, they are now focused on leading virtual events and I have to say, just go online and catch the CERAWeek conversations and it’s everybody from world leaders to key energy markets thought leaders, Dan Yergin, who, along with Jamey Rosenfield are founders of the CERAWeek.  They’ve just done an outstanding job to make sure we are supporting our customers in the right dialogues. But they are having to do it virtually. And that at a minimum will be world-class at and let’s see what happens. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Eric Boyer for any closing remarks. \nEric Boyer: Now we thank you… \nLance Uggla: Before you go, Eric, Eric, Just before you go, I just want to say one last word. The first thing I’d like to say is thank you for the support our shareholders have given us. These are tough times. I never thought I could have experienced anything like this in my life.  And I have to say that having a strong team around you, strong shareholders and great, great people throughout the firm globally working with our customers, we’ve been able to navigate and I know from many companies they are not – haven’t been as fortunate. So, I feel very lucky to be able to do what we’ve been able to do. But I couldn’t have done that with all the teams and I know our shares have been well supported by our investors and I just want to say, thank you for that. And I hope the transparency that we are providing, you will allow us to return to pre-COVID levels once we get through this. But up through that point, I feel that we want to show market leadership in our reporting to help you navigate the challenging waters that we are navigating ourselves and fortunately also performing well in.  So, thank you very much. Also thanks to all the employees. And I want to close that the – some of the challenges that we are dealing in communities around us, in particularly we are at out to all our black colleagues in the U.S. I am appreciating all of their support through us setting strategy forward for IHS Markit.  And once again, we want to be a firm that’s action-oriented where out front we are making change happening and I appreciate all of the support from those colleagues in the firm that have been helping me. So, thank you. Eric, do you want to close? \nEric Boyer: Yes. Great. We thank you for your interest in IHS Markit.

            "name": "Edouard Tavernier",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Lance and thanks, Gary for the questions. I'll take your two-parter. On the first part, obviously, we saw a strong drop-off in activity in late March, which lasted through end of April. But since late April, we have seen as you suggested an earlier than expected recovery in both used car sales and new car sales.  At this point in time, the used car sales market is solid. The outlook remains solid for the rest of the year. There is a little bit of pent-up demand that's supporting us and that we have seen a corresponding increase in the volume of activity at CARFAX in particular. Yes. Great. Thanks for the questions. So what do I see in as in an industry which broadly speaking in a better condition today than it was going into the 2008 to 2010 great recession. And so, the signals that we are getting from our customers, our partners, the OEMs and the suppliers is that they are pushing back discretionary expenditure they are holding on for cash, but they see the market recovery in 2021 and beyond and they believe in the growth of the industry.  So what we are seeing from our standpoint is that along that discretionary spending which would result in one-time revenues this year are being pushed out into Q4 and into 2021. That's why we see a moderate outlook for the second half of the year, especially driven by the new car business. But we feel good about the recovery outlook in 2021. Yes, sure. So, we have already removed the vast majority of our pricing concessions and we still have a few in place to support some segments of the markets that these will have been phased out completely by the month of August. Did that answer the question? Right. So, I will start with the end of your question, Ashish, which is the growth of Mastermind. So, we actually saw accelerating growth in the past few quarters until Q1. You may remember in Q1, Mastermind delivered 36% organic growth year-on-year. So really, really strong acceleration and now I'll pick-up on your first point, which is what is driving that growth?

            "name": "Jonathan Gear",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Lance. Q2 results included the following: Revenue of $1.03 billion, organic decline of 7%, and total revenue decline of 10%; normalized organic decline was 3%; net income of $71 million and a GAAP EPS of $0.18; adjusted EBITDA of $454 million, which is an increase of 9% on a normalized basis, with margins of 44.2%. This represents a margin expansion of 320 basis points, and finally, adjusted EPS of $0.69, an increase of 11% on a normalized basis.  Regarding revenue, our Q2 normalized organic decline of 3% included recurring organic growth of 1% and non-recurring organic decline of 26%. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by a tough year-on-year comp in Financial Services, lower OEM auto activities and lower Energy Consulting.  Now moving on to segment performance; our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 3%, including 6% recurring in the quarter. Information and Processing had their strong performances delivering 7% and 8% organic growth respectively, while Solutions had a 3% organic decline due to a difficult comp to prior year's quarter and lower software and consulting delivery driven by COVID delays.  Our Transportation segment delivered normalized organic decline of 16% in the quarter. This included a decline of 10% recurring and a decline of 31% in non-recurring, primarily driven by delays in digital marketing, recalls and the retail portion of our Used Car business. Our resources segment had 1% organic decline normalized for events which is comprised of 1% recurring growth and 15% in non-recurring declines.  Q2 organic ACV decreased by $20 million in the quarter and our trailing 12-month organic ACV is negative 0.7% Our CMS segment delivered 2% total growth, including 2% recurring and flat non-recurring.  Turning now to profits and margins, our adjusted EBITDA was $434 million, down $11 million versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 9% on a normalized basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 44.2%, which is up 320 basis points.  Moving to segment profitability, Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $231 million with a margin of 52.2%, up 470 basis points. Financial Services margin was driven by strong revenue flow through benefiting from prior year's cost reductions and a favorable product mix. We do expect some moderation in Financial Services margin in the second half due to increased investments and a shift in our product mix.  Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $102 million with a margin of 41.8%, which is down 120 basis points, driven by the dealer pricing concessions which we have discussed.  Resources' adjusted EBITDA was $96 million with a margin of 43.9%, an increase of 10 basis points. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $35 million with a margin of 29%, up 710 basis points. This large increase was driven by the rationalization of the TMT Resources post the divestiture last year and great cost control measures across product design and ECR.  Moving on to adjusted EPS, our adjusted EPS was $0.69 per diluted share, a decline of $0.02 or 3%, albeit an increase of 11% once normalized for the ADS divestiture and the events to cancellation. Our GAAP tax rate was 6% and our adjusted tax rate was 18%. Our Q2 free cash flow was $209 million.  As a reminder, our trailing twelve month conversion rate was impacted by several non-recurring items and I would call out the following: one-time tax payments in Q4 2019 associated with the changes in the U.S tax provisions; the Q2 settlement of our U.S. and UK pension plans; Q1 payroll taxes associated with the exercising of a majority of the remaining outstanding options; and finally, one-time costs associated with our cost reduction efforts.  Turning to balance sheet, our Q2 ending debt balance was $5.4 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 3.0 times on a bank covenant basis, 2.9 times net of cash, which is in line with the top-end of our capital policy. We continue to manage our balance sheet to provide liquidity and flexibility in this environment.  We closed the quarter with $208 million of cash and our Q2 undrawn revolver balance with approximately $750 million representing a great liquidity position. In Q2, we closed a very small acquisition that extends our Derivatives processing capabilities within APAC and made a small investment in an AI-based retail fuel pricing solution. In June, we also divested our small product tear down business within TMT.  Our Q2 weighted average diluted share count was 400 million shares. We repurchased 252 million of shares in the quarter including completing our $215 million Q2 ASR at an average price of $62.20. Year-to-date, share repurchase is $852 million. We expect to return to share buybacks later this year or early next year while maintaining our capital policy of operating within the two to three times gross leverage range.  Moving on to guidance, as Lance stated, we entered the second half with strong visibility to revenues and a very clear line of sight to earnings. Based on this, we are comfortable providing a tighter guidance range, which assumes no additional major lock-ins.  Our full year guidance is as follows: revenue of 4.28 billion to $4.3 billion, this represents an organic growth rate normalized for the year of between 0% and 1%; adjusted EBITDA of $1.825 billion to $1.835 billion; this represents a margin of 42.7%; adjusted EPS of $2.76 to $2.78 representing 10% year-on-year growth and we expect free cash flow to run at 50% of adjusted EBITDA.  And now I will turn the call back to Lance to go through our outlook for 2021. Well, I think you know that well, Lance. And I'll just mathematically – it kind of goes back to your point is the year-on-year comp will kind of help us in that point. But I think the key thing as Lance said, we now have a clear line of sight to our own customers about how they would behave in a similar type shutdown.  The impact as Lance said, would be primarily in automotive and we have a view both on how the customers will react and also how we can react and support customers to even provide commerce in a semi-shutdown situation. Yes, just to add a couple points, Lance. I think you hit the major ones is, I mean, first, I will say as Lance said, the easiest way to margin expansion is through a top-line organic growth and it what made this year so unusual as we manage to deliver over 200 basis points or will deliver expansion despite the fact it's a challenging environment.  And to me, it's really the actions by our teams across the world in addressing cost in Q2 here, particularly the permanent cost, as Lance mentioned earlier on, we actually overshot the target that we had. And overshooting it gave us, obviously first, confidence in this year's number, but equally it gave us ability to invest more right now as we do in the second half and to initiatives which are going to drive growth and drive margin in future years.  So, that really has, has given us more flexibility than we normally have. But I think as Lance said, I think our focus is on, as we continue to grow with the nature of our business model that does drive through the margin expansion and that we will keep driving until we think we have a – until we tell you otherwise. Yes, I'll go ahead and tackle it, Andrew. So, I mean, the biggest – as you look to the lift, the biggest change is, the biggest change is obviously in Transportation. And this key signal which Edouard covered there is really the recovery of the used car market. And if you recall, we had this call 90 days ago, we talked about the uncertainty about the lock-ins would lock is lift or not and also when they did lift, what was consumer behavior be like.  And I think we've answered the second part of that question. The consumer behavior in the U.S. around used car purchases actually was pent-up and so we are seeing this resurgence come back. So that's driving a lot of confidence we have, particularly around the used car portion of our Transportation business.  And as Edouard also said I think we've built in the appropriate amount of moderation around the new cars as OEMs has kind of build back-up inventory and then we should move sites, Financial Services had a very, very strong Q2 as they had a very strong Q1 and they continue to see the build into it.  And the third element within Resources, Brian and the team, I think have done an incredible job of working closely with our customers, particularly in upstream, understanding the risk we have in our portfolio. They are working directly with our clients. And as a result are at a very detailed level, we have line of sight to the revenue build out second half for the year.  So, I think at this point, Andrew, it's an order in the year where arguably there is most uncertainty. I'd actually feel very, very good right now in terms of our revenue and margin for the rest of the year. No, I think you captured it Lance and I just emphasize what you said, we remain committed to our capital policy of remaining under three times, because it's very important to us. And as we spend, the less on M&A, you have to deploy more on buybacks kind of where the cash goes. No, no. You had it right. But it's that – I mean, I just call out what Brian said, is on the high-end of the range, we assume events coming back strong and on a low-end, we would assume events coming back in a very moderate fashion. So that is a swing item in that range. It's a little less. A little less than the 2019 levels, you assumed. Yes, you always had one point you said at Lance is, in Q2 we announced the event cancellation we talked about $0.09 of EPS impact. That was a result of losing all the revenue while still having all the cost. And as Lance said, I think the events, particularly those three flagships are important to us for branding reasons, thought leadership and [a sense of almost] community within the industries we serve. But financially, the events themselves are frankly not that important to our profitability at the end of the day."

            "name": "Adam Kansler",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Lance. I think you described it well. I think the way to think about the overall set of businesses is to think about the balance across asset classes. So, strong IPO markets. Obviously, desirable because you have a lot of new issuers coming into the market and that gives us opportunity to provide a range of services.  But when IPO markets are slow in the current period, what we've seen is a significant uptick in fixed income, municipal issuance, and global activity in markets is actually been quite strong post the initial shock of the COVID shutdowns even into the early periods of June, late May, we are starting to see the IPO market even start to tick back up with a lot of activity in the last few weeks.  So the numbers in our view of the business is, with asset classes largely offsetting each other, a resumption of normal levels of issuance in the IPO market which I hope drive some other businesses, but then you'll see a bit of maybe moderation in the highly active fixed income markets that we've seen over the last few weeks.  So, when you roll it altogether, you kind of have a balanced portfolio through the year, we think sustains the growth that we've seen. Yes. I think you summed it up well, Lance. The interesting thing I think from the COVID experience is a lot of our customer base has looked at the Solutions that they use to maintain most efficient and risk management tools and it's actually accelerated some of their decision-making and implementing lot of the types of solutions that we offer.  And that's been the biggest driver of the growth in pipeline. Coupled with six months to a year ago, we really formalized to bringing together of a lot of our solutions and looking at larger packages of services for our customers where our solutions can work with each other and give customers larger overall opportunity for efficiency.

            "name": "Lance Uggla",
            "content": "Okay, thank you, Eric and thank you everybody for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings call. In light of the recent events in the U.S., specifically, the murder of George Floyd, I want to say that IHS Markit stands in solidarity with our black colleagues and with all of those who face discrimination in our communities around the world. I've learned a lot in the last few weeks and have much more to learn.  At IHS Markit, we are committed to inclusivity and equality. We will not tolerate any racial prejudice in our workplace and we'll take aggressive actions in the coming weeks and months to improve diversity inclusion in our firm and in the communities around us. These actions will not be temporary reactions to current events, but long-term commitments to change.  As expected, Q2 was a challenging quarter due to the COVID pandemic. However, I am extremely pleased with the way the organization responded and are positioned to deliver results within the scenario ranges we provided on our Q1 call. This includes, recurring organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth on a normalized basis.  Through our strong cost management, we have also protected profit against further revenue downside and funded investments for our growth initiatives. A great result in a challenging period. And I personally want to thank my team globally for their hard work and dedication in this new adjusted work model.  For today's financial discussion, when we speak to the normalized results, we are excluding the impact of the Aerospace and Defense divestiture, as well as the events cancellation on growth rates for revenue, EBITDA, and EPS.  So let's start with the financial highlights in the quarter. Revenue of $1.08 billion, down 3% on a normalized organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $454 million and margin of 44.2%, which is up 320 basis points year-over-year due to strong cost management and adjusted EPS of $0.69, up 11% over the prior year, again on a normalized basis.  On our Q1 call, we provided 2020 guidance based upon macro and market recovery assumptions and we suggested three potential scenarios, a Q3, a Q4 and a 2021 recovery. We can say since our call, in Q1 in March, we now have clarity on how our markets and customers are reacting, giving us a lot of confidence in our revenue assumptions.  Additionally, our cost actions executed early in the year have given us strong line of sight into adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS for the year. As such, we are now comfortable providing a tight guidance range for 2020 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS.  Now let me provide some segment commentary for our Q2 and rest of the year assumptions. Financial Services provided strong resilience for the firm with Q2 organic growth of 3%. This was achieved with very strong results from Information and Processing, somewhat offset by temporary slower growth in Solutions.  Information's key areas of strength included pricing and valuation services, indices and equities information.  Within Processing, derivatives business benefited from increased market volatility which led to higher volumes.  Solutions was pressured from a hard year-over-year comparison. Last year in Q2 was a 15% quarter and some services of course being delayed through the COVID period in terms of implementation.  Going forward, we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the year with continued strength in Information, improving growth in Solutions as customers are resuming their normal operations and Processing to normalize to pre-COVID volume levels.  Transportation in Q2 reported a normalized organic revenue decline of 16%. Revenue from the Used Car portion of our auto business was impacted by our voluntary price release for dealer customers, a pause in new sales activity and some cancellations. Our New Car business was negatively impacted around new sales activity and a pause in non-recurring services around recall and marketing.  Our Maritime and Trade business performed as expected. Our revenue guidance for Transportation is now for a decline of low to mid-single-digits for the year. We expect our Used Car business to benefit as consumer demand continues to improve and our New Car business to be somewhat negatively impacted as customers remain in conservation mode until late second half.  Within Maritime and Trade, we assume a gradual improvement over the second half with the shipping industry, as global trade begins to improve.  Now moving to Resources, which reported a normalized organic revenue decline of 1%, our downstream organic growth was offset by a challenged upstream environment. The industry remains on pace for global CapEx reductions in the 30% range for the year in line with our previous expectations. As such, we expect normalized organic revenue growth for the year to be negative low-single-digits.  CMS organic revenue growth was low-single-digits as expected with strength in product design, somewhat offset by weakness in our TMT business. For the year, we continue to expect organic growth in the low-single-digits excluding the impact of the boiler pressure vessel code.  Moving to our cost actions, I have to say I am very pleased with the speed and level of cost reductions that were achieved focusing on both near-term necessities and long-term optimization. We exceeded our initial objectives.  Overall, we are well positioned to deliver solid earnings growth this year and to return to strong organic revenue growth in 2021, which I'll detail after Jonathan goes over our Q2 results.  Jonathan? Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. I feel very confident in our 2020 guidance as shown by the tight ranges that Jonathan just provided you. Looking forward to 2021, I want to once again break with the traditional practice and actually give you a deep insight into our 2021 planning forecasts.  We'll look to taking these ranges as we enter 2021 and our starting point for 2021 is that we are going to have a gradual global economic recovery, no further major lock-ins and by major lock-ins complete world shutting down as we have seen in Q2, there may be small regional lock-ins like we've recently seen in Beijing, but that will be well managed and very conservative events revenue. Okay.  So top-line, we expect organic revenue growth next year of 7% to 9%, which includes the following assumptions by segment.  So first, Financial Services revenues will return to its longer term organic revenue growth range of 6% to 8%. Strength will continue in Information. We'll return to our high-single-digit growth in Solutions, which is well supported by strong backlog and pipeline of orders. And Processing revenues moderate back to more normal levels. Transportation, we are expecting to grow in the range of 14% to 16%.  Now this sounds high, but this is well supported by our usual growth of high-single-digits, plus a favorable year-over-year benefit due to 2020 dealer price concessions that were made and the resumption of a more normalized OEM service level.  In Resources, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%. And this is assuming continued downstream strength, which we are seeing on a growing portion of our energies division, offset by weakness in upstream as a result of lower 2020 bookings being fully reflected in our annual recurring revenue.  And then finally CMS, which has actually done a great job post-merger and is now expected to maintain itself in mid-single-digit organic growth range.  Okay, let's take a look at EBITDA. Here the team has done a lot of work in this COVID period but we still expect approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion next year. This will put us within the mid-40s range solidly that we set as our intermediate goal when announcing the merger and we remain confident from this range of margin in our ability to continue margin expansion going forward.  Some of this has come from the illuminated additional opportunities for margin expansion that we witnessed through the COVID period and working from home.  And finally, we expect adjusted EPS growth in 2021 to be in the 13% to 15% range. And that's 10% to 12% when normalized for the impact of events. So make sure you think about the events and that impacts and that puts us solidly into our 10% to 12% range. But next year, we'll be 13% to 15% without normalizing the events.  Now as in our 2020 forecast provided on our Q1 call, we are also providing an expected floor to our 2021 forecast. So how are we thinking about the downside to that 7% to 9% scenario? The floor accounts for a potential second lock-down that would be similar in magnitude to the one just experienced.  In this instance, our organic revenue growth would be approximately 5%. So we'd see an adjustment and that's really about automotive lockdown and adjusted EPS growth would be in the high-single-digits. And that combination of revenue and expense marriage in automotive around the lockdown is now well understood through Q2.  In conclusion, we'd make tough decisions to protect our earnings, growth during this challenging period, which I am pleased the team has done an excellent job on. And we've created capacity to invest in substantive opportunities that will enable us to deliver within our longer-term organic revenue range of 5% to 7% for the continuing years to come.  While the world still faces uncertainty, we'll continue to provide unparalleled transparency into how we are managing the business to help U.S. shareholders navigate these challenging investment times. We are firmly positioned to deliver strong results through this uncertainty, demonstrated by our 2020 tight guidance range that Jonathan provided and the outlook for even stronger performance in 2021.  Operator, we are ready to open the lines for questions. Hi, Gary. Okay. Great. Those are good questions. I've got my management team with me on today. So, Edouard Tavernier runs all transportation on and I'll let Edouard take that and I'll add to it if needed. Edouard? Excellent. Thanks, Edouard. Next question? Hi, Manav. Yes, well, if I look at next year at 7% to 9% and putting a black swan scenario at 5%, it's at least 2% below the range which is about $90 million of revenue. So it's quite substantive and that would more than offset what we've seen in this global shutdown here around our automotive business. So, my view is, is that, that's a solid planning tool that I use with my teams in terms of budgeting and looking on a forward basis.  And I felt that instead of just sharing with you the 7% to 9%, and waiting for the question, what if there is another wave? Well, to me, how I challenge their numbers is if there was a substantive quarterly or several months shutdown globally again, what would that look like? My personal view as we plan is that there will be some second and third waves like we've just seen in Beijing.  But I believe communities, governments, hospitals, a whole bunch of therapeutics and other things are starting to emerge and the management of the waves will be more contained and the return to business and resumption to business will be faster. So, I do think the 5% floor is a solid floor and one that provides our shareholders with the peak to how we think in terms of a second wave.  But really our confidence is in the 7% to 9% and actually performing the businesses that we run, that we know how to run and returning to a more normalized approach to running our business. Jonathan, did you want to add anything else to that? Thanks, Jonathan. Next question? Hi, Bill. Right. Yes, no, I think that's – those are fair points and I think since merger, I think we've been consistent in our approach to margin expansion heading to the mid-40s and we probably would have thought we'd be there in another couple of years, not now.  But the pandemic for us, we have a called action in terms of my leadership team early in the year and we took the appropriate measures to protect our long-term earnings growth and also to protect 2020 against the potential for an even longer period of lockdown.  And so, I think the teams did a good job. Now a big piece of the cuts in 2020 came around compensation cuts. Those will return and start to resume probably for some of the – not necessarily my direct reports, but potentially their direct reports. I'll look to get a return to normal salary levels at the appropriate time in the second half of this year.  For my reports and myself, I think the prudent is to see most of this year past and look at a return and resumption into next year depending on the second half performance. We have a large cash bonus to all that gave us some short-term reprieve for 2020. But as we perform at those levels in 2021, it will need to come back in.  We took action on early on some leases that were coming up and on some smaller offices where we said we'll have a changed footprint going forward. So those are more permanent cuts that require a little bit of restructuring.  We executed those very rapidly with a SWAT team. We have the automotive cuts, actually are mainly around the marketing costs and so when the revenue declined, of course, those costs came into play, but as revenue grows, they will come back in together in parallel.  So, no harm done there. And then I think the biggest thing that I am really proud for my team is the cuts that they made around a large portion of our staff that was being hired on a contract basis, which in a lot of times is an expensive way to staff, but sometimes accelerates initiatives and it's easy also to manage them. And I really worked hard with my teams to put into place replacement units.  So, take the contractor savings, but then immediately permission the restructuring into somewhere a better cost footprints. And the team has done a great job. Those are permanent cost changes and won't come back, but no challenge on our initiatives. We cut a few underperforming initiatives that maybe only do when there is a pandemic, but we actually made some tough calls.  And so, net-net, I don't see any issues with any of our forward initiatives. I am pleased with the performance to support our current products. And I feel we've got the appropriate staff levels to support our ongoing business and the appropriate investments.  I still believe though, Bill, that there is a margin expansion to continue from the mid-40s to the upwards from 44 to say, 47 over the next few years as we continue to manage this much more adjustable footprint.  And we are doing a lot of surveying, a lot of studying, a lot of managing with our teams and I do see substantive savings forward for the redevelopment of our footprint as leases expire and we look forward into the coming years. So, that's where we stand. So the business is strong.  The teams are motivated. I think the glimpse, the scores that we have for employee satisfaction in the firm have been the highest since our merger. And that they are at levels that I thought only Google and tech companies could achieve, but here we go. We've got a really satisfied workforce that's delivering great results.  Next question? Edouard, do you want to take that? Thanks, Edouard. Nothing to add. I'll go to the next question. Yes, maybe I'll start and I'll pass it to Jonathan. So, I have a personal view that that since merger, that shifting from a high 30s, 40% margin and heading towards a 50% margin, that was a task that was in hand for us to do and that over the next five to seven years, we'd execute it.  And so, here we sit at 44% margin looking forward into 2021 and my personal view, understanding if all our cost levers, technology and how it can save us money forward through use of the cloud, cloud-based services, and supporting a work from home and more flexible infrastructure that can support a more flexible work footprint, means that, we have opportunities to do two things.  One, to change our footprint and take cost out over time without being disruptive, and two, through general attrition be able to continue to build our staff into better cost locations and to be better cost locations are Raleigh versus New York, our Manchester versus London, our Gurgaon versus Milan or it's Gdansk versus Frankfurt.  So we have – and even our CARFAX team has built up a great office across the border in Windsor, Ontario and achieved substantive cost savings in their forward planning. So when I look at our footprint, Kevin, my view is, until I say stop, it's a 100 basis points a year and we have to be able and at 5% or better top-line growth with 3% general wage inflation, we are able to generate the appropriate amount of investments for our type of business and we'll continue to do so.  And I think the teams – the team and ourselves, it's our fourth year post-merger. I think we've got a great cadence at executing and we haven't missed yet and I don't think we'll be missing going forward. Jonathan? Thanks, Jonathan. Next question? Hi, Andrew. Jonathan, do you want to grab that? Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. Next question? Yes. Okay. And, Adam is also with me on the call. So, I'll ask him to add to what I have to say. So, first off, I have to say the Ipreo assets have all performed very well through this period. The one piece that hasn't have the opportunity to perform well, but is definitely having its increasing share of activities is the equities portion of the Ipreo revenues.  But when you get to alternatives in private markets, the private markets piece of Ipreo is growing in the 25% to 30% range. And when I look at our valuations business, that's pinned against, that is growing in the 50% plus range.  And so, I really think that our move into alternatives, our team have really taken a leadership role and we are one of a – couple of assets out there that will continue to benefit in that growth in alternatives, as well as the need for the independence around reporting in valuations and the tools that the other marketplaces that are more well developed have established.  Adam, maybe you want to talk a little bit about munis, debt, equity issuance and then the investor services business and how they are performing and the prospects looking forward. Good. Thanks – thanks, Adam. Next question? Okay. Well, I think I said in the last quarter's call that I felt the investments in some of our key organic growth initiatives looking forward were anchored around two or three key things across all our businesses. So, continued diversification of resources, we are very focused on climate and energy transition.  We see it as a big TAM, a growth market and one that we've been investing in and those specific assets have been growing north of 10% in our current Resources division. So, we are very keen to continue to invest there. We invested through in acquisition into agriculture in our agro business. We also expect forward high-single-digits to double-digit growth there as we've invested in the business, re-staffed and Brian is working with the team to set it on a correct path going forward.  So that's organic and that's a large TAM that we are focused on. We don't see us needing to acquire further although there could be small tuck-ins associated to energy transition and climate-related activities. When I – we go into automotive, here Edouard is very focused with CARFAX and AMM teams on automotive, kind of OEM Mastermind which is looking at those digital marketing dollars and the spend.  And you look at the amount for the first time ever, I think digital marketing spend has now surpassed everything else, I read it in the – I think it was the Financial Times or one of the U.S. papers yesterday and we are very well positioned to pull our assets together organically to drive OEM targeting of incentives and marketing dollars.  And again, Edouard is very focused on that organically. The continuation in financial markets with asset managers looking to cut costs, we've been working on, I mentioned in Q2 asset management platform to draw together key market participants in the design host and build of new solutions for asset managers. That's all organic.  So, when I look at that, I go, I've got and we continue to invest and we have substantive organic complementary growth to our existing business. We don't really need a lot of acquisitions. So therefore, I can see capital resuming at the upper-end of our range in terms of share buybacks forward. And keeping our leverage below three times and going to the maximum on that.  And Jonathan and the team, Granat working for him that runs treasury, they are on top of that. They manage it and my view is, is use any excess capital for share buybacks. I don't see a big acquisition slew needed to support our long-term growth initiatives. Jonathan, do you want to add anything else or? Thank you. Next question? Edouard? Nigel, keep going on this one. Yes. Thank you, Edouard. I was on mute. Thanks. Next question. I am going to start and then let Brian add in here in a moment. I would always refer, I referred to actually in the written script I referred to – I think it was within automotive small cancellations. And I don't think anything significant to discuss. But in the Energy space and really across the firm, I took a stance with the team in beginning of Q2 that look, this is an opportunity.  I just market we've got a great reputation to work with our customers. We are going to have some troubled customers and I want us to be at upfront in price concessions and wherever we can increase the price concessions for longer term contracts. And I think the team did really well and where there was opportunities for us to execute longer term contracts and help our customers through a tough year, I think the team did that.  And so, it's going to have an impact within 2020, but also when I fit in our energy minus two, plus two, I am going to have that now dragging through into 2021 with the benefit coming back in 2022, 2023, 2024, because the contract extensions were in general for, three, five, seven years or longer. And so, I think the team did a great job and it's exactly what a good firm should do in this environment.  But I don't actually see any long-term challenges beyond what we've modeled. Now within the Permian, and that lack of CapEx, lower energy prices, private equity and lenders looking for higher hurdle rates on their returns, I think there is a continued challenge. And therefore, we modeled that challenge into our numbers.  And Brian, maybe you want to top up that commentary that I just gave with some of your specifics on how you are viewing the energy recovery and some of the moves we've made through this tough period. Thanks, Brian. Next question. Sorry, I got you. Yes, I got you. Yes, that's correct. Thanks, Shlomo. Next question. Yes, I'll start and again Brian you can add if I don't have it all covered. So, I guess the minus two to plus two, remember, I've given you a – what isn't normally done by a company. In Q2, we gave you the scenarios – previously we gave you the scenarios for 2020, now what I am doing is giving you my forecasting tools that I am doing throughout this July, August period, so that I am ready for a December 1 start.  And currently, 6% to 8% Financial Services, mid-teens in Transportation recovering off of that low comp, which really is high-single-digits. Energy is a bit different. So, Energy, the whole supply/demand equation that went completely out of whack really caused some structural issues in that upstream marketplace and you know we have about $300 million which used to be $400 plus million of premerger of upstream data revenues that are very important to our customers and very sticky.  But if the customer is not there, they are not buying any data. And the fact is, some of those structural supply/demand shifts in our view will cause some customers to disappear, but also some of our larger customers we gave price concessions to. Price concessions cost us in 2020, because they are not for full year. We get the full year impact in 2021. So that continues to cost us.  And then, we built in growth going forward on our contracts from years two through years seven and even longer. So, I think the team has done a good job for that and that gives us a real nice certainty on the way forward. And as you get your data revenues in upstream become about $250 million of $1 billion business and above $4.5 billion company it starts to become an issue of small challenges.  But in 2021, the minus two to plus two reflects the rolling out of that, those revenue concessions that were made, some customers disappearing. And our CapEx down 30%. On the other hand, the rest of the business has opportunities to grow at 7% to 11%. And in the planning period, I can't tell you whether I am going to be precise to 7%, 9%, 10%.  What I can tell you that rate of the moment, the combination of all I know about our Resources business would have us no worse than negative two and likely no better than plus two unless we – unless the $400 million of other revenues grew closer to double-digits. And in planning, that's now how I plan and how I manage the firm with the division heads.  I manage for certainty for reasonableness of error for strong customer pipeline and renewals with our customers and that's what Brian and his team are doing. Brian, do you want to add anything to that? Now, that's a story, Brian. I missed that. Yes, so, right now, in our forecast, we put – we haven't put events returning at the 2019 level. And honestly what, there is some people – if I guess if I was the U.S. President, I'd put full events in for 2021. But in fact, my personal view is that, in analysis with my team, we see some virtual events definitely and some smaller events potentially to come together.  But we haven't put that back in. And if you remember right, at the time of last quarter when I disclosed some of the challenges with the events, you are talking a $40 million that's 4% of growth in that division, or 4% of the revenue potential coming back in that division. And I don't think it's right to put that back in. Jonathan, do you want to add to that? Just to make sure I didn't boggle any numbers there. Right. And would you – in our top range, would we see events returning to 2019 level or a little less or a little more? Yes, yes. Okay. So that's how I said. Good. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Next question. Okay. No. Good question. I'll start, Adam, if can ready to follow-up here. So, Solutions sales for us, I have to say, even though the number is not reflecting in this quarter, actually if you normalize the year-over-year on last year's big Q2, I think normalize over eight or ten quarters, we are probably running at 9%, 10%.  So it's a – it might delay this, normalize Solutions still very strong. The pipeline is also at an all-time high. So therefore, there is lots of interest in the pipeline. And we generally feel that we'll return slowly for the rest of this year and better into next year, those customers closing that pipeline and putting it into production. And so, I think if I look forward, I view Solutions as a strong growth contributor to Financial Services back to pre-COVID levels.  Adam, do you want to add some of the highlights, low lights, some of the challenges and just your forecast of how we look at 2021? Good. Thanks – thanks, Adam. Next question. Good. Thanks. Edouard? Thanks, Edouard. Next question. Yes. No, I guess, I have a personal view and I imagine if we pooled everybody on the phone, we'd all have slightly different views. One I've been quite pleased with the virtual dialogue going on in IHS Markit with our customers. So, we have no issues with supporting our products and our services, our research, our datasets, out data science.  And therefore, I feel we are really lucky to be so resilient against COVID. Our revenue globally from events is probably about 1% of what we do. So therefore, it's – we've taken that impact. It's in the numbers and so, to put it back into the numbers at any reasonable scenario, my view is that, there is got to be a vaccine to support that.  Otherwise, I think there is going to be a mixed bag of people want to fly, want to on subways, want to be in crowded rooms, speakers want to be in crowded rooms themselves as they help companies provide thought leadership. So my own view is that, we should expect at our 9% scenario, something a little less than 19% as Jonathan said.  So, we are at 45, maybe it's 35 to 40. Maybe it's 30. But it's not as high. And at our low-end of the scenario, little to no events and in our black swan, a 5% growth – my view would definitely be none. So, as I look forward and sculpt our business, I am very careful with the teams to be not looking at substantive.  I want to maintain our flagship big CERAWeek, Chem Week, TPM. Those are three flagship events. We are also leaders now around the climate dialogue. We got to support that. We will be world-class virtually. We'll have small meetings and small events where our customers want us to. And if there is a vaccine or a trend back to bigger gatherings, we will be prepared to go.  But, it's not something I put a lot of face in for 2021. But a lot of that's more personal than it is a total view of IHS Markit. But you will get in our forecast numbers, you should know that events will be a tempered revenue that is never going to be the reason for us to hit numbers. Jonathan? Good. Thanks, Jonathan. And, I – all I can say is for our teams that lead those events, they are now focused on leading virtual events and I have to say, just go online and catch the CERAWeek conversations and it's everybody from world leaders to key energy markets thought leaders, Dan Yergin, who, along with Jamey Rosenfield are founders of the CERAWeek.  They've just done an outstanding job to make sure we are supporting our customers in the right dialogues. But they are having to do it virtually. And that at a minimum will be world-class at and let's see what happens. Next question. Before you go, Eric, Eric, Just before you go, I just want to say one last word. The first thing I'd like to say is thank you for the support our shareholders have given us. These are tough times. I never thought I could have experienced anything like this in my life.  And I have to say that having a strong team around you, strong shareholders and great, great people throughout the firm globally working with our customers, we've been able to navigate and I know from many companies they are not – haven't been as fortunate. So, I feel very lucky to be able to do what we've been able to do. But I couldn't have done that with all the teams and I know our shares have been well supported by our investors and I just want to say, thank you for that. And I hope the transparency that we are providing, you will allow us to return to pre-COVID levels once we get through this. But up through that point, I feel that we want to show market leadership in our reporting to help you navigate the challenging waters that we are navigating ourselves and fortunately also performing well in.  So, thank you very much. Also thanks to all the employees. And I want to close that the – some of the challenges that we are dealing in communities around us, in particularly we are at out to all our black colleagues in the U.S. I am appreciating all of their support through us setting strategy forward for IHS Markit.  And once again, we want to be a firm that's action-oriented where out front we are making change happening and I appreciate all of the support from those colleagues in the firm that have been helping me. So, thank you. Eric, do you want to close?"

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Eric Boyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nEric Boyer: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter based on non-GAAP measures are adjusted numbers, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit's filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions. With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance. Lance?\nLance Uggla: Okay, thank you, Eric and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. Before we get started, I want to direct your attention to our supplemental slides posted on our IR website, which we will be referencing today. We're certainly living in unprecedented times with the human and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets in turmoil, and oil in the $20s due to both supply and demand challenges. We've analyzed the changing dynamics within our markets, and we've developed a strong plan and are taking decisive cost actions while maintaining and making room for continued investment to deliver double-digit earnings growth this year and over the coming years. In times such as these, I'm committed to providing even more unparalleled transparency to all of my colleagues and to you, our shareholders. Our markets are changing rapidly and parts of our business will be more challenged than others, but on a whole we're extremely fortunate that our model will be resilient. This is due in large part to our diversification across end-markets and within our end-markets, must have products and services, low revenue concentration across products and customers, annual multi-year subscriptions with high renewal rates, and 90% plus recurring revenue. We've got a CapEx light model with strong cash flow conversion, strong balance sheet, excellent liquidity, and a firm-wide culture that we've honed to drive efficiencies, profit, and continue to innovate even in challenging revenue environments. Now with offices in APAC, we learned quickly how to manage the COVID-19 situation by conducting early-on business impact reviews and ensuring that our IT infrastructure that we've been investing in could support all, I mean all of 16,000 employees working from home and remotely as needed, and we've certainly been tested on that. We're also using these challenging times as an opportunity to be even more visible with our customers and our management teams through virtual calls and webinars. We have the benefit that in this environment, our customers need to hear from us even more to help them through these kinds of uncertainty. Our experts, over 3,000 of them, are reaching thousands of our customers every single day, and we're using the current market conditions to make sure we're there for them and developing opportunities and adjusting our models to support them through these challenging times. Overall, I feel good about our business model, how we are managing the complexity of changing global conditions. I equally feel good about how we're helping our customers during these times with essential activities. Now, Jonathan is going to go over Q1 results, and then I'll go over our multi-year plan on how we're going to plan to achieve the earnings growth that we've suggested. Over to you, Jonathan.\nJonathan Gear: Great. Thank you, Lance. Q1 results were indeed very, very strong. It included revenue of $1.08 billion, organic growth of 6%, and total revenue growth of 3%. We delivered net income of $484 million and a GAAP EPS of $1.20, adjusted EBITDA of $432 million, which is an increase of 8% normalized for the AD&S divestiture and a margin of 39.9%. And we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.66, which is an increase of $0.07 or 12% normalized for the AD&S divestiture. Regarding revenue, our Q1 organic revenue growth of 6% included strong recurring organic growth of 7% and non-recurring organic decline of 5%. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by a tough year-on-year comp in financial services. Moving on to segment performance; our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 7%, including 9% recurring in the quarter. All three subsegments delivered strong performances. Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 9% in the quarter. This included an excellent 12% recurring revenue growth and a decline of 1% in non-recurring, driven by the expected decline of one time in our auto business. We saw exceptional operational metrics, in particular from our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind business lines. Our Resources segment delivered 1% organic growth, which is broken down as 1% recurring growth and 2% non-recurring growth. Our Q1 organic ACV increased by $3 million, and our trailing 12-month organic ACV remained up $24 million or 3%. Our CMS segment delivered 3% total growth, including 1% recurring and a 15% growth in non-recurring. Our CMS total organic growth normalized from prior year RootMetrics customer loss was an impressive 4%. Turning now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was $432 million, which is up $24 million or 8% versus prior-year normalized for AD&S divestiture. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.9%, which is up 90 bps. Segment margins were in line with our expectations. The adjusted EPS was $0.66 per diluted share, which is a $0.07 or 12% improvement normalized for the divestiture. Adjusted EPS also excludes the one-time gain on the sale of AD&S of $372 million. Our GAAP tax rate was 1% and our adjusted tax rate was 17%. Q1 free cash flow was $117 million. As is typical, Q1 cash was seasonally low due to bonus payments. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $966 million and represented a conversion rate of 54%. Now just a reminder, our trailing 12-month conversion rates were impacted by the one-time tax payments that we had in Q4 2019. Turning to the balance sheet, our Q1 ending balance was $5.2 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.9 times on a bank covenant basis, which is in line with our capital policy. We closed the quarter with $144 million of cash, and our Q1 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $925 million and represents a great liquidity position. Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 404 million shares. We repurchased $610 million of shares in the quarter, including completing our $500 million ASR. We also launched a $250 million ASR on March 1. And now Lance, I'll pass it back to you.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. Maybe we can all go on to mute there. We cannot predict with any certainty the length of disruption from COVID-19, and how long and deep the economic impacts are going to last. To account for this uncertainty, we are providing for a wider-than-usual range of 2020 outcomes based upon three scenarios that make assumptions on the macroeconomic and market-specific drivers that may impact our business over the remainder of the year, and these are laid out in the supplement. We're also taking cost actions that will allow us to deliver double-digit earnings growth, even under our worst case revenue scenario. In all three scenarios, we of course face pressure. The reality of an economic slowdown, significantly lower oil prices and CapEx impacting our Upstream Resources business, a general slowdown of new business and decision-making, a near-term shock to consumer spending impacting our auto customers as communities shut down. Now our first scenario, which is the upper end of our guidance, requires the world to settle quickly. And in this scenario, we'd expect our Q3 recovery to begin. Under the Q3 recovery scenario, this is what you would expect to see in terms of our businesses recovery; continued volatility that's driving demand for our pricing and valuation services, and then we'd see a recovery of equity issuances coming in the second half, lower oil prices driving OPEC plus to an agreement in Q3, Brent would rise to the low $30's by the year-end and we'd have an average in the upper $20's, new and used car buying impacted now in Q2 would continue and then rebound in Q3. Okay, let's look at the second scenario. Second scenario moves recovery to Q4; continued volatility drives demand for financial services solutions, a new equity issuance has been closed for most of the year. Oil markets remain uncertain, new OPEC plus agreement is delayed until the end of the year which would lead to an average price of Brent in the mid-$20's, the shutdown of auto sales in Q2 would be followed by U-shaped demand recovery with slow growth throughout the second half. Now the third scenario, which I call with my team are a worst-case scenario. Gives that the longer global recession with no recovery expected in 2020 and recovery begins in 2021. Now, I personally really believe that we've modeled here a worst-case scenario. This is a very challenged financial markets industry, our customers are under continued profit pressure through 2020, without any normal conditions returning until 2021. OPEC plus has disintegrated, there is no sign of any agreement throughout this year, and an average price of Brent will stay in the low $20's into 2021 as well. A sustained recession in the auto industry with sales of both, new and used cars impacted throughout 2020. Now for modeling exercises; my view with this transparency that we're going to be providing you with, each and every quarter and updating you against it, you can model off our worst-case scenario which we'll call the 2021 recovery scenario. We're all working hard and there's many great story that can entice you in to the Q3 and the Q4 recovery, and we'll keep those in mind as we update you regularly. But as you know, we've managed IHS Markit since merger very prudently, and we are going to base our cost assumptions and our cost measures against our worst case scenario in order to provide downside protection, to be able to deliver strong profitability regardless of our revenue outcome, and we've already put in process more than $250 million of 2020 costs. Many of these costs, a minimum of $50 million are modeled as permanent cost reductions going forward. There is also a variable portion of costs that we now have levers in place that as revenue recovers we'll be able to bring those costs back to normal levels. I'll give you some examples of the efforts that my team and colleagues have been making globally to deliver this robust financial plan. Now, of course the variable costs that adjust with revenue, especially within the Autos business are natural levers, those are in place. Last night, my Board, myself, approved a set of executive salary cuts for my top 300 people. And the Board is also equally considering for a next Board meeting in April, a reduction. Cash bonuses will be curtailed, workforce reductions, travel and entertainment, non-critical projects, contractor spend, and a freeze on both new and replacement hiring, we're also optimizing facilities and lease negotiations, reduction in purchase expenses also being optimized. In addition to providing double-digit earnings growth in a challenging environment, these cost reductions now are allowing us to maintain investments in each and every one of our segments at the levels we were investing at. No investments have been cut around our alternatives business, our auto enterprise Mastermind product, which the Mastermind team had a whopping 36% first quarter, really great performance in recovery. Our initiatives around climate, and regardless of this current environment, the challenges of climate globally are not going away and IHS Markit will be prepared to build those services as we look forward into 2021 and beyond. And then finally, our team working on a new asset management platform that will bring efficiencies in technology and operations to the asset management industry will still be fully invested. Next, we've been investing in our data lakes, teams and people from working globally to transform our technology stack, to be able to offer new and exciting services to our customers that are already taken shape, underway and revenue in the pipeline. Our investment in our transformation to the cloud will carry on fully. All of this is provided for within the plans presented in each of the three scenarios, as well as in the 2021 and 2022 guidance as you see us returning to growth. Now, let me provide you some color on how the current uncertainty may impact each of our different segments so you can understand the levers we're dealing with and equally gain confidence in the plan that we're providing you. Let's start with resources. We know the price of oil is under pressure from the largest disruption of global industry demand. With increasing supply, our scenarios are going to assume an average global CapEx reduction of roughly 30% in 2020 and further 15% in 2021. Now, with the bulk of the cut to North America, this will impact our upstream business, and remember our upstream business is now only 60% of resources revenue. Remember, our upstream revenue is broken into three parts; data, analytics and our insights businesses. We expect the largest negative impact to be on our data business followed by analytics, but our insights business includes market forecast, analysis; the insight business has held up very well during the last downturn, and we expect even better this time as the financial market, corporations, governments are all calling on us to provide information and scenarios to manage them through this difficult environment. We're well diversified this time; super majors, national oil companies, large, mid-sized, and small independent E&P companies. There is and going to be the most pressure among our small independents. The small independents make up only a $100 million of our upstream revenue and reside within North America, and they're mostly customers of our data and analytics offerings, and where they are stronger are still drawing on our insights to help them with their decision-making through this tough period. Moving to our downstream business; now 40% of our resources revenue and very well diversified chemicals, power, gas, renewables, agriculture and our OPIS business -- we expect these businesses to continue to produce regular growth as the customer base is very diversified and mostly non-E&P customers, in fact. Now, the E&P industry is going to remain under pressure in the coming quarters. But as a company, we're so much better positioned than the company that entered 2015. Here are some of the reasons; our resources business, as I said, is more balanced, our fast growing downstream businesses are now 40%, they were only 15% back in 2014. Upstream revenue is only 15% of our total company versus 35% back then. International data cancellations which led the decline in revenue the last time are much lower as large independents are mainly operating in the U.S. today. Our team's been through this before, they've got the playbook and we're operating with much better data and analytics due to all the investments we've made post-merger in systems to help support us. Given all of this, we expect our resources segment's organic growth to be positive low-single digits to negative low-single digits, adjusted for the events -- the one-time events cancellation in 2020. Okay, let's go to Transportation. Included in Q1, which was absolutely stellar and I really want to congratulate the team for the results that they delivered, we've been delivering and performing at a very high level with double-digit organic revenue growth in 10 of the past 11 quarters. Now, in the current environment, our Transportation business will experience headwinds and this is discussed in our scenarios. As regions around the world enact stay at home policies to deal with the virus, it's easy to know that consumers are not out buying cars. We saw this in China during their shutdown period and we're now seeing a slow recovery. The dynamic is now beginning in North America. And traffic to dealerships will continue to decline significantly and put tremendous profit pressure on our dealer customers. We do believe this is an unprecedented short-term impact to the dealerships and not representative of how the industry would perform during the normal cyclical downturn. The range of the outcomes tied to our three scenarios is wide and growth for this segment should be between positive low-single digits to negative mid-single digits. Let's move to Financial Services, which also performed exceptionally well in Q1 and have done over the past three years, just fueled by product innovation, market penetration, diversification and a very strong team. We now expect organic growth in the mid-single digits and here is what we're assuming. So you're going to have stable revenue across information. This is due to the high recurring revenue and all of these products are must haves and even more so in these volatile environments. Our valuations are in full demand, corporate actions, corporate Services, all very much needed with potential growth in demand in the coming quarters. Now, Processing, which has been a challenging segment of course, is processing derivatives and secondary loan markets but two-thirds of it is derivative processing and the volumes and of course the ticket sizes are lower and the volumes are higher due to the volatility and we'll see some tailwinds there through the coming quarters. We also expect though, some weakness within solutions. It's going to be due to longer software sales cycles, lower volumes in some of the Issuer Services business. We expect lower volumes through Q2 for our equities, bonds and municipals, which combined are about $70 million of our annual variable revenue. In our best scenario, we start to see some improvements early in the second half with no improvement in our worst-case scenarios through to 2021. Now, finally within CMS and it's great to see CMS coming through and supporting us in this challenging time, but here our hard work is paying off. We see steady demand for our product design offerings, continued demand for our economic and country risk [ph] offerings where we provide knowledge and insights into the challenges across over 200 countries. And our health sciences team is being called on as well for advice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our customers need increased support in a rapidly changing world and we expect organic growth in CMS to be in the low single digits. Now, I'm going to turn the call back to Jonathan, who will provide details on the 2020 guidance.\nJonathan Gear: That's great. Thank you, Lance. Now relative to our original guidance, as a reminder, we previously announced the cancellation of events due to the COVID-19 health concerns. Again, as a reminder, these cancellations will negatively impact Q2 revenue by $50 million and adjusted EPS by $0.09. Approximately $40 million of the revenue impact relates to the Resources segment due to the cancellation of our CERAWeek and CHEMWeek [ph] events. The remaining $10 million relates to our Transportation segment due to the cancellation of our TPM Maritime and other events. We have also adjusted for the change in foreign currency exchange rates since the beginning of the year, causing a negative FX impact on revenue of approximately $25 million. In terms of our forward view for 2020, as Lance stated, due to the uncertainty we have developed three scenarios to take into account different assumptions on how the virus, the price of oil, and economic situations evolve over the next few months and quarters. Our supplemental schedules detail the three scenarios with the following ranges; revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.425 billion; organic growth of between 1% and 4% normalized for the impact of the Q2 events; adjusted EBITDA of $1.825 billion to $1.85 billion; and adjusted EPS of $2.76 to $2.81. As Lance mentioned, we would direct your estimate to the lower end of these ranges at this time. Now in terms of cost actions, we are in the process of executing approximately $250 million of 2020 costs. We do expect approximately $50 million of these costs to be permanent go forward reductions. The variable portion of costs will return as revenue recovers in our Auto businesses and salaries return to normal level in 2021 and 2022. Finally, we expect cash conversion of approximately 50% due to one-time costs with our cost reduction efforts and working capital delays due to market conditions. All guidance items below adjusted EBITDA are unchanged from prior guidance except for stock-based comp. Our original guidance range call for a full year stock-based comp expense of $220 million to $225 million. We now expect full year stock-based comp expense to be approximately $30 million higher than our original guidance due to higher employer taxes from the U.K. National Insurance expense on 2020 option exercises. This represents a one-time increase in our GAAP stock-based comp expenses in 2020 and will not impact our 2021 expense level. In terms of capital allocation, given the current market conditions, we are focused on maintaining high levels of liquidity and capital structure flexibility. We do plan to pause share buybacks and plan to maximize our capacity under our bank credit facility. However, the cash dividend we initiated and paid in Q1 will continue as planned. We maintain a very healthy and strong balance sheet, investor-grade rating, a well-positioned debt maturity ladder and a strong diversified bank group. While there will negative impacts from the current external challenges, we do have a model that can absorb the risk in this environment, yet still deliver solid earnings growth. And with that Lance, I'll turn the call back to you.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. As our supplemental slide layout, our cost cutting actions are going to anchor our 2020 earnings to double-digit growth, regardless of which revenue scenario unfolds in the coming quarters. We're not providing formal guidance for 2021 and '22 but based upon our scenarios and cost actions, we would expect in each of those forward years, organic revenue growth to return to our longer-term range of 5% to 7%, adjusted EPS growth of double-digits and as we move through the year, we'll update you on our progress with our cost actions and the conditions within our end markets against our scenarios. Now, finally, I want to thank all of my colleagues around the world who have been working tirelessly to manage the rapidly changing dynamics within our markets, local communities and to continue to serve our customers. And to you, our shareholders, I want to thank you for your support and give you my commitment of this unparalleled level of transparency in our progress against our multi-year plan during these uncertain times and my commitment will be to continue to update you against scenario one, two, and three, our worst case scenario, and project those into 2021 and '22 and show any adjustments needed on a quarterly basis. Now, with that, operator, we're ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nGary Bisbee: Hi, good morning. And thanks for all the color, Lance and team. I appreciate it. I feel like that's a lot more than a lot of companies are giving. Obviously, it's taken a lot of work, so we appreciate it. Given how rapidly things are changing and frankly just how dramatically things have changed in the last 10 days, what's your confidence level around the scenarios, in particular, the worst case and especially revenue being able to bounce back to that mid-to-high, single-digits so quickly if the recession coming out of this persists for a while?\nLance Uggla: Right. So, I guess, if you have to look at the numbers, how I've worked in with the team, the first thing that I wanted to do with the team is make sure that the decisive nature of our response is early and protects us through our worst case scenario and then sets us up very well for the recovery, but also its protection, given the variable nature of some of those cost returns can protect us indefinitely looking forward. If you want to ask me about my probabilities on scenarios one, two, three, my view is, is that the scenario one with 4% organic growth is my lowest probability scenario, and I'd say that's a 10% chance that we're able to deliver that scenario. That depends on the recovery time, but also it will depend on some of the new revenue initiatives that are in place and the demands on some of our existing services that have some silver linings in difficult periods. So, let's put a 10% or maximum 15% on that scenario. I'd also say that our scenario two, with a recovery going into the end of the year probably has a similar probability on it of 10% to 15%. And so therefore, what really made me focus on our worst case scenario, which I really do believe at a 95% confidence level is more than enough to protect us through all the environments that I'm looking at in terms of the modeling today with my team. And I really wanted to put that out on the table to eliminate a lot of the shareholders' fears about the what-ifs. So when we come back next quarter in Q2, I'll update you on those costs and I'll share with you the total revenue impacts and how we're tracking against each of those scenarios. And I think with that color, Gary, we'll be well-positioned to manage through this year but also will give us a great base level to start 2021. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBill Warmington: Hello, everyone. I wanted to -- how are you doing?\nLance Uggla: Good. We're all on virtual, so we're having to give each other a hand signal to see who is going to take your tough questions.\nBill Warmington: I know. It used to be that working for home was -- there was a stigma associated with it, and the dog would bark and give you away. But I think it's pretty much the new normal these days. So, I wanted to also say, I appreciate the detail around the scenario analysis. I think that's very helpful, constructive way to lay out the guidance. I wanted to ask about the assumptions that you have around the ACV and resources and how -- maybe you could repeat the comments around where ACV finished up in Q1? And how you think that's going to unfold in the different scenarios?\nLance Uggla: Okay. Well, I've got all my leadership team on here virtually Brian, Edouard, Adam, and Jonathan. So, I'll pass that to Brian who's worked up his models and he can answer that question directly. Brian?\nBrian Crotty: Can you hear me?\nBill Warmington: Yes.\nBrian Crotty: Hey Bill. So yes, we see -- ACV, we see it trailing just a little, but only the segment. I mean, the segments that we model it for are really just the Data Business, and mostly we've taken it by customer. We've really drilled into it. And so, we're really focused on the drilling segment of our customer base. So, that coupled with saying towards the future, our -- we've taken down our projections on new sales early into that segment. But the nice thing is, as Lance said earlier, the business is a lot more diversified now. We're seeing a lot of strength still in our downstream businesses which are growing high-single digits.\nLance Uggla: Good. Thanks, Brian. Jonathan, you wanted to add to that?\nJonathan Gear: Yes, I was going to give you the numbers, Bill. So, as I mentioned, the Q1 organic ACV increased by $3 million and the trailing 12-month organic ACV is up $24 million or 3%.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. I just -- hi, good morning. Just want to confirm on Transport that the figures that you gave us, the outlook figures are for the full year in total, including, I guess the strong growth that you saw in Q1, meaning the Q2 through Q4 numbers are implying something. Well, we just want to make sure I'm understanding that right. And then just any color you could give us within Transport or Autos by the different product lines and the outlook would be appreciated? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Okay. So, the numbers are for the full year, and I have Edouard Tavernier on, and he'll give you a bit of color on the Automotive and Maritime segment.\nEdouard Tavernier: Great, thank you. Thank you, Lance. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. So, in terms of color, as we've said historically, our business is resilient to what I would call cyclical downturns. But this, as Lance said, is not a normal cyclical downturn. And as we worked with many retailers across the U.S. and Canada, we are seeing first-hand the impact of communities shutting down on automotive retail. So, our dealer partners are hurting, they're hit by an unprecedented consumer demand shock. And as you know, we are seeing an increasing number of states that are issuing stay at home mandates or where entire communities are shutting down. In these conditions, dealers may no longer be able to sell vehicles. Some of them have had to close temporarily. Others have seen a dramatic decline in their revenues. So, as our Q1 earnings showed, we are incredibly well positioned to support the industry going forward, and we look forward to expanding our long-term partnership with North American automotive dealers. However, in the short term, our business is being impacted by depressed levels of new business, increased levels of cancellations, and in some cases temporary price concessions to dealer partners during the month of May they we are no longer able to operate their business in normal conditions. In terms of car makers and suppliers, the entire supply chain is facing challenges in the face of COVID-19 disruption, and we continue to be very well-positioned to help them through this crisis, including helping them manage disruptions in their supply chains.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Lance. Good morning, guys. And thanks for the color as well, but just on the financial services assumption for the full year. I was just hoping you could help us with, how much of that mid-single-digit organic growth is driven by your expectations of processing volumes, helping you guys in the next couple of quarters given the volatility there?\nLance Uggla: Yes, I wish -- I'll let Adam speak in a moment, but I couldn't have a more conservative leadership team and every time I say the derivatives volumes that we're starting to see here, we should see that through the rest of the year, they put them back to flat. So in the models that we're showing you there is a modicum of upside in terms of processing. So there is really the real bet is that we maintain our current business. We have a really strong pipeline and the financial markets are maintaining the need for the information, the rollout of new regulations and the demand incrementally for second and third pricing services through this volatile period. And we saw something similar in '08 and we're seeing some of that now. We have modeled out though that other pieces of demand of course will decline. And Adam, why don't you give like Brian and Edouard have done, just a bit of color on Financial Services in a bit more detail.\nAdam Kansler: Sure. Thanks, Lance, and thanks Manav. I think Lance captured the bigger picture very well. I think when you think about our business, it's a pretty well-diversified business across the different types of financial services, customers and services and products we provide. So in volatile times like this looking for processing, we will see places within our processing business with outsized performance to the upside, volatility does drive credit markets in some interesting ways but in this moment you're also seeing a real Holocene [ph] equity issuance and real fits and starts and other fixed income issuance. So like -- I tend to think of it is a balanced package. There may be opportunities on the upside as we go through the year depending on how long things last and what markets look like over the next several months, you may see aggregate downside. The full year vision that we've given bakes in what we think is a conservative estimate of what would happen in each of the three scenarios thanks.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Adam. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nHamzah Mazari: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the color as well. You guys spoke about the business being much more diversified, you talked of our Downstream, Upstream being lower, and also you have sort of the downturn playbook from the last cycle. Maybe if you could touch on are your contracts structured differently versus last cycle? Do you have more multi-year contracts? Is the cancellation, notice period the same? And then just versus the last downturn playbook is there anything different you can do on the cost side? I know you mentioned $250 million of costs, and then $50 million permanent. So maybe just compare the downturn playbook you have this time, how it's different from last time? And then maybe any changes to contract structure, if at all? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Okay. I'll pass that to Jonathan first and then he can pass it to Brian, if necessary.\nJonathan Gear: Sure. Just a couple of comments on kind of where we are in the cycle and emphasize some things that Lance says in his earlier comments. First of all, Q4 and Q1 are our heavier renewals type of periods. So you kind of gotten through those two periods, which obviously is helpful. The second thing and I'll compliment Brian and the team. They've done an excellent job of going through customer-by-customer, understanding their position, where they are in the renewal cycle and also where they are in the oil patch and identifying where we see potential risk really at a customer-by-customer level. So again, I think we have far greater transparency for analytics and control kind of where we are in this cycle. Brian, anything you want to add?\nBrian Crotty: No, the only thing I'll add is coming out of the last downturn, we did focus on multi-year agreement. So we have increased our percentage. So we feel pretty good about where we are in those and we continue to sell those as well.\nLance Uggla: Excellent. Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. Just real quick, hey, Lance, great job. Really just, well done. Just I want to clarify on the capital allocation. Did you say, are you going to draw down on the revolver? Number one. And then number two, Jonathan, on the ASR are you going to complete that $500 million ASR or that's on hold as well?\nLance Uggla: Yes. Okay, I'll start and then I'll pass to Jonathan. So we, we completed the $500 million ASR. We started a $250 million ASRs, that's been going through the quarter, which will be completed probably sometime in April. We have a -- halted any further ASRs until we see better sight into the forward marketplace. In our modeling looking forward into next year and the following year with the return to growth, we modeled in about a $1 billion of buybacks in each of those years and we're not going to draw down on our liquidity lines. We've got a diversified bank group that's strong and we've talked to them all and we don't see a need to draw down on those bank lines. So that's what I'd say. Jonathan, add to that?\nJonathan Gear: Yes, well, that actually covered very, very well. And the thing I'll again amplify to this, we have a very, very strong bank group, over 20 banks in that group, Atlanta [ph], we've spoken to everyone. We really frankly don't have a need to draw down a bit. So we don't have any plans at this point to do it. But again, we certainly have the liquidity there should we choose to in the future.\nLance Uggla: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, two questions. In the 2020 guide in the third scenario, which is the plus 1%, what's your assumption around subs versus non-subs organic revenue growth? And I also have a second question, what needs to happen during 2020 to set yourself up to get to that 6% to 7% organic revenue growth that you painted in 2021 and 2022?\nLance Uggla: Right. So I guess, I look at our 2019 performance -- I look at our Q1 performance, I look at the investments we're making in incremental growth in well-demanded areas, and I look at a lot of our must have services across all of our divisions, and even the investments made to put CMS on a stronger footing. I really felt a lot of confidence going into this year of our 5% to 7% and having ample opportunity to be in that range and even at the top of that range. As we look at this year, Andrew, this is an unparalleled situation, and I think what I've said since merger is that we were in a good position to be able to manage this company, expand margin and provide double-digit earnings growth, even if we fell down to a 4% ongoing organic revenue growth. And in this case, even in our worst-case scenario as we fall down to 1% growth combination of strong decisions by my team as well as putting us in a strong position next year, you can see that we got those levers to manage the company well. So going to your next question, which is on that 6%, a lot of what we do is multi-year recurring revenue must have. The variable portion of our business is quite low. We're very diversified across customers and very diversified in all divisions across products. I'm not assuming that the recovery, the COVID-19 pandemic playing into that global recession continues on right through '21. But if that's the scenario that you would like to put into our model, then I would suggest that you see a 2% to 4% revenue growth in '21 with a long protracted recession and you'll see us maintain the variable cost that we're showing in our model in the supplementals to be rolling back in as staying out and you'll continue to see margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth as we navigate some of the tough challenges ahead of us. But we've got a resilient model that can respond differently than many of our peers and customers. And I think the team has really put in the efforts in the tough decisions now that are going to ensure that if your scenario, if that's what it is, of a protracted recession into 2021 and beyond, we've already put the cost management in place to be able to manage that and the variable cost would stay out, of course, the revenue would come down and hopefully some of the newer initiatives around climate, around asset management, cost reduction platforms in place around our alternatives business that we expect will be still a key part of future financial markets and of course, dealers trying to return to sales will meet us for their incentives planning, advertising, building audiences, and I have to say, I feel very committed to that forward plan and I'm very confident that even if we do go into a protracted revenue lower than the 6% at a lower single-digit level, we can manage the Company and deliver exceptional results. Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hey, good morning guys. Appreciate you taking the question. Certainly unprecedented times, hopefully relatively short-lived anyway; I wonder if I could dig down a little bit in the cost savings projections. As I look at my model, they're pretty significant from a margin standpoint in absolute terms too. I mean, how comfortable are you taking out the costs that you are -- which presumably would be at an accelerated rate compared to a normal environment that that doesn't impair your ability to return to growth on the other side of all this.\nLance Uggla: Right, that's a good question. Well -- so to me, there's two pieces of these cost take-outs. One piece of them are permanent take-outs, so as we described that's about $50 million. The second piece of this is a variable cost takeout that we'll need to return with the revenue, but they are scaled against that return to profitability. So, we have a big cost base, $4.5 billion of revenues and more than $2.5 billion of costs. So we've got a big cost base. So to take $50 million out in terms of fixed means that we've had to dig deep and look at things that are some nice to haves, things that we're working on that weren't revenue based initiatives but maybe were you know an expansion of an office, maybe they were some of the nice to haves. We have around a lot of the social activities in the firm, things around higher priced contractors that we might have been using to accelerate our growth, which in this environment, we will look to move to our better-cost locations and bring back in-house. So we're ready for that return to growth. So about $50 million, which is a couple of percent of our overall cost base that we've taken out permanently. The rest is variable. So what is that variable? Travel and entertainment. It's the salary cuts that I led with my executive team. It's our forward events calendar, which will be -- will come back slowly over time. It's our -- some of the things around our revenue that's tied -- that has a tied cost base so marketing expense that we use is CARFAX to support used car listings that will be off. So, we -- there is a bunch that are variable and they'll just come back in naturally and we've modeled those in for you so you could see how that works. But we have taken out $50 million fixed. I forgot also some of the purchased expenses, we've already renegotiated. We put in some -- we've got 130 offices. There were several million around leases that we've either extended now at lower prices or actually decided to eliminate and carry on with a work from home strategy going forward. So we've -- I think the team has done a great job on that and I'm not worried about the $50 million and I like the variable nature of the other costs because, as Andrew asked in the previous question, it gives me the levers to protect earnings if the revenue is slower than planned. Jonathan, do you want to add some to that?\nJonathan Gear: Sure, that is a great summary, Lance. One thing I would add is that the part of our business, which is being most affected in this scenario here is our automotive business, particularly our support for marketing efforts for both used and new cars. And that happens to be the part of our business that has the most variable cost that flexes up and down with revenue. So there is a natural and significant flex down that comes naturally. As our dealers need less traffic, as their shops are closed. If it comes back down, they will naturally come back up. So I think the key thing that we've all done as the executive team and management team has done here, we've been very focused. And as Lance mentioned in his opening remarks, we still are investing in the key growth levers and drivers that will take us into the growth in '21 and beyond.\nLance Uggla: Good. Thanks, Jonathan. And that probably last point was the most important is, we've got kind of four great long-term growth levers that further diversify us and take us to new levels. And we're quite pleased to be able to announce that to our teams that we wouldn't be cutting any of those initiatives whatsoever in the forward plans because they are important to that -- our future. The other thing that I think is important on the cost side is that we really made a decision around enhanced severance and focus on any workforce reductions to ensure that nobody is sent home with less than a year of continuance in terms of their compensation through this tough period. And again, that's an important leadership decision that my teams collectively made. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning everyone. Maybe to come back to the guidance, what -- I don't think anybody has asked this question, like, what would be the thing that you would look for to not make that double-digit growth in 2020? I guess what are the factors that could still get you below that where you just can't find any more offset? And I guess you could ask the same question about 2021 as well.\nLance Uggla: Yes. Honestly, the way I've produced this guidance for you guys now in these scenarios, I don't really -- to me, it's a low single-digit probability to not hit that double-digit earnings growth in 2020 and 2021. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nSeth Weber: Good morning, guys. Just a -- I guess, maybe just first a clarification on the $50 million permanent cut. Is that, should we assume that that's skewed to resource on a relative basis versus the other segments?\nLance Uggla: No, not at all. Actually, if I look at all of our teams, they do a great job expanding margin each year. One thing you should know about our margin expansion, a lot of it has come through our attrition and then replacing attrition in near and offshore locations, which have substantive gains for our operational development testing and other roles. So we've got 16,000 people, about 4,000 of them are in better cost of living locations and that gives us more than probably 100,000 per person fully costed [ph]. So we've been doing that naturally, and the teams have been expanding staff but reducing costs and adding margin by leveraging our footprint, which is now very well developed. And so a lot of what we're doing here across the whole firm is accelerating some of those initiatives, and that means we've got to look at everything across the firm, whether it's, finance, HR, tech, development, whether it's product people and product development folks. We really have to leverage that footprint globally and that's across the whole firm. Brian's already running a lean, mean Energy team which do a great job and our view is the diversification there across Upstream, Midstream and Downstream gives us ample opportunity to deliver great results for the firm. It's actually quite interesting, when you actually look at what's happening to us through this period as we gave you a worst-case scenario actually, the worst-case scenario is being driven by our best performing division which is Automotive, because they have the variability around the used car and the Listings businesses around CARFAX and CARFAX Canada. So here we are in an environment where everybody is worried about our energy market performance. But the energy market performance would have been completely absorbed in the outperformance of financial markets, CMS and automotive but it's the combination of this worst-case scenario that puts us in a place where the cost initiatives are, I think, prudent because they put us in a very flexible position for 2020 profit delivery but also with a variable return of expenses. We're now actually well-positioned for 2021 and 2022 and I just really felt it was important to give you guys our models, which I don't think is going to be the norm across companies out there, but we basically shared with you my planning tool, how I'm managing the company, and I'm going to update you on that every quarter. And as far -- since merger we, I guess, besides one little blip, we've never missed a single number we've given to you. So don't expect us to do that going forward. We plan to hit these numbers and hopefully be able to surprise. Okay, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. And again, I appreciate the detail around the forecasting. Lance, can you talk a little bit about what you've seen so far in Asia-Pac, in China? How you see things play out and how you believe that might be applicable to what we're seeing in other areas of the world or where you think it may not be applicable?\nLance Uggla: Right, so it's very interesting. That's a great question and probably one that takes us a little bit away from the script and the call, but at the same time, you can see how a recovery can happen. So started in China, we sent -- everybody was sent home, working from home, we're testing our systems. We're learning about the challenges of not being able to travel into a region, trying to complete deals, close deals and make things happen. Today, our people are mostly back in the offices and they managed this through a very serious use of social distancing, hands washing, use a mask. People that don't wear the masks are shunned at in Asia and the ones that weak them are respected. We have the opposite problem here in the UK, and I think you have it in North America. People get a funny look if they're wearing a mask as if they're the challenge and the ones that don't wear the mask are going to prolong the recovery. So in Asia we've had -- we had China recover first. Hong Kong now, our office is back and running. But again, people are very careful about their social distances and cleanliness in terms of masks and hands but they're back working together. Actually sales and our pipeline is actually quite strong, a bunch of new pipelines, orders and businesses coming from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore. If anything, it gives you a lot of hope for our scenario one but actually, I think with such a democratic society in Europe and North America, I actually think that I can't bet on the Q3 recovery and therefore I wanted to share with you a Q4 and even a full year lack of recovery. But if we followed the Asian path you would quickly go to our Q3 recovery and say, yes, you got it right. And you do, you know as well as I do that, that when I talk to many people, including the U.S. President and online last night is we want to get back to work quick and soon. And not that I necessarily believe that that's the reality, but there are still many people that don't think that staying at home and staying out of danger is going to be a way to get to a recovery and get to the other side. So here we are. You've got a Q3 optimistic view that follows the Asia path and it follows probably what I'm starting to hear out of Italy. Although you see big numbers in Italy, when I talk to colleagues and others in Milan, I start to see that people are starting to see some optimism in the control. If you don't believe that, push to the Q4 recovery. And if you don't believe that, go to our worst case scenario, lever your models off of that, bet on the earnings that I'm showing you and then you have to decide the recovery. But what's nice about the recovery, if we don't hit the revenue, our costs are now variable, rolling back in and we'll protect earnings. And I've got lots of levers for growth. When the right opportunity comes, but right now I want to make sure I keep the company strong, be able to pay all our people well, protect our liquidity and deliver great results for you guys. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks, good morning. I'd like to go back to the topic of cost reductions. Can you discuss the timeline for when you expect to complete your permanent cost reductions? And when you might expect to return to your prior longer-term guidance of 100 bps of annual EBITDA margin expansion?\nLance Uggla: Yes. Well, as you've seen in all scenarios this year, you'll have in excess of that margin. And, if you look forward into '21 and '22, we also forecast a continuation of the 100 basis points. So our view is, even though we're going to have a strong outperformance, we still have ample scope for our organizational design that we've been working on and we expect that to continue into the future. So my perspective, the margin story and the earnings story is really strong; this is a story about revenues that are going to come off at some unknown level. And so therefore, we need to set a set of cost reductions in place that will be constructed to never return, and to come back and return on a variable basis with the revenue. So I feel we've got a perfect model set up for the go-forward. What I would say on the permanent reductions, the $50 million that we talked about, we are already in full execution mode, and I'd expect those to have a 8-month impact for this year. I'll pass in full impact for next year. Jonathan?\nJonathan Gear: Great. I'll just echo what you said Lance. And George, what we're seeing is, even in our worst case scenario we expect to see a couple of hundred bips of improvements from 2019 to 2020, and then continue to have 100 bips all the way through to 2022; so we're no way backing off on margins improvement commitment.\nGeorge Tong: Thanks, Jonathan.\nLance Uggla: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. And Lance, thanks a lot for all the colors that you've provided. Maybe just a quick follow-up, as you mentioned, there is the biggest variability is on the auto or the used-car listing site, and thanks for providing a lot of color on that front. My question there was, just as we think about the cadence there -- just given the variability also, is it fair to assume that you would see the most impact there in the maybe second quarter? And even in the worst case scenario, you should see that part of the business bounce back quicker than other parts of the businesses and reaccelerate fastest growth; is that the right way to think about it?\nLance Uggla: That's exactly how we think about it. But again, if you model off of that worst case scenario, we're saying, you know, you don't have any of that recovery until next year. But our view is that bounces back very quickly, we've got a super strong model. And maybe Edouard wants to add some additional color to that.\nEdouard Tavernier: No, I think you're spot on, Lance. Obviously, the sector is very, very responsive to consumer demand. So it will take the bigger hits right now in Q2. We've seen activity levels declined precipitously in the past two weeks and but obviously, we think this sector will rebound before the other because as soon as consumers will back into dealership logs, our dealer customers, our dealer partners will require our tools and solutions, so absolutely.\nLance Uggla: Excellent. Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph [ph] with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, and thanks for the scenarios in the call. Just on oil, have you seen any real-time changes in oil CapEx spending? Our budget is being opened up and what are you building in for M&A and failures or any possibility of a deal in these scenarios? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: I'll pass it to Brian in a second. But clearly, in our worst case scenario, we see the smaller independents really struggling, potential mergers, potential failures to pay potential bankruptcies; so therefore, I think we -- it's $100 million of all of that revenue, and we definitely -- you know, I think modeled appropriately for that piece of the puzzle. We do see Shell came out with their announcements and you can see that CapEx will be curtailed. We put actually a 30% followed by a further 15% cut on CapEx which we think is significant. Given the -- you know, there is going to be a built up; obviously, supply -- that needs to get tuned through in the future, but ultimately, there is a -- still a robust demand for product, still longer term and that needs to be brought out of the ground. So, I think our model is fairly robust. And Brian, maybe want to add some additional color on that?\nBrian Crotty: Yes, I think so. You know, obviously, CapEx goes down further certainly in the US and it does overseas. But I -- you know, the thing that actually helps us out is some of the oil is hedged in the US, so those small independence will stay around and try to weather the storm. So, I think -- you know, while CapEx will actually accelerate and will decelerate in that area, these companies -- you know, it's not oil goes down to $20 and these guys go out of business; so there will be a lag before we start to see curation [ph].\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Brian. Our next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, thanks for taking my question. How is the shift to working from home affected the various internal projects you have underway, whether it be the data lake project or the hiring practices tied to your shift of the employee base to lower cost regions, or really any other projects that might have previously relied more heavily on face-to-face interaction? And then, same topic or at least relatedly, if you could provide any color on the expected impact of virtual work on your sales force's ability to sell new business and build your pipeline? That would be helpful.\nLance Uggla: Yes. No, that's -- that's a good question. I've never been -- I have to say, I've never been celebrator of work-from-home. And so, I'm learning my lessons here the proper way. But actually what's funny is, your productivity working from home without interruptions is actually substantively improved for many -- for others that have challenges in terms of children, family, etcetera, in that work-from-home environment that becomes something that you have to work with. But I found productivity for myself has improved and my connection with people have been substantive, and -- so I'm actually very pleased. And if anything, it's made me rethink some of those policies and flexibilities that many companies would like to have. We also have put in -- we've been an early, we're in the middle post the Asian move, we started to look at the workplace analytics tools, and tools that measure productivity; so we actually have some early POCs [ph]. And I think what we can see is, productivity at home is pretty damn high, and people are working very hard, and our pipelines and results are showing that. On developers and people working on projects; you know, most of our developers sit side by side with headphones on and are in their own focused world doing their jobs, and they're quite happy to not have to commute and be able to focus on the work at hand. We have some professional services people that actually have to go on site with our customers, and of course, this is curtailed. And so we've put in for slower implementation of some of those activities, but a lot of times the customer's virtual acceptance has actually increased. And again, it's very focused. So decision-making is happening effectively. So, for a non-believer in work-from-home, I've become a believer, I find that I'm working more hours sitting here at my dining room table than I care to admit. And really, my colleagues around the world have been impressive, and I have to say that they're holding up the fort very well. But let's hope we get some social interaction back in our lives again soon. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Eric Boyer for the closing remarks.\nLance Uggla: Okay. And just before -- just before you go Eric, I just really want to say to all of our shareholders that all of you represent and the shareholders that are on the phone; you know, for us, it was a big decision in terms of opening it up to transparency in this detail, as well as giving you that detail into 2021 and 2022. But I did feel that in times like this, making decisions day-to-day you're entrusted to invest people's money, and you need to make sure that you don't have to second guess what's happening in the companies you're investing in. So this level of transparency will be updated every single quarter until we feel we're back to a normal situation. When we get back to the normal situation, I ask that you accept that I'll turn that light bulb off and go back to managing the company, how we always did, and hopefully, if your trust in both, myself and my management team will remain at the highest of levels. And thank you for your support. Eric?\nEric Boyer: Great, thanks for your interest in HIS Markit. This call will be accessed via replay 855-859-2056 or international dial-in at 404-537-3406. Conference ID 4656659 beginning in about two hours and running through March 31, 2020. In addition, the webcast will be archived for one year on our website. Thank you and we appreciate your interest and time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Adam Kansler",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Lance, and thanks Manav. I think Lance captured the bigger picture very well. I think when you think about our business, it's a pretty well-diversified business across the different types of financial services, customers and services and products we provide. So in volatile times like this looking for processing, we will see places within our processing business with outsized performance to the upside, volatility does drive credit markets in some interesting ways but in this moment you're also seeing a real Holocene [ph] equity issuance and real fits and starts and other fixed income issuance. So like -- I tend to think of it is a balanced package. There may be opportunities on the upside as we go through the year depending on how long things last and what markets look like over the next several months, you may see aggregate downside. The full year vision that we've given bakes in what we think is a conservative estimate of what would happen in each of the three scenarios thanks."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Lance Uggla",
            "content": "Okay, thank you, Eric and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. Before we get started, I want to direct your attention to our supplemental slides posted on our IR website, which we will be referencing today. We're certainly living in unprecedented times with the human and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets in turmoil, and oil in the $20s due to both supply and demand challenges. We've analyzed the changing dynamics within our markets, and we've developed a strong plan and are taking decisive cost actions while maintaining and making room for continued investment to deliver double-digit earnings growth this year and over the coming years. In times such as these, I'm committed to providing even more unparalleled transparency to all of my colleagues and to you, our shareholders. Our markets are changing rapidly and parts of our business will be more challenged than others, but on a whole we're extremely fortunate that our model will be resilient. This is due in large part to our diversification across end-markets and within our end-markets, must have products and services, low revenue concentration across products and customers, annual multi-year subscriptions with high renewal rates, and 90% plus recurring revenue. We've got a CapEx light model with strong cash flow conversion, strong balance sheet, excellent liquidity, and a firm-wide culture that we've honed to drive efficiencies, profit, and continue to innovate even in challenging revenue environments. Now with offices in APAC, we learned quickly how to manage the COVID-19 situation by conducting early-on business impact reviews and ensuring that our IT infrastructure that we've been investing in could support all, I mean all of 16,000 employees working from home and remotely as needed, and we've certainly been tested on that. We're also using these challenging times as an opportunity to be even more visible with our customers and our management teams through virtual calls and webinars. We have the benefit that in this environment, our customers need to hear from us even more to help them through these kinds of uncertainty. Our experts, over 3,000 of them, are reaching thousands of our customers every single day, and we're using the current market conditions to make sure we're there for them and developing opportunities and adjusting our models to support them through these challenging times. Overall, I feel good about our business model, how we are managing the complexity of changing global conditions. I equally feel good about how we're helping our customers during these times with essential activities. Now, Jonathan is going to go over Q1 results, and then I'll go over our multi-year plan on how we're going to plan to achieve the earnings growth that we've suggested. Over to you, Jonathan. Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. Maybe we can all go on to mute there. We cannot predict with any certainty the length of disruption from COVID-19, and how long and deep the economic impacts are going to last. To account for this uncertainty, we are providing for a wider-than-usual range of 2020 outcomes based upon three scenarios that make assumptions on the macroeconomic and market-specific drivers that may impact our business over the remainder of the year, and these are laid out in the supplement. We're also taking cost actions that will allow us to deliver double-digit earnings growth, even under our worst case revenue scenario. In all three scenarios, we of course face pressure. The reality of an economic slowdown, significantly lower oil prices and CapEx impacting our Upstream Resources business, a general slowdown of new business and decision-making, a near-term shock to consumer spending impacting our auto customers as communities shut down. Now our first scenario, which is the upper end of our guidance, requires the world to settle quickly. And in this scenario, we'd expect our Q3 recovery to begin. Under the Q3 recovery scenario, this is what you would expect to see in terms of our businesses recovery; continued volatility that's driving demand for our pricing and valuation services, and then we'd see a recovery of equity issuances coming in the second half, lower oil prices driving OPEC plus to an agreement in Q3, Brent would rise to the low $30's by the year-end and we'd have an average in the upper $20's, new and used car buying impacted now in Q2 would continue and then rebound in Q3. Okay, let's look at the second scenario. Second scenario moves recovery to Q4; continued volatility drives demand for financial services solutions, a new equity issuance has been closed for most of the year. Oil markets remain uncertain, new OPEC plus agreement is delayed until the end of the year which would lead to an average price of Brent in the mid-$20's, the shutdown of auto sales in Q2 would be followed by U-shaped demand recovery with slow growth throughout the second half. Now the third scenario, which I call with my team are a worst-case scenario. Gives that the longer global recession with no recovery expected in 2020 and recovery begins in 2021. Now, I personally really believe that we've modeled here a worst-case scenario. This is a very challenged financial markets industry, our customers are under continued profit pressure through 2020, without any normal conditions returning until 2021. OPEC plus has disintegrated, there is no sign of any agreement throughout this year, and an average price of Brent will stay in the low $20's into 2021 as well. A sustained recession in the auto industry with sales of both, new and used cars impacted throughout 2020. Now for modeling exercises; my view with this transparency that we're going to be providing you with, each and every quarter and updating you against it, you can model off our worst-case scenario which we'll call the 2021 recovery scenario. We're all working hard and there's many great story that can entice you in to the Q3 and the Q4 recovery, and we'll keep those in mind as we update you regularly. But as you know, we've managed IHS Markit since merger very prudently, and we are going to base our cost assumptions and our cost measures against our worst case scenario in order to provide downside protection, to be able to deliver strong profitability regardless of our revenue outcome, and we've already put in process more than $250 million of 2020 costs. Many of these costs, a minimum of $50 million are modeled as permanent cost reductions going forward. There is also a variable portion of costs that we now have levers in place that as revenue recovers we'll be able to bring those costs back to normal levels. I'll give you some examples of the efforts that my team and colleagues have been making globally to deliver this robust financial plan. Now, of course the variable costs that adjust with revenue, especially within the Autos business are natural levers, those are in place. Last night, my Board, myself, approved a set of executive salary cuts for my top 300 people. And the Board is also equally considering for a next Board meeting in April, a reduction. Cash bonuses will be curtailed, workforce reductions, travel and entertainment, non-critical projects, contractor spend, and a freeze on both new and replacement hiring, we're also optimizing facilities and lease negotiations, reduction in purchase expenses also being optimized. In addition to providing double-digit earnings growth in a challenging environment, these cost reductions now are allowing us to maintain investments in each and every one of our segments at the levels we were investing at. No investments have been cut around our alternatives business, our auto enterprise Mastermind product, which the Mastermind team had a whopping 36% first quarter, really great performance in recovery. Our initiatives around climate, and regardless of this current environment, the challenges of climate globally are not going away and IHS Markit will be prepared to build those services as we look forward into 2021 and beyond. And then finally, our team working on a new asset management platform that will bring efficiencies in technology and operations to the asset management industry will still be fully invested. Next, we've been investing in our data lakes, teams and people from working globally to transform our technology stack, to be able to offer new and exciting services to our customers that are already taken shape, underway and revenue in the pipeline. Our investment in our transformation to the cloud will carry on fully. All of this is provided for within the plans presented in each of the three scenarios, as well as in the 2021 and 2022 guidance as you see us returning to growth. Now, let me provide you some color on how the current uncertainty may impact each of our different segments so you can understand the levers we're dealing with and equally gain confidence in the plan that we're providing you. Let's start with resources. We know the price of oil is under pressure from the largest disruption of global industry demand. With increasing supply, our scenarios are going to assume an average global CapEx reduction of roughly 30% in 2020 and further 15% in 2021. Now, with the bulk of the cut to North America, this will impact our upstream business, and remember our upstream business is now only 60% of resources revenue. Remember, our upstream revenue is broken into three parts; data, analytics and our insights businesses. We expect the largest negative impact to be on our data business followed by analytics, but our insights business includes market forecast, analysis; the insight business has held up very well during the last downturn, and we expect even better this time as the financial market, corporations, governments are all calling on us to provide information and scenarios to manage them through this difficult environment. We're well diversified this time; super majors, national oil companies, large, mid-sized, and small independent E&P companies. There is and going to be the most pressure among our small independents. The small independents make up only a $100 million of our upstream revenue and reside within North America, and they're mostly customers of our data and analytics offerings, and where they are stronger are still drawing on our insights to help them with their decision-making through this tough period. Moving to our downstream business; now 40% of our resources revenue and very well diversified chemicals, power, gas, renewables, agriculture and our OPIS business -- we expect these businesses to continue to produce regular growth as the customer base is very diversified and mostly non-E&P customers, in fact. Now, the E&P industry is going to remain under pressure in the coming quarters. But as a company, we're so much better positioned than the company that entered 2015. Here are some of the reasons; our resources business, as I said, is more balanced, our fast growing downstream businesses are now 40%, they were only 15% back in 2014. Upstream revenue is only 15% of our total company versus 35% back then. International data cancellations which led the decline in revenue the last time are much lower as large independents are mainly operating in the U.S. today. Our team's been through this before, they've got the playbook and we're operating with much better data and analytics due to all the investments we've made post-merger in systems to help support us. Given all of this, we expect our resources segment's organic growth to be positive low-single digits to negative low-single digits, adjusted for the events -- the one-time events cancellation in 2020. Okay, let's go to Transportation. Included in Q1, which was absolutely stellar and I really want to congratulate the team for the results that they delivered, we've been delivering and performing at a very high level with double-digit organic revenue growth in 10 of the past 11 quarters. Now, in the current environment, our Transportation business will experience headwinds and this is discussed in our scenarios. As regions around the world enact stay at home policies to deal with the virus, it's easy to know that consumers are not out buying cars. We saw this in China during their shutdown period and we're now seeing a slow recovery. The dynamic is now beginning in North America. And traffic to dealerships will continue to decline significantly and put tremendous profit pressure on our dealer customers. We do believe this is an unprecedented short-term impact to the dealerships and not representative of how the industry would perform during the normal cyclical downturn. The range of the outcomes tied to our three scenarios is wide and growth for this segment should be between positive low-single digits to negative mid-single digits. Let's move to Financial Services, which also performed exceptionally well in Q1 and have done over the past three years, just fueled by product innovation, market penetration, diversification and a very strong team. We now expect organic growth in the mid-single digits and here is what we're assuming. So you're going to have stable revenue across information. This is due to the high recurring revenue and all of these products are must haves and even more so in these volatile environments. Our valuations are in full demand, corporate actions, corporate Services, all very much needed with potential growth in demand in the coming quarters. Now, Processing, which has been a challenging segment of course, is processing derivatives and secondary loan markets but two-thirds of it is derivative processing and the volumes and of course the ticket sizes are lower and the volumes are higher due to the volatility and we'll see some tailwinds there through the coming quarters. We also expect though, some weakness within solutions. It's going to be due to longer software sales cycles, lower volumes in some of the Issuer Services business. We expect lower volumes through Q2 for our equities, bonds and municipals, which combined are about $70 million of our annual variable revenue. In our best scenario, we start to see some improvements early in the second half with no improvement in our worst-case scenarios through to 2021. Now, finally within CMS and it's great to see CMS coming through and supporting us in this challenging time, but here our hard work is paying off. We see steady demand for our product design offerings, continued demand for our economic and country risk [ph] offerings where we provide knowledge and insights into the challenges across over 200 countries. And our health sciences team is being called on as well for advice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our customers need increased support in a rapidly changing world and we expect organic growth in CMS to be in the low single digits. Now, I'm going to turn the call back to Jonathan, who will provide details on the 2020 guidance. Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. As our supplemental slide layout, our cost cutting actions are going to anchor our 2020 earnings to double-digit growth, regardless of which revenue scenario unfolds in the coming quarters. We're not providing formal guidance for 2021 and '22 but based upon our scenarios and cost actions, we would expect in each of those forward years, organic revenue growth to return to our longer-term range of 5% to 7%, adjusted EPS growth of double-digits and as we move through the year, we'll update you on our progress with our cost actions and the conditions within our end markets against our scenarios. Now, finally, I want to thank all of my colleagues around the world who have been working tirelessly to manage the rapidly changing dynamics within our markets, local communities and to continue to serve our customers. And to you, our shareholders, I want to thank you for your support and give you my commitment of this unparalleled level of transparency in our progress against our multi-year plan during these uncertain times and my commitment will be to continue to update you against scenario one, two, and three, our worst case scenario, and project those into 2021 and '22 and show any adjustments needed on a quarterly basis. Now, with that, operator, we're ready for questions. Right. So, I guess, if you have to look at the numbers, how I've worked in with the team, the first thing that I wanted to do with the team is make sure that the decisive nature of our response is early and protects us through our worst case scenario and then sets us up very well for the recovery, but also its protection, given the variable nature of some of those cost returns can protect us indefinitely looking forward. If you want to ask me about my probabilities on scenarios one, two, three, my view is, is that the scenario one with 4% organic growth is my lowest probability scenario, and I'd say that's a 10% chance that we're able to deliver that scenario. That depends on the recovery time, but also it will depend on some of the new revenue initiatives that are in place and the demands on some of our existing services that have some silver linings in difficult periods. So, let's put a 10% or maximum 15% on that scenario. I'd also say that our scenario two, with a recovery going into the end of the year probably has a similar probability on it of 10% to 15%. And so therefore, what really made me focus on our worst case scenario, which I really do believe at a 95% confidence level is more than enough to protect us through all the environments that I'm looking at in terms of the modeling today with my team. And I really wanted to put that out on the table to eliminate a lot of the shareholders' fears about the what-ifs. So when we come back next quarter in Q2, I'll update you on those costs and I'll share with you the total revenue impacts and how we're tracking against each of those scenarios. And I think with that color, Gary, we'll be well-positioned to manage through this year but also will give us a great base level to start 2021. Next question? Good. We're all on virtual, so we're having to give each other a hand signal to see who is going to take your tough questions. Okay. Well, I've got all my leadership team on here virtually Brian, Edouard, Adam, and Jonathan. So, I'll pass that to Brian who's worked up his models and he can answer that question directly. Brian? Good. Thanks, Brian. Jonathan, you wanted to add to that? Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Okay. So, the numbers are for the full year, and I have Edouard Tavernier on, and he'll give you a bit of color on the Automotive and Maritime segment. Thanks, Edouard. Next question? Yes, I wish -- I'll let Adam speak in a moment, but I couldn't have a more conservative leadership team and every time I say the derivatives volumes that we're starting to see here, we should see that through the rest of the year, they put them back to flat. So in the models that we're showing you there is a modicum of upside in terms of processing. So there is really the real bet is that we maintain our current business. We have a really strong pipeline and the financial markets are maintaining the need for the information, the rollout of new regulations and the demand incrementally for second and third pricing services through this volatile period. And we saw something similar in '08 and we're seeing some of that now. We have modeled out though that other pieces of demand of course will decline. And Adam, why don't you give like Brian and Edouard have done, just a bit of color on Financial Services in a bit more detail. Thanks, Adam. Next question? Okay. I'll pass that to Jonathan first and then he can pass it to Brian, if necessary. Excellent. Thank you. Next question? Yes. Okay, I'll start and then I'll pass to Jonathan. So we, we completed the $500 million ASR. We started a $250 million ASRs, that's been going through the quarter, which will be completed probably sometime in April. We have a -- halted any further ASRs until we see better sight into the forward marketplace. In our modeling looking forward into next year and the following year with the return to growth, we modeled in about a $1 billion of buybacks in each of those years and we're not going to draw down on our liquidity lines. We've got a diversified bank group that's strong and we've talked to them all and we don't see a need to draw down on those bank lines. So that's what I'd say. Jonathan, add to that? Thank you. Next question? Right. So I guess, I look at our 2019 performance -- I look at our Q1 performance, I look at the investments we're making in incremental growth in well-demanded areas, and I look at a lot of our must have services across all of our divisions, and even the investments made to put CMS on a stronger footing. I really felt a lot of confidence going into this year of our 5% to 7% and having ample opportunity to be in that range and even at the top of that range. As we look at this year, Andrew, this is an unparalleled situation, and I think what I've said since merger is that we were in a good position to be able to manage this company, expand margin and provide double-digit earnings growth, even if we fell down to a 4% ongoing organic revenue growth. And in this case, even in our worst-case scenario as we fall down to 1% growth combination of strong decisions by my team as well as putting us in a strong position next year, you can see that we got those levers to manage the company well. So going to your next question, which is on that 6%, a lot of what we do is multi-year recurring revenue must have. The variable portion of our business is quite low. We're very diversified across customers and very diversified in all divisions across products. I'm not assuming that the recovery, the COVID-19 pandemic playing into that global recession continues on right through '21. But if that's the scenario that you would like to put into our model, then I would suggest that you see a 2% to 4% revenue growth in '21 with a long protracted recession and you'll see us maintain the variable cost that we're showing in our model in the supplementals to be rolling back in as staying out and you'll continue to see margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth as we navigate some of the tough challenges ahead of us. But we've got a resilient model that can respond differently than many of our peers and customers. And I think the team has really put in the efforts in the tough decisions now that are going to ensure that if your scenario, if that's what it is, of a protracted recession into 2021 and beyond, we've already put the cost management in place to be able to manage that and the variable cost would stay out, of course, the revenue would come down and hopefully some of the newer initiatives around climate, around asset management, cost reduction platforms in place around our alternatives business that we expect will be still a key part of future financial markets and of course, dealers trying to return to sales will meet us for their incentives planning, advertising, building audiences, and I have to say, I feel very committed to that forward plan and I'm very confident that even if we do go into a protracted revenue lower than the 6% at a lower single-digit level, we can manage the Company and deliver exceptional results. Thank you. Next question? Right, that's a good question. Well -- so to me, there's two pieces of these cost take-outs. One piece of them are permanent take-outs, so as we described that's about $50 million. The second piece of this is a variable cost takeout that we'll need to return with the revenue, but they are scaled against that return to profitability. So, we have a big cost base, $4.5 billion of revenues and more than $2.5 billion of costs. So we've got a big cost base. So to take $50 million out in terms of fixed means that we've had to dig deep and look at things that are some nice to haves, things that we're working on that weren't revenue based initiatives but maybe were you know an expansion of an office, maybe they were some of the nice to haves. We have around a lot of the social activities in the firm, things around higher priced contractors that we might have been using to accelerate our growth, which in this environment, we will look to move to our better-cost locations and bring back in-house. So we're ready for that return to growth. So about $50 million, which is a couple of percent of our overall cost base that we've taken out permanently. The rest is variable. So what is that variable? Travel and entertainment. It's the salary cuts that I led with my executive team. It's our forward events calendar, which will be -- will come back slowly over time. It's our -- some of the things around our revenue that's tied -- that has a tied cost base so marketing expense that we use is CARFAX to support used car listings that will be off. So, we -- there is a bunch that are variable and they'll just come back in naturally and we've modeled those in for you so you could see how that works. But we have taken out $50 million fixed. I forgot also some of the purchased expenses, we've already renegotiated. We put in some -- we've got 130 offices. There were several million around leases that we've either extended now at lower prices or actually decided to eliminate and carry on with a work from home strategy going forward. So we've -- I think the team has done a great job on that and I'm not worried about the $50 million and I like the variable nature of the other costs because, as Andrew asked in the previous question, it gives me the levers to protect earnings if the revenue is slower than planned. Jonathan, do you want to add some to that? Good. Thanks, Jonathan. And that probably last point was the most important is, we've got kind of four great long-term growth levers that further diversify us and take us to new levels. And we're quite pleased to be able to announce that to our teams that we wouldn't be cutting any of those initiatives whatsoever in the forward plans because they are important to that -- our future. The other thing that I think is important on the cost side is that we really made a decision around enhanced severance and focus on any workforce reductions to ensure that nobody is sent home with less than a year of continuance in terms of their compensation through this tough period. And again, that's an important leadership decision that my teams collectively made. Next question? Yes. Honestly, the way I've produced this guidance for you guys now in these scenarios, I don't really -- to me, it's a low single-digit probability to not hit that double-digit earnings growth in 2020 and 2021. Next question? No, not at all. Actually, if I look at all of our teams, they do a great job expanding margin each year. One thing you should know about our margin expansion, a lot of it has come through our attrition and then replacing attrition in near and offshore locations, which have substantive gains for our operational development testing and other roles. So we've got 16,000 people, about 4,000 of them are in better cost of living locations and that gives us more than probably 100,000 per person fully costed [ph]. So we've been doing that naturally, and the teams have been expanding staff but reducing costs and adding margin by leveraging our footprint, which is now very well developed. And so a lot of what we're doing here across the whole firm is accelerating some of those initiatives, and that means we've got to look at everything across the firm, whether it's, finance, HR, tech, development, whether it's product people and product development folks. We really have to leverage that footprint globally and that's across the whole firm. Brian's already running a lean, mean Energy team which do a great job and our view is the diversification there across Upstream, Midstream and Downstream gives us ample opportunity to deliver great results for the firm. It's actually quite interesting, when you actually look at what's happening to us through this period as we gave you a worst-case scenario actually, the worst-case scenario is being driven by our best performing division which is Automotive, because they have the variability around the used car and the Listings businesses around CARFAX and CARFAX Canada. So here we are in an environment where everybody is worried about our energy market performance. But the energy market performance would have been completely absorbed in the outperformance of financial markets, CMS and automotive but it's the combination of this worst-case scenario that puts us in a place where the cost initiatives are, I think, prudent because they put us in a very flexible position for 2020 profit delivery but also with a variable return of expenses. We're now actually well-positioned for 2021 and 2022 and I just really felt it was important to give you guys our models, which I don't think is going to be the norm across companies out there, but we basically shared with you my planning tool, how I'm managing the company, and I'm going to update you on that every quarter. And as far -- since merger we, I guess, besides one little blip, we've never missed a single number we've given to you. So don't expect us to do that going forward. We plan to hit these numbers and hopefully be able to surprise. Okay, next question? Right, so it's very interesting. That's a great question and probably one that takes us a little bit away from the script and the call, but at the same time, you can see how a recovery can happen. So started in China, we sent -- everybody was sent home, working from home, we're testing our systems. We're learning about the challenges of not being able to travel into a region, trying to complete deals, close deals and make things happen. Today, our people are mostly back in the offices and they managed this through a very serious use of social distancing, hands washing, use a mask. People that don't wear the masks are shunned at in Asia and the ones that weak them are respected. We have the opposite problem here in the UK, and I think you have it in North America. People get a funny look if they're wearing a mask as if they're the challenge and the ones that don't wear the mask are going to prolong the recovery. So in Asia we've had -- we had China recover first. Hong Kong now, our office is back and running. But again, people are very careful about their social distances and cleanliness in terms of masks and hands but they're back working together. Actually sales and our pipeline is actually quite strong, a bunch of new pipelines, orders and businesses coming from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore. If anything, it gives you a lot of hope for our scenario one but actually, I think with such a democratic society in Europe and North America, I actually think that I can't bet on the Q3 recovery and therefore I wanted to share with you a Q4 and even a full year lack of recovery. But if we followed the Asian path you would quickly go to our Q3 recovery and say, yes, you got it right. And you do, you know as well as I do that, that when I talk to many people, including the U.S. President and online last night is we want to get back to work quick and soon. And not that I necessarily believe that that's the reality, but there are still many people that don't think that staying at home and staying out of danger is going to be a way to get to a recovery and get to the other side. So here we are. You've got a Q3 optimistic view that follows the Asia path and it follows probably what I'm starting to hear out of Italy. Although you see big numbers in Italy, when I talk to colleagues and others in Milan, I start to see that people are starting to see some optimism in the control. If you don't believe that, push to the Q4 recovery. And if you don't believe that, go to our worst case scenario, lever your models off of that, bet on the earnings that I'm showing you and then you have to decide the recovery. But what's nice about the recovery, if we don't hit the revenue, our costs are now variable, rolling back in and we'll protect earnings. And I've got lots of levers for growth. When the right opportunity comes, but right now I want to make sure I keep the company strong, be able to pay all our people well, protect our liquidity and deliver great results for you guys. Next question? Yes. Well, as you've seen in all scenarios this year, you'll have in excess of that margin. And, if you look forward into '21 and '22, we also forecast a continuation of the 100 basis points. So our view is, even though we're going to have a strong outperformance, we still have ample scope for our organizational design that we've been working on and we expect that to continue into the future. So my perspective, the margin story and the earnings story is really strong; this is a story about revenues that are going to come off at some unknown level. And so therefore, we need to set a set of cost reductions in place that will be constructed to never return, and to come back and return on a variable basis with the revenue. So I feel we've got a perfect model set up for the go-forward. What I would say on the permanent reductions, the $50 million that we talked about, we are already in full execution mode, and I'd expect those to have a 8-month impact for this year. I'll pass in full impact for next year. Jonathan? Next question? That's exactly how we think about it. But again, if you model off of that worst case scenario, we're saying, you know, you don't have any of that recovery until next year. But our view is that bounces back very quickly, we've got a super strong model. And maybe Edouard wants to add some additional color to that. Excellent. Thank you. Next question? I'll pass it to Brian in a second. But clearly, in our worst case scenario, we see the smaller independents really struggling, potential mergers, potential failures to pay potential bankruptcies; so therefore, I think we -- it's $100 million of all of that revenue, and we definitely -- you know, I think modeled appropriately for that piece of the puzzle. We do see Shell came out with their announcements and you can see that CapEx will be curtailed. We put actually a 30% followed by a further 15% cut on CapEx which we think is significant. Given the -- you know, there is going to be a built up; obviously, supply -- that needs to get tuned through in the future, but ultimately, there is a -- still a robust demand for product, still longer term and that needs to be brought out of the ground. So, I think our model is fairly robust. And Brian, maybe want to add some additional color on that? Thanks, Brian. Our next question? Yes. No, that's -- that's a good question. I've never been -- I have to say, I've never been celebrator of work-from-home. And so, I'm learning my lessons here the proper way. But actually what's funny is, your productivity working from home without interruptions is actually substantively improved for many -- for others that have challenges in terms of children, family, etcetera, in that work-from-home environment that becomes something that you have to work with. But I found productivity for myself has improved and my connection with people have been substantive, and -- so I'm actually very pleased. And if anything, it's made me rethink some of those policies and flexibilities that many companies would like to have. We also have put in -- we've been an early, we're in the middle post the Asian move, we started to look at the workplace analytics tools, and tools that measure productivity; so we actually have some early POCs [ph]. And I think what we can see is, productivity at home is pretty damn high, and people are working very hard, and our pipelines and results are showing that. On developers and people working on projects; you know, most of our developers sit side by side with headphones on and are in their own focused world doing their jobs, and they're quite happy to not have to commute and be able to focus on the work at hand. We have some professional services people that actually have to go on site with our customers, and of course, this is curtailed. And so we've put in for slower implementation of some of those activities, but a lot of times the customer's virtual acceptance has actually increased. And again, it's very focused. So decision-making is happening effectively. So, for a non-believer in work-from-home, I've become a believer, I find that I'm working more hours sitting here at my dining room table than I care to admit. And really, my colleagues around the world have been impressive, and I have to say that they're holding up the fort very well. But let's hope we get some social interaction back in our lives again soon. Next question? Okay. And just before -- just before you go Eric, I just really want to say to all of our shareholders that all of you represent and the shareholders that are on the phone; you know, for us, it was a big decision in terms of opening it up to transparency in this detail, as well as giving you that detail into 2021 and 2022. But I did feel that in times like this, making decisions day-to-day you're entrusted to invest people's money, and you need to make sure that you don't have to second guess what's happening in the companies you're investing in. So this level of transparency will be updated every single quarter until we feel we're back to a normal situation. When we get back to the normal situation, I ask that you accept that I'll turn that light bulb off and go back to managing the company, how we always did, and hopefully, if your trust in both, myself and my management team will remain at the highest of levels. And thank you for your support. Eric?"

            "content": "Great. Thank you, Lance. Q1 results were indeed very, very strong. It included revenue of $1.08 billion, organic growth of 6%, and total revenue growth of 3%. We delivered net income of $484 million and a GAAP EPS of $1.20, adjusted EBITDA of $432 million, which is an increase of 8% normalized for the AD&S divestiture and a margin of 39.9%. And we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.66, which is an increase of $0.07 or 12% normalized for the AD&S divestiture. Regarding revenue, our Q1 organic revenue growth of 6% included strong recurring organic growth of 7% and non-recurring organic decline of 5%. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by a tough year-on-year comp in financial services. Moving on to segment performance; our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 7%, including 9% recurring in the quarter. All three subsegments delivered strong performances. Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 9% in the quarter. This included an excellent 12% recurring revenue growth and a decline of 1% in non-recurring, driven by the expected decline of one time in our auto business. We saw exceptional operational metrics, in particular from our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind business lines. Our Resources segment delivered 1% organic growth, which is broken down as 1% recurring growth and 2% non-recurring growth. Our Q1 organic ACV increased by $3 million, and our trailing 12-month organic ACV remained up $24 million or 3%. Our CMS segment delivered 3% total growth, including 1% recurring and a 15% growth in non-recurring. Our CMS total organic growth normalized from prior year RootMetrics customer loss was an impressive 4%. Turning now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was $432 million, which is up $24 million or 8% versus prior-year normalized for AD&S divestiture. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.9%, which is up 90 bps. Segment margins were in line with our expectations. The adjusted EPS was $0.66 per diluted share, which is a $0.07 or 12% improvement normalized for the divestiture. Adjusted EPS also excludes the one-time gain on the sale of AD&S of $372 million. Our GAAP tax rate was 1% and our adjusted tax rate was 17%. Q1 free cash flow was $117 million. As is typical, Q1 cash was seasonally low due to bonus payments. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $966 million and represented a conversion rate of 54%. Now just a reminder, our trailing 12-month conversion rates were impacted by the one-time tax payments that we had in Q4 2019. Turning to the balance sheet, our Q1 ending balance was $5.2 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.9 times on a bank covenant basis, which is in line with our capital policy. We closed the quarter with $144 million of cash, and our Q1 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $925 million and represents a great liquidity position. Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 404 million shares. We repurchased $610 million of shares in the quarter, including completing our $500 million ASR. We also launched a $250 million ASR on March 1. And now Lance, I'll pass it back to you. That's great. Thank you, Lance. Now relative to our original guidance, as a reminder, we previously announced the cancellation of events due to the COVID-19 health concerns. Again, as a reminder, these cancellations will negatively impact Q2 revenue by $50 million and adjusted EPS by $0.09. Approximately $40 million of the revenue impact relates to the Resources segment due to the cancellation of our CERAWeek and CHEMWeek [ph] events. The remaining $10 million relates to our Transportation segment due to the cancellation of our TPM Maritime and other events. We have also adjusted for the change in foreign currency exchange rates since the beginning of the year, causing a negative FX impact on revenue of approximately $25 million. In terms of our forward view for 2020, as Lance stated, due to the uncertainty we have developed three scenarios to take into account different assumptions on how the virus, the price of oil, and economic situations evolve over the next few months and quarters. Our supplemental schedules detail the three scenarios with the following ranges; revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.425 billion; organic growth of between 1% and 4% normalized for the impact of the Q2 events; adjusted EBITDA of $1.825 billion to $1.85 billion; and adjusted EPS of $2.76 to $2.81. As Lance mentioned, we would direct your estimate to the lower end of these ranges at this time. Now in terms of cost actions, we are in the process of executing approximately $250 million of 2020 costs. We do expect approximately $50 million of these costs to be permanent go forward reductions. The variable portion of costs will return as revenue recovers in our Auto businesses and salaries return to normal level in 2021 and 2022. Finally, we expect cash conversion of approximately 50% due to one-time costs with our cost reduction efforts and working capital delays due to market conditions. All guidance items below adjusted EBITDA are unchanged from prior guidance except for stock-based comp. Our original guidance range call for a full year stock-based comp expense of $220 million to $225 million. We now expect full year stock-based comp expense to be approximately $30 million higher than our original guidance due to higher employer taxes from the U.K. National Insurance expense on 2020 option exercises. This represents a one-time increase in our GAAP stock-based comp expenses in 2020 and will not impact our 2021 expense level. In terms of capital allocation, given the current market conditions, we are focused on maintaining high levels of liquidity and capital structure flexibility. We do plan to pause share buybacks and plan to maximize our capacity under our bank credit facility. However, the cash dividend we initiated and paid in Q1 will continue as planned. We maintain a very healthy and strong balance sheet, investor-grade rating, a well-positioned debt maturity ladder and a strong diversified bank group. While there will negative impacts from the current external challenges, we do have a model that can absorb the risk in this environment, yet still deliver solid earnings growth. And with that Lance, I'll turn the call back to you. Yes, I was going to give you the numbers, Bill. So, as I mentioned, the Q1 organic ACV increased by $3 million and the trailing 12-month organic ACV is up $24 million or 3%. Sure. Just a couple of comments on kind of where we are in the cycle and emphasize some things that Lance says in his earlier comments. First of all, Q4 and Q1 are our heavier renewals type of periods. So you kind of gotten through those two periods, which obviously is helpful. The second thing and I'll compliment Brian and the team. They've done an excellent job of going through customer-by-customer, understanding their position, where they are in the renewal cycle and also where they are in the oil patch and identifying where we see potential risk really at a customer-by-customer level. So again, I think we have far greater transparency for analytics and control kind of where we are in this cycle. Brian, anything you want to add? Yes, well, that actually covered very, very well. And the thing I'll again amplify to this, we have a very, very strong bank group, over 20 banks in that group, Atlanta [ph], we've spoken to everyone. We really frankly don't have a need to draw down a bit. So we don't have any plans at this point to do it. But again, we certainly have the liquidity there should we choose to in the future. Sure, that is a great summary, Lance. One thing I would add is that the part of our business, which is being most affected in this scenario here is our automotive business, particularly our support for marketing efforts for both used and new cars. And that happens to be the part of our business that has the most variable cost that flexes up and down with revenue. So there is a natural and significant flex down that comes naturally. As our dealers need less traffic, as their shops are closed. If it comes back down, they will naturally come back up. So I think the key thing that we've all done as the executive team and management team has done here, we've been very focused. And as Lance mentioned in his opening remarks, we still are investing in the key growth levers and drivers that will take us into the growth in '21 and beyond. Great. I'll just echo what you said Lance. And George, what we're seeing is, even in our worst case scenario we expect to see a couple of hundred bips of improvements from 2019 to 2020, and then continue to have 100 bips all the way through to 2022; so we're no way backing off on margins improvement commitment."

I mean, the segments that we model it for are really just the Data Business, and mostly we've taken it by customer. We've really drilled into it. And so, we're really focused on the drilling segment of our customer base. So, that coupled with saying towards the future, our -- we've taken down our projections on new sales early into that segment. But the nice thing is, as Lance said earlier, the business is a lot more diversified now. We're seeing a lot of strength still in our downstream businesses which are growing high-single digits. No, the only thing I'll add is coming out of the last downturn, we did focus on multi-year agreement. So we have increased our percentage. So we feel pretty good about where we are in those and we continue to sell those as well. Yes, I think so. You know, obviously, CapEx goes down further certainly in the US and it does overseas. But I -- you know, the thing that actually helps us out is some of the oil is hedged in the US, so those small independence will stay around and try to weather the storm. So, I think -- you know, while CapEx will actually accelerate and will decelerate in that area, these companies -- you know, it's not oil goes down to $20 and these guys go out of business; so there will be a lag before we start to see curation [ph]."

So, in terms of color, as we've said historically, our business is resilient to what I would call cyclical downturns. But this, as Lance said, is not a normal cyclical downturn. And as we worked with many retailers across the U.S. and Canada, we are seeing first-hand the impact of communities shutting down on automotive retail. So, our dealer partners are hurting, they're hit by an unprecedented consumer demand shock. And as you know, we are seeing an increasing number of states that are issuing stay at home mandates or where entire communities are shutting down. In these conditions, dealers may no longer be able to sell vehicles. Some of them have had to close temporarily. Others have seen a dramatic decline in their revenues. So, as our Q1 earnings showed, we are incredibly well positioned to support the industry going forward, and we look forward to expanding our long-term partnership with North American automotive dealers. However, in the short term, our business is being impacted by depressed levels of new business, increased levels of cancellations, and in some cases temporary price concessions to dealer partners during the month of May they we are no longer able to operate their business in normal conditions. In terms of car makers and suppliers, the entire supply chain is facing challenges in the face of COVID-19 disruption, and we continue to be very well-positioned to help them through this crisis, including helping them manage disruptions in their supply chains. No, I think you're spot on, Lance. Obviously, the sector is very, very responsive to consumer demand. So it will take the bigger hits right now in Q2. We've seen activity levels declined precipitously in the past two weeks and but obviously, we think this sector will rebound before the other because as soon as consumers will back into dealership logs, our dealer customers, our dealer partners will require our tools and solutions, so absolutely."

I’d like to inform you that this call is being recorded for broadcast. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Chip Merritt, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\nChip Merritt: Thank you for joining today’s S&P Global fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. Presenting on today’s call are Doug Peterson, President and CEO; and Ewout Steenbergen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a news release with our results earlier today. If you need a copy of the release and financial schedules, they can be downloaded at investor.spglobal.com. Before we begin, I need to provide certain cautionary remarks about forward-looking statements. Except for historical information, the matters discussed in today’s conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, estimates and descriptions of future events. Any such statements are based on current expectations and current economic conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. In this regard, we direct listeners to the cautionary statements contained in our Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs and other periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, as announced late in 2020, S&P Global and IHS Markit entered into a definitive merger agreement. In March last year, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. The merger is pending regulatory approval and we currently expect to close this quarter. This call will touch on the merger, but does not constitute and offer a sell or buy or the solicitation of any offer to buy or sell any securities nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities law of any such jurisdiction. No offering of securities shall be made except by means of prospectus meeting requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933. In connection with the proposed transaction, S&P Global and IHS Markit have filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a joint proxy statement and a prospectus. S&P Global and IHS Markit have filed other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC. Investors and security holders of S&P Global or IHS Markit stock are urged to carefully read the entire registration statement and joint proxy statement and prospectus, which are available on our website and sec.gov. In today’s earnings release and during the conference call, we are providing adjusted financial information. This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation’s operating performance between periods and to view the corporation’s business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release and the slides contain exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This call, especially discussion of our outlook, contains statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in our filings with the SEC and on our website. I would also like to call your attention to a European regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should give me a call to better understand the impact of this legislation on the investor and potentially the company. We are aware that we do have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to Ola Fadahunsi at 212-438-2296. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Chip. Welcome to everyone joining today’s earnings call. The first thing I’d like to do is thank our people at S&P Global for their dedication and commitment throughout 2021. We have asked a lot of our people this year as they do their day jobs, while also preparing for the expected merger with IHS Markit and all the while dealing with the uncertainty of the pandemic. So on behalf of the Board and our management team, thank you. Now, let me turn to the key financial achievements in 2021. S&P Global delivered 12% organic revenue growth and 17% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. All four businesses contributed with growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit margin. This is quite an achievement following the remarkable results of 2020. We generated $3.5 billion of free cash flow, excluding certain items and returned $743 million in dividends. In addition to the very strong financial results, we made significant progress on our key initiatives as well. Clearly, the most important initiative of the year has been on preparation for the merger and the multiple rounds of synergy validation. Upon closing of the merger, we are well prepared to rapidly begin operating as one company and to begin to realize both the cost and revenue synergies we have already outlined to you. In fact, on a run-rate basis, we have already achieved pre-realized synergies of $25 million by the end of 2021. Also, after the merger is completed, we will host a post-merger investor call to provide an update on the merged company strategy, business segment details, synergies, investment programs, share repurchase plans, and guidance. The other key initiatives achieved in 2021 include the rapid progress achieved on our 2020 multiyear productivity program, numerous new product launches and expanded product capabilities resulting from our strategic investment initiatives, the creation of Sustainable1 to manage and drive significant expansion in coordination with ESG product offerings across the company; the launch of S&P Platts Dimensions Pro, a fully integrated user experience connecting pricing, market commentary, news and analytics with special emphasis on energy transition; and continued progress in China with one example being the issuance of 57 domestic ratings in China, up over 150% from 2020. This included the first dual-rated bond. I will provide more detail on many of these items in today’s call. These are the strategic initiatives that we shared with you on our fourth quarter earnings call last year. We made great strides in each of these items and we will remark in more detail on many of them today. To recap the financial results for the full year, organic revenue increased 12% to $8.3 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 15%. Our adjusted operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 55.2%. And we delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. It’s important to note that adjusted EPS of $13.70 far exceeded our original 2021 guidance of $12.25 to $12.45 and that the adjusted operating profit margin of 55.2% far exceeded our original guidance of 53.8% to 54.3%. Much of this was due to unexpected outperformance in ratings following what was a very strong 2020. Ewout will review our fourth quarter financial performance in a moment. All four divisions delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit improvement. The largest revenue gain was the 16% in Indices. After several years of elevated investment spending, Market Intelligence delivered the largest adjusted operating profit margin increase with a gain of 190 basis points. It’s important to remember that our 2021 financial results are part of a solid track record of performance. Over the past 4 years, we have posted a compound annual growth rate of 8% for revenue and we have averaged 217 basis points per year of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. And this has resulted in a nearly doubling of our adjusted diluted EPS over that timeframe. The company also continued to advance its own industry leading practices in sustainability. We issued our 10th Annual Sustainability Impact Report and 3rd Annual TCFD Report. We expanded parental leave to 26 weeks and introduced a flexible time-off policy with no prescribed maximum in all eligible jurisdictions. We established a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility tied to our published Science Based Target goals, one of the first sustainability-linked banking facilities in the U.S. Our S&P Global Foundation increased its grants by 30% to $15 million to organizations that support COVID-19 relief, diversity, economic inclusion and environmental sustainability. And our efforts have been recognized by several leading third-parties. While we continue to improve our own internal sustainability programs, we are investing in our ESG business. In 2021, we launched Sustainable1 to elevate and coordinate external ESG efforts across the company. This resulted in ESG revenue of $98 million, a 51% increase over 2020. All our key ESG products contributed to this growth. We completed 59 ESG evaluations, up 48%; 43 Green Evaluations, up 79%; 103 SAM benchmark engagements, up 36%; and we launched social and sustainability framework alignment opinions and completed 42 of them. We ended 2021 with ESG ETF AUM reaching $32.2 billion, an increase of 59% versus year end 2020. At the core of our ESG efforts are the corporate sustainability assessments. These are a key differentiator versus our competitors as they enable us to collect an enormous amount of data directly from corporations around the world. For the methodology year that ends in March, we have already increased CSA survey participation by 58% to 2,190 companies. We also enhanced ESG offerings available on Capital IQ Pro, expanded S&P Global ESG scores coverage to 11,500 companies and expanded coverage of climate risk analytics to more than 3 million physical assets such as mines, power stations and buildings. In addition to excellent commercial progress and expanded capabilities, we also launched numerous new ESG products and initiatives in 2021. While I don’t have time to delve into each one of them, let me just comment on a few. Second Party Opinions assess a transaction against a sustainable finance framework for alignment with consistent and comparable market principles and standards. Climate changes created the need to evaluate the impact of different climate-related scenarios on counterparties, investments and portfolios. To support these efforts, Market Intelligence and Oliver Wyman created Climate Credit Analytics, a climate scenario analysis and credit analytics model suite. And in December, we acquired the Climate Service. The company sells the Climanomics platform, a tool that quantifies physical climate risk for corporates, investors and governments. Kensho continues to be a driving force for productivity improvement for the company and increasingly for our customers. The key capabilities they have created are listed on this slide. Codex is an AI-powered document viewer that enables efficient navigation and extraction of relevant information from large quantities of documents. There have been over 300,000 client uses to-date. Codex is available on Capital IQ Pro. Kensho AGAVE has transformed Platts’ process for creating price assessments. The AGAVE tool, developed by engineers at Kensho and Platts, has transformed the process for creating price assessments. Platts has implemented AGAVE in 40 of 57 markets targeted. And on average, daily price assessments are completed 70 minutes faster. Internally, Kensho Link facilitated quicker data ingestion by providing automated mappings for 60 million company entities. Externally, Kensho Link was used by our customers to efficiently map 16 million of their own entities to S&P Global unique identifiers. Many of our customers have taken note of Kensho’s capabilities and we have begun monetizing Kensho Link, Kensho Scribe, RPA, data extraction and machine learning development. While the innovation we create internally is what drives much of our success, key industry trends also help. One of those is the shift into passive investing. This chart illustrates the $1.9 trillion of cumulative AUM U.S. equity flows in the past 10 years. We are a prime beneficiary of this trend. If we look at ETF AUM associated with our indices, there has been a 173% increase over the past 5 years to $2.8 trillion. We believe that this trend will continue. The increase in global issuance has been another positive trend for the company. It’s hard to believe that 2021 issuance growth of 15% exceeded 2020 issuance growth of 13% as is often the case to our pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. In 2020, global investment grade and high yield were the strongest, while in 2021 leveraged loans and structured products were the fastest growing categories. The market clearly favored leveraged loans over high yield in 2021. The bars on these charts depict leveraged loan volume which soared in 2021. The lines depict the percentage of loans that we rated, which reached new heights of 95% in the U.S. and 93% in Europe. I’d now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2022. The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this month. The total amount of global debt maturing in this study is $11 trillion over the next 5 years. This is down 3% from the $11.3 trillion highlighted in last year’s study. The chart on the right depicts the global high yield debt and leveraged loans maturing over the next 5 years. It totals $2.9 trillion, down 3% from $3 trillion in last year’s study. It appears that 2021 issuance benefited from a bit of extra pull forward. Let’s put this small decline in upcoming maturities into perspective. This chart shows total global corporate debt outstanding for the past 6 years. This increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 6%. The vast majority of this debt will get refinanced, and the pool of debt that needs to be refinanced just keeps getting larger. After exceptional issuance growth in 2020 and 2021, our Ratings Research Group anticipates that issuance will decrease 2% in 2022. The forecast calls for gains in structured, U.S. municipal and financial services issuance of 3%, 2% and 1%, respectively and a decrease in non-financials of 7%. Please note that this is an issuance forecast not a revenue forecast and it does not include leveraged loans. Now, let’s start with the latest view from our economists. They are forecasting global GDP growth of 4.2% in 2022. The global economy is in the midst of a robust, but uneven rebound from the pandemic. Demand growth is outrunning supply growth and inflation has risen quickly almost everywhere. GDP growth in the U.S. and Europe reached multi-decade highs in 2021 and have continued in 2022. Inflation has proven to be more persistent than thought and now presents a key policy challenge in the U.S. and Europe. Our economists now expect at least 3 Fed rate hikes this year starting in March. Each year, we carefully assess the external factors facing the company. This slide depicts those that we think are most important going into 2022. Probably the most important positive factors are the expectation for continued healthy economic growth, borrowing costs that remain historically low, continued AUM flows from active to passive, elevated commodity levels that help the financial stability of commodity producers and ample liquidity. The most significant negative factors are geopolitical uncertainty, sticky inflation, Central Bank rate increases and a re-pricing of equities and of course, the pandemic and supply chain disruptions remain general risks facing the global economy. Before I finish, I want to say that I’m incredibly proud of the team we have built at S&P Global and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to S&P Global. We are hopeful we will be speaking with you soon to update you on the merger. Once the merger is complete, we will immediately begin building a new company with an even brighter future. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug and welcome to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Revenue increased 12%. Adjusted corporate unallocated expense increased 38% primarily due to increased incentive compensation, higher professional fees and the timing of contributions to the S&P Global Foundation. Adjusted total expenses increased 9% and I will come back to this on the next slide. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 120 basis points. Interest expense decreased 22% primarily due to a reduction in FIN 48 interest expense accruals and adjusted diluted EPS increased 16%. Total adjusted expenses for the full year increased 7%. For the fourth quarter, they increased to 9%. The fourth quarter increase was primarily due to elevated variable expenses, including incentives, commissions and royalties as a result of strong 2021 financial performance; severance charges related to management changes in the Indices business during the quarter; increased investments in growth initiatives; increased professional fees; and the resumption of T&E spending. During the fourth quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments totaled to a net pre-tax loss of $131 million. They included $21 million for merger transaction cost primarily legal fees, $42 million for merger integration cost primarily consulting fees, retention bonuses, branding and technology integration cost; $51 million from merger costs to achieve, which will drive synergy benefits, they include lease impairments and restructuring charges; $4 million for acquisition and divestiture-related expenses; $8 million in gains from real estate sales; and $21 million in deal-related amortization. This quarter, all four segments delivered increased revenue with Indices leading the way with an 18% increase. All four segments also delivered adjusted operating profit growth with Ratings leading the way with an 18% increase. Quarterly margins were mixed, but more importantly, all four segments reported a gain in adjusted operating profit margin for the year. Each year, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we share the changes in our headcount. In 2021, headcount decreased 1% primarily for two reasons. The first is operational efficiencies. Much of the operational efficiencies were from automation. In fact, our people created 225 bots in 2021 with Market Intelligence leading the way with 167 bots. Cognitive automation and RPA generated over 600,000 hours of savings in 2021. The second is pre-realized merger synergies. Because of the pending merger, it didn’t make sense to backfill many positions when people left the company in 2021. We estimate that there were about 150 S&P Global positions left unfilled, representing pre-realized synergies of approximately $25 million by year end 2021. This year, with the formation of Sustainable1, we added this as a new category. Many of the people in Sustainable1 were previously reported in other categories. Platts was the area with the largest headcount increase at 11% due to investments in several growth projects. Market Intelligence had the largest decrease at 6% largely due to automation efficiencies and realignment to Sustainable1. Last year, we shared this slide and estimated that we would invest $100 million on growth initiatives in 2021. We ended up investing $80 million. The primary reasons for the difference were the competing priorities due to the merger and the competitive labor market. We will share our 2022 investment spending plans after the merger is completed. On our third quarter 2020 earnings call, we introduced a new $120 million productivity program to be completed over a 2 to 3-year period. I am pleased to report that only after 18 months we have already largely completed the program. There are few small procurement projects that are awaiting the close of the merger to take advantage of the increased scale of the combined company. All our productivity efforts will now be focused on achieving the merger synergies. Now, turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x. Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $217 million or 7% over the prior year period. Because the share repurchase program was suspended due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, we only returned 21% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2021. After the merger is completed, we expect to significantly ramp up share repurchases. Now, let’s turn to the division results, starting with S&P Dow Jones Indices, the segment delivered 18% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and increased exchange-rated derivative activity. Our asset-linked revenue also included the benefit of a customer underreporting true-up. In the fourth quarter, we reported a 28% increase in adjusted expenses primarily due to severance, increased incentive compensation, commissions and royalties; a 13% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 65.7%, a decrease of 280 basis points. On a trailing four-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 69.9%. S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered growth across all revenue channels this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 18% with very strong gains in ETFs and mutual funds. Exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 30%. Data and custom subscriptions increased 10%. Activity at the CBOE increased in the fourth quarter, with S&P 500 Index options activity increasing 47% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 18%. CME equity complex volume increased 15% with particular strength in E-mini S&P 500 options. Ratings reported revenue increased 12%. Adjusted expenses increased 5% primarily due to increased incentive compensation, wages and outside services. This resulted in an 18% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 300 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 180 basis points to 64.2%. Non-transaction revenue increased 7% primarily due to fees associated with CRISIL, new entity credit ratings and surveillance, partly offset by lower Rating Evaluation Service. As an aside, we added over 1,000 new entity credit ratings in 2021. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to strength in investment-grade corporate bonds, bank loans and structured products. This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 14% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 5%, structured finance increased 32%, governments decreased 11%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. On the right side of this slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured products. The largest change was in CLOs, which increased 43%. Turning to Platts, revenue increased 12% or $26 million, including a $4 million commercial settlement. Approximately 14% of this growth was from new products. Core subscriptions increased 10%, and Global Trading Services increased 13%. The gains in GTS revenue were mainly from higher petroleum and iron ore volumes. Adjusted expenses increased 16% primarily due to increased commissions, growth investments, cost of sales and incentives. Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 50.1%. The trailing four-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 55.1%. Platts delivered excellent revenue growth in every category with notable increases in natural gas, power and renewables and petrochemicals. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 8% or $42 million, with 34% of the growth coming from new products. Usage of our key market platforms increased 4% year-over-year, while year-ending active users increased 13% to 299,000 users. Adjusted expenses increased 5% due to increased cloud hosting initiatives, royalties, incentives and commissions. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 15%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 32.7%. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 34.3%. Looking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 6%. During 2021, Market Intelligence rebranded its premier platform offering as Capital IQ Pro. The Capital IQ Pro platform combines the best of Capital IQ and SNL desktops with broad public fundamentals and deep industry data. In addition, the platform offers greater visibility into private companies and private markets as well as regulatory, supply chain, climate data and analytics and ESG scores. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 11%, and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. Due to the pending merger, the company will not provide guidance for 2022 at this time but will provide 2022 guidance for the combined company after the merger is completed. We continue to expect the merger to close this quarter. In addition to the slides that we have reviewed on this call, there are additional slides in an appendix that can be downloaded from the Investor Presentations section of the Investor Relations website. In conclusion, 2021 was a noteworthy year for S&P Global. We delivered strong financial results, realized significant growth, made considerable progress on merger preparation and synergy validation and launched multiple innovative new products across the company, including our Sustainable1 product offerings. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.\nChip Merritt: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. With respect to the merger with IHS Markit, can you elaborate on what steps remain for the companies to complete before the transaction can close?\nDoug Peterson: Hi, George, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. Well, first of all, as you know from our last call and what you’ve seen that we’ve released, we have approval from all of the regulators that we require approval from to close the merger. And – but those are conditioned on certain divestitures. So with the UK CMA, we are – have already presented them with approved buyers for the Base Chemicals business, which is News Corp. We’re waiting for their approval of that potential buyer. And then the second would be from the EC. We have – they have looked at all of the divestitures and the additional one from them is CUSIP, which we’ve announced that we signed a contract with FactSet. And we’re waiting for them to approve them as an acceptable divestiture partner. Other than that, we’re ready to go.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. You’ve realized pre-realized merger synergies over the course of 2021 and early 2022. Given your work around synergy realization, how are your views on revenue and cost synergies from the transaction changed?\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, George, this is Ewout. Obviously, we have continued to work on further validating our synergies, both on the cost side and on the revenue side. We have, in the meantime, had five rounds of synergy submissions by our work streams. So they do a lot of work on substantiating synergies, building bottom-up plans and further really developing concrete initiatives around these synergies. So the confidence level is going up for each of those submission rounds. I cannot give you specific numbers today. We will get back to you during the merger call. But a lot of work is continuing, so we’re ready to realize the synergies immediately after completing the transaction.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks, so much. I wanted to ask on Ratings. You mentioned the down 2% issuance for this year that your Ratings Group is forecasting. Just given the potential for rising rates, you mentioned you’re expecting three rate hikes. I guess how are you thinking about upside versus downside to that down 2% number?\nDoug Peterson: Yes, Toni, thank you for that. First of all, let me just share a little bit of the color of the market. As you know, last year was – had a lot of mixed movement in the Ratings. As an example, the corporates in the U.S. were down 30%. Financial institutions were up 17%, and then as an example, globally structured credit, which is CLOs, was up 265%. So we saw a lot of mix in the movements. And our analysts and the team at the S&P Global Ratings research team have been looking across all of those types of factors, what was the part issuance. One thing that they have looked at is what was the growth in issuance over the last couple of years in all the different sectors? What’s the M&A landscape? What are we seeing for the pipeline of LBOs, private sector transactions, private credit transactions? And what they see right now is in the – what we call the corporates or the industrials that they are expecting they’ll be down by about 7% next year with the range of negative 15% to negative 5%. Financial services relatively flat, up about 1% with a range from down 5% to up 5%. Structured finance at about 3% growth for the year with could go down as much as 5%, could go as much up as 8%. And then public finance at about 2%, either flat to up 5%. So that gives you a total of down about 2% with a range that could go down 8%, and it could go up to 3%. As I said, this is based on the factors of looking at the pipeline, looking at outstanding issuance, maturities that are coming up, M&A pipeline, what we’ve learned from the banking sector on what they see with the private transactions, etcetera.\nToni Kaplan: That’s great. Very helpful. And wanted to ask on ESG, so you have mentioned in the past that most of the ESG revenue right now is in Platts, but there are significant opportunities in the other segments, and you’ve mentioned a number of those earlier in the call. But just how should we think about the ramp of ESG in the different segments? Like would you expect like Market Intelligence to be able to ramp first or Index? And should we see this being sort of a gradual opportunity over time? Or as things gain traction, massive step up somewhere? Just how should we think about going forward?\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Toni, if you look at the revenues for ESG, we’re very pleased with the growth during 2021. We realized 51% growth in revenues across the company. And so overall, we continue to be committed to that 40% CAGR that we have laid out before. Your question with respect to each of the segments, you’re right that Platts is still the highest, the largest in terms of ESG revenue contribution. Market Intelligence is very closely following now the Platts business. And what we are seeing that besides Platts, particularly Ratings, Market Intelligence and the Index business are having the highest growth of each ESG revenues at this point in time. So this is clearly an enterprise-wide initiative. That’s why we have created the Sustainable1 group that is looking across the company and driving commercial initiatives for the company as a whole. And we continue to be very excited about the outlook for the ESG revenues and particularly also seeing that growth in the other segments outside of Platts.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Toni.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks, so much and congratulations. Obviously, there is a lot going on and just really, really nice outcome. Doug or Ewout, could you talk about obviously, there is the focus on rates, but there is market volatility as well. Maybe talk about how the volatility impacts the Indices business, the Market Intelligence and then Platts as well because I think there is puts and takes across the model, but maybe the increased volatility, again, how that impacts Indices, Intelligence and then maybe just a spike in oil within the context of Platts, if you could.\nEwout Steenbergen: Absolutely, Kevin, and good morning. Actually, the way how we look at volatility, that is, in many cases, also a positive for our businesses because if there is more volatility going on in the markets, more activity happening. There is more demand for our products, for our research, for our insight and for our analytics. So actually, volatility in markets usually shows more the higher value add of our products. And then on top of that, we see two of our businesses that are directly benefiting from more volatility from a trading perspective. We have Global Trading Services revenue in Platts that is going up when there is more market volatility in the commodities markets. And then we have the exchange-traded derivative activity in the Index business, which is the case that there is more hedging going on been in more volatile equity markets. And that is one of the revenue drivers of our Index business. So clearly, volatility is helping the company both from a value add, but then also about directly two revenue streams in both the Index and the Platts business.\nKevin McVeigh: That’s great. I will get back in, thank you so much.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Hi, good morning, everyone. Wanted to come back to the Ratings agency discussion for a second, Doug, you mentioned obviously that the forecast from your team doesn’t include loan markets. But if you look at the loan business for you in 2021, obviously, that business doubled. So, curious where you shake out in terms of loan market expectations in terms of issuance? And obviously, that filters into structured finance as well in case it’s a soft environment, which we’ve seen so far in January. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thank you. Well, when it comes to the loan market, we still see conditions which are quite attractive for loan issuers. First of all, even though there is discussions about rates going up, we’ve seen estimates from 3, 4, 5, 6, even 7 hikes recently as the last couple of days, our own economists have increased their expectation for rate hikes in the U.S. up to a range of more like 5 or 6 now. But even if you look at rates, rates are still quite low. And there is a lot of demand for floating rate instruments given the rate cycle, and there could be increases there. We also see a very strong M&A pipeline. As you know, M&A is one of the biggest drivers of loan issuance as people complete M&A, they many times are financing it with a bridge loan or potentially going into the loan market. So when we look at the entire market, we think that even though rates are going to be going up, they are still low on historical levels. Spreads are very tight. There is a lot of demand for floating rate paper. There is a large pipeline of transactions coming through, both from a combination of M&A as well as private equity transactions. So we’re seeing right now still a very strong market for loans into the near future.\nAlex Kramm: Alright. Fair enough. And then maybe this could be for Ewout or you. Inflation, obviously, is a topic that’s been coming up a lot. Curious, I know you’re not giving any guidance at this point, but how you think, on the one hand, that could impact your cost pressure that we’ve seen with other companies? And then maybe remind us how much CPI you have built into some of your contracts in Market Intelligence, maybe Platts. So I guess the question is where could inflation actually help organic growth in 2022, which some people may not be thinking about? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Alex. I’m going to start, and then I’m going to hand it over to Ewout. Well, first of all, when we look at inflation, we see that last year, as an example, in the U.S., it was a 7% annualized rate in December. That annualized rate of 7% has, obviously, led to a very animated discussion about interest rates in the U.S. So as we built our plan and we’re looking forward, we’ve been looking at this in the U.S. and the UK, around the world. So first impact is we believe that interest rates will be going up. You’ve seen them go up in the UK. They are talking about it in the EC. The ECB has now been rumored to be looking at interest rate increases. And then in the U.S., there is expectations this year. So we’ve built those factors in. When it comes to labor markets, that’s one of the areas I am watching myself quitter closely both from a systemic point of view and then for our company itself. We’ve seen some wage pressure in areas like technology roles. There are some ESG roles that we’ve seen some pressure, wage pressure because those – we’re obviously going to be paying market rates. But let me hand it over to Ewout to give you some more thoughts about how we’re applying it for our budget for this year.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Alex, if we think about the impact of inflation on the company, we think, overall, this is going to be manageable for us because of a couple of reasons. Obviously, there will be expense increases with respect to people costs and procurement. And as Doug said, we are making some targeted adjustments for certain job groups within the company. But then the offsets are the following. We are continuing to run productivity programs, and you have seen that we have made quite good progress with the program we announced in 2020. Of course, we’re getting the significant synergy programs. And then we have an opportunity based on the high value-add of our products and services to achieve more favorable contract terms and fees over time when we are at that point of renewal. Obviously, that depends on facts and circumstances for each of our businesses. But clearly, we will be looking at balancing growth, at margins, at customer relations and then ultimately, shareholder value by managing the impact of inflation. But as I said at the beginning, we think that is overall manageable from a financial results perspective.\nAlex Kramm: Very helpful. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the – when the INFO acquisition was announced, the company had guided to a mid-single-digit EPS growth for ‘22. I understand, you will provide the guidance on the – after the acquisition closes. But a lot has changed since then. So I was just wondering if you could just provide us some puts and takes since the original guidance was given and whether the buyback was included in that original guidance? Any incremental color will be helpful. Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Ashish, fully understand this is a very unusual situation that we cannot provide you guidance at this point in time. Having said that, you should expect us from a philosophical perspective, how we manage the company to continue exactly for what you have seen us doing in the past and what we have thought you before. So expect to grow revenues in all of our businesses in 2022 and also to continue to expand our margins. And we will be more specific during the merger call and give you more quantification around that.\nAshish Sabadra: That’s very helpful color, thank you for that. And then just on the multiyear productivity, it’s great to see the progress there and ability to pull forward or ability to execute at a better-than-expected pace and then now the focus on cost synergies going forward. Just a question there would be is there opportunity for – as we – in addition to the cost synergies, could there be more opportunities for productivity, global productivity improvement on stand-alone businesses as well? Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: We will continue to look at all the opportunities. You may expect us to see us continue to be very disciplined from a cost management perspective. There are areas where we are further looking at across the whole company from productivity to real estate to automation, many, many different areas. Again, we will give you a full update on what that means for the combined company from a synergy perspective. But overall, I’m very pleased with the progress we are making to get ready to start to realize those synergies and the concrete plans that we have put behind that. And as I said before, five rounds we now had in terms of synergies, submissions by the work streams. So an incredible amount of work has gone into this to further validate and to bring up the confidence level in terms of what we will be able to accomplish.\nAshish Sabadra: That’s great and congrats on such a strong quarter. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Ashish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. I’m just looking at the Kensho slide here, and I just wanted kind of a high-level overview on what the pipeline at Kensho looks like just with S&P at the moment, and I imagine IHS Markit only opens up the doors there?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, Manav. And you know this is always one of my favorite topics to talk about. So we continue to be so excited about the initiatives of Kensho and how Kensho is helping to transform S&P Global and what it can do also for the combined company after we complete the transaction. You’ve seen some of the highlights of the accomplishment of Kensho during 2021, and we are expecting to see that continuing in 2022. We have such a complete toolkit of AI for unstructured data, which is about linking data, extraction, speech to text, the Codex platform that is now on Cap IQ Pro and has already 300,000 users to date. And you cannot imagine the amount of demand that Kensho have going forward. We will have some prioritization decisions to make where we think we can create the highest value and where to use those resources. Also, by the way, the attention for Kensho from external customers is going up at this point in time. There is more and more external activity happening and also the relations with Kensho with some of the large technology firms is further expanding. So we’re actually really excited that the external recognition of Kensho remains very high. So high value creation for Kensho, and it’s going to be really positive to see what is going to be next for Kensho in a way to help to catalyze innovation for the company.\nManav Patnaik: Got it, thank you for that. And then just a quick update on China, obviously, the number of ratings is growing really nicely as you disclosed. Just wondering like is the revenue material yet and what that kind of pace looks like?\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thanks, Manav. Well, we’re so excited about China. We have a fantastic team there with really good leadership. We’ve been out educating the market. As you know, there is been some opportunities for us to provide some seminars on credit. We’ve seen a very large increase in traffic coming to us, especially given the current credit environment in China. As you mentioned, we got up to 57 ratings in 2021. One of the things that’s important to us is that they span the different levels of investment-grade ratings. They are broad from AAA to BBB. We rated financial institutions, corporate structured. And the regulatory environment is also one where there are some very good initiatives going on to look at changing the floor of ratings that are going to be available for financial institutions and insurance companies. But our revenue is still light. It’s not material to the company. It’s something that we’re putting a major focus on in 2022, so we can drive our commercial organization faster and harder to take advantage of the really strong start that we’re off to.\nManav Patnaik: Alright. Thank you very much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Manav.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nHamzah Mazari: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. My question is just on market intelligence. Could you just remind us are all those contracts now on enterprise-wide arrangements? And maybe do you see the mix changing with data management solutions kind of being a much bigger part? And any mix changes you see within this business post merger? I know it’s one of your highest growth businesses and margins seem to have come back post some of your earlier investments.\nEwout Steenbergen: Hamzah, good morning. Definitely what we expect to see is that the data management solutions is going to grow faster and becoming a more and more prominent part of the market intelligence business over time. So, maybe going back to a couple of the comments you made. With respect to enterprise-wide contracts, that process is done. So, we have now all our contracts on that basis. What you are seeing is very steady and healthy growth in desktop. We really like the commercial activity in 2021. We have seen some very healthy sales levels, and that sets us up well for 2022 from a desktop growth perspective, 6% reported growth. And that is more or less that mid-single digit steady growth is to be expected going forward. Then data management solutions in a normal quarter, you should see that grow at high-single digits to low-teens. We are a bit higher this quarter, about 11% and particularly nice growth in marketplace and in the Trucost area as well. So, those are doing particularly very well. And then lastly, you were referring to margins. We have been investing, as you know, the last year a lot in new growth initiatives in market intelligence. And we are very happy to see that paying off from an overall revenue growth perspective. And we said that you should see margins coming back in 2021 to that mid-30 levels. And we are very happy to see that, that actually also has taken place. So, market intelligence is very well positioned, I think for the next few years.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Very helpful. And just my follow-up question, I will turn it over, is just around just the ratings business. I know you highlighted your global issuance forecast for 2022. And I know your revenue differs obviously with that figure because of pricing and non-transactional business and mix, etcetera. But maybe could you talk about what you are seeing in Europe around issuance, maybe in Asia? I know you touched on China in some of your prepared remarks, but any thoughts as to outside of North America, how those markets look like as you look at 2022? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Just to give you some thoughts about the markets. Well, first of all, the numbers we gave you were a global issuance forecast, so it’s taken into account all the different markets we are in. But Europe was very similar to the United States last year in full year and also in the final numbers in the quarter. Europe was down in corporates, but it was up in financial institutions as well as very strong in CLOs and structured credit. In addition, the CMBS market in Europe was strong. We saw – it’s not a big market, but there was a lot of interest in CMBS in the European market. We see the continued conditions in Europe that are strong for capital markets. There is an interest. I have mentioned this before in other calls, in the European policy sector to stop having all of the dependence for corporate financing coming from banks and moving more to capital markets. As that continues, we see that as a long-term valuable trend for us. That trend in Asia is also something that we are seeing more of as well. Just a little bit about 2020 – 2021. In Asia, across all of Asia, both the corporates and financial institutions were up. Corporates were up about 10%, and financial institutions were up about 14% through the year, whereas the overall structure in Asia was only up about 30%, most of that being in traditional ABS and RMBS where the major volume is. But we do see, again, in Asia that move towards capital markets away from banking markets as a trend. There is also a lot more M&A activity taking place and part of Asia, obviously, is China where we are on the ground floor there as that becomes a much more sophisticated market.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Hamzah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. Just wanted to touch on the cost a little bit for the – you gave some good detail earlier on this. But in the fourth quarter, can you just touch on internal investment spending, how that may have differed dollar-wise if you could versus a year ago or sequentially and also incentive compensation as well. Is that materially different? How is it accrued over the course of the year? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. Good morning Craig, and thanks for asking that question. So I would first would like to point out that the expenses are unusually high during this quarter. The vast majority is not recurring, and you should see continued expense discipline from us going forward. So, having said that, you were specifically asking about certain categories, so, what you are seeing were from an expense growth perspective that the majority of the growth was coming from variable expenses, performance-related expenses, which I consider good expenses because they are directly correlated with healthy sales and revenue activity. So, these are commissions, royalties and incentive compensation. Incentive compensation, you asked a specific question around that. We are accruing at this moment significantly above 100% for our short-term incentive compensation, and that’s a bit higher compared to 2020. And also the performance factors of our long-term incentive compensation are running a bit higher than in 2020. So, that drove some of the additional expenses. With respect to growth investments, although you saw that they were overall a bit lower compared to the year before, that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have an impact on the overall expense levels, because some of those growth initiatives go to a baseline. And it means that some of the new growth initiatives are still incremental to what we already have in place. So overall, growth in net investments drove approximately $15 million of the expense growth during the fourth quarter. So, we think these are clear reasons why the expense growth is happening. The underlying recurring expense growth is actually very limited and very minimal.\nCraig Huber: And my follow-up, I guess, you guys touched on a little bit earlier about on bank loans, the outlook for that. Can you just go a little bit deeper? I mean that’s obviously a huge wildcard this year. Obviously, it’s not included in your global debt issuance forecast. So, maybe touch on a little deeper what do you think the likely outcomes are for bank loans versus last year’s strength of about 100%? Maybe touch on CLOs as well as they think about this New Year. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Craig. Yes. Right now, I can talk to you a little bit about the conditions, but we are not giving any guidance right now for 2022. But as I mentioned, the conditions for the market as of the current market are still quite favorable for bank loans. In particular, the M&A market, we see is strong. There is a large backlog of transactions which have already been announced that haven’t been closed yet. You have a large private equity pipeline of transactions, which are going on. Even though interest rates are starting to go up, and we have seen the 10-year treasury hasn’t hit 2%, but it’s getting closer. But spreads are tight, and interest rates are still very low on a historical basis. There is a lot of demand as well from insurance companies, from banks and other institutional investors for floating rate paper. So, we do think that the conditions are still very strong for the loan market. But as of now, we are not giving any specific guidance for 2022.\nCraig Huber: Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nTrevor Romeo: Hi, good morning. This is actually Trevor Romeo in for Andrew. I appreciate you taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones for me. First, just wanted to go a bit deeper on Platts with 12% growth in the quarter, I think 18% growth in the U.S. I know some of that might be one-time from the commercial settlement. Is there anything you would call out there in terms of drivers of that strength? And how much is the strong commodity market driving growth kind of across the various areas of Platts right now?\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning Trevor, definitely very pleased to see such a high revenue growth in Platts. I think it has been a long time ago, we see Platts growing in the double-digit space. So, this is really excellent results. You are right, there was that $4 million commercial settlement in those numbers. If you would take that out, you are at approximately 10% growth for revenues for Platts in the fourth quarter, so still quite strong. So, what is happening behind there in terms of revenue growth, we see strong commercial momentum in both the core business, which is the price reporting business and the insights business. And that is mostly because we see customers being healthy with the current commodity prices. The current commodity market environment is actually very good for our customers and then also global trading services is doing well. We are growing clearly here based on the overall price volatility in the markets. And then the third reason behind this strong revenue growth of Platts is the new initiatives. We have invested in new initiatives like LNG, energy transition and agriculture, and they also start to pay off at this moment, so very pleased with the results of Platts overall.\nTrevor Romeo: Great. Great. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, just wanted to ask about your recent acquisition of the Climate Service, I am sure that’s probably a fairly small acquisition, but just wondering if you could talk a bit more about how that kind of physical climate risk more broadly fits into your ESG strategy? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thank you for that. The Climate Service is a really interesting business, and it’s an excellent fit for us with the suite of climate products, in particular, that we have been putting together, both homegrown as well as the Trucost acquisition we made 4.5 years ago. It brings a platform called Climanomics, which is you are able to build across different data sets. It allows companies to look at their physical risk in many different categories, cyclones, hurricanes, fire, floods, etcetera. And it can be modeled to different approaches. As an example, the task force for climate-related financial disclosure modeling. So, this is something that we find that it’s a great fit for our organization. But more importantly, it also brings a really talented group of people, people who are entrepreneurial. They have got passion. They have got energy. And they are going to be a great addition to S&P Global as well because they are going to bring all of that energy as we build out even further our Sustainable1 business platform.\nTrevor Romeo: Great. I appreciate the color. Thanks again.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thanks, Trevor.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I want to get your thought about the potential development of ESG this year. And there has been a lot of conversation about the inconsistency of ESG data and ratings, and there are obviously some benefits of ESG data as well. But could you please talk about some of the potential events or development this year that can potentially get us closer to a more standardized ESG disclosure or ESG data and ratings? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thanks, Owen. This is really an important area for us, both as S&P Global as well as an industry. And by that, I mean, the entire financial industry as we look to this important factor that starts to get included in people’s decision-making. What we see is that the ESG market itself for data and analytics as scores, it started to evolve as more and more insurance companies, institutional investors, asset managers take those factors into account as they make decisions. And as of now, as you know, the factors which are being used by different organizations are not the same. You have organizations that care more about climate. You have some that care more about diversity inclusion or supply chain. And so there is different language out there, whether it’s an impact fund, it’s an ESG fund, it’s an ESG approach. And we are working very closely with different organizations such as the IFRS and the ISSP. They are setting up the international sustainability standards for disclosure. The IOSCO, which is the International Organization of Securities, Commissioners, is looking at new rules around the globe for disclosure as well, both disclosure from the point of view of issuers, but also disclosure that could be asked for by different types of investors as they sell their funds or sell their investments. We do think that there is a really good effort going on across the private sector as well as NGOs along with these regulatory agencies to start addressing what would be the potential regulatory requests as well as the market themselves coming to standards of how we are going to be disclosing this. S&P Global for our products, all of our products, we provide very simple, clear, consistent disclosure on everything that we are providing in the ESG products. Our disclosure is built in a way that it’s consistent, it’s transparent, it’s comparable. You can see what the actual criteria is that’s used to determine an index or a score or the weighting of the score. And we think that, that’s going to be a key differentiating factor for us as we build out our ESG business.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That’s very helpful. And then one follow-up question is about the buyback. And again, and I know you don’t provide any specific guidance on buyback, but how should we think about kind of the magnitude and also the timing of the ASR? I mean, the stocks have traded down quite a bit since the beginning of this year. Would you be opportunistic to do one large ASR or you would do multiple ASR for the rest of this year? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Owen, let me explain to you philosophically what we are having in mind. Obviously, we need to do a catch-up because we have not been able to do buybacks over the last 2 years. The same applies for IHS Markit. We have the opportunity to do buybacks based on the proceeds of some of those divestitures. We are also, of course, looking at the overall refinancing that we can do of the IHS Markit debt and potentially some opportunity for upsizing. And then very quickly, we would like to go in a normal course return of capital. We still are committed to the capital targets that were provided the call when we announced the merger, so at least 85% of return of free cash flow. So, we definitely are ready to resume buybacks after the transaction is completed and we would like to do that as quickly as possible in order to get normal rating again for the combined company.\nOwen Lau: Got it. Thank you very much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks Owen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks. I know it’s late. I will just ask one. In your comments, you talked a bit about labor cost. I was wondering if you can drill down a little bit more. First of all, is it more difficult to find and retain people? I know a lot of companies are talking about that? And then what does that translate into the labor costs you have been incurring and what you expect for this year? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Jeff. I am going to start and then hand it over to Ewout. As I mentioned earlier, it’s critical for us that we are competitive, and we are paying market rates in all of the different markets we are in. We are seeing a little bit of inflation or increase in job expenses, wage expenses, as I mentioned, in some specific areas like high-demand technology areas, data scientists. One market, in particular, we are seeing increase in some pressures in India. And I will give you an example of something you might not have thought of, but we are actually seeing a lot of our recruiters getting recruited away. People are trying to hire people who can hire people. So, we are seeing certain areas where we do see some increase in turnover, and we are seeing clearly the areas that we are watching quite carefully. But our philosophy is to pay market rates to ensure that this is a great place to work, and Ewout can talk a little bit more of how that translates.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. In addition to what Doug said, I think we are not having any problem with hiring. We are still a very attractive company, people like to work for us. And to stay competitively from a pay perspective, we have made adjustments for certain job groups. Think about the ratings analysts, technology and ESG. And we are also increasing the merit levels in certain jurisdictions. So, that is just to make sure we stay competitive. But overall, as I said to an earlier question, we believe that the impact is manageable because we have opportunities also to look at productivity, synergy, efficiencies, automation as well as the opportunity to look at some contractual terms and fees over time.\nJeff Silber: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thanks so much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. I heard you a lot and clear, no guidance at this time. But I thought Ewout said that you expect to grow revenue in all of your businesses in ‘22. If I could just confirm if that’s what was said, obviously, asking specifically for ratings, if that’s the case. And then a related technical question, just given your team – your ratings team maintaining the down two issuance forecast, but also explicitly saying risks way to the downside. Did they lower the low end of the range and that down eight, seven at the low end already reflects their current views of that downside risk, or did they maintain the whole range and their kind of probability weighting different parts of the range or think there could be a future adjustment? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning Jeff. First, to your question about revenue growth, indeed, I said before that we expect to grow revenues in all of our businesses in 2022 and that we will get back to you with more specifics during the merger call. With respect to your question about some of the ranges with respect to the issuance forecast by our research group, I think you are right that compared to a quarter ago, some of the ranges have widened. But overall, the issuance forecast is still at a minus 2% level. And ranges have become wider because as we showed you in one of those slides in the prepared remarks, clearly, there is more uncertainty in the macro environment. So, the level of headwinds and potential tailwinds that we are seeing is a bit larger. So, ranges are wider, but overall, the midpoint is still the same.\nJeff Meuler: Makes sense. Thanks for the reinforcement. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. And let me just reinforce what Ewout said about the businesses and just clarify that this is S&P Global businesses that we are talking about. We have no discussion whatsoever about the IHS Markit businesses. But let me wrap up the call. And I want to thank everyone again for joining the call for your questions, for your support. I want to thank, again, as I always do, our very dedicated people. This has now been 2 years for the pandemic. We are going into our third year. We have asked our people to do a lot last year in the last 2 years. And we want to ensure that they are fully prepared for the expected merger with IHS Markit because we are going to be working really hard and running fast as soon as that closes. And throughout 2021, we continued to perform, as you saw today, with the strong financial results and the progress on our strategic initiatives, especially those that are going to be driving growth in the future and Kensho, data sciences, data analytics, ESG, what we have talked about with investment in our global businesses. Going back to one of the first questions we received about the merger. We are very excited about the merger and the progress that we have been making, planning for the merger. We are going to host the call as soon as it’s completed. We will do a post-merger investor call. We can provide an update on the company’s strategy, the business segments, the synergies, the investment program, share repurchases, things that you asked about today or wanted to ask about today, and that would include guidance. One last point I would like to make on the call is I want to thank Chip Merritt. He has been an incredible partner as our Head of IR. He is going to still be with us for a few more months until May. But for the past 9 years, he has been a great partner. He has helped position S&P Global as the leading financial data and analytics and benchmark company and always with a great sense of humor. So Chip, thank you so much for your partnership throughout. We couldn’t have never done as well as we had without you. So again, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We are very proud of all that we have been able to achieve, but we also have a lot to look forward to. So, thank you, again, everyone.\nOperator: That concludes this morning’s call. A PDF version of the presentation slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&P Global’s website for 1 year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month. On behalf of S&P Global, we thank you for participating and wish you a good day.",

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug and welcome to all of you on the call. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Revenue increased 12%. Adjusted corporate unallocated expense increased 38% primarily due to increased incentive compensation, higher professional fees and the timing of contributions to the S&P Global Foundation. Adjusted total expenses increased 9% and I will come back to this on the next slide. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 120 basis points. Interest expense decreased 22% primarily due to a reduction in FIN 48 interest expense accruals and adjusted diluted EPS increased 16%. Total adjusted expenses for the full year increased 7%. For the fourth quarter, they increased to 9%. The fourth quarter increase was primarily due to elevated variable expenses, including incentives, commissions and royalties as a result of strong 2021 financial performance; severance charges related to management changes in the Indices business during the quarter; increased investments in growth initiatives; increased professional fees; and the resumption of T&E spending. During the fourth quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments totaled to a net pre-tax loss of $131 million. They included $21 million for merger transaction cost primarily legal fees, $42 million for merger integration cost primarily consulting fees, retention bonuses, branding and technology integration cost; $51 million from merger costs to achieve, which will drive synergy benefits, they include lease impairments and restructuring charges; $4 million for acquisition and divestiture-related expenses; $8 million in gains from real estate sales; and $21 million in deal-related amortization. This quarter, all four segments delivered increased revenue with Indices leading the way with an 18% increase. All four segments also delivered adjusted operating profit growth with Ratings leading the way with an 18% increase. Quarterly margins were mixed, but more importantly, all four segments reported a gain in adjusted operating profit margin for the year. Each year, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we share the changes in our headcount. In 2021, headcount decreased 1% primarily for two reasons. The first is operational efficiencies. Much of the operational efficiencies were from automation. In fact, our people created 225 bots in 2021 with Market Intelligence leading the way with 167 bots. Cognitive automation and RPA generated over 600,000 hours of savings in 2021. The second is pre-realized merger synergies. Because of the pending merger, it didn't make sense to backfill many positions when people left the company in 2021. We estimate that there were about 150 S&P Global positions left unfilled, representing pre-realized synergies of approximately $25 million by year end 2021. This year, with the formation of Sustainable1, we added this as a new category. Many of the people in Sustainable1 were previously reported in other categories. Platts was the area with the largest headcount increase at 11% due to investments in several growth projects. Market Intelligence had the largest decrease at 6% largely due to automation efficiencies and realignment to Sustainable1. Last year, we shared this slide and estimated that we would invest $100 million on growth initiatives in 2021. We ended up investing $80 million. The primary reasons for the difference were the competing priorities due to the merger and the competitive labor market. We will share our 2022 investment spending plans after the merger is completed. On our third quarter 2020 earnings call, we introduced a new $120 million productivity program to be completed over a 2 to 3-year period. I am pleased to report that only after 18 months we have already largely completed the program. There are few small procurement projects that are awaiting the close of the merger to take advantage of the increased scale of the combined company. All our productivity efforts will now be focused on achieving the merger synergies. Now, turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $6.5 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8x. Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $217 million or 7% over the prior year period. Because the share repurchase program was suspended due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, we only returned 21% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2021. After the merger is completed, we expect to significantly ramp up share repurchases. Now, let's turn to the division results, starting with S&P Dow Jones Indices, the segment delivered 18% revenue growth primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices and increased exchange-rated derivative activity. Our asset-linked revenue also included the benefit of a customer underreporting true-up. In the fourth quarter, we reported a 28% increase in adjusted expenses primarily due to severance, increased incentive compensation, commissions and royalties; a 13% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and an adjusted segment operating profit margin of 65.7%, a decrease of 280 basis points. On a trailing four-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 69.9%. S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered growth across all revenue channels this quarter. Asset-linked fees increased 18% with very strong gains in ETFs and mutual funds. Exchange-traded derivative revenue increased 30%. Data and custom subscriptions increased 10%. Activity at the CBOE increased in the fourth quarter, with S&P 500 Index options activity increasing 47% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 18%. CME equity complex volume increased 15% with particular strength in E-mini S&P 500 options. Ratings reported revenue increased 12%. Adjusted expenses increased 5% primarily due to increased incentive compensation, wages and outside services. This resulted in an 18% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 300 basis point increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 180 basis points to 64.2%. Non-transaction revenue increased 7% primarily due to fees associated with CRISIL, new entity credit ratings and surveillance, partly offset by lower Rating Evaluation Service. As an aside, we added over 1,000 new entity credit ratings in 2021. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to strength in investment-grade corporate bonds, bank loans and structured products. This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in Ratings revenue was the 14% increase in corporates. In addition, financial services revenue increased 5%, structured finance increased 32%, governments decreased 11%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. On the right side of this slide, you can see the changes in revenue within structured products. The largest change was in CLOs, which increased 43%. Turning to Platts, revenue increased 12% or $26 million, including a $4 million commercial settlement. Approximately 14% of this growth was from new products. Core subscriptions increased 10%, and Global Trading Services increased 13%. The gains in GTS revenue were mainly from higher petroleum and iron ore volumes. Adjusted expenses increased 16% primarily due to increased commissions, growth investments, cost of sales and incentives. Adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 50.1%. The trailing four-quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 55.1%. Platts delivered excellent revenue growth in every category with notable increases in natural gas, power and renewables and petrochemicals. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 8% or $42 million, with 34% of the growth coming from new products. Usage of our key market platforms increased 4% year-over-year, while year-ending active users increased 13% to 299,000 users. Adjusted expenses increased 5% due to increased cloud hosting initiatives, royalties, incentives and commissions. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 15%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 200 basis points to 32.7%. On a trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 34.3%. Looking across the Market Intelligence components, Desktop revenue grew 6%. During 2021, Market Intelligence rebranded its premier platform offering as Capital IQ Pro. The Capital IQ Pro platform combines the best of Capital IQ and SNL desktops with broad public fundamentals and deep industry data. In addition, the platform offers greater visibility into private companies and private markets as well as regulatory, supply chain, climate data and analytics and ESG scores. Data Management Solutions revenue grew 11%, and Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. Due to the pending merger, the company will not provide guidance for 2022 at this time but will provide 2022 guidance for the combined company after the merger is completed. We continue to expect the merger to close this quarter. In addition to the slides that we have reviewed on this call, there are additional slides in an appendix that can be downloaded from the Investor Presentations section of the Investor Relations website. In conclusion, 2021 was a noteworthy year for S&P Global. We delivered strong financial results, realized significant growth, made considerable progress on merger preparation and synergy validation and launched multiple innovative new products across the company, including our Sustainable1 product offerings. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions. Good morning, George, this is Ewout. Obviously, we have continued to work on further validating our synergies, both on the cost side and on the revenue side. We have, in the meantime, had five rounds of synergy submissions by our work streams. So they do a lot of work on substantiating synergies, building bottom-up plans and further really developing concrete initiatives around these synergies. So the confidence level is going up for each of those submission rounds. I cannot give you specific numbers today. We will get back to you during the merger call. But a lot of work is continuing, so we're ready to realize the synergies immediately after completing the transaction. Thanks, George. Good morning, Toni, if you look at the revenues for ESG, we're very pleased with the growth during 2021. We realized 51% growth in revenues across the company. And so overall, we continue to be committed to that 40% CAGR that we have laid out before. Your question with respect to each of the segments, you're right that Platts is still the highest, the largest in terms of ESG revenue contribution. Market Intelligence is very closely following now the Platts business. And what we are seeing that besides Platts, particularly Ratings, Market Intelligence and the Index business are having the highest growth of each ESG revenues at this point in time. So this is clearly an enterprise-wide initiative. That's why we have created the Sustainable1 group that is looking across the company and driving commercial initiatives for the company as a whole. And we continue to be very excited about the outlook for the ESG revenues and particularly also seeing that growth in the other segments outside of Platts. Absolutely, Kevin, and good morning. Actually, the way how we look at volatility, that is, in many cases, also a positive for our businesses because if there is more volatility going on in the markets, more activity happening. There is more demand for our products, for our research, for our insight and for our analytics. So actually, volatility in markets usually shows more the higher value add of our products. And then on top of that, we see two of our businesses that are directly benefiting from more volatility from a trading perspective. We have Global Trading Services revenue in Platts that is going up when there is more market volatility in the commodities markets. And then we have the exchange-traded derivative activity in the Index business, which is the case that there is more hedging going on been in more volatile equity markets. And that is one of the revenue drivers of our Index business. So clearly, volatility is helping the company both from a value add, but then also about directly two revenue streams in both the Index and the Platts business. Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, Alex, if we think about the impact of inflation on the company, we think, overall, this is going to be manageable for us because of a couple of reasons. Obviously, there will be expense increases with respect to people costs and procurement. And as Doug said, we are making some targeted adjustments for certain job groups within the company. But then the offsets are the following. We are continuing to run productivity programs, and you have seen that we have made quite good progress with the program we announced in 2020. Of course, we're getting the significant synergy programs. And then we have an opportunity based on the high value-add of our products and services to achieve more favorable contract terms and fees over time when we are at that point of renewal. Obviously, that depends on facts and circumstances for each of our businesses. But clearly, we will be looking at balancing growth, at margins, at customer relations and then ultimately, shareholder value by managing the impact of inflation. But as I said at the beginning, we think that is overall manageable from a financial results perspective. Ashish, fully understand this is a very unusual situation that we cannot provide you guidance at this point in time. Having said that, you should expect us from a philosophical perspective, how we manage the company to continue exactly for what you have seen us doing in the past and what we have thought you before. So expect to grow revenues in all of our businesses in 2022 and also to continue to expand our margins. And we will be more specific during the merger call and give you more quantification around that. We will continue to look at all the opportunities. You may expect us to see us continue to be very disciplined from a cost management perspective. There are areas where we are further looking at across the whole company from productivity to real estate to automation, many, many different areas. Again, we will give you a full update on what that means for the combined company from a synergy perspective. But overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we are making to get ready to start to realize those synergies and the concrete plans that we have put behind that. And as I said before, five rounds we now had in terms of synergies, submissions by the work streams. So an incredible amount of work has gone into this to further validate and to bring up the confidence level in terms of what we will be able to accomplish. Thanks, Manav. And you know this is always one of my favorite topics to talk about. So we continue to be so excited about the initiatives of Kensho and how Kensho is helping to transform S&P Global and what it can do also for the combined company after we complete the transaction. You've seen some of the highlights of the accomplishment of Kensho during 2021, and we are expecting to see that continuing in 2022. We have such a complete toolkit of AI for unstructured data, which is about linking data, extraction, speech to text, the Codex platform that is now on Cap IQ Pro and has already 300,000 users to date. And you cannot imagine the amount of demand that Kensho have going forward. We will have some prioritization decisions to make where we think we can create the highest value and where to use those resources. Also, by the way, the attention for Kensho from external customers is going up at this point in time. There is more and more external activity happening and also the relations with Kensho with some of the large technology firms is further expanding. So we're actually really excited that the external recognition of Kensho remains very high. So high value creation for Kensho, and it's going to be really positive to see what is going to be next for Kensho in a way to help to catalyze innovation for the company. Hamzah, good morning. Definitely what we expect to see is that the data management solutions is going to grow faster and becoming a more and more prominent part of the market intelligence business over time. So, maybe going back to a couple of the comments you made. With respect to enterprise-wide contracts, that process is done. So, we have now all our contracts on that basis. What you are seeing is very steady and healthy growth in desktop. We really like the commercial activity in 2021. We have seen some very healthy sales levels, and that sets us up well for 2022 from a desktop growth perspective, 6% reported growth. And that is more or less that mid-single digit steady growth is to be expected going forward. Then data management solutions in a normal quarter, you should see that grow at high-single digits to low-teens. We are a bit higher this quarter, about 11% and particularly nice growth in marketplace and in the Trucost area as well. So, those are doing particularly very well. And then lastly, you were referring to margins. We have been investing, as you know, the last year a lot in new growth initiatives in market intelligence. And we are very happy to see that paying off from an overall revenue growth perspective. And we said that you should see margins coming back in 2021 to that mid-30 levels. And we are very happy to see that, that actually also has taken place. So, market intelligence is very well positioned, I think for the next few years. Yes. Good morning Craig, and thanks for asking that question. So I would first would like to point out that the expenses are unusually high during this quarter. The vast majority is not recurring, and you should see continued expense discipline from us going forward. So, having said that, you were specifically asking about certain categories, so, what you are seeing were from an expense growth perspective that the majority of the growth was coming from variable expenses, performance-related expenses, which I consider good expenses because they are directly correlated with healthy sales and revenue activity. So, these are commissions, royalties and incentive compensation. Incentive compensation, you asked a specific question around that. We are accruing at this moment significantly above 100% for our short-term incentive compensation, and that's a bit higher compared to 2020. And also the performance factors of our long-term incentive compensation are running a bit higher than in 2020. So, that drove some of the additional expenses. With respect to growth investments, although you saw that they were overall a bit lower compared to the year before, that doesn't mean that it doesn't have an impact on the overall expense levels, because some of those growth initiatives go to a baseline. And it means that some of the new growth initiatives are still incremental to what we already have in place. So overall, growth in net investments drove approximately $15 million of the expense growth during the fourth quarter. So, we think these are clear reasons why the expense growth is happening. The underlying recurring expense growth is actually very limited and very minimal. Good morning Trevor, definitely very pleased to see such a high revenue growth in Platts. I think it has been a long time ago, we see Platts growing in the double-digit space. So, this is really excellent results. You are right, there was that $4 million commercial settlement in those numbers. If you would take that out, you are at approximately 10% growth for revenues for Platts in the fourth quarter, so still quite strong. So, what is happening behind there in terms of revenue growth, we see strong commercial momentum in both the core business, which is the price reporting business and the insights business. And that is mostly because we see customers being healthy with the current commodity prices. The current commodity market environment is actually very good for our customers and then also global trading services is doing well. We are growing clearly here based on the overall price volatility in the markets. And then the third reason behind this strong revenue growth of Platts is the new initiatives. We have invested in new initiatives like LNG, energy transition and agriculture, and they also start to pay off at this moment, so very pleased with the results of Platts overall. Owen, let me explain to you philosophically what we are having in mind. Obviously, we need to do a catch-up because we have not been able to do buybacks over the last 2 years. The same applies for IHS Markit. We have the opportunity to do buybacks based on the proceeds of some of those divestitures. We are also, of course, looking at the overall refinancing that we can do of the IHS Markit debt and potentially some opportunity for upsizing. And then very quickly, we would like to go in a normal course return of capital. We still are committed to the capital targets that were provided the call when we announced the merger, so at least 85% of return of free cash flow. So, we definitely are ready to resume buybacks after the transaction is completed and we would like to do that as quickly as possible in order to get normal rating again for the combined company. Yes. In addition to what Doug said, I think we are not having any problem with hiring. We are still a very attractive company, people like to work for us. And to stay competitively from a pay perspective, we have made adjustments for certain job groups. Think about the ratings analysts, technology and ESG. And we are also increasing the merit levels in certain jurisdictions. So, that is just to make sure we stay competitive. But overall, as I said to an earlier question, we believe that the impact is manageable because we have opportunities also to look at productivity, synergy, efficiencies, automation as well as the opportunity to look at some contractual terms and fees over time. Good morning Jeff. First, to your question about revenue growth, indeed, I said before that we expect to grow revenues in all of our businesses in 2022 and that we will get back to you with more specifics during the merger call. With respect to your question about some of the ranges with respect to the issuance forecast by our research group, I think you are right that compared to a quarter ago, some of the ranges have widened. But overall, the issuance forecast is still at a minus 2% level. And ranges have become wider because as we showed you in one of those slides in the prepared remarks, clearly, there is more uncertainty in the macro environment. So, the level of headwinds and potential tailwinds that we are seeing is a bit larger. So, ranges are wider, but overall, the midpoint is still the same."

            "name": "Doug Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Chip. Welcome to everyone joining today's earnings call. The first thing I'd like to do is thank our people at S&P Global for their dedication and commitment throughout 2021. We have asked a lot of our people this year as they do their day jobs, while also preparing for the expected merger with IHS Markit and all the while dealing with the uncertainty of the pandemic. So on behalf of the Board and our management team, thank you. Now, let me turn to the key financial achievements in 2021. S&P Global delivered 12% organic revenue growth and 17% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. All four businesses contributed with growth in both revenue and adjusted operating profit margin. This is quite an achievement following the remarkable results of 2020. We generated $3.5 billion of free cash flow, excluding certain items and returned $743 million in dividends. In addition to the very strong financial results, we made significant progress on our key initiatives as well. Clearly, the most important initiative of the year has been on preparation for the merger and the multiple rounds of synergy validation. Upon closing of the merger, we are well prepared to rapidly begin operating as one company and to begin to realize both the cost and revenue synergies we have already outlined to you. In fact, on a run-rate basis, we have already achieved pre-realized synergies of $25 million by the end of 2021. Also, after the merger is completed, we will host a post-merger investor call to provide an update on the merged company strategy, business segment details, synergies, investment programs, share repurchase plans, and guidance. The other key initiatives achieved in 2021 include the rapid progress achieved on our 2020 multiyear productivity program, numerous new product launches and expanded product capabilities resulting from our strategic investment initiatives, the creation of Sustainable1 to manage and drive significant expansion in coordination with ESG product offerings across the company; the launch of S&P Platts Dimensions Pro, a fully integrated user experience connecting pricing, market commentary, news and analytics with special emphasis on energy transition; and continued progress in China with one example being the issuance of 57 domestic ratings in China, up over 150% from 2020. This included the first dual-rated bond. I will provide more detail on many of these items in today's call. These are the strategic initiatives that we shared with you on our fourth quarter earnings call last year. We made great strides in each of these items and we will remark in more detail on many of them today. To recap the financial results for the full year, organic revenue increased 12% to $8.3 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 15%. Our adjusted operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 55.2%. And we delivered a 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. It's important to note that adjusted EPS of $13.70 far exceeded our original 2021 guidance of $12.25 to $12.45 and that the adjusted operating profit margin of 55.2% far exceeded our original guidance of 53.8% to 54.3%. Much of this was due to unexpected outperformance in ratings following what was a very strong 2020. Ewout will review our fourth quarter financial performance in a moment. All four divisions delivered revenue growth and adjusted operating profit improvement. The largest revenue gain was the 16% in Indices. After several years of elevated investment spending, Market Intelligence delivered the largest adjusted operating profit margin increase with a gain of 190 basis points. It's important to remember that our 2021 financial results are part of a solid track record of performance. Over the past 4 years, we have posted a compound annual growth rate of 8% for revenue and we have averaged 217 basis points per year of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. And this has resulted in a nearly doubling of our adjusted diluted EPS over that timeframe. The company also continued to advance its own industry leading practices in sustainability. We issued our 10th Annual Sustainability Impact Report and 3rd Annual TCFD Report. We expanded parental leave to 26 weeks and introduced a flexible time-off policy with no prescribed maximum in all eligible jurisdictions. We established a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility tied to our published Science Based Target goals, one of the first sustainability-linked banking facilities in the U.S. Our S&P Global Foundation increased its grants by 30% to $15 million to organizations that support COVID-19 relief, diversity, economic inclusion and environmental sustainability. And our efforts have been recognized by several leading third-parties. While we continue to improve our own internal sustainability programs, we are investing in our ESG business. In 2021, we launched Sustainable1 to elevate and coordinate external ESG efforts across the company. This resulted in ESG revenue of $98 million, a 51% increase over 2020. All our key ESG products contributed to this growth. We completed 59 ESG evaluations, up 48%; 43 Green Evaluations, up 79%; 103 SAM benchmark engagements, up 36%; and we launched social and sustainability framework alignment opinions and completed 42 of them. We ended 2021 with ESG ETF AUM reaching $32.2 billion, an increase of 59% versus year end 2020. At the core of our ESG efforts are the corporate sustainability assessments. These are a key differentiator versus our competitors as they enable us to collect an enormous amount of data directly from corporations around the world. For the methodology year that ends in March, we have already increased CSA survey participation by 58% to 2,190 companies. We also enhanced ESG offerings available on Capital IQ Pro, expanded S&P Global ESG scores coverage to 11,500 companies and expanded coverage of climate risk analytics to more than 3 million physical assets such as mines, power stations and buildings. In addition to excellent commercial progress and expanded capabilities, we also launched numerous new ESG products and initiatives in 2021. While I don't have time to delve into each one of them, let me just comment on a few. Second Party Opinions assess a transaction against a sustainable finance framework for alignment with consistent and comparable market principles and standards. Climate changes created the need to evaluate the impact of different climate-related scenarios on counterparties, investments and portfolios. To support these efforts, Market Intelligence and Oliver Wyman created Climate Credit Analytics, a climate scenario analysis and credit analytics model suite. And in December, we acquired the Climate Service. The company sells the Climanomics platform, a tool that quantifies physical climate risk for corporates, investors and governments. Kensho continues to be a driving force for productivity improvement for the company and increasingly for our customers. The key capabilities they have created are listed on this slide. Codex is an AI-powered document viewer that enables efficient navigation and extraction of relevant information from large quantities of documents. There have been over 300,000 client uses to-date. Codex is available on Capital IQ Pro. Kensho AGAVE has transformed Platts' process for creating price assessments. The AGAVE tool, developed by engineers at Kensho and Platts, has transformed the process for creating price assessments. Platts has implemented AGAVE in 40 of 57 markets targeted. And on average, daily price assessments are completed 70 minutes faster. Internally, Kensho Link facilitated quicker data ingestion by providing automated mappings for 60 million company entities. Externally, Kensho Link was used by our customers to efficiently map 16 million of their own entities to S&P Global unique identifiers. Many of our customers have taken note of Kensho's capabilities and we have begun monetizing Kensho Link, Kensho Scribe, RPA, data extraction and machine learning development. While the innovation we create internally is what drives much of our success, key industry trends also help. One of those is the shift into passive investing. This chart illustrates the $1.9 trillion of cumulative AUM U.S. equity flows in the past 10 years. We are a prime beneficiary of this trend. If we look at ETF AUM associated with our indices, there has been a 173% increase over the past 5 years to $2.8 trillion. We believe that this trend will continue. The increase in global issuance has been another positive trend for the company. It's hard to believe that 2021 issuance growth of 15% exceeded 2020 issuance growth of 13% as is often the case to our pockets of strength and pockets of weakness. In 2020, global investment grade and high yield were the strongest, while in 2021 leveraged loans and structured products were the fastest growing categories. The market clearly favored leveraged loans over high yield in 2021. The bars on these charts depict leveraged loan volume which soared in 2021. The lines depict the percentage of loans that we rated, which reached new heights of 95% in the U.S. and 93% in Europe. I'd now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2022. The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this month. The total amount of global debt maturing in this study is $11 trillion over the next 5 years. This is down 3% from the $11.3 trillion highlighted in last year's study. The chart on the right depicts the global high yield debt and leveraged loans maturing over the next 5 years. It totals $2.9 trillion, down 3% from $3 trillion in last year's study. It appears that 2021 issuance benefited from a bit of extra pull forward. Let's put this small decline in upcoming maturities into perspective. This chart shows total global corporate debt outstanding for the past 6 years. This increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 6%. The vast majority of this debt will get refinanced, and the pool of debt that needs to be refinanced just keeps getting larger. After exceptional issuance growth in 2020 and 2021, our Ratings Research Group anticipates that issuance will decrease 2% in 2022. The forecast calls for gains in structured, U.S. municipal and financial services issuance of 3%, 2% and 1%, respectively and a decrease in non-financials of 7%. Please note that this is an issuance forecast not a revenue forecast and it does not include leveraged loans. Now, let's start with the latest view from our economists. They are forecasting global GDP growth of 4.2% in 2022. The global economy is in the midst of a robust, but uneven rebound from the pandemic. Demand growth is outrunning supply growth and inflation has risen quickly almost everywhere. GDP growth in the U.S. and Europe reached multi-decade highs in 2021 and have continued in 2022. Inflation has proven to be more persistent than thought and now presents a key policy challenge in the U.S. and Europe. Our economists now expect at least 3 Fed rate hikes this year starting in March. Each year, we carefully assess the external factors facing the company. This slide depicts those that we think are most important going into 2022. Probably the most important positive factors are the expectation for continued healthy economic growth, borrowing costs that remain historically low, continued AUM flows from active to passive, elevated commodity levels that help the financial stability of commodity producers and ample liquidity. The most significant negative factors are geopolitical uncertainty, sticky inflation, Central Bank rate increases and a re-pricing of equities and of course, the pandemic and supply chain disruptions remain general risks facing the global economy. Before I finish, I want to say that I'm incredibly proud of the team we have built at S&P Global and I look forward to welcoming the talented IHS Markit employees to S&P Global. We are hopeful we will be speaking with you soon to update you on the merger. Once the merger is complete, we will immediately begin building a new company with an even brighter future. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout? Hi, George, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. Well, first of all, as you know from our last call and what you've seen that we've released, we have approval from all of the regulators that we require approval from to close the merger. And – but those are conditioned on certain divestitures. So with the UK CMA, we are – have already presented them with approved buyers for the Base Chemicals business, which is News Corp. We're waiting for their approval of that potential buyer. And then the second would be from the EC. We have – they have looked at all of the divestitures and the additional one from them is CUSIP, which we've announced that we signed a contract with FactSet. And we're waiting for them to approve them as an acceptable divestiture partner. Other than that, we're ready to go. Yes, Toni, thank you for that. First of all, let me just share a little bit of the color of the market. As you know, last year was – had a lot of mixed movement in the Ratings. As an example, the corporates in the U.S. were down 30%. Financial institutions were up 17%, and then as an example, globally structured credit, which is CLOs, was up 265%. So we saw a lot of mix in the movements. And our analysts and the team at the S&P Global Ratings research team have been looking across all of those types of factors, what was the part issuance. One thing that they have looked at is what was the growth in issuance over the last couple of years in all the different sectors? What's the M&A landscape? What are we seeing for the pipeline of LBOs, private sector transactions, private credit transactions? And what they see right now is in the – what we call the corporates or the industrials that they are expecting they'll be down by about 7% next year with the range of negative 15% to negative 5%. Financial services relatively flat, up about 1% with a range from down 5% to up 5%. Structured finance at about 3% growth for the year with could go down as much as 5%, could go as much up as 8%. And then public finance at about 2%, either flat to up 5%. So that gives you a total of down about 2% with a range that could go down 8%, and it could go up to 3%. As I said, this is based on the factors of looking at the pipeline, looking at outstanding issuance, maturities that are coming up, M&A pipeline, what we've learned from the banking sector on what they see with the private transactions, etcetera. Thanks, Toni. Yes. Thank you. Well, when it comes to the loan market, we still see conditions which are quite attractive for loan issuers. First of all, even though there is discussions about rates going up, we've seen estimates from 3, 4, 5, 6, even 7 hikes recently as the last couple of days, our own economists have increased their expectation for rate hikes in the U.S. up to a range of more like 5 or 6 now. But even if you look at rates, rates are still quite low. And there is a lot of demand for floating rate instruments given the rate cycle, and there could be increases there. We also see a very strong M&A pipeline. As you know, M&A is one of the biggest drivers of loan issuance as people complete M&A, they many times are financing it with a bridge loan or potentially going into the loan market. So when we look at the entire market, we think that even though rates are going to be going up, they are still low on historical levels. Spreads are very tight. There is a lot of demand for floating rate paper. There is a large pipeline of transactions coming through, both from a combination of M&A as well as private equity transactions. So we're seeing right now still a very strong market for loans into the near future. Thanks, Alex. I'm going to start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Ewout. Well, first of all, when we look at inflation, we see that last year, as an example, in the U.S., it was a 7% annualized rate in December. That annualized rate of 7% has, obviously, led to a very animated discussion about interest rates in the U.S. So as we built our plan and we're looking forward, we've been looking at this in the U.S. and the UK, around the world. So first impact is we believe that interest rates will be going up. You've seen them go up in the UK. They are talking about it in the EC. The ECB has now been rumored to be looking at interest rate increases. And then in the U.S., there is expectations this year. So we've built those factors in. When it comes to labor markets, that's one of the areas I am watching myself quitter closely both from a systemic point of view and then for our company itself. We've seen some wage pressure in areas like technology roles. There are some ESG roles that we've seen some pressure, wage pressure because those – we're obviously going to be paying market rates. But let me hand it over to Ewout to give you some more thoughts about how we're applying it for our budget for this year. Thanks, Alex. Thanks, Ashish. Yes. Thanks, Manav. Well, we're so excited about China. We have a fantastic team there with really good leadership. We've been out educating the market. As you know, there is been some opportunities for us to provide some seminars on credit. We've seen a very large increase in traffic coming to us, especially given the current credit environment in China. As you mentioned, we got up to 57 ratings in 2021. One of the things that's important to us is that they span the different levels of investment-grade ratings. They are broad from AAA to BBB. We rated financial institutions, corporate structured. And the regulatory environment is also one where there are some very good initiatives going on to look at changing the floor of ratings that are going to be available for financial institutions and insurance companies. But our revenue is still light. It's not material to the company. It's something that we're putting a major focus on in 2022, so we can drive our commercial organization faster and harder to take advantage of the really strong start that we're off to. Thanks, Manav. Yes. Just to give you some thoughts about the markets. Well, first of all, the numbers we gave you were a global issuance forecast, so it's taken into account all the different markets we are in. But Europe was very similar to the United States last year in full year and also in the final numbers in the quarter. Europe was down in corporates, but it was up in financial institutions as well as very strong in CLOs and structured credit. In addition, the CMBS market in Europe was strong. We saw – it's not a big market, but there was a lot of interest in CMBS in the European market. We see the continued conditions in Europe that are strong for capital markets. There is an interest. I have mentioned this before in other calls, in the European policy sector to stop having all of the dependence for corporate financing coming from banks and moving more to capital markets. As that continues, we see that as a long-term valuable trend for us. That trend in Asia is also something that we are seeing more of as well. Just a little bit about 2020 – 2021. In Asia, across all of Asia, both the corporates and financial institutions were up. Corporates were up about 10%, and financial institutions were up about 14% through the year, whereas the overall structure in Asia was only up about 30%, most of that being in traditional ABS and RMBS where the major volume is. But we do see, again, in Asia that move towards capital markets away from banking markets as a trend. There is also a lot more M&A activity taking place and part of Asia, obviously, is China where we are on the ground floor there as that becomes a much more sophisticated market. Thanks, Hamzah. Thanks, Craig. Yes. Right now, I can talk to you a little bit about the conditions, but we are not giving any guidance right now for 2022. But as I mentioned, the conditions for the market as of the current market are still quite favorable for bank loans. In particular, the M&A market, we see is strong. There is a large backlog of transactions which have already been announced that haven't been closed yet. You have a large private equity pipeline of transactions, which are going on. Even though interest rates are starting to go up, and we have seen the 10-year treasury hasn't hit 2%, but it's getting closer. But spreads are tight, and interest rates are still very low on a historical basis. There is a lot of demand as well from insurance companies, from banks and other institutional investors for floating rate paper. So, we do think that the conditions are still very strong for the loan market. But as of now, we are not giving any specific guidance for 2022. Thanks, Craig. Yes. Thank you for that. The Climate Service is a really interesting business, and it's an excellent fit for us with the suite of climate products, in particular, that we have been putting together, both homegrown as well as the Trucost acquisition we made 4.5 years ago. It brings a platform called Climanomics, which is you are able to build across different data sets. It allows companies to look at their physical risk in many different categories, cyclones, hurricanes, fire, floods, etcetera. And it can be modeled to different approaches. As an example, the task force for climate-related financial disclosure modeling. So, this is something that we find that it's a great fit for our organization. But more importantly, it also brings a really talented group of people, people who are entrepreneurial. They have got passion. They have got energy. And they are going to be a great addition to S&P Global as well because they are going to bring all of that energy as we build out even further our Sustainable1 business platform. Yes. Thanks, Trevor. Yes. Thanks, Owen. This is really an important area for us, both as S&P Global as well as an industry. And by that, I mean, the entire financial industry as we look to this important factor that starts to get included in people's decision-making. What we see is that the ESG market itself for data and analytics as scores, it started to evolve as more and more insurance companies, institutional investors, asset managers take those factors into account as they make decisions. And as of now, as you know, the factors which are being used by different organizations are not the same. You have organizations that care more about climate. You have some that care more about diversity inclusion or supply chain. And so there is different language out there, whether it's an impact fund, it's an ESG fund, it's an ESG approach. And we are working very closely with different organizations such as the IFRS and the ISSP. They are setting up the international sustainability standards for disclosure. The IOSCO, which is the International Organization of Securities, Commissioners, is looking at new rules around the globe for disclosure as well, both disclosure from the point of view of issuers, but also disclosure that could be asked for by different types of investors as they sell their funds or sell their investments. We do think that there is a really good effort going on across the private sector as well as NGOs along with these regulatory agencies to start addressing what would be the potential regulatory requests as well as the market themselves coming to standards of how we are going to be disclosing this. S&P Global for our products, all of our products, we provide very simple, clear, consistent disclosure on everything that we are providing in the ESG products. Our disclosure is built in a way that it's consistent, it's transparent, it's comparable. You can see what the actual criteria is that's used to determine an index or a score or the weighting of the score. And we think that, that's going to be a key differentiating factor for us as we build out our ESG business. Thanks Owen. Thanks, Jeff. I am going to start and then hand it over to Ewout. As I mentioned earlier, it's critical for us that we are competitive, and we are paying market rates in all of the different markets we are in. We are seeing a little bit of inflation or increase in job expenses, wage expenses, as I mentioned, in some specific areas like high-demand technology areas, data scientists. One market, in particular, we are seeing increase in some pressures in India. And I will give you an example of something you might not have thought of, but we are actually seeing a lot of our recruiters getting recruited away. People are trying to hire people who can hire people. So, we are seeing certain areas where we do see some increase in turnover, and we are seeing clearly the areas that we are watching quite carefully. But our philosophy is to pay market rates to ensure that this is a great place to work, and Ewout can talk a little bit more of how that translates. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. And let me just reinforce what Ewout said about the businesses and just clarify that this is S&P Global businesses that we are talking about. We have no discussion whatsoever about the IHS Markit businesses. But let me wrap up the call. And I want to thank everyone again for joining the call for your questions, for your support. I want to thank, again, as I always do, our very dedicated people. This has now been 2 years for the pandemic. We are going into our third year. We have asked our people to do a lot last year in the last 2 years. And we want to ensure that they are fully prepared for the expected merger with IHS Markit because we are going to be working really hard and running fast as soon as that closes. And throughout 2021, we continued to perform, as you saw today, with the strong financial results and the progress on our strategic initiatives, especially those that are going to be driving growth in the future and Kensho, data sciences, data analytics, ESG, what we have talked about with investment in our global businesses. Going back to one of the first questions we received about the merger. We are very excited about the merger and the progress that we have been making, planning for the merger. We are going to host the call as soon as it's completed. We will do a post-merger investor call. We can provide an update on the company's strategy, the business segments, the synergies, the investment program, share repurchases, things that you asked about today or wanted to ask about today, and that would include guidance. One last point I would like to make on the call is I want to thank Chip Merritt. He has been an incredible partner as our Head of IR. He is going to still be with us for a few more months until May. But for the past 9 years, he has been a great partner. He has helped position S&P Global as the leading financial data and analytics and benchmark company and always with a great sense of humor. So Chip, thank you so much for your partnership throughout. We couldn't have never done as well as we had without you. So again, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We are very proud of all that we have been able to achieve, but we also have a lot to look forward to. So, thank you, again, everyone."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Chip. Welcome to today's third quarter Earnings Call. I'd like to start with some of the highlights of the quarter. We reported exceptional financial results with revenue increasing 13%, and all 4 businesses delivering strong revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. Indices delivered the strongest revenue growth for the second straight quarter due to large gains in ETF AUM. Adjusted expenses increased 7%, largely due to investment spending, commissions, and royalties.  After raising guidance on both the first quarter and second quarter earnings calls, we're raising 2021 guidance again, based on these strong results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Ewout will provide details in a moment. I'd also like to share some additional highlights from the third quarter. The most important initiative of the year continues to be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit.  This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our Company and our customers. The regulatory path to closing the merger's now becoming clear. We launched S&P Capital IQ Pro and Platts Dimensions Pro. And sustainable one, our ESG business is gaining momentum as we build internal capabilities and product offerings expand. I'll come back to all of these highlights in more detail, but let's start with the merger.  When we announced the merger November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in five jurisdictions, Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We've made substantial progress with all these regulators and there are number of remedies we must undertake in order to complete the merger. IHS Markit must divest the OPIS, the Coal, Metals and Mining, and the Petchem Wire businesses. The sale of these assets to News Corp has already been announced. In addition, IHS Markit must divest its Base Chemicals business. S&P Global must divest CUSIP Global Services, and leverage commentary and data together with related family of leveraged loan indices. S&P Global and IHS Markit will begin the process of selling these additional businesses shortly. In order to provide time to undertake these sales processes, we now expect to close the merger in the first quarter of 2022.  Collectively, the revenue from all of the businesses being divested is approximately $425 million, and the margins for each of these businesses are higher than the margins for each of the divisions they're in. In a moment, EVA will provide an update on our merger synergy expectations, and you will see that despite these divestitures, we're raising both our cost and revenue synergy targets. To recap the financial results for the third quarter, revenue increased 13% to $2.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 18% and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 250 basis points to 55.4%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing four quarter basis, which increased 130 basis points to 55.1%. As a result, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 24%.  Each quarter, we highlight a few key business drivers and important projects underway. This quarter, let's start with ratings bond issuance trends. During the third quarter, global bond issuance increased 3%. In the U.S., bond issuance in Aggregate increased 6% as Investment Grade decreased 12%, High Yield decreased 16%, Public Finance decreased 24%, while Structured Finance increased 105% due to large increases in every category, particularly CLOs which increased 340%.  European bond issuance increased 4% as Investment-grade decreased 7%, high yield decreased 4%, and structured finance increased 70% with gains in every asset class, except RMBS. Of particular note, CMBS increased 375%. In Asia, bond issuance decreased 2% overall. The data on this slide only depicts bond issuance when we include new bank loan volumes, overall global issuance increased 9%. The next two slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that the combination of global leveraged loan and high yield issuance in the third quarter, continued to be very strong, surpassing every quarter in 2018. '19, and '20. This slide depicts the combination of high yield issuance and leveraged loan volume by the use of proceeds of the funds raised. This quarter, both general corporate purpose and refinancing-related issuance was lower than the third quarter of 2020. The surge in activity is entirely due to M&A, LBOs, buybacks, and dividends. These are opportunistic categories that aren't pull-forward. The surge in issuance is not pulling forward issuance from future years, and it's additive to future financing needs. Since bank loan ratings are an important element of ratings revenue, we like to disclose our bank loan ratings revenue each quarter.  The unprecedented strength of bank loan ratings revenue continued in the third quarter, and year-to-date revenues already surpassed any of the previous 10 full years. The leverage loan market and the CLO market are dependent on one another as many of the leverage loans end up CLOs. As you can see here, CLO issuance continued to accelerate in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we rebranded our market intelligence platform as S&P Capital IQ Pro. This recognizes the value of the Capital IQ brand as we continue to upgrade the platform with additional content and functionality. We currently have approximately 290,000 active desktop users of which 90,000 are utilizing S&P Capital IQ Pro.  The inaugural release of S&P Capital IQ Pro includes a number of capabilities not found in the market intelligence platform. A new Kensho -enabled document viewer incorporates AI -based search to speed up users' discovery of tech space insights across filings in transcripts. It's based on technology that Kensho originally developed for U.S. security and military agencies, and is now re-engineered for S&P Capital IQ Pro. For example, it gives investors the ability to quickly screen comments made over years of earnings calls within minutes. The new platform features frequent coverage of private markets, including data around fundraising trends, dry powder, fund performance, and LP Investor allocations.  Also included is the ability for users to screen on non-traditional industry criteria, such as crypto, therapeutics and cleantech. S&P Capital IQ Pro also includes ratings, direct coverage of corporate and financial institutions. Our users can now incorporate a full suite of S&P Capital IQ pro tools and functionality and interact with S&P Global ratings content in ways not previously possible. Platts has been on a long journey to consolidate its product platforms as well. With the acquisitions of Bentek, Eclipse [Indiscernible], Petromedia, and others. There has been a tremendous effort to consolidate all of these capabilities into a single platform.  This quarter, Platts introduced Platts Dimensions Pro, which provides users with a seamless one-stop shop experience across Platt's benchmark price assessments, news, and analytics, spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. And like S&P Capital IQ Pro, this content is available on a web-based portal that is mobile-friendly, via machine-to-machine delivery, and as an Excel add-in. Periodically, we like to provide updates on new product launches. The first 2 charts on this slide depict the acceptance by market participants of our JKM marker for liquefied natural gas and our low sulfur marine fuel assessment.  Both have exhibited very strong growth recently. The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched in energy transition space in the last 4 years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices, covering what is expected to be one of the key producers of this future fuel. The methane performance certificate, which reflects production of natural gas in the U.S., with 0 methane emissions, and upstream values for the measured carbon emissions associated with crude oil production and transportation, covering an initial suite of 14 crudes from around the world and aiming to provide the backbone for low carbon crude trading.  Buyers can start to make active choices based on the relative carbon impact of different crude sources with this crude carbon intensity product. Turning to our investments in ESG, our Sustainable1 milestones and product launches continue to build. Third quarter Sustainable1 revenue increased 58% to $24 million versus the prior period. With the launch of Second-Party Opinions, Ratings now has 5 products. Overall, Ratings completed, 10 ESG evaluations, 13 Green evaluations, 13 SIEM benchmark engagements, and 11 social and sustainability framework alignment opinions in the quarter. In market intelligence, we're close to wrapping up the annual CSA survey.  And so far in 2021, corporate participation increased 34% over 1,800 companies. On the back of these surveys, we relaunched our S&P Global ESG scores on 8,000 companies during the quarter. We are targeting to have scores on more than 11,000 companies by the end of this year's assessment cycle in the first quarter of 2022. In indices, we had $26.5 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the third quarter. This is an increase of 178% since the end of the third quarter of last year. Our indices business also added to its ESG indices offerings with the launch of the S&P NZX 50 tilted index with the New Zealand Stock Exchange. Platts added products to both its suite of carbon assessments and it's recycled plastic offerings.  And finally, S&P Global's a founding member of [Indiscernible], a new technology platform designed to provide private equity firms and the private markets with ESG measurement, data collection, and bench marking capabilities to help improve the management and tracking of ESG performance. By providing rich, detailed data on a wide array of ESG topics. The corporate sustainability assessment is an integral part of our ESG scores. Since we purchased the capability for RobecoSAM in late 2019, we've expanded the number of corporate participants by about 500 Companies, and the group has almost doubled corporate participation in the last 4 years.  Today's participating companies represents 45% of global market capitalization. In addition, you could see this as a global endeavor. We view the CSA input as a key differentiator to our Sustainable1 efforts. Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance in GDP. The 2021 issuance forecast continued to creep higher, and is now relatively flat versus 2020 issuance. The latest forecast was issued earlier this week and also covers 2022 issuance for the first time. 2022 issuances forecast a declined 2%. This is based on a 7% decrease in Non-financial Corporate, a 1% increase in Financial Services, a 3% increase in Structured Finance, and a 2% increase in U.S. Public Finance. Looking forward, inflation concerns, prospects for rising rates, high cash balances, and possible tax reform, all translate to headwinds for issuance in 2022.  We expect that they will lead to a second year of contraction in issuance total. Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address non-transaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity. The macro outlook is little change from 3 months ago. Our economists expect growth to moderate in 2022 with growth in Europe and many emerging markets improving while growth rates drop in the US and China.  Commodity prices have rebound due to strong retail sales, weather events in supply chain and balances. However, inflation pressures appear to be peaking with some emerging markets Central Banks raising rates, US Federal Reserve moving up its tapering timeline, and the ECB firmly on hold for now. Finally, Platts Analytics believes the current fundamentals should remain supportive of oil prices in the mid 70s. This is positive for the health of the oil industry. I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. While we have excellent Third Quarter results and an exciting merger pending, I would like to start my discussion today with our latest thinking around our merger synergy targets. There that has been an extensive effort throughout the Company to identify and validate potential merger synergies. While the initial synergy targets that we introduced at the time of the merger announcement were developed by a very limited number of senior managers, the latest figures take into consideration in depth planning and analysis by countless employees across both companies. We have increased our total synergy targets and now estimate that there will be $530-580 million of cost synergies and $330-360 million of revenue synergies. As you can see in the slide, these stakes into consideration new synergies identified as well as those who will no longer be able to achieve due to required divestitures.  Correspondingly, the proceeds of the divestitures will contribute to additional capacity for share repurchases. I'll also want to point out that on a run rate basis, we have already achieved approximately $25 million of these synergies. This is primarily from not back-filling open positions created through normal attrition. Today, we are only providing an update on the merger synergy targets. We'll give you a full update on the financial targets of the merged Company after we complete the transaction.  Turning to our third quarter financial results, Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses increased 18% due to Company-owned life insurance proceeds in the prior period. Our net interest expense improved 13% due to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our debt last year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to a refinement of tax accruals on foreign operations related to both a prior and current period. During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.02.  The only meaningful impact was in ratings where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $5 million. In the Second Quarter, we introduced three new categories to provide insights into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction costs. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees, and filing fees. The second category is integration costs. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure, and retention costs. The third category is cost to achieve.  These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees, and investments related to product development, marketing, and distribution enhancements. During the third quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $73 million. They included $9 million from merchant transaction costs, primarily legal fees, $45 million for merger integration costs, primarily consulting fees, a $3 million gain on the sale of an office building in India, and $21 million in deal-related amortization.  This quarter, all 4 deficient delivered solid gains in revenue and adjusted operating profit, with indices delivering the largest gains. On a trading four-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased in all 4 deficient with indices leading with a gain of 170 basis points. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment. Now, turning to the Balance Sheet, our Balance Sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8 times.  Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $2.6 billion in the first nine months of 2021, an increase of more than $300 million or 15% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been suspended. Now let's turn to the deficient results and begin with S&P Dow Jones Indices, which delivered extraordinary revenue growth of 28% primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. Please note that the ETF revenue included a $5 million break-up fee due to the termination of our indices as the basis for several ETFs.  In the third quarter, adjusted expenses increased 4% largely due to royalties and compensation partially offset by reduced legal costs. The adjusted segment operating profit increased a whopping 40% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 660 basis points to 71.8%. On a trailing four-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 170 basis points to 70.7%. Every category increased revenue this quarter, asset-linked fees increased 36% primarily from gains in ETF s, augmented by gains in mutual function insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity that exceeded 20%.  Exchange traded derivative revenue increased 15% on increased trading volumes at the [Indiscernible]. Data and custom subscriptions increased 8%. For our indices deficient over the past year, ETF net inflows were $223 billion and market appreciation totaled $524 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is 43% higher compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 48% year-over-year. Sequentially towards the end of the Second Quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $55 billion and market depreciation totaled $16 billion.  Exchange traded derivative activity was mixed during the quarter. Activity at the CBOE increased with S&P 500 Index options activity increasing 39% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 31% Activity at the CME Equity complex decreased 6% due primarily to a 22% decrease in [Indiscernible] volumes. Ratings delivered very strong revenue growth, increasing 14% with strength in bank loan ratings, structured finance, and non-transaction activity. Adjusted expenses increased 9% primarily due to increased salaries, headcounts at CRISIL, growth initiatives and incentives.  This resulted in a 17% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 160 basis points increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On the trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin, increased 40 basis points to 63.8%. In China, we see continued momentum and interest in our ratings. We completed 15 ratings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 46 compared to 22 in all last year. Non-transaction revenue increased 15% primarily due to growth in fees associated with surveillance, increased new entity ratings activity, Chrisol and Rating Evaluation Services revenue. Transaction revenue increased as a 150% increase in bank loan ratings activity and strong structure product issuance more than offset a decline in corporate bond issuance.  This slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in ratings revenue was the 48% increase in structured finance driven by CLOs, CMBS and the ADS. In addition, corporates increased 14%, financial services increased 8%, governments decreased 12%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. Market Intelligence delivered reported revenue growth of 7%, and 8% on an organic basis. More than 1/3 of the revenue growth was from recent product investments, which increased by 40% led by ESG and the S&P Global Marketplace, adjusted expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher investment spending, particularly in ESG, S&P Global marketplace, SME, and China, additional infrastructure spending, supporting our cloud initiatives, and S&P Capital IQ Pro, and data, which is primarily license fees tied to aftermarket research revenue.  Adjusted segment operating profit increased 13%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 35.7%. On the trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 90 basis points to 33.8%. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category. Desktop revenue grew 6%, Data Management Solutions revenue grew 12%, Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. And now turning to Platts, reported revenue increased 8%. Our core subscriptions increased 7%. It's notable that more than 1/3 of the growth came from new products primarily ESG and LNG. Global trading services had a great quarter, increasing 14% mainly due to strong LNG and petroleum volumes.  GTS activity often picks up when commodity prices become more volatile. Adjusted expenses increased 11% primarily due to growth initiatives, incentives, and commissions. In addition, expenses in the Third Quarter last year were aided by management actions. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 5% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 54.6%. The trailing four quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 55.6%.  Well, there was another revenue growth in every category, petrochemicals, natural gas, power and renewables, and shipping all delivered double-digit growth. Because the Company now anticipates closing the merger with IHS Markit in the first quarter of 2022, we're able to provide 2021 GAAP guidance for the first time. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance. The third column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that changed highlighted. We're making these changes primarily due to greater revenue growth in ratings and indices. Therefore, our revenue guidance is increased from high single-digit increase to a low double-digit increase.  Corporate unallocated is increased by $5 million to a new range of $140-150 million due to increased incentives and a charitable contribution. Operating profit margin is increased by a range of 40-60 basis points to a new range of 55-55.5%. This results in the $0.50 to $0.55 increase to adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $13.50 to $13.65. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.6 to $3.7 billion. In conclusion, 2021 is turning out to be an exceptionally strong year for the Company. All our businesses are delivering solid growth. We continue to expand our ESG product offerings, and we're making great progress on the upcoming merger with IHS Markit. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions.\nChip Merritt: Thank you. Just a couple of instructions for our phone participants. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to two questions in order allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open, ma'am.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. I just had a question on the Capital IQ Pro platform that you talked about. It seems like that's been in the works for some time, perhaps it's out a little bit later than you guys had anticipated. But just talk about how you think that improves your competitive positioning. Are there any changes in that [Indiscernible] of the market from the competitive angle.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Manav, this is Doug. Well, first of all, welcome everyone to the call. We had a lot to report today and then I'm pleased that you picked up that we've been able to launch the Capital IQ Pro platform. What it brings is its ability to, first of all, consolidate of many different information sources that we've had in the Company across the years. It has a much better interface if you've seen if you started using it. It also incorporates new Kensho capabilities and improves search.  It also has the data for ESG, it's easier to use for our risk services data. So across the board, it provides us with a competitive advantage of comprehensive data, ease-of-use, as well as new tools that make it easier to download data to move them into spreadsheets for chatting, etc. So we think it's an incremental leap forward and it gives us a much more competitive platform for the market.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then Doug, just on the issuance forecast for next year. I know you gave us the moving pieces by category, but just high level from a macro standpoint, I mean down 2% volume giving [inaudible 00:33:44] that bad compared to the strong two years that we've had. But the situation where you think the positives and negatives could be to that number.\nDoug Peterson: Yeah, this is something as you know, we've seen a really interesting mix of the issuance this year. You saw the very strong issuance in loans which is driven by M&A, we seeing so far in the quarter, we saw a drop of [Indiscernible] [inaudible 00:34:07] of 30%, while we saw an increase of structured finance of over 100%. So those are really big swings. We do see that the M&A activity should continue forward. There's a lot of M&A activity in the pipeline which would bode well for loan issuance. That's not something that's in the bond forecast itself, but in the bond forecast, we see that in Corporates, it's going to be down about 7%.  There continues to be a strong liquidity for those types of issuance. The trend is right now, there's not a very big pipeline of issuance of Corporates that we see. Financial Services had half strength the last couple of quarters. As you saw this quarter, Financial Institutions was up about 5%. In the U.S., it was actually up about 30%, so you did see some strength in that. So we do think that there's going to be some continuation up about 1% -- sorry, 1% for 2022.  For Structured Finance, we do think that there's going to be some continuation of interest in CLOs but I'm not sure if that will continue across all asset classes with about 3% increase. U.S. public finance are close to flat, around 2% up. And then finally, total, we look across all of those given the volume of corporates which went down 7%, that would bring the total down about 2% in 2022. And as we said on the call, this is a initial issuance forecasted bond. It's not a revenue forecast.\nManav Patnaik: Understood. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Manav.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, congratulations on the results. Doug, can you talk about ESG just within the context of longer-term opportunities. I mean, you're scaling it, it seems like the revenue was 24 million up from 22. And I think in the past, you talked about $100 million target and exceeding 300 million by 2024. You still comfortable with that, and is there a potential? Just put some takes on that as we think about bringing in IHS to the extent you can talk about that.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Kevin. This is Ewout. Let me first take the first part of your question and then I will hand it over to Doug. And --\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: First, with respect to the revenue outlook for ESG for the full year, yes, we are still expecting to come in approximately $100 million of revenues for the full year. And one of the reasons is that there is some seasonality with respect to some revenues. Usually it's a bit higher in the fourth quarter. So year-to-date that 67 million of ESG revenues. And again, then we expect this to go up in the fourth quarter to approximately 100 million for the full year. So we are on track with respect to our forecast. the 40% CAGR that we expect over the next few years. And you see that we have a lot of positive momentum, a lot of new product launches, a lot of new initiatives going on, a lot of investments in ESG initiatives. So let me hand it over here to Doug.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Kevin. Just a couple of points strategically in [Indiscernible], we have been able to put together the Sustainability1 Group under the leadership of Martina Chan (ph). And this has provided us with the ability to look across the entire organization for ways that we can link data and put together the latest needs for the market. As you saw, we launched the partnership with the Ford Foundation, Hamilton Lane, and [Indiscernible] for the Nevada platform for the private markets and private equity. So we're looking across all the different types of opportunities to bring ESG data into the market.  So you have the most transparency, the most comprehensive, consistent approach to providing those ESG solutions to the market. So this is something that we're looking at across the board in all the different aspects of how markets are starting to use ESG data. You should expect that we're going to continue to invest in this area. You should hear from us every quarter, that we've spent some money or invested in a different division to increase our sales force, our technical capabilities. And if you ask the question about where might we still be targeting some longer-term look at acquisitions, ESG would clearly be on that list.\nKevin McVeigh: Super helpful, and then just real quick, it seems like you're able to walk up the cost synergies and even the upper end of the revenue synergies, despite some additional divestments to get the deal over the goal line. Any thoughts on the broader categories of what the expense synergies are, and then, maybe, where some of that revenue comes in as well? Is that just your coming together, or just any thoughts as to what drove that upside there?\nEwout Steenbergen: Alright. Kevin, the short answer here it's that based on [Indiscernible] by large groups of people with a lot of rigor, substantiating synergy opportunities. We have been able to find a higher opportunities than we thought before. So let me expand a bit on that. You recall when we announced the transaction, we said that we had 350 million of revenue synergies and 480 million of cost synergies. That was based on very thorough process during due diligence. However, that was done by a smaller group of senior executives because, of course, a smaller group of people were aware that we're working on that transaction.  Since then, we have had work streams in place and four submission rounds with respect to synergies through a very rigorous process. And we have been able to look much deeper into all the synergy categories from integrating corporate functions, to optimizing real estate and technology, going very deep in procurement to clean room activities. Procurements, I already mentioned, eliminating duplicative costs, so many of those areas. And based on all of that very detailed work, we are confident now that you can raise those synergy targets, both for cost and revenues.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you so much, congrats again.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Andrew Nicolas with William Blair. Your line is open, sir.\nAndrew Nicolas: Great, thank you. Maybe I'll start with a follow-up to the last question, which is just on the timing of cost synergies. I believe, of the 480 that you'd outlined initially, 390 were expected in the first 2 years. This additional 100 or so, is that a first-two-year opportunity or is that part of a longer tail?\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Andrew. What we're looking at is very similar trajectories with respect to expense synergies and revenue synergies that we told you before. Three-year cost synergy ramp, which is more front end loaded, and then five-year ramp for revenue synergies, which is more gradual over the five-year period of time.\nAndrew Nicolas: Understood. Thank you. And then my next question, I appreciate you taking them, was just on the implied guidance for Fourth Quarter spend. Obviously after a really good quarter, it still looks like you're expecting more acceleration in spend. So I'm just wondering one, what the major drivers of that increase spend are in the Fourth Quarter, and then also as a jumping off point for 2022.\nEwout Steenbergen: Sure. Well, I have to be careful about 2022 because we're not providing guidance on that at this point in time. But let me give you some more details about the outlook for the remainder of the year. What you see, Andrew, is a bit of direction of different initiatives going in opposite directions. First, we have the productivity program where we take benefits so far this year from an expense growth perspective, as well as the pre -realized synergies on the S&P Global sites that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, and of course, we are also taking benefit from the operating leverage.  But what goes in the opposite direction is the strategic investments we are making in the strategic initiatives. For example, in ESG. For example, in the energy transition in Platts. And then also our variable expenses are going up. I consider those good expenses because they are directly linked to our sales levels and our revenue levels. So think about incentive compensation commissions and cost of sales. So we expect those underlying trends to continue in the Fourth Quarter.  Specifically, I would like to call out Platts because the Platts expenses might be a little higher in the Fourth Quarter, similar to what you saw in the Third Quarter, because here you see particularly those variable expenses being a bit higher as well as the investments in the new initiatives. But that is also paying off because, as we mentioned, 1/3 of the revenue growth in Platts is coming from those new products. I hope that's helpful.\nAndrew Nicolas: Yes, it is. Thanks a lot.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. My question was just around if you could just update us on the capital allocation framework going forward. I know the deal timeline is Q1. You also are planning how much free cash you're generating this year. Just update us on your thoughts on return of cash, post-deal closing. And then have the cost to achieve synergies changed at all with the updated cost synergy figures?\nEwout Steenbergen: I'm sorry. Good morning. So let me first take the capital return philosophy. You're absolutely right that we're building up significant cash as a Company. And our thinking about returning that, because obviously this is temporarily elevated. Returning that cash, the thinking about that is the following. First we have a catch up to do because for the last one and half years, we have not been able to do share buybacks.  And the same applies by the way, for IHS Markit, so IHS Markit can also not do share buyback so is also building up its cash position. Then what we should add is some of the proceeds of the divestitures that will help with the capital return capacity. And then very quickly after the completion of the transaction, we would like to move to our new capital return target of at least 85% of free cash flow.  So if you add up all of those pieces, then we're speaking about a very meaningful capital return number that we will be able to achieve after the completion of the transaction. I cannot give you a numerical answer on that right now, but what we are planning to do is give you the financial targets of the combined Company in the first quarter, again, after we complete the merger. With respect to your second part of the question the costs to achieve, so we're looking still at those 3 different categories with respect to our merger-related costs.  So we have transaction costs, integration costs, and cost to achieve. Cost to achieve in my view are, of course, the best category of costs because it's an investment to ultimately achieve those synergies. What we're looking at in terms of the overall best estimates with respect to the spend at the integration costs and the cost to achieve combined, we're looking at approximately 1.1 times the overall cost and revenue synergy. So that's our best estimate in terms of what the expected to spend for integration and cost to achieve but again, that is an investment in order to achieve ultimately those higher synergy numbers.\nHamzah Mazari: Very helpful, and my follow-up question, I'll turn it over as just -- around the China Ratings business. I know you outlined completing 15 domestic ratings, but do you view that environment as having changed for your business or not really? A lot of the headlines around China are a little more -- seems like it's tougher, but maybe it doesn't impact your business domestically, so just any thoughts there.\nDoug Peterson: Yeah, thanks, Hamzah. Nice to hear from you. And as you mentioned, we did complete 15 ratings in the third quarter. It's actually 46 year-to-date, and that compares to 2020 -- '22 and all of 2020, so we know that growth isn't going to be a straight line. There's a lot of interest in our ratings. As you see, there's some credit events taking place in China right now, and those are bringing a lot of attention to our ratings and our methodology, how we think about informing the market. We see a big uptick in people attending our webinars, downloading our research.  We've also been pleased that we've been able to wait companies across the entire credit sector from AAA-BBB and then different types of companies, financial structured products, and our first non-financial corporate. But more to your question about the environment, we continue to see the financial regulators are very interested in reforming and updating their financial markets. We would see that when it comes to the ratings industry that there's interest in seeing more from us.  They are talking about some reforms that would make the ratings industry more transparent, and make it change some of the floors for what would be defined as a non-investment-grade rating. But very importantly, we also see a whole slew of international financial firms getting licenses to operate 100% owned or more than 51% owned operations in China. Recently, Goldman Sachs received approval to take full ownership of its Securities, JV. Others include Fidelity, JP Morgan, City, BlackRock, etc. So we do think that in the financial markets, we see a very different rhetoric and a willingness to openly reform the markets compared to what you see some times in other parts of the markets.\nHamzah Mazari: Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Hamzah.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the divestitures and the $420 million of revenues for the divestitures. I believe the ones that are already announced, Opus, CMM and Petrochem, those 129 million. I just wanted to confirm if that number is still right. And I was wondering if you could provide any incremental details on the other businesses, any further details on revenues for other businesses. Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Ashish. Indeed, that number is still correct, approximately 125 million revenue for Opus and its related business -- businesses like the coal metals and mining. And as Doug said in his prepared remark, 425 million for all of the divestitures, including Opus combined.\nAshish Sabadra: Okay. Then that's helpful. And then just a question on the Capital IQ Pro. Obviously that's getting pretty good traction with the rollout there. My question was, how does that help you pose the integration with IHS Markit? Does it make it easier for you to cross-sell IHS data into the Cap IQ customer base with the rollout of the IQ Pro, a pretty solid rollout of the IQ -- Capital IQ Pro platform. Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Yeah, Ashish, it definitely does. Having the Capital IQ Pro developed and delivered is important to us. It gives us confidence of our ability to integrate new datasets. It also is something that's on the desktop of already 90,000 users, which is growing rapidly. We believe that that gives us the ability to integrate new datasets, as you know related to the Market Intelligence business, we also have the data marketplace, which has the tiles for different datasets which are already curated, have the contracts around them.  That's another aspect of the Market Intelligence business that is going incredibly well, that will help us integrate the data [Indiscernible] and the data products also of IHS Markit. The progress, technologically, was how we've moved our operations to the cloud, the upgrade and updates we've been doing to the back-end, as well as now the ability we've delivered that front-end of S&P Capital IQ Pro, are all going to help facilitate the integration.\nChip Merritt: Thanks, Ashish.\nAshish Sabadra: Sorry, go ahead.\nDoug Peterson: Well, thank you very much.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks, a lot. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. Wanted to switch over to the indices business. The performance has really been remarkable the past few quarters, and I think you've had three straight quarters of adjusted operating margin above 70%. Is that the new bar going forward? Is that sustainable?\nEwout Steenbergen: Hello, Jeff, this is Ewout. With respects to the outlook for margins for indices, I can only give you the outlook for 2021 and that is approximately 70% margin for the full year. And we will get back to you in the First Quarter when we do our Fourth Quarter earnings call with respect to specific guidance for 2022.\nJeff Silber: Okay. I thought I'd try, but thank you anyhow. And then just moving back to the merger, can you just remind us where we stand in terms of milestones, in terms of what we're looking for over the next few months.\nDoug Peterson: Let me take that and what we're looking over the next few months is to continue to meet the requirements that we've agreed with the regulators on where we're going to be divesting of some businesses so that we can close the transaction. As you saw this week or last week, we were able to reach some agreements with the EC for the approval of some conditions and what they call remedies, which include the divestiture of Opus that they include what's now the divestiture of CUSIP.  And then also LCD and loan indices. We have about six months from now to close the LCD and the loan indices and those are not conditions to close the transaction, CUSIP is. And then with the CMA in the UK, we also have the condition of the Opus transaction and now something else is being added that's called Base Chemicals. And we'll -- we heard from them this morning that in general, they approved of that as a remedy, that they would expect meets the needs. We also want to make sure that over the next 3 or 4 months that we have time to follow through on a very thorough and robust process to get full value for all of these divestitures.  So in a sense right now getting those divestitures, meeting the requirements of those regulators are the remedies that they saw that created competitive positions that they thought would be too strong including -- completing those divestitures is going to be the gating factor. But we also want to do it, as I said, in a way that's professional, robust, and we get full value. So you should be watching that. We'll be providing more information as things crop up that we can talk about, but be assured that this is something that's on the top of our list right now of things we have to get done.\nJeff Silber: Okay. I really appreciate the color. Thank you so much.\nEwout Steenbergen: If I may build on Doug 's answer, with respect to milestones, we also have, of course, the milestones around the merger planning process. And I think we're well underway, a lot of positive initiatives that are going on in both organizations. And we are looking at, for example, getting ready for day 1 and being able to operate as one combined Company on day 1: system integrations, people planning, synergies [Indiscernible]. So also a lot of milestones that we are working on So, the more overall planning process.\nJeff Silber: Thank you.\nChip Merritt: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. Wanted to ask about the recurring revenue within the Ratings Business. It's very strong again at 15%, fourth quarter of double-digit growth. Going forward, should we expect sort of a similar growth rate there? And just broadly, has there been any change from issuers when deciding whether to enter a frequent issuer program, especially as debt balances continue to rise, or has that not really changed at this point?\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Toni. Indeed, very positive -- continued positive revenue growth in the non-transaction category for ratings. And we also expect that to continue for the full year for the outlook for non-transaction revenue is now low double-digits growth. What you see is underneath is a couple of developments. First, we are seeing that surveillance fees are going up that is being helped last year by the very high level of bonds issuance activity.  And this year, of course, by bank loan rating activity, where we also are receiving surveillance fees. So indeed some part of that you may expect to also continue in the future beyond 2021. Then what we also see is a lot of activity with respect to initial credit ratings this year, rating evaluation surface, which is helped by the M&A environment, and then CRISIL also is doing very well and is also showing very healthy growth. So all of the underlying categories in loan transaction revenue doing very well.\nToni Kaplan: That's really helpful color. And just for my follow-up, given that, I know you're less exposed to some of the labor for pressures we're seeing across some of our diversified names. But that being said, can you comment on if you're seeing any headwinds on the labor side? Is it harder to find people just want to understand what's going on with your employment.\nEwout Steenbergen: Absolutely, Toni. We're monitoring this at very closely both indeed from a quality of people that we can attract and retain, as well as overall from a cost perspective because, of course, the largest cost category we have is staff cost as a Company is about 70% of our overall cost base. We by the way, see this both as a risk as -- and as an opportunity because it's -- there are a lot of people on the move in the labor markets. It's also a clear opportunity to pick up some really good talent as a Company [Indiscernible], with the hybrid working [Indiscernible] that we are introducing, we also think that it is attractive as an employer that we can offer that.  And it also offers up on the possibility to look at talent in a much wider geographical area that we're looking at before so we're closely monitoring this. At this point in time, our economist believe that the inflation pressure should be transitory. So that's more our base case, but we're definitely running stress tests to think about if inflation would be more permanent, what that would mean for the Company, and what management actions we can take.\nToni Kaplan: That's great. Thank you so much.\nChip Merritt: Thanks, Toni.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open, sir.\nCraig Huber: Hi, my first question. Typically you guys raise prices on average 3% to 4% per year. For your legacy business this year, is that a reasonable range, and is there any areas around that are significantly higher or lower than that? Then I'll have a follow-up. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Craig, as you know, we typically will price somewhere around 2, 3%. We try to look at what are the trends in the markets on inflation, but that's -- would continue to be our expectation going forward but we don't have any further guidance or update on that right now.\nCraig Huber: Okay. Then my other question, Doug, your outlook for debt issuance this upcoming years, I guess, down 2% excludes bank loans, if I heard you right. Can you just comment if you would, what's your best assessment, how you think bank loan issuance will do next year given the huge strength you guys have seen this year? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: I don't have a bank loan issuance forecast from the team. And I do -- I would only say that we do see a very strong pipeline for M&A and LBOs. That is always one of the most important elements that figures into that. But we'll be providing more guidance on that, at our next Earnings Call.\nCraig Huber: Thank you.\nChip Merritt: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir.\nAndrew Steinerman: I'll be quick. Ewout, could you just help us a little bit more understanding of the fourth quarter? Just a comment about the four segments and how they are likely to do on an organic revenue growth basis to puzzle in to the full-year '21 guide that you gave on Slide 43.\nEwout Steenbergen: Sure. Andrew. We're looking now at outlook with respect to revenue growth for our decisions. The Index business, double-digits, revenue growth ratings, low double-digits, We have Platts at high single-digits, and we have MI at mid-to-high single digits. And then with respect to the margin outlook for the full year, we have, as I said before, indices around 70%, ratings mid 60s, Platts mid 50s, and then MI mid 30s. Continued positive momentum, healthy top-line growth, and healthy margins for all of our segments.\nAndrew Steinerman: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nDoug Peterson: That's been a full year. [Indiscernible]\nEwout Steenbergen: Those are full-year, correct.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. We'll puzzle into fourth quarter. Thanks for highlighting that, appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you for the question. Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks Good morning. Are you now increased your guidance for debt issuance and ratings revenue three quarters in a row, well why shouldn't the factors that drove up performance persist into 2022.\nDoug Peterson: I don't have any reason whatsoever to try to give a forecast in 2022 right now that goes beyond what our own team, who are the people in the markets every day, have looked at. Clearly, there's a lot of factors which go into the decision of organizations to issue debt or to undertake an M&A deal and what sort of instrument did they undertake to finance it with whether it's a loan, how it gets packaged in CLO, et c? There is a lot of liquidity in the market. We do see a strong M&A pipeline right now and so those are things that will factor in when we bring you the full year update in our guidance on our next earnings call.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. Got it. You increased your synergy target associated with the info merger. Which businesses do you expect these incremental synergies to come from, predominantly, or is it relatively evenly spaced across the business?\nEwout Steenbergen: George, it will be across the board in many different categories, in all of the segments, as well as also in the functional areas. Let me give you a couple examples of that so that you can get more the feel behind it. First, a lot of work has been underway in what we call the procurements clean room. About 2.5 billion of spend of both companies has been analyzed, there are 25,000 active contracts, and that has led to some opportunities -- further opportunities that have been identified.  Also, there is a clean room for cross-sell, and we have filed about 200 synergies with respect to cross-sell food at clean room activity. And then what we did not expect before were shortened synergy benefits from segments that we basically did not have on the list before. So we now have synergies also being identified in ratings, in transportation, in CME, and in Crystal. So those are a couple of examples, but I would say in general, really more opportunities in all of the areas across both organizations. And of course, tend to combined Company in the future.\nGeorge Tong: Great. Thank you.\nChip Merritt: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.\nOwen Lau: Thank you. I'll be quick. Could you please talk about the rationale behind how you came down to the conclusion to divest CUSIP and LCD? And then are all these divestitures contingent to the completion of the INFO deal? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thank you, Owen. Well, as you know, these are businesses that the EC and the CMA have looked at with a lot of depth. They go to the market, they go to market participants to ask them to look at the businesses as we bring them together and to give them feedback as to what would be the competitiveness of those businesses. So when it comes to the discussion with the EC, they determined that CUSIP and LCD, and the loan indices would create some sort of an additional competitive advantage.  And in the discussions with them, and looking at their understanding of belief through the market position, we agreed that that would be a remedy that would meet their needs to ensure that we didn't have a dominant position in the markets. So this is a -- this is something that they looked at. You can actually read their letter that has been published, that they have the -- they have a very short couple of paragraphs that described their views of that and how they feel about it.  But they've also given us what they call an approval with conditions which we think was a very positive aspect. Similarly with the CMA, they go to the markets, they listen to market participants, and they came back with the discussion about the Base Chemicals business that would also create a competitive issue in the UK. And in discussions in negotiations with them, we also agreed that that would be a condition that we would meet in order to get approval on the transaction.  So these are what the regulators do, they look at the market, they speak with market participants, and then we discuss these with them. And in these cases, we've agreed that we would make these divestitures in order to close the deal. You asked about conditionality. It's our understanding in the case of the CMA, we would need to have a buyer identified, that they would that they would vet, of the Base Chemicals business and also the OPIS business, in which we already have a buyer, and in the case of the EC, we'd have to have a buyer identified for the OPIS and related businesses, which we already have, and then for CUSIP, we'd have to have a buyer we have identified and vetted before we can close the deal. But for LCD and loan indices, we have six months from now, and we could close the deal without having a buyer for that transaction.\nOwen Lau: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nChip Merritt: Thanks, Owen.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open, sir.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. On the Cap IQ and Platts upgraded platforms, as you upgrade an existing client, is there incremental revenue at the point of upgrade or is this all about driving usage and then you capture the better monetization on the back-end. And then on the expense side, is there a sizable opportunity to save on costs as you censored some of the legacy platforms eventually?\nDoug Peterson: There's a few aspects to this. One is related to something you mentioned and that is that as we improve our capabilities and make it easier to find data, to search it, to chart it, to download it, etc. That makes the products more sticky, it makes more people are use the product, it brings more people to the platform, which is a virtuous cycle which then allows us to have a stronger negotiations when it comes to price increases. So there is not necessarily a direct increase that comes from the launch of these platforms, but it does give us a virtual cycle. In addition, it makes it easier for -- to plug-in and add new datasets which do sometimes bring new contracts and new revenue along with those.  In addition, you asked about the expense side of this. As we redeploy resources from turning off and changing older platforms, it allows us to either have an expense save or in many cases it allows us to redeploy those programmers and developers into areas where the highest growth opportunities, like what we've talked about earlier, something on ESG, private markets are the areas that we're quite excited about with the merger with IHS Markit, how we're going to be able to bring energy transition products, further credit in this products, etc. We can get some savings but also look at how we're going to redeploy our development talent to the highest opportunities for the future growth.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nChip Merritt: Thank you. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open, Sir.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Ewout, I apologize if I missed this but the divested businesses I heard are going to be 425 million in revenue. But what would the EBIT or EBITDA of those businesses be on a collective basis.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, Shlomo. Good morning. No, we haven't mentioned that specifically. But what Doug said during his prepared remarks is that the margins on these businesses are higher than the margins of the respective segments where these businesses are reported today. So these are businesses with a bit higher margins than you see on average. And however, if you think about it, the revenues of those 4 businesses is approximately 4% of the revenues off the proforma combined Company. So they are four, the overall impact on the margins of the Company is relatively modest. And then also take into consideration that the overall synergy numbers we have moved up with these announcements.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: If the synergies are moving up, so does that go until offset -- in other words, how should I think of the offset? Should I think of it in terms of the share repurchases is going to be the primary offset, or some of the increased synergies? How are you guys thinking of that in terms of the lost [Indiscernible].\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. The way to think about it is maybe 3 elements. So you could say the starting point for the combined Company, the margins are slightly, modestly lower, based on these divestments. But then we will see two positives coming out of it. One is higher synergy opportunity which will help to drive the margin stand further up in the future, as well as the proceeds of these divestments will help with additional buyback capacity, which is also of course, a positive thing for the EPS, in order to offset the lost earnings.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you for your line to follow-up. Just one thing I haven't heard before was a termination fee on ETFs. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit more. Are they going to internal indices that they're creating on their own or what happened all of a sudden?\nDoug Peterson: As you know, in the index business occasionally, an organization will rebalance or maybe they might bring together some indices and switch to another party. And when we have a contract in place with an index provider that our -- sorry, ETF provider diffusing our index if they switch, it could be the built in the contract there's an early cancellation fee and that would be the case that we saw during this quarter.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. We will now take our final question from Alex Kramm with UBS. Sir, you may ask your question.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just one quick follow-up on the upside to synergies. Can you -- I know you've given a lot of color, but can you give a little bit more detail in terms of what you were able to look into now given that the deal is not close d and what is still prevented? I guess what I'm asking, and I know I'm getting ahead of myself here, what further synergy opportunities may be out there that you haven't been able to tackle? As for example, you may look at the IHS Markit stand-alone cost base a little bit further once you own the Company. What are the things that you already have in your mind that you're just not willing to put numbers around yet? And again, I know I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit. Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, Alex, and really appreciate your joining the call today. I think you should see this in the following way. We do have, of course, certain restrictions legally with respect to how far we can look into certain details with respect to financials in terms of commercial agreements, in terms of procurement agreements, because the two Companies are still run as standalone entities at this point in time. So the way -- how you can solve for that partially is through so-called clean rooms, where you have a separate segregated area where people can look into those particular details, that can never be shared with any of the respective organizations.  So definitely, after we are able to complete the transaction, we have an opportunity to look even more deeper into all of that and further make those synergy numbers more robust compared to what we have now. But again, as I said before, we think that we have a very rigorous process in place. We have already had four submission rounds, bottom up substantiation of all of the synergies, we'll have a fifth around before the ultimate completion of their transaction. And then definitely of course, we'll then learn more after we can start to operate as a combined Company.\nAlex Kramm: All right. Well, thank you very much. That's it from me.\nDoug Peterson: Great. Thank you, Alex. I'm going to make some closing remarks. And first of all, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. And as you saw, we had very strong performance in the third quarter. We delivered exceptional financial results with a 13% topline growth and adjusted diluted EPS of 24% growth. We launched new product platforms, we advanced our ESG propositions and many, many more things going on.  And as we're able to talk about, we're moving forward on the IHS Markit merger. This is something that we're very excited about. The path towards regulatory approval is getting clear. We now have to execute on the divestitures that we discussed today to achieve the full value, but also, we don't want to rush. We want to have time to close and also to make sure that we can execute those transactions well.\nDoug Peterson: Well, as you know, we also have integration planning going on which is identifying synergies. But more importantly, it's also identifying strategies for our businesses. How we're going to work together, how we are going to address the needs of our customers, how we're going to be bringing together technology and very importantly data. And then most importantly, our people and our culture, and all of this work is going extremely well. But today on this call, I also want to thank our people.  They've been working now for 600 days. It sounds like a lot, it's 600 days people been working from home and working remotely, starting to come back to the offices. And when they do, I'd love to welcome them depending on which offices we're around the world. But our people have been dedicated, they've been working hard. They may be able to deliver the kind of results that you saw earlier as well as work on this exciting transformation for the Company with the merger. They've been diligent.  They're helping rethink and reimagine the future of the work. And I want to thank them for all of their dedication and commitment to making this Company what it is and looking forward to the future for building an even better Company. And then finally, I want to thank everyone on the call, the analysts for your questions, and also the shareholders for your support. And thank you very much looking forward to a great Fourth Quarter and the holidays at the end of the year. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes this morning's call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. While we have excellent Third Quarter results and an exciting merger pending, I would like to start my discussion today with our latest thinking around our merger synergy targets. There that has been an extensive effort throughout the Company to identify and validate potential merger synergies. While the initial synergy targets that we introduced at the time of the merger announcement were developed by a very limited number of senior managers, the latest figures take into consideration in depth planning and analysis by countless employees across both companies. We have increased our total synergy targets and now estimate that there will be $530-580 million of cost synergies and $330-360 million of revenue synergies. As you can see in the slide, these stakes into consideration new synergies identified as well as those who will no longer be able to achieve due to required divestitures.  Correspondingly, the proceeds of the divestitures will contribute to additional capacity for share repurchases. I'll also want to point out that on a run rate basis, we have already achieved approximately $25 million of these synergies. This is primarily from not back-filling open positions created through normal attrition. Today, we are only providing an update on the merger synergy targets. We'll give you a full update on the financial targets of the merged Company after we complete the transaction.  Turning to our third quarter financial results, Doug covered the highlights of strong revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses increased 18% due to Company-owned life insurance proceeds in the prior period. Our net interest expense improved 13% due to the refinancing of a substantial portion of our debt last year. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to a refinement of tax accruals on foreign operations related to both a prior and current period. During the quarter, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact on adjusted EPS of $0.02.  The only meaningful impact was in ratings where adjusted operating profit was positively impacted by $5 million. In the Second Quarter, we introduced three new categories to provide insights into the type of expenses that are going to be incurred related to the pending merger. The first category is transaction costs. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees, and filing fees. The second category is integration costs. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure, and retention costs. The third category is cost to achieve.  These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease terminations, severance, contract exit fees, and investments related to product development, marketing, and distribution enhancements. During the third quarter, the non-GAAP adjustments collectively totaled to a net pretax loss of $73 million. They included $9 million from merchant transaction costs, primarily legal fees, $45 million for merger integration costs, primarily consulting fees, a $3 million gain on the sale of an office building in India, and $21 million in deal-related amortization.  This quarter, all 4 deficient delivered solid gains in revenue and adjusted operating profit, with indices delivering the largest gains. On a trading four-quarter basis, adjusted operating profit margin increased in all 4 deficient with indices leading with a gain of 170 basis points. I'll provide color on the individual business results in a moment. Now, turning to the Balance Sheet, our Balance Sheet continues to be very strong with low leverage and ample liquidity. We have cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion and debt of $4.1 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA improved since the end of last year to 1.8 times.  Free cash flow, excluding certain items, was $2.6 billion in the first nine months of 2021, an increase of more than $300 million or 15% over the prior year period. Due to the pending merger with IHS Markit, share repurchases have been suspended. Now let's turn to the deficient results and begin with S&P Dow Jones Indices, which delivered extraordinary revenue growth of 28% primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. Please note that the ETF revenue included a $5 million break-up fee due to the termination of our indices as the basis for several ETFs.  In the third quarter, adjusted expenses increased 4% largely due to royalties and compensation partially offset by reduced legal costs. The adjusted segment operating profit increased a whopping 40% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 660 basis points to 71.8%. On a trailing four-quarter basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 170 basis points to 70.7%. Every category increased revenue this quarter, asset-linked fees increased 36% primarily from gains in ETF s, augmented by gains in mutual function insurance and over-the-counter derivative activity that exceeded 20%.  Exchange traded derivative revenue increased 15% on increased trading volumes at the [Indiscernible]. Data and custom subscriptions increased 8%. For our indices deficient over the past year, ETF net inflows were $223 billion and market appreciation totaled $524 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is 43% higher compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 48% year-over-year. Sequentially towards the end of the Second Quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $55 billion and market depreciation totaled $16 billion.  Exchange traded derivative activity was mixed during the quarter. Activity at the CBOE increased with S&P 500 Index options activity increasing 39% and fixed futures and options activity increasing 31% Activity at the CME Equity complex decreased 6% due primarily to a 22% decrease in [Indiscernible] volumes. Ratings delivered very strong revenue growth, increasing 14% with strength in bank loan ratings, structured finance, and non-transaction activity. Adjusted expenses increased 9% primarily due to increased salaries, headcounts at CRISIL, growth initiatives and incentives.  This resulted in a 17% increase in adjusted segment operating profit and a 160 basis points increase in adjusted segment operating profit margin. On the trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin, increased 40 basis points to 63.8%. In China, we see continued momentum and interest in our ratings. We completed 15 ratings in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 46 compared to 22 in all last year. Non-transaction revenue increased 15% primarily due to growth in fees associated with surveillance, increased new entity ratings activity, Chrisol and Rating Evaluation Services revenue. Transaction revenue increased as a 150% increase in bank loan ratings activity and strong structure product issuance more than offset a decline in corporate bond issuance.  This slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor to the increase in ratings revenue was the 48% increase in structured finance driven by CLOs, CMBS and the ADS. In addition, corporates increased 14%, financial services increased 8%, governments decreased 12%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. Market Intelligence delivered reported revenue growth of 7%, and 8% on an organic basis. More than 1/3 of the revenue growth was from recent product investments, which increased by 40% led by ESG and the S&P Global Marketplace, adjusted expenses increased 4% primarily due to higher investment spending, particularly in ESG, S&P Global marketplace, SME, and China, additional infrastructure spending, supporting our cloud initiatives, and S&P Capital IQ Pro, and data, which is primarily license fees tied to aftermarket research revenue.  Adjusted segment operating profit increased 13%, and the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 35.7%. On the trailing four-quarter basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 90 basis points to 33.8%. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category. Desktop revenue grew 6%, Data Management Solutions revenue grew 12%, Credit Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. And now turning to Platts, reported revenue increased 8%. Our core subscriptions increased 7%. It's notable that more than 1/3 of the growth came from new products primarily ESG and LNG. Global trading services had a great quarter, increasing 14% mainly due to strong LNG and petroleum volumes.  GTS activity often picks up when commodity prices become more volatile. Adjusted expenses increased 11% primarily due to growth initiatives, incentives, and commissions. In addition, expenses in the Third Quarter last year were aided by management actions. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 5% and the adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 54.6%. The trailing four quarter adjusted segment operating profit margin increased 70 basis points to 55.6%.  Well, there was another revenue growth in every category, petrochemicals, natural gas, power and renewables, and shipping all delivered double-digit growth. Because the Company now anticipates closing the merger with IHS Markit in the first quarter of 2022, we're able to provide 2021 GAAP guidance for the first time. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our adjusted guidance. The third column shows our new 2021 adjusted guidance with all the line items that changed highlighted. We're making these changes primarily due to greater revenue growth in ratings and indices. Therefore, our revenue guidance is increased from high single-digit increase to a low double-digit increase.  Corporate unallocated is increased by $5 million to a new range of $140-150 million due to increased incentives and a charitable contribution. Operating profit margin is increased by a range of 40-60 basis points to a new range of 55-55.5%. This results in the $0.50 to $0.55 increase to adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $13.50 to $13.65. And finally, free cash flow generation has been increased by $100 million to a range of $3.6 to $3.7 billion. In conclusion, 2021 is turning out to be an exceptionally strong year for the Company. All our businesses are delivering solid growth. We continue to expand our ESG product offerings, and we're making great progress on the upcoming merger with IHS Markit. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chip for your questions. Good morning, Kevin. This is Ewout. Let me first take the first part of your question and then I will hand it over to Doug. And -- First, with respect to the revenue outlook for ESG for the full year, yes, we are still expecting to come in approximately $100 million of revenues for the full year. And one of the reasons is that there is some seasonality with respect to some revenues. Usually it's a bit higher in the fourth quarter. So year-to-date that 67 million of ESG revenues. And again, then we expect this to go up in the fourth quarter to approximately 100 million for the full year. So we are on track with respect to our forecast. the 40% CAGR that we expect over the next few years. And you see that we have a lot of positive momentum, a lot of new product launches, a lot of new initiatives going on, a lot of investments in ESG initiatives. So let me hand it over here to Doug. Alright. Kevin, the short answer here it's that based on [Indiscernible] by large groups of people with a lot of rigor, substantiating synergy opportunities. We have been able to find a higher opportunities than we thought before. So let me expand a bit on that. You recall when we announced the transaction, we said that we had 350 million of revenue synergies and 480 million of cost synergies. That was based on very thorough process during due diligence. However, that was done by a smaller group of senior executives because, of course, a smaller group of people were aware that we're working on that transaction.  Since then, we have had work streams in place and four submission rounds with respect to synergies through a very rigorous process. And we have been able to look much deeper into all the synergy categories from integrating corporate functions, to optimizing real estate and technology, going very deep in procurement to clean room activities. Procurements, I already mentioned, eliminating duplicative costs, so many of those areas. And based on all of that very detailed work, we are confident now that you can raise those synergy targets, both for cost and revenues. Thanks Kevin. Good morning, Andrew. What we're looking at is very similar trajectories with respect to expense synergies and revenue synergies that we told you before. Three-year cost synergy ramp, which is more front end loaded, and then five-year ramp for revenue synergies, which is more gradual over the five-year period of time. Sure. Well, I have to be careful about 2022 because we're not providing guidance on that at this point in time. But let me give you some more details about the outlook for the remainder of the year. What you see, Andrew, is a bit of direction of different initiatives going in opposite directions. First, we have the productivity program where we take benefits so far this year from an expense growth perspective, as well as the pre -realized synergies on the S&P Global sites that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, and of course, we are also taking benefit from the operating leverage.  But what goes in the opposite direction is the strategic investments we are making in the strategic initiatives. For example, in ESG. For example, in the energy transition in Platts. And then also our variable expenses are going up. I consider those good expenses because they are directly linked to our sales levels and our revenue levels. So think about incentive compensation commissions and cost of sales. So we expect those underlying trends to continue in the Fourth Quarter.  Specifically, I would like to call out Platts because the Platts expenses might be a little higher in the Fourth Quarter, similar to what you saw in the Third Quarter, because here you see particularly those variable expenses being a bit higher as well as the investments in the new initiatives. But that is also paying off because, as we mentioned, 1/3 of the revenue growth in Platts is coming from those new products. I hope that's helpful. I'm sorry. Good morning. So let me first take the capital return philosophy. You're absolutely right that we're building up significant cash as a Company. And our thinking about returning that, because obviously this is temporarily elevated. Returning that cash, the thinking about that is the following. First we have a catch up to do because for the last one and half years, we have not been able to do share buybacks.  And the same applies by the way, for IHS Markit, so IHS Markit can also not do share buyback so is also building up its cash position. Then what we should add is some of the proceeds of the divestitures that will help with the capital return capacity. And then very quickly after the completion of the transaction, we would like to move to our new capital return target of at least 85% of free cash flow.  So if you add up all of those pieces, then we're speaking about a very meaningful capital return number that we will be able to achieve after the completion of the transaction. I cannot give you a numerical answer on that right now, but what we are planning to do is give you the financial targets of the combined Company in the first quarter, again, after we complete the merger. With respect to your second part of the question the costs to achieve, so we're looking still at those 3 different categories with respect to our merger-related costs.  So we have transaction costs, integration costs, and cost to achieve. Cost to achieve in my view are, of course, the best category of costs because it's an investment to ultimately achieve those synergies. What we're looking at in terms of the overall best estimates with respect to the spend at the integration costs and the cost to achieve combined, we're looking at approximately 1.1 times the overall cost and revenue synergy. So that's our best estimate in terms of what the expected to spend for integration and cost to achieve but again, that is an investment in order to achieve ultimately those higher synergy numbers. Good morning, Ashish. Indeed, that number is still correct, approximately 125 million revenue for Opus and its related business -- businesses like the coal metals and mining. And as Doug said in his prepared remark, 425 million for all of the divestitures, including Opus combined. Hello, Jeff, this is Ewout. With respects to the outlook for margins for indices, I can only give you the outlook for 2021 and that is approximately 70% margin for the full year. And we will get back to you in the First Quarter when we do our Fourth Quarter earnings call with respect to specific guidance for 2022. If I may build on Doug 's answer, with respect to milestones, we also have, of course, the milestones around the merger planning process. And I think we're well underway, a lot of positive initiatives that are going on in both organizations. And we are looking at, for example, getting ready for day 1 and being able to operate as one combined Company on day 1: system integrations, people planning, synergies [Indiscernible]. So also a lot of milestones that we are working on So, the more overall planning process. Good morning, Toni. Indeed, very positive -- continued positive revenue growth in the non-transaction category for ratings. And we also expect that to continue for the full year for the outlook for non-transaction revenue is now low double-digits growth. What you see is underneath is a couple of developments. First, we are seeing that surveillance fees are going up that is being helped last year by the very high level of bonds issuance activity.  And this year, of course, by bank loan rating activity, where we also are receiving surveillance fees. So indeed some part of that you may expect to also continue in the future beyond 2021. Then what we also see is a lot of activity with respect to initial credit ratings this year, rating evaluation surface, which is helped by the M&A environment, and then CRISIL also is doing very well and is also showing very healthy growth. So all of the underlying categories in loan transaction revenue doing very well. Absolutely, Toni. We're monitoring this at very closely both indeed from a quality of people that we can attract and retain, as well as overall from a cost perspective because, of course, the largest cost category we have is staff cost as a Company is about 70% of our overall cost base. We by the way, see this both as a risk as -- and as an opportunity because it's -- there are a lot of people on the move in the labor markets. It's also a clear opportunity to pick up some really good talent as a Company [Indiscernible], with the hybrid working [Indiscernible] that we are introducing, we also think that it is attractive as an employer that we can offer that.  And it also offers up on the possibility to look at talent in a much wider geographical area that we're looking at before so we're closely monitoring this. At this point in time, our economist believe that the inflation pressure should be transitory. So that's more our base case, but we're definitely running stress tests to think about if inflation would be more permanent, what that would mean for the Company, and what management actions we can take. Sure. Andrew. We're looking now at outlook with respect to revenue growth for our decisions. The Index business, double-digits, revenue growth ratings, low double-digits, We have Platts at high single-digits, and we have MI at mid-to-high single digits. And then with respect to the margin outlook for the full year, we have, as I said before, indices around 70%, ratings mid 60s, Platts mid 50s, and then MI mid 30s. Continued positive momentum, healthy top-line growth, and healthy margins for all of our segments. Those are full-year, correct. George, it will be across the board in many different categories, in all of the segments, as well as also in the functional areas. Let me give you a couple examples of that so that you can get more the feel behind it. First, a lot of work has been underway in what we call the procurements clean room. About 2.5 billion of spend of both companies has been analyzed, there are 25,000 active contracts, and that has led to some opportunities -- further opportunities that have been identified.  Also, there is a clean room for cross-sell, and we have filed about 200 synergies with respect to cross-sell food at clean room activity. And then what we did not expect before were shortened synergy benefits from segments that we basically did not have on the list before. So we now have synergies also being identified in ratings, in transportation, in CME, and in Crystal. So those are a couple of examples, but I would say in general, really more opportunities in all of the areas across both organizations. And of course, tend to combined Company in the future. Thanks, Shlomo. Good morning. No, we haven't mentioned that specifically. But what Doug said during his prepared remarks is that the margins on these businesses are higher than the margins of the respective segments where these businesses are reported today. So these are businesses with a bit higher margins than you see on average. And however, if you think about it, the revenues of those 4 businesses is approximately 4% of the revenues off the proforma combined Company. So they are four, the overall impact on the margins of the Company is relatively modest. And then also take into consideration that the overall synergy numbers we have moved up with these announcements. Yes. The way to think about it is maybe 3 elements. So you could say the starting point for the combined Company, the margins are slightly, modestly lower, based on these divestments. But then we will see two positives coming out of it. One is higher synergy opportunity which will help to drive the margin stand further up in the future, as well as the proceeds of these divestments will help with additional buyback capacity, which is also of course, a positive thing for the EPS, in order to offset the lost earnings. Thanks, Alex, and really appreciate your joining the call today. I think you should see this in the following way. We do have, of course, certain restrictions legally with respect to how far we can look into certain details with respect to financials in terms of commercial agreements, in terms of procurement agreements, because the two Companies are still run as standalone entities at this point in time. So the way -- how you can solve for that partially is through so-called clean rooms, where you have a separate segregated area where people can look into those particular details, that can never be shared with any of the respective organizations.  So definitely, after we are able to complete the transaction, we have an opportunity to look even more deeper into all of that and further make those synergy numbers more robust compared to what we have now. But again, as I said before, we think that we have a very rigorous process in place. We have already had four submission rounds, bottom up substantiation of all of the synergies, we'll have a fifth around before the ultimate completion of their transaction. And then definitely of course, we'll then learn more after we can start to operate as a combined Company."

            "name": "Doug Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Chip. Welcome to today's third quarter Earnings Call. I'd like to start with some of the highlights of the quarter. We reported exceptional financial results with revenue increasing 13%, and all 4 businesses delivering strong revenue and adjusted operating profit growth. Indices delivered the strongest revenue growth for the second straight quarter due to large gains in ETF AUM. Adjusted expenses increased 7%, largely due to investment spending, commissions, and royalties.  After raising guidance on both the first quarter and second quarter earnings calls, we're raising 2021 guidance again, based on these strong results and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Ewout will provide details in a moment. I'd also like to share some additional highlights from the third quarter. The most important initiative of the year continues to be our upcoming merger with IHS Markit.  This is an incredibly transformative opportunity for our Company and our customers. The regulatory path to closing the merger's now becoming clear. We launched S&P Capital IQ Pro and Platts Dimensions Pro. And sustainable one, our ESG business is gaining momentum as we build internal capabilities and product offerings expand. I'll come back to all of these highlights in more detail, but let's start with the merger.  When we announced the merger November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in five jurisdictions, Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We've made substantial progress with all these regulators and there are number of remedies we must undertake in order to complete the merger. IHS Markit must divest the OPIS, the Coal, Metals and Mining, and the Petchem Wire businesses. The sale of these assets to News Corp has already been announced. In addition, IHS Markit must divest its Base Chemicals business. S&P Global must divest CUSIP Global Services, and leverage commentary and data together with related family of leveraged loan indices. S&P Global and IHS Markit will begin the process of selling these additional businesses shortly. In order to provide time to undertake these sales processes, we now expect to close the merger in the first quarter of 2022.  Collectively, the revenue from all of the businesses being divested is approximately $425 million, and the margins for each of these businesses are higher than the margins for each of the divisions they're in. In a moment, EVA will provide an update on our merger synergy expectations, and you will see that despite these divestitures, we're raising both our cost and revenue synergy targets. To recap the financial results for the third quarter, revenue increased 13% to $2.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit increased 18% and our adjusted operating profit margin increased 250 basis points to 55.4%. As you know, we measure and track adjusted operating profit margin on a trailing four quarter basis, which increased 130 basis points to 55.1%. As a result, our adjusted diluted EPS increased 24%.  Each quarter, we highlight a few key business drivers and important projects underway. This quarter, let's start with ratings bond issuance trends. During the third quarter, global bond issuance increased 3%. In the U.S., bond issuance in Aggregate increased 6% as Investment Grade decreased 12%, High Yield decreased 16%, Public Finance decreased 24%, while Structured Finance increased 105% due to large increases in every category, particularly CLOs which increased 340%.  European bond issuance increased 4% as Investment-grade decreased 7%, high yield decreased 4%, and structured finance increased 70% with gains in every asset class, except RMBS. Of particular note, CMBS increased 375%. In Asia, bond issuance decreased 2% overall. The data on this slide only depicts bond issuance when we include new bank loan volumes, overall global issuance increased 9%. The next two slides look at the combined high-yield issuance and leveraged loan volume for the U.S. and Europe. Data is not readily available for the rest of the world. This slide shows that the combination of global leveraged loan and high yield issuance in the third quarter, continued to be very strong, surpassing every quarter in 2018. '19, and '20. This slide depicts the combination of high yield issuance and leveraged loan volume by the use of proceeds of the funds raised. This quarter, both general corporate purpose and refinancing-related issuance was lower than the third quarter of 2020. The surge in activity is entirely due to M&A, LBOs, buybacks, and dividends. These are opportunistic categories that aren't pull-forward. The surge in issuance is not pulling forward issuance from future years, and it's additive to future financing needs. Since bank loan ratings are an important element of ratings revenue, we like to disclose our bank loan ratings revenue each quarter.  The unprecedented strength of bank loan ratings revenue continued in the third quarter, and year-to-date revenues already surpassed any of the previous 10 full years. The leverage loan market and the CLO market are dependent on one another as many of the leverage loans end up CLOs. As you can see here, CLO issuance continued to accelerate in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we rebranded our market intelligence platform as S&P Capital IQ Pro. This recognizes the value of the Capital IQ brand as we continue to upgrade the platform with additional content and functionality. We currently have approximately 290,000 active desktop users of which 90,000 are utilizing S&P Capital IQ Pro.  The inaugural release of S&P Capital IQ Pro includes a number of capabilities not found in the market intelligence platform. A new Kensho -enabled document viewer incorporates AI -based search to speed up users' discovery of tech space insights across filings in transcripts. It's based on technology that Kensho originally developed for U.S. security and military agencies, and is now re-engineered for S&P Capital IQ Pro. For example, it gives investors the ability to quickly screen comments made over years of earnings calls within minutes. The new platform features frequent coverage of private markets, including data around fundraising trends, dry powder, fund performance, and LP Investor allocations.  Also included is the ability for users to screen on non-traditional industry criteria, such as crypto, therapeutics and cleantech. S&P Capital IQ Pro also includes ratings, direct coverage of corporate and financial institutions. Our users can now incorporate a full suite of S&P Capital IQ pro tools and functionality and interact with S&P Global ratings content in ways not previously possible. Platts has been on a long journey to consolidate its product platforms as well. With the acquisitions of Bentek, Eclipse [Indiscernible], Petromedia, and others. There has been a tremendous effort to consolidate all of these capabilities into a single platform.  This quarter, Platts introduced Platts Dimensions Pro, which provides users with a seamless one-stop shop experience across Platt's benchmark price assessments, news, and analytics, spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. And like S&P Capital IQ Pro, this content is available on a web-based portal that is mobile-friendly, via machine-to-machine delivery, and as an Excel add-in. Periodically, we like to provide updates on new product launches. The first 2 charts on this slide depict the acceptance by market participants of our JKM marker for liquefied natural gas and our low sulfur marine fuel assessment.  Both have exhibited very strong growth recently. The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched in energy transition space in the last 4 years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices, covering what is expected to be one of the key producers of this future fuel. The methane performance certificate, which reflects production of natural gas in the U.S., with 0 methane emissions, and upstream values for the measured carbon emissions associated with crude oil production and transportation, covering an initial suite of 14 crudes from around the world and aiming to provide the backbone for low carbon crude trading.  Buyers can start to make active choices based on the relative carbon impact of different crude sources with this crude carbon intensity product. Turning to our investments in ESG, our Sustainable1 milestones and product launches continue to build. Third quarter Sustainable1 revenue increased 58% to $24 million versus the prior period. With the launch of Second-Party Opinions, Ratings now has 5 products. Overall, Ratings completed, 10 ESG evaluations, 13 Green evaluations, 13 SIEM benchmark engagements, and 11 social and sustainability framework alignment opinions in the quarter. In market intelligence, we're close to wrapping up the annual CSA survey.  And so far in 2021, corporate participation increased 34% over 1,800 companies. On the back of these surveys, we relaunched our S&P Global ESG scores on 8,000 companies during the quarter. We are targeting to have scores on more than 11,000 companies by the end of this year's assessment cycle in the first quarter of 2022. In indices, we had $26.5 billion of ESG ETF AUM at the end of the third quarter. This is an increase of 178% since the end of the third quarter of last year. Our indices business also added to its ESG indices offerings with the launch of the S&P NZX 50 tilted index with the New Zealand Stock Exchange. Platts added products to both its suite of carbon assessments and it's recycled plastic offerings.  And finally, S&P Global's a founding member of [Indiscernible], a new technology platform designed to provide private equity firms and the private markets with ESG measurement, data collection, and bench marking capabilities to help improve the management and tracking of ESG performance. By providing rich, detailed data on a wide array of ESG topics. The corporate sustainability assessment is an integral part of our ESG scores. Since we purchased the capability for RobecoSAM in late 2019, we've expanded the number of corporate participants by about 500 Companies, and the group has almost doubled corporate participation in the last 4 years.  Today's participating companies represents 45% of global market capitalization. In addition, you could see this as a global endeavor. We view the CSA input as a key differentiator to our Sustainable1 efforts. Let me now turn to our outlook for global issuance in GDP. The 2021 issuance forecast continued to creep higher, and is now relatively flat versus 2020 issuance. The latest forecast was issued earlier this week and also covers 2022 issuance for the first time. 2022 issuances forecast a declined 2%. This is based on a 7% decrease in Non-financial Corporate, a 1% increase in Financial Services, a 3% increase in Structured Finance, and a 2% increase in U.S. Public Finance. Looking forward, inflation concerns, prospects for rising rates, high cash balances, and possible tax reform, all translate to headwinds for issuance in 2022.  We expect that they will lead to a second year of contraction in issuance total. Please note that this is a bond issuance forecast. This is not a revenue forecast. For example, it doesn't address non-transaction revenue and doesn't include leveraged loan activity. The macro outlook is little change from 3 months ago. Our economists expect growth to moderate in 2022 with growth in Europe and many emerging markets improving while growth rates drop in the US and China.  Commodity prices have rebound due to strong retail sales, weather events in supply chain and balances. However, inflation pressures appear to be peaking with some emerging markets Central Banks raising rates, US Federal Reserve moving up its tapering timeline, and the ECB firmly on hold for now. Finally, Platts Analytics believes the current fundamentals should remain supportive of oil prices in the mid 70s. This is positive for the health of the oil industry. I will now turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout? Thank you, Manav, this is Doug. Well, first of all, welcome everyone to the call. We had a lot to report today and then I'm pleased that you picked up that we've been able to launch the Capital IQ Pro platform. What it brings is its ability to, first of all, consolidate of many different information sources that we've had in the Company across the years. It has a much better interface if you've seen if you started using it. It also incorporates new Kensho capabilities and improves search.  It also has the data for ESG, it's easier to use for our risk services data. So across the board, it provides us with a competitive advantage of comprehensive data, ease-of-use, as well as new tools that make it easier to download data to move them into spreadsheets for chatting, etc. So we think it's an incremental leap forward and it gives us a much more competitive platform for the market. Yeah, this is something as you know, we've seen a really interesting mix of the issuance this year. You saw the very strong issuance in loans which is driven by M&A, we seeing so far in the quarter, we saw a drop of [Indiscernible] [inaudible 00:34:07] of 30%, while we saw an increase of structured finance of over 100%. So those are really big swings. We do see that the M&A activity should continue forward. There's a lot of M&A activity in the pipeline which would bode well for loan issuance. That's not something that's in the bond forecast itself, but in the bond forecast, we see that in Corporates, it's going to be down about 7%.  There continues to be a strong liquidity for those types of issuance. The trend is right now, there's not a very big pipeline of issuance of Corporates that we see. Financial Services had half strength the last couple of quarters. As you saw this quarter, Financial Institutions was up about 5%. In the U.S., it was actually up about 30%, so you did see some strength in that. So we do think that there's going to be some continuation up about 1% -- sorry, 1% for 2022.  For Structured Finance, we do think that there's going to be some continuation of interest in CLOs but I'm not sure if that will continue across all asset classes with about 3% increase. U.S. public finance are close to flat, around 2% up. And then finally, total, we look across all of those given the volume of corporates which went down 7%, that would bring the total down about 2% in 2022. And as we said on the call, this is a initial issuance forecasted bond. It's not a revenue forecast. Thanks, Manav. Thank you, Kevin. Just a couple of points strategically in [Indiscernible], we have been able to put together the Sustainability1 Group under the leadership of Martina Chan (ph). And this has provided us with the ability to look across the entire organization for ways that we can link data and put together the latest needs for the market. As you saw, we launched the partnership with the Ford Foundation, Hamilton Lane, and [Indiscernible] for the Nevada platform for the private markets and private equity. So we're looking across all the different types of opportunities to bring ESG data into the market.  So you have the most transparency, the most comprehensive, consistent approach to providing those ESG solutions to the market. So this is something that we're looking at across the board in all the different aspects of how markets are starting to use ESG data. You should expect that we're going to continue to invest in this area. You should hear from us every quarter, that we've spent some money or invested in a different division to increase our sales force, our technical capabilities. And if you ask the question about where might we still be targeting some longer-term look at acquisitions, ESG would clearly be on that list. Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, thanks, Hamzah. Nice to hear from you. And as you mentioned, we did complete 15 ratings in the third quarter. It's actually 46 year-to-date, and that compares to 2020 -- '22 and all of 2020, so we know that growth isn't going to be a straight line. There's a lot of interest in our ratings. As you see, there's some credit events taking place in China right now, and those are bringing a lot of attention to our ratings and our methodology, how we think about informing the market. We see a big uptick in people attending our webinars, downloading our research.  We've also been pleased that we've been able to wait companies across the entire credit sector from AAA-BBB and then different types of companies, financial structured products, and our first non-financial corporate. But more to your question about the environment, we continue to see the financial regulators are very interested in reforming and updating their financial markets. We would see that when it comes to the ratings industry that there's interest in seeing more from us.  They are talking about some reforms that would make the ratings industry more transparent, and make it change some of the floors for what would be defined as a non-investment-grade rating. But very importantly, we also see a whole slew of international financial firms getting licenses to operate 100% owned or more than 51% owned operations in China. Recently, Goldman Sachs received approval to take full ownership of its Securities, JV. Others include Fidelity, JP Morgan, City, BlackRock, etc. So we do think that in the financial markets, we see a very different rhetoric and a willingness to openly reform the markets compared to what you see some times in other parts of the markets. Thanks, Hamzah. Yeah, Ashish, it definitely does. Having the Capital IQ Pro developed and delivered is important to us. It gives us confidence of our ability to integrate new datasets. It also is something that's on the desktop of already 90,000 users, which is growing rapidly. We believe that that gives us the ability to integrate new datasets, as you know related to the Market Intelligence business, we also have the data marketplace, which has the tiles for different datasets which are already curated, have the contracts around them.  That's another aspect of the Market Intelligence business that is going incredibly well, that will help us integrate the data [Indiscernible] and the data products also of IHS Markit. The progress, technologically, was how we've moved our operations to the cloud, the upgrade and updates we've been doing to the back-end, as well as now the ability we've delivered that front-end of S&P Capital IQ Pro, are all going to help facilitate the integration. Well, thank you very much. Let me take that and what we're looking over the next few months is to continue to meet the requirements that we've agreed with the regulators on where we're going to be divesting of some businesses so that we can close the transaction. As you saw this week or last week, we were able to reach some agreements with the EC for the approval of some conditions and what they call remedies, which include the divestiture of Opus that they include what's now the divestiture of CUSIP.  And then also LCD and loan indices. We have about six months from now to close the LCD and the loan indices and those are not conditions to close the transaction, CUSIP is. And then with the CMA in the UK, we also have the condition of the Opus transaction and now something else is being added that's called Base Chemicals. And we'll -- we heard from them this morning that in general, they approved of that as a remedy, that they would expect meets the needs. We also want to make sure that over the next 3 or 4 months that we have time to follow through on a very thorough and robust process to get full value for all of these divestitures.  So in a sense right now getting those divestitures, meeting the requirements of those regulators are the remedies that they saw that created competitive positions that they thought would be too strong including -- completing those divestitures is going to be the gating factor. But we also want to do it, as I said, in a way that's professional, robust, and we get full value. So you should be watching that. We'll be providing more information as things crop up that we can talk about, but be assured that this is something that's on the top of our list right now of things we have to get done. Craig, as you know, we typically will price somewhere around 2, 3%. We try to look at what are the trends in the markets on inflation, but that's -- would continue to be our expectation going forward but we don't have any further guidance or update on that right now. I don't have a bank loan issuance forecast from the team. And I do -- I would only say that we do see a very strong pipeline for M&A and LBOs. That is always one of the most important elements that figures into that. But we'll be providing more guidance on that, at our next Earnings Call. That's been a full year. [Indiscernible] I don't have any reason whatsoever to try to give a forecast in 2022 right now that goes beyond what our own team, who are the people in the markets every day, have looked at. Clearly, there's a lot of factors which go into the decision of organizations to issue debt or to undertake an M&A deal and what sort of instrument did they undertake to finance it with whether it's a loan, how it gets packaged in CLO, et c? There is a lot of liquidity in the market. We do see a strong M&A pipeline right now and so those are things that will factor in when we bring you the full year update in our guidance on our next earnings call. Yes. Thank you, Owen. Well, as you know, these are businesses that the EC and the CMA have looked at with a lot of depth. They go to the market, they go to market participants to ask them to look at the businesses as we bring them together and to give them feedback as to what would be the competitiveness of those businesses. So when it comes to the discussion with the EC, they determined that CUSIP and LCD, and the loan indices would create some sort of an additional competitive advantage.  And in the discussions with them, and looking at their understanding of belief through the market position, we agreed that that would be a remedy that would meet their needs to ensure that we didn't have a dominant position in the markets. So this is a -- this is something that they looked at. You can actually read their letter that has been published, that they have the -- they have a very short couple of paragraphs that described their views of that and how they feel about it.  But they've also given us what they call an approval with conditions which we think was a very positive aspect. Similarly with the CMA, they go to the markets, they listen to market participants, and they came back with the discussion about the Base Chemicals business that would also create a competitive issue in the UK. And in discussions in negotiations with them, we also agreed that that would be a condition that we would meet in order to get approval on the transaction.  So these are what the regulators do, they look at the market, they speak with market participants, and then we discuss these with them. And in these cases, we've agreed that we would make these divestitures in order to close the deal. You asked about conditionality. It's our understanding in the case of the CMA, we would need to have a buyer identified, that they would that they would vet, of the Base Chemicals business and also the OPIS business, in which we already have a buyer, and in the case of the EC, we'd have to have a buyer identified for the OPIS and related businesses, which we already have, and then for CUSIP, we'd have to have a buyer we have identified and vetted before we can close the deal. But for LCD and loan indices, we have six months from now, and we could close the deal without having a buyer for that transaction. There's a few aspects to this. One is related to something you mentioned and that is that as we improve our capabilities and make it easier to find data, to search it, to chart it, to download it, etc. That makes the products more sticky, it makes more people are use the product, it brings more people to the platform, which is a virtuous cycle which then allows us to have a stronger negotiations when it comes to price increases. So there is not necessarily a direct increase that comes from the launch of these platforms, but it does give us a virtual cycle. In addition, it makes it easier for -- to plug-in and add new datasets which do sometimes bring new contracts and new revenue along with those.  In addition, you asked about the expense side of this. As we redeploy resources from turning off and changing older platforms, it allows us to either have an expense save or in many cases it allows us to redeploy those programmers and developers into areas where the highest growth opportunities, like what we've talked about earlier, something on ESG, private markets are the areas that we're quite excited about with the merger with IHS Markit, how we're going to be able to bring energy transition products, further credit in this products, etc. We can get some savings but also look at how we're going to redeploy our development talent to the highest opportunities for the future growth. As you know, in the index business occasionally, an organization will rebalance or maybe they might bring together some indices and switch to another party. And when we have a contract in place with an index provider that our -- sorry, ETF provider diffusing our index if they switch, it could be the built in the contract there's an early cancellation fee and that would be the case that we saw during this quarter. Thank you. Great. Thank you, Alex. I'm going to make some closing remarks. And first of all, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. And as you saw, we had very strong performance in the third quarter. We delivered exceptional financial results with a 13% topline growth and adjusted diluted EPS of 24% growth. We launched new product platforms, we advanced our ESG propositions and many, many more things going on.  And as we're able to talk about, we're moving forward on the IHS Markit merger. This is something that we're very excited about. The path towards regulatory approval is getting clear. We now have to execute on the divestitures that we discussed today to achieve the full value, but also, we don't want to rush. We want to have time to close and also to make sure that we can execute those transactions well. Well, as you know, we also have integration planning going on which is identifying synergies. But more importantly, it's also identifying strategies for our businesses. How we're going to work together, how we are going to address the needs of our customers, how we're going to be bringing together technology and very importantly data. And then most importantly, our people and our culture, and all of this work is going extremely well. But today on this call, I also want to thank our people.  They've been working now for 600 days. It sounds like a lot, it's 600 days people been working from home and working remotely, starting to come back to the offices. And when they do, I'd love to welcome them depending on which offices we're around the world. But our people have been dedicated, they've been working hard. They may be able to deliver the kind of results that you saw earlier as well as work on this exciting transformation for the Company with the merger. They've been diligent.  They're helping rethink and reimagine the future of the work. And I want to thank them for all of their dedication and commitment to making this Company what it is and looking forward to the future for building an even better Company. And then finally, I want to thank everyone on the call, the analysts for your questions, and also the shareholders for your support. And thank you very much looking forward to a great Fourth Quarter and the holidays at the end of the year. Thanks, everyone."

After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Eric Boyer. Please go ahead.\nEric Boyer: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 2021 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion in the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit’s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance.\nLance Uggla: Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings calls. We had another very strong quarter. Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with organic growth of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and margin of 43.8%, up 30 basis points year-over-year FX adjusted, and up 80 basis points now year-to-date; adjusted EPS up 0.81 or $0.81, up 17% over the prior year. So, overall, we’re pleased with the first half of our year, which puts us in an excellent position to raise our full-year guidance today. In terms of core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had another strong quarter with 9% organic growth in Q2. Within the division, information performed solidly with organic growth of 5%. Contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data, and valuations offerings, as well as continued growth in our equities regulatory reporting and trade and analytics platforms. Solutions had an excellent quarter, with 15% organic growth, and they continue to benefit from robust market activity in equities and loan markets, combined with a broad-based rebound of investment, customers in our software solutions, and our corporate actions and regulatory and compliance offerings. Finally, our processing business grew 6% organically, strengthened loans and derivatives performance as expected. For the full-year, we still expect Financial Services to be in the 7% to 8% organic growth range. Now, moving on to transportation, which had organic revenue growth of 39% in Q2. Now, you'll recall that the basis for comparison, the second quarter of 2020 was depressed by significant pricing concessions that we granted our customers at the height of the COVID-related lockdowns, as well as by particularly challenging trading conditions in the automotive market. However, there is more to this quarter than a low comparison. I'm pleased to say that this quarter’s performance also reflected strong underlying organic growth right across the transportation businesses. Our dealer businesses, that includes CARFAX and Mastermind, are once again experiencing rapid growth. In a retail environment, that's marked by a shortage of inventory both used and new, and by rapidly escalating used car prices, our products are critical to helping the dealers acquire and sell more cars at the right price in the right time. Demand for our predictive solutions, volumes planning, power transmissions compliance, supply chain and technology are all accelerating, as the industry grapples with multiple supply chain disruptions, and as it faces major strategic decisions related to the technology mega trends, those include the connected car, autonomous driving, and electrification. Our marketing audience and measurements business is rapidly expanding its footprint with automotive market tiers. And recently, we announced a wide-ranging partnership with Nielsen, which we are very excited about. And finally, our Maritime & Trade business continued to deliver strong performance. This has been the result of a very focused product strategy and disciplined execution over multiple quarters. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. So, for the full-year, we now expect transportation organic growth to be higher, and in the 14% to 16% range, which is up from our previously noted 13% to 15% range. This represents a healthy underlying high single-digit growth rate, excluding the favorable year-over-year comparison due to the pandemic. Moving on to resources, where our organic growth was flat in Q2. Our resources business performance was as expected, with recurring revenue consistent with Q1 and non-recurring revenue benefiting from the return of both CERAWeek and the World Petrochemical Conferences. As expected, our ACV experienced slight positive growth in Q2, which we believe should accelerate in the back half, providing a stronger foundation for our 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate throughout the rest of the year. Downstream is now 50% of the overall division and upstream 50%. That's a 10% shift year-over-year. In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits as upstream improves and downstream continues its growth trajectory.  Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results continue and across CMS throughout the year. For the full-year, we expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. The only update we have on the merger is what S&P Global recently disclosed that we expect the deal to now close in calendar Q4. And now, I'll turn the call over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Gear: Great. Thank you, Lance. Q2 highlights included revenue organic growth of 13%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 14%, GAAP net income and EPS both had growth of 122%, and adjusted EPS had growth of 17% year-over-year. Regarding revenue, our Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with total growth of 15%. Organic growth in the quarter was 13%, which included the current organic growth of 10% and non-recurring organic growth of 41%. This increase was driven by strong underlying growth in financial services and transportation, as well as benefiting from favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the impact of COVID on some of our transportation and resources businesses. Moving on to segment performance, our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 9%, including 7% occurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular, had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in capital market issuances, corporate actions, and reg and compliant offerings, while information had 5% growth driven by pricing and valuations and our equities, regulatory reporting, and trading analytics platforms. Processing had a 6% organic increase driven by volumes, primarily in loans. Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 39% in the quarter. This included growth of 38% recurring, as Q2 continue to have strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses, and accelerating growth within our Maritime & Trade business. Non-recurring revenue increased by 41%, primarily driven by strong performance in CARFAX, consumer and dealer transactions, core automotive insights and Maritime & Trade events. Our resources segment remained flat, which is comprised with 8% recurring decline and 73% non-recurring increase. Q2 organic ACB increased by 2 million in the quarter, and our trailing 12-month organic ACB is down 8% as we have now cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year. We had great success with our entirely virtual CERAWeek and World Petrochem Conferences and we continue to see strong demand in our downstream businesses, particularly in our products and services to support energy transition and energy market supply chains. Our CMS segment had 1% organic growth, including 2% recurring and a decrease of 10% non-recurring. Moving now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was 517 million, up 63 billion versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% with a margin of 43.8% down 40 basis points, and up 30 basis points FX adjusted. Moving to our segments. Financial services adjusted EBITDA was 238 million, with a margin of 48.2% down 320 bips FX adjusted. Financial services margins reflects a return to more normal margin levels post COVID. Transportation’s adjusted EBITDA was 171 billion, with a margin of 49.6%, up 870 bips FX adjusted. We do expect margins to moderate in forward quarters as we see more expense tied to revenue growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was 91 million with a margin of 41.4%, a decrease of 210 bips FX adjusted as a result of lower revenue. CMS adjusted EBITDA was 29 million, with a margin of 23.3%, down 520 bips FX adjusted. This quarter’s decrease was driven primarily by the return to more normal margins compared to the prior year in addition to a mix shift. We do expect margins to continue to improve in the back half of the year. Moving now to net income and EPS. Net income was 159 million and GAAP EPS was $0.40. Adjusted EPS was $0.81, an increase of 17% over prior year. Our GAAP tax rate was 26%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q2 free cash flow was 301 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion has increased to 56%. Turning to the balance sheet, our Q2 ending debt balance was 5.0 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.6 times on a bank covenant basis, and 2.5 times net of cash. We closed the quarter with 217 million of cash and our Q2 undrawn revolver balance was approximately 917 million. In the quarter, we paid off our 250 million, 364-day term loan. Our Q2 weighted average diluted share count was [400.7 million] shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares, and therefore our share repurchase program is currently suspended, other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share based compensation. Moving to guidance, we had a strong first half of the year and are adjusting and raising our guidance ranges. We’re raising revenue guidance to 4.635 billion to 4.675 billion with organic growth of 7% to 8%. Approximately 30 million of this increase is due to changes in FX rates, which are benefiting revenue, negative to margin percentage, but neutral to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is being raised to 2.02 billion to 2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points adjusted for FX. Adjusted EPS is being increased to $3.15 per share to $3.17 per share. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. We had another strong quarter as our end markets continue to recover and the teams have executed at a high level. We remain very confident in our ability to deliver strong results for the year as represented by our updated guidance. And operator, we're now ready to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. \nLance Uggla: Hi, Kevin.\nKevin McVeigh: Hey, how are you? Hey, really, really great numbers in transportation and obviously, easier comp, but what's interesting to me is, we read a lot about constrained inventories, things like that. So, it seems like the numbers would have been that much stronger, if not for, even if there was more inventory out there. Any puts and takes you’d call out in particular, Lance or Jonathan, just because again, it’s really amazing numbers there?\nLance Uggla: Yeah, why don't I start and then we'll pass it over to Edouard, actually, because he's on with us. But I think the biggest thing is, and Edouard can build on this some more, if you took out 2020, what you really want to look at is recurring revenue growth 2019 to 2021, and that's a mid to upper teens number. So that's the blow away number. From my perspective, the team's done an amazing job that comes down with non-recurring revenue. And if you take the overall quarter 2019 to 2021, it's high single digits. And that's right in line if you look back to 2018, 2019, et cetera. So, my view is the teams recovered. They've done the maximum they can. They’ve innovated into new products. They’ve worked virtually well. I really think, it's been a stellar performance for them. But Edouard, do you want to add a little bit to that in terms of just your own color on the numbers?\nEdouard Tavernier: Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Lance. Can you hear me now? Okay, cool. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. And just to build on what Lance said, good call out on the inventories. So, the industry is still in a process of recovery. And you're right. In this current environment, both dealers and carmakers have less of a need to spend on marketing. And that does create a headwind for some of our products. On the other hand, I would say that dealers, in particular, are currently seeing higher margins they’ve ever recorded. And when our customers do well, that's obviously a good thing for us.  So, you sort of have a balance here of headwinds and tailwinds. But the takeaway for me is that even in marked environments like today's auto industry, I think we're showing that our products are critical, must-have products that are helping dealers and carmakers sell more cars, and also, in the case of dealers, acquire used cars in a really tough, kind of used car market. So that's a big deal for us. And I'm really happy with how the business has been performing in response.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, good morning. I guess on Financial Services, continues to do quite well, a two-part question. How important is issuance in the last couple of quarters across equity and debt markets? And outside of the issuance benefit, what else would you call out that continues to do quite well here? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Okay, maybe I can start and then I'll hand it over to Adam. I guess first off, yeah, I look at Financial Services in high single digits, and I just, to me that’s super strong quarter. So, great performance. I'd say the one thing I'd call out, which if you were following Markit, then IHS Markit over the years, we always viewed our solutions business is having double-digit growth opportunities. And for a little while that slipped into high-single-digits. It's been throughout 2019, 2020, and now 2021, we've started to see that recover and that's a 15% solution, sort of growth. Albeit some of its non-recurring, what's really important is that solutions growth brings and draws recurring revenue. So, a really super performance by the solutions team. I don’t know, Adam, do you want to add in terms of issuance, et cetera.\nAdam Kansler: Yeah. I mean, one of the nice things about our business is the diversification of the asset classes in which we operate and the types of businesses that we have. So, a strong issuance market, it gives us a bit of a lift. But in other market environments where you see volatility, we have other platforms or other businesses that respond well in those environments. So, you do have a bit of a balance. Heavy issuance market, like we saw in Q1, in particular, that started to moderate a bit into Q2. It gives us some amount of lift, but across the portfolio, the core is really the strength in our pricing, our valuations, continued growth in demand for those products. And as Lance mentioned, our solutions, we made a significant investment over the last couple of years and we're winning some pretty significant mandates. And that's fueling growth. I think that will be an area of continued growth for us certainly over the mid-term.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Adam. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah, thank you. On the macro around connected cars that you call that in the prepared remarks, obviously, not new, but I guess what's the strategy for CARFAX or IHS auto to collect connected car data in real-time or near real-time? And I guess how important is that to you, kind of intermediate to long-term as you defend your position or look to find new sources of revenue?\nLance Uggla: Edouard, do you want to take that one?\nEdouard Tavernier : Yes, sure. Thank you, Jeff, and great question. So, over time, availability of connected car base is going to get bigger, coverage is going to get much better. And we see a couple of opportunities for us both in terms of access to data, to supplement what we do today, and also new business models. Today, we are running a number of POCs across our business, both on the CARFAX side of the business to figure out like what can we get from that base? And how can we supplement our existing resources, but also building that data set into workflow for carmakers such as dealer network optimization, dealer network designing.  So, an exciting opportunity for us. We see connected car data has been a critical source for us in the future. Right now, availability is limited. Coverage is very lighter and there are still some significant question marks around access to VIN-level data who owns that data, which will have to play out over the next two or three years. So, let's continue to watch this space together on the floors, but it will take two or three years for connected car data to emerge as something that we can really leverage.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard, Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, Lance. I just wanted to hear a little bit more specifically about what will drive the recovery and IHS' Resources ACV for the balance of the year, surely I recognize Brent oil is back into the 70s. But just give us a sense of, kind of where and why IHS is seeing additional subscription revenue coming into ACV?\nLance Uggla: Okay. Probably Brian can give you a real good detail and more granular. So, I'll pass it over to you, Brian.\nBrian Crotty: Yeah. So what we're seeing is, there’s really high demand right now for our clean tech, carbon, biofuels, crop science in our agri group, and plastics for chemicals. And we, what we've done this year is, we have new or expanded offerings in all those areas. So, we're just seeing that segment of the business really take off.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thanks, Brian. Really, that’s that I mentioned that I think back [Technical Difficulty] at the merger 60/40, now, for the first time ever 50% downstream with agri having a 10% quarter. It really - the diversification is much, much better. And we'll continue to balance the set of assets with the energy transition and the team has done a good job. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nHamzah Mazari: My question is more related to the S&P merger, could you maybe, Lance talk about any integration pre-planning that's gone on, maybe you could touch on employee morale, clearly, you know, the deal closes as you mentioned, Q4, but how is employee morale shaping up in terms of culturally and with that integration, you know, anything you can touch on, any color you can provide there from a pre-planning process, and also from an employee morale perspective? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Right. Okay. Well, the year will be a year, December 1 to that final quarter. So, you know, it is a long time, but I have to say, you know, the team really got motivated together through COVID. So, you know, I just think the firm rallied around COVID. And culturally, you know, improved and delivered great results. And that carried us through most of the last year. Like anything, we worry that, you know, over time, you can get, you know, a merger fatigue. But we haven't noticed that at all.  I think S&P has done a great job working with my teams on pre-merger planning. And because we've probably had an extra, you know, three or four months, they really have rolled up their sleeves, and just went deeper. And the other thing you should know is, you know, we don't have that much of employee morale issues, because, you know, our energy team is completely different, you know, how the plots of this overlap is going to create a sale that's been announced.  So, you know, even within Opus, people are excited about the fact that they'd be doing something new again. So, that's not an issue. There's no overlap with our upstream and downstream businesses in the Platts, really. The financial services, Adam’s going to be leading that. And, you know, it's exciting integration given lots of opportunities. Automotive, transportation, no real need for overlaps, so Edouard is leading that. Sally's leaving alliances and building a new team across S&P.  So, I think, you know, the teams are all highly motivated. Where the overlap is, of course, in the services, and, you know we did a really good job, both firms have treated the employees very well through this merger period. And so, we haven't had a lot of people at all leaving the firm. And, you know, I feel my teams have done an exceptional job, and are still highly motivated. Jonathan's been leading the IMO from our side. So, maybe he can add a little bit of additional color to that.\nJonathan Gear: Sure, Lance. Will do. I mean, just as you let your question, [certainly there’s] been some very intensive integration planning going on, completely going back to severance, but first we announced this. And teams have been stood up across all the different functions, all the different areas, of course, being careful not to jump the gun, but really get ahead on the integration planning. And then that process, I think a couple things have come out. First, I think, as we identified synergies at – when we announced the deal. We've taken the last few quarters to really begin to solidify exactly the path to [indiscernible] synergies and I think we’re increasing confidence on how to get there.  And the second thing culturally, to your question, it's been a great opportunity for the teams to really work with one another and get to know each other and get to know their future colleagues extremely well. And I think what's come out of that is certainly Lance and I knew from our discussions in the fall is the values of the two firms are very, very similar. And I think as the two teams have gotten to know each other, it's been relieving, if you will, for them to get to know that their colleagues are going to be working with other people that they want to work with. So, we’re making great progress both culturally, as well as the integration planning, and we [indiscernible] well set up when we close.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Adam on for Shlomo. What level of costs were reintroduced into the business through the re-openings? And how might this have impacted margins in the quarter? \nLance Uggla: Jonathan, do you want to do that one?\nJonathan Gear : Sure. So, there was a couple different areas where we did. So, if you call last year, Q, what Q2 call last year, when we were entering COVID, we took some significant cost reductions, some of those were permanent, and those permanent cost savings have indeed been permanent. They haven't crept back in, but some were certainly temporary. There was impacts on executive salaries, few other things we did, we pulled back on marketing spend, for example on CARFAX given that the dealers had shut down in North America. And so those costs and we certainly built it into our plan, into our guidance this year, those costs have been reversed.  So, it does create a – I will call it somewhat odd dynamic or the absolute margin of the segment level with transportation, for example, when we take significant costs, reductions in Q2 of last year, you see a significant year-on-year margin accretion, which is a little bit of a false economy, I would say. You should see that normalize going forward. But those have been the main costs and have come back in. Then of course, we continue to invest in the business and where we see strong performance, they should make investments to fund future growth. But the key thing I will call out is really you're seeing the year-on-year reverse of some of those temporary cost reductions from last year.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You increased your full-year guidance for organic revenue growth given strength in transportation. How do you expect your updated guide to flow through to your fiscal 2022 outlook given current trends in each of your segments?\nLance Uggla: Yeah, I think I'll let Jonathan add after me, but, you know, the key thing that I think people should look at is, it's a very, you know, we're halfway – over halfway through our fiscal year. We've given you a very narrow; you know 40 million of revenue guidance, and an even narrower EBITDA guidance. And, you know, if you look at our track record, you know, over the last many years, we don't miss our guidance. So, the fact is, is we've given you a very accurate picture, for this year, float all the way through into earnings.  Of course, we also feel that, you know, our strong, you know mid-to-upper single-digit revenue profile as a firm is one that's very intact. And we expect that to continue. And so I don't see us changing the percentage of revenue growth expected into 2020, 2023, 2024, but that's not to say that as we go into those years, if we have strong, you know, first second quarter, we don't have any issue with, you know, raising our view forward, and we'd love to beat our guidance, but I don't see us changing, you know, across the mix of our businesses. So, you know mid-to-high single digit revenue growth in 2022 off of our closing 2021 numbers. Jonathan, do you want to add anything else to that?\nJonathan Gear : No, but maybe there's a couple of comments add to yours, Lance. I mean, first of all, we did give our 2021 guidance this time last year, coming out of all the noise of COVID. I’m actually really proud of the team that even with all the uncertainties back then, we are landing the plane, kind of as we expected. And as Lance has alluded to, great, great performance by the team.  Now, I will say, George, in terms of a raise in the guidance this time, obviously, we're doing on the back of what we saw in the first half of the year and what we're seeing go forward. I think at this point, we're not prepared to really give formal guidance for 2022. I think we'll be back to our normal cadence. Obviously, much rather be in position of strength exiting the year than position of weakness. But as Lance was saying, I think at this point, no news in terms of changes to future growth will surely get back to you later in the year once we finalize our plans.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. I wanted to ask about ESG, when you think about the $70 million of ESG revenue, it spans across a number of different areas, emissions, data, supply chain, solar wind, hydrogen, etcetera. I guess who's competing against you in these areas? And are there any capabilities or datasets that you don't have right now that you would like to? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Yeah, that's a good question Toni. Thanks for that. So, we – I think where IHS Markit standalone has an edge in ESG is clearly around the E, and scope 123 emissions science-based targets, the challenges of, you know, for corporations, governments who will want to regulate coming out of the [COP 26], these are areas where we have real substantive detail, climate analytics. We have data that plays into climate analytics. So, location data around energy assets, our maritime and trade group have very detailed supply chain footprints for all the maritime fleet.  We have, you know, some great new products and services that play into research and development around E. So, I think we have the competitive edge as IHS Markit in E. When you marry that with S&P Global, I actually think the combination gets even stronger, and they do have the RobecoSAM, Trucost, and other assets that are very, very valuable in terms of, you know, competing with the likes of, you know MSCI, FTSE, the LSE group, you know various providers of ESG ratings and scores that are much more driven off the, you know, public knowledge, SNG versus the E.  So I think our combination is going to give us a competitive edge and give us a lot of opportunity to grow into, and I think across S&P Global and IHS Markit, this is a very strong double-digit growth engine for, you know, at least a decade. Because, you know, there's 1.5 trillion a year being spent, you know, on climate change now, and that number is expected to grow to something like 4.5 trillion. And so, I think we've got lots to offer, and you know we'll watch this space closely. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: Thank you so much. This is actually a follow-up from Hamzah’s question on your internal workforce. You said you have not had a lot of people leave since the merger announcement. That's great. I'm assuming you've been hiring since, if you could just confirm the size of your workforce has increased since the merger announcement? And if so, how difficult is it to find these people, and are you having to pay higher than normal wages? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: [Indiscernible] let the team add to this one. So, I'll go to Jonathan or if he wants to pass it to any of the division heads he can. We're definitely hiring, and we're definitely, you know, with the growth numbers, you know, we're growing. And in many cases, we're growing into new spaces, in the markets to operate in. So, I haven't seen this have any, you know, challenges to hire. You know, and of course, in a merger, we make sure that we retain our people and look after them.  So, I don't notice anything that stands out, you know, from my perspective, but if any of the division heads want to add anything in terms of hiring, etcetera, maybe you can start Jonathan if you know our overall employment growth across the group, year-over-year, and then if any of the division heads want to add?\nJonathan Gear: Sure, maybe I’ll just give a general overview and then the division heads can supplement as they like. So, first off to your point is first, the attrition we've seen kind of year to date has been very much in line with what we normally see. And so no [indiscernible], we are growing. And you're absolutely right. We are growing and investing in all the different businesses that that Adam, Edouard and Brian, lead, in particular growing in India has always been a growth sector for us. India is a hot market. Itself is – what we're very, very attractive employers always, you know, challenged to find great people.  I would say that the challenge we have finding people this year really is not that different from other years. It's always, you look attractive, the best people and pull them in, is never easy, but we always try and to get it done. So, we are growing. Certain markets are hotter than other markets, certain segments, particularly in technology, data science, etcetera, the usual places you would expect. Obviously difficult, but I wouldn't say dramatically different this year from prior years. But happy to open up to the divisional leads to add some more color.\nEdouard Tavernier: I'll just add something to what Jonathan said. I would say it’s in pockets, right. I think is a great question. Technology is one of those pockets. You may have seen in some places an uptick in nutrition, and we have struggles to hire great tech talent in some locations. So, our strategy here is to diversify the sources of talent. But as you know, we are actively engaged in globalizing our talent footprint and that’s helping us and in some cases, adjusted wages [indiscernible] by and large that we're funding the [chance we need].\nLance Uggla : Adam, do you want to add anything or Brian?\nAdam Kansler: Yeah, no, the only comment maybe I'd make Lance is, we, obviously were operating a competitive job market. We put a lot of attention into our internship and our early careers programs where we brought large groups of young people into the firm and that pipeline, you know, that's like that gives us great strength forward. That's a real investment in the future of the firm. And I think that's a place where we've seen real progress both in our diversity and equality, as well as just bringing great talent that continues to join and progress within our firm.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Brian, anything?\nBrian Crotty: No. I mean, I think I agree. I'm seeing the same things that Edouard and Adam are and definitely our internship programs really help onboard good talent as those are grad. So, I think we're firing on all cylinders there.\nLance Uggla: Yeah. No, it's great. We have over 250 interns and 250 graduates joining. So, you know, that fuels, a lot of our growth that manages our expenses. Okay, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I know it's a smaller piece of business, but I was wondering if you could speak a bit to the performance of CMS in the quarter. And what the medium-term outlook looks like for that segment? I think recurring revenue held up decently well throughout the past, kind of year plus, and I know, you get some non-recurring revenue from the boiler pressure, vessel codes in the back half of this year, but excluding that, do you think CMS can get into the mid-single-digits range, longer-term? And if so, what are the primary drivers to getting there? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Yeah, I'll start that. Jonathan can add if needs to. But, you know, we've really retooled CMS toward mid-single-digit growth. We called it out in this quarter that we expect the full-year to be mid-single-digits. So, you know, again I think you guys have, you know, strong confidence in the numbers we give you. And we expect to hit them. So, but you know, long term organic growth means you do it over and over and over again.  And then people give you that valuation expectation, and CMS has been, you know, in need of retooling and building out, our tech platform, the team has done a great job. They are seeing demand, and that's flowing through to, you know, better recurring revenue. So, I think the team's done a great job. I think moving from low up to mid-single-digits is step one. And we expect that the team will be able to do that through this year and then again into next year. Jonathan?\nJonathan Gear: Great last year – maybe just a few things I would add, because if you look at CMS, there are really two divisions or two major divisions. One is product design. One is our economic and country risk. So, then, product design, it has been a multi-year investment back in technology and new platforms and products. We begin to see that lift take place that drives. As Lance said, not a single year, but kind of a multi-year sustainable organic growth. We do certainly see as we look the first half of the year and then look at what's building in the second half of the year.  We do see a path for that to get to mid-single-digit seconds for the full-year, based on what we're seeing. That we think should be a sustainable growth rate. On the economic company risk that that Adam mentioned, this has been some significant investments in terms of new products and new packaging around how we get much more of a persona-based approach with our products there. And similar story where those investments were made to, kind of – end of last year early this year, and received the benefit in our growth through our pipeline, we expect to see that lift second half of the year. So, out report divisions, our lowest growth rate first half of the year, we would expect it to get to mid-singles by the end of the year.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, thank you. Good morning, everybody. Appreciate taking the question. Just wondering a little bit, Lance, you know, the transportation business has been fantastic and it sounds broad based, some of what you described in terms of the market dynamics feels a little bit like peak cycle. I just wonder if you could address that next year, obviously, comparison side, assuming supply chains loosen up a little bit. Used car prices perhaps normalize, anything we need to think about, you know, in terms of 2021 as being sort of an exceptional year that sets up just a tougher, you know, sort of macro backdrop for transportation next year?\nLance Uggla: Right. Well, I guess it's the merger of IHS and Markit, you know that, I got used to that question every single quarter. So, about 20 quarters of that same question. So it's a good – it obviously is a good question because it's the one that's on the mind of all of our analysts. And I think what you should be really looking at is high single digit growth for transportation. And it does that time and time again, in a very diversified way. And sometimes it's used car markets, sometimes it's new car markets. Sometimes it's marketing and advertising.  Sometimes it's, you know, supply chain in predictive analytics. And so when everything's ticking, we can peek into double digits, but in general, I look at transportation, say it's a strong high single digit performer with ample opportunity in its markets to maintain that. And it's not reliant on new or used car sales alone, but many things that are actually needed by the automotive suppliers, and the OEMs, regardless of the environment we're in.  So, they all need to market from cars, they all need to spend their incentives, they all need to measure their emissions, they all need to order parts and study the supply chains. They all need to do R&D, and look into the future car, the connected car, the electrification of vehicles, next will be hydrogen. So, there's always stuff to be done. Then we get on the dealer floor. And the marriage of CARFAX and Mastermind and helping dealers sell cars in a connected digital world, those types of tools become even more important.  And so, I think, you know, you can expect more of the same in the high-single-digit range for transportation. But, you know, this is an outsize quarter that’s catching up from, you know, a COVID period where, you know, really the comparison. You know, it's exciting to get to save 39% we actually teased the team that it wasn't 40, because would have been nicer number to shout out. But the fact is, it's really a high single digit consistent growth scenario, where the team's recovered really well. I'm all in there. I think that was our final question operator?\nOperator: We do have a question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research. Your line is open.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Go ahead, Doug.\nDoug Arthur: Yes, thanks. I'll make it quick. Lance, last just on the ACV turning up, would you, I mean you’ve given various updates on your, kind of pendulum swinging there on ACV, is it sort of as expected at this point or is it a little ahead of schedule?\nLance Uggla: No, I'd say as expected. We're definitely not ahead of schedule, but, you know, what I really like is the continued shift to a division that's highly diversified, like financial services, like transportation where we've got strong diversification across, you know, many facets of global economies that are, you know dealing with energy transition, new sources of energy, circular economy and demands waste. This division is with its expertise and chemicals to agricultural business. The continued need for, you know, 90 million, 100 million barrels a day of oil, oil prices at 70, when it wasn't long ago, they were sub-50.  So, you know, this team is always in thought leadership in center stage. And, yeah, we've had, it's been one of the toughest divisions as we've come out of, I had to go through COVID. But, you know, we're back to, you know, an expected, probably low-to-mid single-digit growth year in 2022 for energy. And, you know, if 2022 could be the first year where, you know, you've got CMS, you've got energy in the mid-single-digits, and you've got transportation and financial services in high-single-digits. You know, that's kind of, that's the home run and we're going to deliver this firm very strong into the S&P Global strategic merger. I think that might be the final question, but let me know operator.\nOperator: Our final question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Hi Lance. Sorry. I just wanted to unpack maybe, I'll keep it quick, that low-to-mid single-digit growth, you talked about resources. Can you just help break it down? You know, clearly, everyone's talking about energy transition going well, but that's probably, you know, a smaller part of the business. And I just wanted to understand how you guys see the dynamics between, you know, obviously, oil prices going up, but the energy companies still pressured and the zero-carbon world or whatever. So, you know, how do you see those moving pieces there? Yeah.\nLance Uggla: I think the easiest thing to do is, you take 50% of that division, and you call it high-single-digits. You know, agriculture had a 10. You know, chemicals has been consistently, mid-to-high single-digits, Opus has been consistent mid-to-high single-digits, even occasional quarter in double digits. And then you go to upstream and if you really want to be tough on upstream, you know, you could say it's flat, and that's your, you know, your low-single-digits, upstream recovering though, off of the price concessions, etcetera to be low-to-mid single-digits puts the whole division at, you know, 5% to 7%. And so, you know, I don't think it's a tall order to see those types of revenue gross in 2022.  And, you know, we're well set up for that. And the demand around, you know, just understanding energy related assets in a world of – driven by regulatory change, climate change, investor perceptions, and demands, I actually think, our team's roles to help energy market participants navigate these forward challenges. I think there's a lot of growth. We saw, you know, CERAWeek virtually, you know, I was shocked at the turnout and the, you know the needs of the teams to engage market participants in thought leadership. We saw the same in the world petrochemical conference, and our Maritime & Trade, which is more around supply chain and the trade analytics.  So, I really – yeah, I guess I just, you know I'm not a crazy optimist, but I think that, you know, when we say mid, you know, single-digits we mean, and I think that Brian and the team, you know, have navigated COVID very well. But it was tough. It was the toughest division to run from a strategic point of view through this challenging period. It just had the most moving parts and the team, you know, I have to say, you know, they don't have the highest results. But, you know, for me, I give them a badge of honor. So, great job. We'll end there. I think operator, I'll try it one more time, unless somebody came in for another question. I think we're finished.\nOperator: There are no further questions.\nLance Uggla: I'll turn it back to Eric.\nEric Boyer: Great. We thank you for your interest in IHS Markit.

            "content": "Yeah. I mean, one of the nice things about our business is the diversification of the asset classes in which we operate and the types of businesses that we have. So, a strong issuance market, it gives us a bit of a lift. But in other market environments where you see volatility, we have other platforms or other businesses that respond well in those environments. So, you do have a bit of a balance. Heavy issuance market, like we saw in Q1, in particular, that started to moderate a bit into Q2. It gives us some amount of lift, but across the portfolio, the core is really the strength in our pricing, our valuations, continued growth in demand for those products. And as Lance mentioned, our solutions, we made a significant investment over the last couple of years and we're winning some pretty significant mandates. And that's fueling growth. I think that will be an area of continued growth for us certainly over the mid-term. Yeah, no, the only comment maybe I'd make Lance is, we, obviously were operating a competitive job market. We put a lot of attention into our internship and our early careers programs where we brought large groups of young people into the firm and that pipeline, you know, that's like that gives us great strength forward. That's a real investment in the future of the firm. And I think that's a place where we've seen real progress both in our diversity and equality, as well as just bringing great talent that continues to join and progress within our firm."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Lance Uggla",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings calls. We had another very strong quarter. Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with organic growth of 13%. Adjusted EBITDA of $517 million and margin of 43.8%, up 30 basis points year-over-year FX adjusted, and up 80 basis points now year-to-date; adjusted EPS up 0.81 or $0.81, up 17% over the prior year. So, overall, we're pleased with the first half of our year, which puts us in an excellent position to raise our full-year guidance today. In terms of core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had another strong quarter with 9% organic growth in Q2. Within the division, information performed solidly with organic growth of 5%. Contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data, and valuations offerings, as well as continued growth in our equities regulatory reporting and trade and analytics platforms. Solutions had an excellent quarter, with 15% organic growth, and they continue to benefit from robust market activity in equities and loan markets, combined with a broad-based rebound of investment, customers in our software solutions, and our corporate actions and regulatory and compliance offerings. Finally, our processing business grew 6% organically, strengthened loans and derivatives performance as expected. For the full-year, we still expect Financial Services to be in the 7% to 8% organic growth range. Now, moving on to transportation, which had organic revenue growth of 39% in Q2. Now, you'll recall that the basis for comparison, the second quarter of 2020 was depressed by significant pricing concessions that we granted our customers at the height of the COVID-related lockdowns, as well as by particularly challenging trading conditions in the automotive market. However, there is more to this quarter than a low comparison. I'm pleased to say that this quarter's performance also reflected strong underlying organic growth right across the transportation businesses. Our dealer businesses, that includes CARFAX and Mastermind, are once again experiencing rapid growth. In a retail environment, that's marked by a shortage of inventory both used and new, and by rapidly escalating used car prices, our products are critical to helping the dealers acquire and sell more cars at the right price in the right time. Demand for our predictive solutions, volumes planning, power transmissions compliance, supply chain and technology are all accelerating, as the industry grapples with multiple supply chain disruptions, and as it faces major strategic decisions related to the technology mega trends, those include the connected car, autonomous driving, and electrification. Our marketing audience and measurements business is rapidly expanding its footprint with automotive market tiers. And recently, we announced a wide-ranging partnership with Nielsen, which we are very excited about. And finally, our Maritime & Trade business continued to deliver strong performance. This has been the result of a very focused product strategy and disciplined execution over multiple quarters. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. So, for the full-year, we now expect transportation organic growth to be higher, and in the 14% to 16% range, which is up from our previously noted 13% to 15% range. This represents a healthy underlying high single-digit growth rate, excluding the favorable year-over-year comparison due to the pandemic. Moving on to resources, where our organic growth was flat in Q2. Our resources business performance was as expected, with recurring revenue consistent with Q1 and non-recurring revenue benefiting from the return of both CERAWeek and the World Petrochemical Conferences. As expected, our ACV experienced slight positive growth in Q2, which we believe should accelerate in the back half, providing a stronger foundation for our 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate throughout the rest of the year. Downstream is now 50% of the overall division and upstream 50%. That's a 10% shift year-over-year. In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in the low single digits as upstream improves and downstream continues its growth trajectory.  Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results continue and across CMS throughout the year. For the full-year, we expect CMS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. The only update we have on the merger is what S&P Global recently disclosed that we expect the deal to now close in calendar Q4. And now, I'll turn the call over to Jonathan. Thanks, Jonathan. We had another strong quarter as our end markets continue to recover and the teams have executed at a high level. We remain very confident in our ability to deliver strong results for the year as represented by our updated guidance. And operator, we're now ready to open the lines for questions. Hi, Kevin. Yeah, why don't I start and then we'll pass it over to Edouard, actually, because he's on with us. But I think the biggest thing is, and Edouard can build on this some more, if you took out 2020, what you really want to look at is recurring revenue growth 2019 to 2021, and that's a mid to upper teens number. So that's the blow away number. From my perspective, the team's done an amazing job that comes down with non-recurring revenue. And if you take the overall quarter 2019 to 2021, it's high single digits. And that's right in line if you look back to 2018, 2019, et cetera. So, my view is the teams recovered. They've done the maximum they can. They've innovated into new products. They've worked virtually well. I really think, it's been a stellar performance for them. But Edouard, do you want to add a little bit to that in terms of just your own color on the numbers? Thanks, Edouard. Next question. Okay, maybe I can start and then I'll hand it over to Adam. I guess first off, yeah, I look at Financial Services in high single digits, and I just, to me that's super strong quarter. So, great performance. I'd say the one thing I'd call out, which if you were following Markit, then IHS Markit over the years, we always viewed our solutions business is having double-digit growth opportunities. And for a little while that slipped into high-single-digits. It's been throughout 2019, 2020, and now 2021, we've started to see that recover and that's a 15% solution, sort of growth. Albeit some of its non-recurring, what's really important is that solutions growth brings and draws recurring revenue. So, a really super performance by the solutions team. I don't know, Adam, do you want to add in terms of issuance, et cetera. Thanks, Adam. Next question. Edouard, do you want to take that one? Thanks, Edouard, Next question. Okay. Probably Brian can give you a real good detail and more granular. So, I'll pass it over to you, Brian. Okay. Thanks, Brian. Really, that's that I mentioned that I think back [Technical Difficulty] at the merger 60/40, now, for the first time ever 50% downstream with agri having a 10% quarter. It really - the diversification is much, much better. And we'll continue to balance the set of assets with the energy transition and the team has done a good job. Thank you. Next question. Right. Okay. Well, the year will be a year, December 1 to that final quarter. So, you know, it is a long time, but I have to say, you know, the team really got motivated together through COVID. So, you know, I just think the firm rallied around COVID. And culturally, you know, improved and delivered great results. And that carried us through most of the last year. Like anything, we worry that, you know, over time, you can get, you know, a merger fatigue. But we haven't noticed that at all.  I think S&P has done a great job working with my teams on pre-merger planning. And because we've probably had an extra, you know, three or four months, they really have rolled up their sleeves, and just went deeper. And the other thing you should know is, you know, we don't have that much of employee morale issues, because, you know, our energy team is completely different, you know, how the plots of this overlap is going to create a sale that's been announced.  So, you know, even within Opus, people are excited about the fact that they'd be doing something new again. So, that's not an issue. There's no overlap with our upstream and downstream businesses in the Platts, really. The financial services, Adam's going to be leading that. And, you know, it's exciting integration given lots of opportunities. Automotive, transportation, no real need for overlaps, so Edouard is leading that. Sally's leaving alliances and building a new team across S&P.  So, I think, you know, the teams are all highly motivated. Where the overlap is, of course, in the services, and, you know we did a really good job, both firms have treated the employees very well through this merger period. And so, we haven't had a lot of people at all leaving the firm. And, you know, I feel my teams have done an exceptional job, and are still highly motivated. Jonathan's been leading the IMO from our side. So, maybe he can add a little bit of additional color to that. Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Jonathan, do you want to do that one? Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Yeah, I think I'll let Jonathan add after me, but, you know, the key thing that I think people should look at is, it's a very, you know, we're halfway – over halfway through our fiscal year. We've given you a very narrow; you know 40 million of revenue guidance, and an even narrower EBITDA guidance. And, you know, if you look at our track record, you know, over the last many years, we don't miss our guidance. So, the fact is, is we've given you a very accurate picture, for this year, float all the way through into earnings.  Of course, we also feel that, you know, our strong, you know mid-to-upper single-digit revenue profile as a firm is one that's very intact. And we expect that to continue. And so I don't see us changing the percentage of revenue growth expected into 2020, 2023, 2024, but that's not to say that as we go into those years, if we have strong, you know, first second quarter, we don't have any issue with, you know, raising our view forward, and we'd love to beat our guidance, but I don't see us changing, you know, across the mix of our businesses. So, you know mid-to-high single digit revenue growth in 2022 off of our closing 2021 numbers. Jonathan, do you want to add anything else to that? Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Yeah, that's a good question Toni. Thanks for that. So, we – I think where IHS Markit standalone has an edge in ESG is clearly around the E, and scope 123 emissions science-based targets, the challenges of, you know, for corporations, governments who will want to regulate coming out of the [COP 26], these are areas where we have real substantive detail, climate analytics. We have data that plays into climate analytics. So, location data around energy assets, our maritime and trade group have very detailed supply chain footprints for all the maritime fleet.  We have, you know, some great new products and services that play into research and development around E. So, I think we have the competitive edge as IHS Markit in E. When you marry that with S&P Global, I actually think the combination gets even stronger, and they do have the RobecoSAM, Trucost, and other assets that are very, very valuable in terms of, you know, competing with the likes of, you know MSCI, FTSE, the LSE group, you know various providers of ESG ratings and scores that are much more driven off the, you know, public knowledge, SNG versus the E.  So I think our combination is going to give us a competitive edge and give us a lot of opportunity to grow into, and I think across S&P Global and IHS Markit, this is a very strong double-digit growth engine for, you know, at least a decade. Because, you know, there's 1.5 trillion a year being spent, you know, on climate change now, and that number is expected to grow to something like 4.5 trillion. And so, I think we've got lots to offer, and you know we'll watch this space closely. Next question. [Indiscernible] let the team add to this one. So, I'll go to Jonathan or if he wants to pass it to any of the division heads he can. We're definitely hiring, and we're definitely, you know, with the growth numbers, you know, we're growing. And in many cases, we're growing into new spaces, in the markets to operate in. So, I haven't seen this have any, you know, challenges to hire. You know, and of course, in a merger, we make sure that we retain our people and look after them.  So, I don't notice anything that stands out, you know, from my perspective, but if any of the division heads want to add anything in terms of hiring, etcetera, maybe you can start Jonathan if you know our overall employment growth across the group, year-over-year, and then if any of the division heads want to add? Adam, do you want to add anything or Brian? Okay. Brian, anything? Yeah. No, it's great. We have over 250 interns and 250 graduates joining. So, you know, that fuels, a lot of our growth that manages our expenses. Okay, next question. Yeah, I'll start that. Jonathan can add if needs to. But, you know, we've really retooled CMS toward mid-single-digit growth. We called it out in this quarter that we expect the full-year to be mid-single-digits. So, you know, again I think you guys have, you know, strong confidence in the numbers we give you. And we expect to hit them. So, but you know, long term organic growth means you do it over and over and over again.  And then people give you that valuation expectation, and CMS has been, you know, in need of retooling and building out, our tech platform, the team has done a great job. They are seeing demand, and that's flowing through to, you know, better recurring revenue. So, I think the team's done a great job. I think moving from low up to mid-single-digits is step one. And we expect that the team will be able to do that through this year and then again into next year. Jonathan? Thanks, Jonathan. Next question. Right. Well, I guess it's the merger of IHS and Markit, you know that, I got used to that question every single quarter. So, about 20 quarters of that same question. So it's a good – it obviously is a good question because it's the one that's on the mind of all of our analysts. And I think what you should be really looking at is high single digit growth for transportation. And it does that time and time again, in a very diversified way. And sometimes it's used car markets, sometimes it's new car markets. Sometimes it's marketing and advertising.  Sometimes it's, you know, supply chain in predictive analytics. And so when everything's ticking, we can peek into double digits, but in general, I look at transportation, say it's a strong high single digit performer with ample opportunity in its markets to maintain that. And it's not reliant on new or used car sales alone, but many things that are actually needed by the automotive suppliers, and the OEMs, regardless of the environment we're in.  So, they all need to market from cars, they all need to spend their incentives, they all need to measure their emissions, they all need to order parts and study the supply chains. They all need to do R&D, and look into the future car, the connected car, the electrification of vehicles, next will be hydrogen. So, there's always stuff to be done. Then we get on the dealer floor. And the marriage of CARFAX and Mastermind and helping dealers sell cars in a connected digital world, those types of tools become even more important.  And so, I think, you know, you can expect more of the same in the high-single-digit range for transportation. But, you know, this is an outsize quarter that's catching up from, you know, a COVID period where, you know, really the comparison. You know, it's exciting to get to save 39% we actually teased the team that it wasn't 40, because would have been nicer number to shout out. But the fact is, it's really a high single digit consistent growth scenario, where the team's recovered really well. I'm all in there. I think that was our final question operator? Okay. Go ahead, Doug. No, I'd say as expected. We're definitely not ahead of schedule, but, you know, what I really like is the continued shift to a division that's highly diversified, like financial services, like transportation where we've got strong diversification across, you know, many facets of global economies that are, you know dealing with energy transition, new sources of energy, circular economy and demands waste.

            "content": "Great. Thank you, Lance. Q2 highlights included revenue organic growth of 13%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 14%, GAAP net income and EPS both had growth of 122%, and adjusted EPS had growth of 17% year-over-year. Regarding revenue, our Q2 revenue was $1.18 billion, with total growth of 15%. Organic growth in the quarter was 13%, which included the current organic growth of 10% and non-recurring organic growth of 41%. This increase was driven by strong underlying growth in financial services and transportation, as well as benefiting from favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the impact of COVID on some of our transportation and resources businesses. Moving on to segment performance, our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 9%, including 7% occurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular, had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in capital market issuances, corporate actions, and reg and compliant offerings, while information had 5% growth driven by pricing and valuations and our equities, regulatory reporting, and trading analytics platforms. Processing had a 6% organic increase driven by volumes, primarily in loans. Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 39% in the quarter. This included growth of 38% recurring, as Q2 continue to have strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses, and accelerating growth within our Maritime & Trade business. Non-recurring revenue increased by 41%, primarily driven by strong performance in CARFAX, consumer and dealer transactions, core automotive insights and Maritime & Trade events. Our resources segment remained flat, which is comprised with 8% recurring decline and 73% non-recurring increase. Q2 organic ACB increased by 2 million in the quarter, and our trailing 12-month organic ACB is down 8% as we have now cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year. We had great success with our entirely virtual CERAWeek and World Petrochem Conferences and we continue to see strong demand in our downstream businesses, particularly in our products and services to support energy transition and energy market supply chains. Our CMS segment had 1% organic growth, including 2% recurring and a decrease of 10% non-recurring. Moving now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was 517 million, up 63 billion versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% with a margin of 43.8% down 40 basis points, and up 30 basis points FX adjusted. Moving to our segments. Financial services adjusted EBITDA was 238 million, with a margin of 48.2% down 320 bips FX adjusted. Financial services margins reflects a return to more normal margin levels post COVID. Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was 171 billion, with a margin of 49.6%, up 870 bips FX adjusted. We do expect margins to moderate in forward quarters as we see more expense tied to revenue growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was 91 million with a margin of 41.4%, a decrease of 210 bips FX adjusted as a result of lower revenue. CMS adjusted EBITDA was 29 million, with a margin of 23.3%, down 520 bips FX adjusted. This quarter's decrease was driven primarily by the return to more normal margins compared to the prior year in addition to a mix shift. We do expect margins to continue to improve in the back half of the year. Moving now to net income and EPS. Net income was 159 million and GAAP EPS was $0.40. Adjusted EPS was $0.81, an increase of 17% over prior year. Our GAAP tax rate was 26%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q2 free cash flow was 301 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion has increased to 56%. Turning to the balance sheet, our Q2 ending debt balance was 5.0 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.6 times on a bank covenant basis, and 2.5 times net of cash. We closed the quarter with 217 million of cash and our Q2 undrawn revolver balance was approximately 917 million. In the quarter, we paid off our 250 million, 364-day term loan. Our Q2 weighted average diluted share count was [400.7 million] shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares, and therefore our share repurchase program is currently suspended, other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share based compensation. Moving to guidance, we had a strong first half of the year and are adjusting and raising our guidance ranges. We're raising revenue guidance to 4.635 billion to 4.675 billion with organic growth of 7% to 8%. Approximately 30 million of this increase is due to changes in FX rates, which are benefiting revenue, negative to margin percentage, but neutral to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is being raised to 2.02 billion to 2.03 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points adjusted for FX. Adjusted EPS is being increased to $3.15 per share to $3.17 per share. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid-60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance. Sure, Lance. Will do. I mean, just as you let your question, [certainly there's] been some very intensive integration planning going on, completely going back to severance, but first we announced this. And teams have been stood up across all the different functions, all the different areas, of course, being careful not to jump the gun, but really get ahead on the integration planning. And then that process, I think a couple things have come out. First, I think, as we identified synergies at – when we announced the deal. We've taken the last few quarters to really begin to solidify exactly the path to [indiscernible] synergies and I think we're increasing confidence on how to get there.  And the second thing culturally, to your question, it's been a great opportunity for the teams to really work with one another and get to know each other and get to know their future colleagues extremely well. And I think what's come out of that is certainly Lance and I knew from our discussions in the fall is the values of the two firms are very, very similar. And I think as the two teams have gotten to know each other, it's been relieving, if you will, for them to get to know that their colleagues are going to be working with other people that they want to work with. So, we're making great progress both culturally, as well as the integration planning, and we [indiscernible] well set up when we close. Sure. So, there was a couple different areas where we did. So, if you call last year, Q, what Q2 call last year, when we were entering COVID, we took some significant cost reductions, some of those were permanent, and those permanent cost savings have indeed been permanent. They haven't crept back in, but some were certainly temporary. There was impacts on executive salaries, few other things we did, we pulled back on marketing spend, for example on CARFAX given that the dealers had shut down in North America. And so those costs and we certainly built it into our plan, into our guidance this year, those costs have been reversed.  So, it does create a – I will call it somewhat odd dynamic or the absolute margin of the segment level with transportation, for example, when we take significant costs, reductions in Q2 of last year, you see a significant year-on-year margin accretion, which is a little bit of a false economy, I would say. You should see that normalize going forward. But those have been the main costs and have come back in. Then of course, we continue to invest in the business and where we see strong performance, they should make investments to fund future growth. But the key thing I will call out is really you're seeing the year-on-year reverse of some of those temporary cost reductions from last year. No, but maybe there's a couple of comments add to yours, Lance. I mean, first of all, we did give our 2021 guidance this time last year, coming out of all the noise of COVID. I'm actually really proud of the team that even with all the uncertainties back then, we are landing the plane, kind of as we expected. And as Lance has alluded to, great, great performance by the team.  Now, I will say, George, in terms of a raise in the guidance this time, obviously, we're doing on the back of what we saw in the first half of the year and what we're seeing go forward. I think at this point, we're not prepared to really give formal guidance for 2022. I think we'll be back to our normal cadence. Obviously, much rather be in position of strength exiting the year than position of weakness. But as Lance was saying, I think at this point, no news in terms of changes to future growth will surely get back to you later in the year once we finalize our plans. Sure, maybe I'll just give a general overview and then the division heads can supplement as they like. So, first off to your point is first, the attrition we've seen kind of year to date has been very much in line with what we normally see. And so no [indiscernible], we are growing. And you're absolutely right. We are growing and investing in all the different businesses that that Adam, Edouard and Brian, lead, in particular growing in India has always been a growth sector for us. India is a hot market. Itself is – what we're very, very attractive employers always, you know, challenged to find great people.  I would say that the challenge we have finding people this year really is not that different from other years. It's always, you look attractive, the best people and pull them in, is never easy, but we always try and to get it done. So, we are growing. Certain markets are hotter than other markets, certain segments, particularly in technology, data science, etcetera, the usual places you would expect. Obviously difficult, but I wouldn't say dramatically different this year from prior years. But happy to open up to the divisional leads to add some more color. Great last year – maybe just a few things I would add, because if you look at CMS, there are really two divisions or two major divisions. One is product design. One is our economic and country risk. So, then, product design, it has been a multi-year investment back in technology and new platforms and products. We begin to see that lift take place that drives. As Lance said, not a single year, but kind of a multi-year sustainable organic growth. We do certainly see as we look the first half of the year and then look at what's building in the second half of the year.  We do see a path for that to get to mid-single-digit seconds for the full-year, based on what we're seeing. That we think should be a sustainable growth rate. On the economic company risk that that Adam mentioned, this has been some significant investments in terms of new products and new packaging around how we get much more of a persona-based approach with our products there. And similar story where those investments were made to, kind of – end of last year early this year, and received the benefit in our growth through our pipeline, we expect to see that lift second half of the year. So, out report divisions, our lowest growth rate first half of the year, we would expect it to get to mid-singles by the end of the year."

And we, what we've done this year is, we have new or expanded offerings in all those areas. So, we're just seeing that segment of the business really take off. No. I mean, I think I agree. I'm seeing the same things that Edouard and Adam are and definitely our internship programs really help onboard good talent as those are grad. So, I think we're firing on all cylinders there."

            "content": "Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Lance. Can you hear me now? Okay, cool. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. And just to build on what Lance said, good call out on the inventories. So, the industry is still in a process of recovery. And you're right. In this current environment, both dealers and carmakers have less of a need to spend on marketing. And that does create a headwind for some of our products. On the other hand, I would say that dealers, in particular, are currently seeing higher margins they've ever recorded. And when our customers do well, that's obviously a good thing for us.  So, you sort of have a balance here of headwinds and tailwinds. But the takeaway for me is that even in marked environments like today's auto industry, I think we're showing that our products are critical, must-have products that are helping dealers and carmakers sell more cars, and also, in the case of dealers, acquire used cars in a really tough, kind of used car market. So that's a big deal for us. And I'm really happy with how the business has been performing in response. Yes, sure. Thank you, Jeff, and great question. So, over time, availability of connected car base is going to get bigger, coverage is going to get much better. And we see a couple of opportunities for us both in terms of access to data, to supplement what we do today, and also new business models. Today, we are running a number of POCs across our business, both on the CARFAX side of the business to figure out like what can we get from that base? And how can we supplement our existing resources, but also building that data set into workflow for carmakers such as dealer network optimization, dealer network designing.  So, an exciting opportunity for us. We see connected car data has been a critical source for us in the future. Right now, availability is limited. Coverage is very lighter and there are still some significant question marks around access to VIN-level data who owns that data, which will have to play out over the next two or three years. So, let's continue to watch this space together on the floors, but it will take two or three years for connected car data to emerge as something that we can really leverage. I'll just add something to what Jonathan said. I would say it's in pockets, right. I think is a great question. Technology is one of those pockets. You may have seen in some places an uptick in nutrition, and we have struggles to hire great tech talent in some locations. So, our strategy here is to diversify the sources of talent. But as you know, we are actively engaged in globalizing our talent footprint and that's helping us and in some cases, adjusted wages [indiscernible] by and large that we're funding the [chance we need]."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Boyer: Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 2021 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are not a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit’s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Jonathan Gear, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thank you, Eric. And just before we start the call, we do have a moment of silence for all of those who have passed from COVID over the past year. This has taken place at the moment in our UK offices. And I’d just like to pause for a moment here to respect all those that have passed and people that we know and love and friends and family that may have been passed away through the pandemic. So if we could just take a moment silence and then get started. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Eric. And thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. We started the year with a very strong set of Q1 results, which provides a great foundation for the full year. Q1 revenue was $1.12 billion, with organic growth of 3%. Adjusted EBITDA of $467 million and margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, an adjusted EPS of $0.71, up 8% over the prior year. Overall, we are pleased with the start of our year and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 guidance. In terms of our core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had record organic growth of 10% in Q1. Within Financial Services, Information had another quarter of solid organic growth of 6%. Main contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data and valuation services, as well as continued growth in our SFTR reporting platform and indices businesses. Solutions had a very strong quarter with 15% organic growth, driven by solid performance across our Solutions businesses. Increased capital market issuance and greater adoption of our corporate actions, private markets, and reg and compliance offerings were all significant contributors. We continue to expect Solutions to be a large growth contributor for the full year. Finally, our Processing business grew 6% organically, with strength in loans and derivative performance as expected. For the full year, we now expect Financial Services to be in the higher end of our 6% to 8% targeted organic growth range. I just want to congratulate the team on that record 10% quarter. That's the first time record since Markit went public and IHS Markit together that we had a 10% quarter. So congratulations to everybody. Moving on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth improved to 4% in Q1. As expected, we continue to see the rebound across our businesses at varying speeds. We’re particularly pleased to see our recurring revenue growth improved to 8% in the quarter. Our dealer facing dealer facing experienced strong growth across CARFAX and automotiveMastermind, with revenue growth rates approaching pre-COVID levels. New business was strong across the portfolio in Q1, and we remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year. Also in Transportation, our Maritime & Trade business had a very good start to the year, which was in line with our expectations. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. We expect strong new business and retention performance will drive an acceleration of recurring revenue growth through the rest of the year. For the full year, we now expect Transportation’s organic growth to be in the 13% to 15% range, which is up from our original 12% to 15%. Moving on to Resources, where organic decline was negative 10% in Q1. Our Resources business is playing out as expected. In 2020, given the industry conditions, we put into place a number of drivers that should help us return to growth in 2022. As expected, our ACV has bottomed in Q1 and expect for it to slowly recover through the rest of the year, which bodes well for 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate through the rest of the year. In the beginning of March, we held our CERAWeek conference, which had over 19,000 participants. Even with the virtual event, we were able to bring together leaders in the energy industry, world governments, finance and technology to discuss the future of energy. We also hosted a successful virtual World Petrochemical Conference. In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in low single digits, as upstream improves and downstream continues its growth trajectory. Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of negative 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results across Product Design, TMT and ECR to continue through the year. For the full year, we still expect CMS to deliver mid single digit organic growth. Now on March 11th, the shareholders of both IHS Markit and S&P Global overwhelmingly voted to approve the merger. We are working with the relevant regulatory bodies and still expect a second half close. And now I’ll turn the call over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Gear: Great. Thanks, Lance. Q1 results included revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents organic growth of 3% and total revenue increase of 4%, with recurring growth of 4%. Net income of $149 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37. Our adjusted EBITDA of $467 million, an increase of 8%, with margins of 41.7%, this represents margin expansion of 180 basis points. And we also delivered adjusted EPS of $0.71, an increase of 8%. Regarding revenue, our Q1 organic growth of 3% included recurring organic growth of 4% and non-recurring organic decline of 7%. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by lower automotive OEM activities, lower energy consulting activities, and transactional content purchases for upstream and product design when compared to Q1 of last year. Moving on to segment performance. Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 10%, including 9% recurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in equity capital markets, corporate actions, and reg and compliance offerings, and strength in our core portfolio monitoring management tools, while information and processing each had a 6% organic increase, driven by pricing and valuations and loan market activities, respectively. Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 4% in the quarter. This included growth of 8% recurring, as Q1 had strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses. Non-recurring revenue declined by 8%, primarily driven by continued lower activity in digital marketing and recall. Our Resources segment had 10% organic decline, which is comprised of a 9% recurring decline and 20% non-recurring decline. Q1 organic ACV decreased by $7 million in the quarter and our trailing 12 month organic ACV is down 11%, as we have largely cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year. Our CMS segment had 1% organic decline, including 2% increased recurring and a decline of 25% non-recurring. Moving now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, up $35 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% with a margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points. Moving on to our segments. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $233 million, with a margin of 48.1%, up 100 basis points. Financial Services margin was driven by strong revenue growth, while supporting continued investment. Transportation’s adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, with a margin of 47.1%, up 740 basis points. We do expect margins to moderate to - in forward quarters, as we see more expense tied to revenue growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $74 million, with a margin of 36.6%, a decrease of 340 basis points, as a result of lower revenue. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $26 million, with a margin of 21.5%, down 250 basis points. This quarter decrease was primarily driven by mix shift, which we expect to improve during the year. Adjusted EPS was $0.71 per diluted share, an increase of 8%. Our GAAP tax rate was 17%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q1 free cash flow was $172 million. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our lowest free cash flow quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. Our Q1 ending [ph] debt balance was $5.1 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7 times on a bank covenant basis and 2.6 times net of cash. We closed the quarter with $172 million of cash, and our Q1 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.022 billion. Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 401 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares. And therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended, other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share based compensation. Moving to guidance. We had a great start to the year, and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, which include the following, revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%, adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points when adjusted for FX, an adjusted EPS of $3.11 to 3.16. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid 60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. It was a great start to 2021, which puts us on track to deliver strong full year results. I want to thank our colleagues for their continued focus and dedication during the challenges of the pandemic and as we work towards closing the exciting merger with S&P Global. With that, we’re ready to open up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. And congratulations on the great results. Hey, Lance or Jonathan, could you unpack maybe just within Financial Services, you gave really good detail there. But the 10% organic growth overall, it was just really outsized growth in non-recurring. And want to get a sense of, given that strength, does that impact the overall business as you think about it over the balance of the year both on the non-recurring side and then some of the more episodic issues as for core Financial Services business? Is that a structural step-up as you think about the business?\nLance Uggla: So were you - you're referring to Financial Services 10% organic growth?\nKevin McVeigh: That’s right, Lance.\nLance Uggla: Yeah, to just take the breakdown. Okay. I’ll pass that to Adam and he can give you a bit breakdown of the 10% and where the real strong parts are and what he sees on the go-forward as well. Adam?\nAdam Kansler: Sure. Thanks. So yeah, we’re obviously very pleased with the quarter. We’ve built strong platforms and strong capabilities in a few markets that have really seen strength through Q1. We do expect some of that strength to continue throughout the year, particularly in equity capital markets, you saw a very strong first quarter. Second quarter continues to look strong. We’ll see what the balance of the year brings. And similarly, in some of the loans markets, we’ve seen strength as well. So we feel pretty good about the core businesses. They continue to grow at the rates that we’ve targeted, in some cases, towards the higher ends of those targets. With the addition of strong capital markets, that gives us the opportunity to deliver a double-digit quarter like we did here. I’d love to say, we’ll continue that you know, into the future. We’ll see what the future brings. But it’s about - just really about positioning our product to take advantage of those opportunities when the markets are strong.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thanks, Adam. Also, the private markets performance and performance generally across Solutions as asset managers are assessing their cost structures has really been a strong tailwind for the team. And it’s great to see the Solutions teams back to 15%, which we hadn’t seen for a while. So, great results all around. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Lance, I was hoping you could help just provide some of the key takeaways from CERAWeek when you look out over the next couple of years and maybe 3 to 5 years. You know, there’s obviously a lot of movement. And I was hoping some of those insights could help us just figure out what the trajectory for Resources is?\nLance Uggla: Yeah. Okay. No, that’s a great question, Manav. So the first off, I guess when you look at the agenda for CERAWeek, you see a strong formation of discussion in plenaries around energy transition, which is a step away from the big discussion around climate change. And when you think about how the world is responding now with the new Biden administration, with the COP26 coming up, you know, real strong support for the 1.5 degree pathway. And I think that positions IHS Markit’s energy team very, very well for the energy transition associated growth that’s going to come as the industrial participants start to shift gears and look for how they might participate in their businesses with respect to energy transition. That being said, it was pretty clear from the CERAWeek discussions that 100 million barrels a day is still a level of demand post-COVID that is in the crosshairs of what needs to be supplied. And therefore, our upstream business will need to continue to support and play an important role in the provision of the fossil fuels needed, as the world’s transitioning towards 2050. So I think we win both ways, thought leadership, a player in the upstream to support the required supply, and a team that’s working very hard to transition itself through the solar, wind, hydrogen storage solutions and a variety of other activities that are expected to decarbonize our world. So I think we’re doing a good job. I think CERAWeek to me, really sung a story of energy transition stronger than it ever has. And I think we’re well-positioned to get the new growth and to maintain our contracts that we’ve managed through 2020 to longer term and a bit lower price. And so, we’ll see the slightly negative impact through this year. And I’d expect mid single digit growth as we go into 2022. Brian, do you want to add to that at all?\nBrian Crotty: No. Yeah, I just think the team did a great job taking you know, the physical event and migrating into a virtual event. And we’re looking forward in October to having a physical event in India, and of course, next March. But, I think you’ve hit all the high points with energy transition, ESG, clean tech, carbon capture. All of these things that our customers are looking forward to, we’re in a good position to help them.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thanks. Hey. Thanks, Manav. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, guys. Good morning. So the question I continue to get asked most as it relates to the pending merger is just for a bit more granular color on synergies within some of segments. I guess with Adam slated to run Market Intelligence, I wonder if he is got any more thoughts or Lance you do, just to give us a little more color on where you see the big opportunities merging your Financial business within S&P, you know, either on the cost side, or maybe more importantly on the revenue side? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Well, maybe I’ll start and then hand that to Adam given he is right engaged in that post-merger integration discussions. But one thing I can say is that the cost side of the equation has been very well mapped out. Teams are aligned, and my view is that that’s the low-hanging fruit over the next couple of years. And both teams are very focused on making sure they can deliver the results. The exciting side, of course, is the revenue opportunities that Doug and I spoke about. And we see substantive opportunity for revenue synergies. And the teams have started to map them out. They are meeting regularly. And maybe for Financial Services, to start, Adam, you want to chat, and you can probably add the index side in as well.\nAdam Kansler: Yeah. And I really would refer you back to when Lance and Doug talked about it in the merger. Those core areas that were identified upfront continue to be the core areas of opportunity, whether it’s in bringing together multi-asset class benchmarks in our index franchise, the scale of data assets that we can make available to customers and more efficient delivery to those customers. The combined ESG capabilities and assets of the business, the strong ability to play a role in private markets, an area growing quite rapidly, and our deep knowledge of underlying company financials, as well as the tools that are used by the private equity and private credit industry to manage their portfolios. And then, of course, a significant set of data and capabilities around credit and risk looking into the supply chain of customers. So all of the areas that were identified upfront, as we’ve gone through a more extended period of discovery, proven out to be quite significant opportunities for us forward. I think in the coming months, the teams will update publicly our views on synergies. It’s still early to do that. We’re still in a regulatory approval period and still in a discovery phase. But it’s – you know, as we dug in more and more, all of the expectations that we had have proven out.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Thank you, Adam. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may proceed with your question.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Question on Transport, so the recurring looks particularly good to me given that it’s still a tough comp, and I think you effectively lost a year or two price lift in that business. So is that the broader Mastermind product suite that’s resulting in more cross-selling or what’s driving that? And then on digital marketing, is it an environmental factor from your perspective where they just haven’t leaned back in yet, or is there some initiatives to improve the positioning of your business that we should be watching for? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Edouard?\nEdouard Tavernier: Right. And hi, Jeff. Thanks for your question. And you are right, the story of the quarter is our recurring revenue growth. We’re very happy with it. It’s developing according to plan. And it shows the strength of the underlying business, and it should strengthen throughout the year. What's driving it? I think it’s the - our core products, right? So if you look at the CARFAX offerings, if you look at the Mastermind offerings, or if you look at some of our core subscription products like supply chain and technology, all of these businesses are growing significantly and are showing good resilience in the first quarter. On the digital marketing side, so what we’re seeing is advertising spending is coming back relative to where it was two or three quarters ago. But it has not yet resumed to pre-COVID levels. Why is that? A couple of reasons, but one of the big ones is low inventories. The supply chain is still catching up and trying to rebuild inventory levels in particular in the North American market. And when inventories are low, advertising spend tends to be lower. And we’re still seeing this in the industry today, and we will see subdued inventory levels for the next couple of quarters at least. And that’s why advertising spend and digital marketing spend is still not quite where we would like it to be. We are seeing strength in the business. We are - activities far higher than it was two quarters ago. So we expect digital marketing to be stronger as the year goes by.\nJeff Meuler: Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning. A quick one on the updated guidance. It sounds to me like financials and automotive doing a little bit better, and then the other business is kind of in line with expectations. Can you also talk about how FX has impacted your outlook change? You got a small benefit in the first quarter. But since then, I think, some of the major currencies [ph] have moved in kind of opposite direction. So just wondering, how much, if any, FX benefits are driving the guidance to the higher end of the range? Thanks.\nJonathan Gear: Sure. This is, Jonathan. I’ll jump and answer [ph] that question. We certainly are getting some benefit of FX at the top-line on revenue. That will impact some of the forward words we're saying about guidance being at the upper end of the range. However, lot of that is just core operational improvement that we’re seeing from AFS [ph] that we continue to see from Transportation and also the - as the outlook for the rest of the year for both Resources and CMS. You should also note, Alex, because you know, we get a benefit from - at the top end from FX, it does impact our expenses. And so the – as the improvement you’re seeing from EBITDA is really a reflection of both, of FX impacting both revenues and expenses. So the EBITDA and EPS flow through is I would call core operational improvement.\nAlex Kramm: Very good. Thanks.\nJonathan Gear: Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Jonathan. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Within Resources, could you tell us, if the non-subs business, like the Energy Consulting business and other non-subs business has lifted off the bottom yet? And kind of what is the nature of what IHS is doing for the industry as the industry recovers, in terms of non-subs?\nBrian Crotty: Yeah, hi. This is Brian. So yeah, the - so the consulting business is already - is bouncing back. When we look out forward, we’re going to be having double-digit growth even in upstream on consulting, which is a good sign for us, because, usually, when consulting bounces back, then you have your subscriptions following.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. Thank you. My question was just around the market serve JV with CME. I know you have that listed as assets for sale. Any mechanics we should be thinking about, on that particular JV? And, as it relates to sort of the larger merger? Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Adam, you want to answer that one?\nAdam Kansler: Yeah. I think, that's a combination that we've talked about for a couple of years, in looking to pull together some of the core assets in the industry around post-trade processing and really not related to the merger. It wasn’t done in anticipation or in connection with that. It was really part of a larger strategy around maximizing the value that assets set. It will continue to be an important part of the business. We’ll look to continue to leverage it, in terms of data sets and opportunities that will come out of making that process much more efficient for our customers and those joint offerings. So I think it continues to be complementary to the combined business, but no direct connection. Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Adam. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a solid quarter. Just a question on the robust margin expansion that we saw in the quarter, we’ve seen several quarters of this margin expansion. My question was - are there further opportunities for cost takeout and accelerate the margin expansion? And this is more through some structural changes within IHS Markit itself? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Maybe I can start, Jonathan, and then you can add. So, first off, we have a strong view at IHS Markit, and that will carry on with the strategic merger, that there is a opportunity to continue to see Resources, especially through this new understanding of the virtually - virtual world, to see Resources in some of the better cost locations that we operate in. And that can be within North America, within South America, India, Eastern Europe, Europe and the Far East. All of our major centers are - have close proximity to some better cost on or offshore locations. So location plays a big role. The second thing that’s playing increasingly big role is technology and the use of technology to manage our more operationally-focused jobs and that also gives us a continued opportunity for margin expansion. So as we look forward, we see that 100 basis points of margin a year, as one that we can continue to support. And there will be opportunity for margin expansion in the combination as well. Jonathan, do you want to add to that at all?\nJonathan Gear: No, Lance. I think you covered it really, really well. I guess, the other thing I’ll just add on top of the cost levers that you’re always pulling, is, of course, we get the natural benefit of the scalability of our revenue as it comes through, which helps with that lift. But, Lance, as you said it well, I think, we see very clear path to 100 basis points at that suggested for this year.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thank you.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. You may proceed with your question.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Lance, can you give us a little more insight on the - how the sales are going from, like, the Data Lake going commercial and how the new product innovation is going? Some of the stuff that you’ve been building to kind of generate the flywheel momentum for years into the future. Is there any like quantitative info you can share or, if not, just qualitatively.\nLance Uggla: Yeah. What I can say is, is that - and if Adam, Edouard or Brian want to add anything after this, they can. What I’ve been impressed with is the pipeline, the growing pipeline and connectivity to the Data Lake, and the assessment of the Data Lake as a new way to consume data from us more efficiently. But also to reach some broader contracts, especially around the hedge fund community, where quantitative and qualitative decision making from vast quantities of data, you know, it’s some of the bigger hedge funds that have those tools and have those capabilities. We’re also seeing some mid-size vendors and some corporates [ph] who have been grappling with their own construct of a Data Lake, where they can leverage us as a technology platform to be able to, not just provide them our data, but to provide them connectivity for their own and even distribution for their own. So some very strong discussions that are starting to lead to revenue. There is paying customers for the Data Lake now, and that starts to grow. Edouard, do you want to add to that. How you're using it within automotive? And then maybe, Adam, you might want to do the same on AFS [ph]. Edouard?\nEdouard Tavernier: Yeah. Sure, Lance. And I’ll address the broader point about kind of innovation, product innovation. I think that is the story, right, over the past 3 or 4 years. We measure internally - we use a metric recall with the vitality index, right? I don't think we publish it. But we measure the contribution of new products to our growth. And for division like Transportation, that contribution has increased year after year over the past 5 years. New products and high growth products are an increasing part of our kind of overall revenue growth.  To give you an example, right, in concrete terms. And if you look at our Maritime and Trade business, it’s always owned a number of incredibly valuable kind of legacy data assets. But over the past 3 years, it has repositioned essentially a data business into a solutions business targeting risk management workflows, trade compliance workflows, commodities analytics workflows. And through this transformation has become essentially a high single digit growth business.  A lot of these innovations have been enabled by the Data Lake and which strongly reduces the product development life cycle. So it’s certainly a good innovation story there. Adam, I don't know if you want to add something?\nAdam Kansler: Yeah. I guess what I would add is, we’ve been pretty excited about the uptake and adoption of our catalog, which allows customers to integrate our data sets over 1500 data sets in the Data Lake today into their own data sets. We’re seeing that uptake, not just in asset managers, but also in corporates, banks and obviously, other parts of the buy side. One of the interesting aspects of their discovery of our data sets is the vast amount of, what you’d call alternative data you know, that’s within those data sets, which we’ve always believed had strong value, as more and more clients adopt our catalog and ability to access the Data Lake that seems to be proving out. We do have paying customers today and we do see the pipeline forward. And I think we’re also particularly excited about how that will come together, as we down the road finalize the S&P merger and think about their marketplace and how all of these data sets can come together in a really efficient and exciting way for our customers.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Adam. Brian, do you want to add from energy, some of the initiatives you’re using the Data Lake for and how it started to drive opportunity?\nBrian Crotty: Sure, yes. So first of all, one - just to support what you said. So we do see a nice pipeline of, especially chemical companies and banking companies looking into the Data Lake for solutions they perhaps can’t get in other places.  Like Edouard said, when we’re looking at developing kind of clean energy, clean tech products, we can go into the lake and take information both from what we’re doing, what other - what our customers are doing. So it’s just a good place where we can shorten product development life cycles to build out things like emissions and things that our customers are interested in.\nLance Uggla: Okay. Thank you. And just to remind everybody, when I think back to the IHS Markit merger, we said two things about building out the Data Lake over the coming years. One, that it would give us efficiencies in terms of managing our own content, which we see through margin expansion. But secondly, that would give us opportunities for distribution, combination of data with customers and third-parties and give us a real competitive edge in our ability to sell and distribute our content. The piece that I think is additive to all that, that we’re starting to learn about is more that there are significant numbers of larger customers who want to be able to interrogate large data sets to identify decision-making signals and decision points. And that’s been leading us to some of the bigger quantitative hedge funds, but it also exists within the corporate world for analytics and analysis. So I think we’re well on our way to gaining the efficiencies and we’re starting to see the revenue follow through as well. So a good story. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the Transportation business, dealers saw strong growth in Automotive, Mastermind and CARFAX. Can you discuss trends that you are seeing among your OEM customers?\nEdouard Tavernier: Yes. Hi, George. This is Edouard. So the OEM customers last year had a slightly different cycle to the dealers in the sense that in Q2 they were operating sort of more normally. But if you will, the COVID crisis really hit them in Q3, and they are still recovering from this. So today they are doing much better. As you know, demand for vehicles is picking up significantly in the US and globally in 2021, as is production. The one caveat I would bring is that the supply chain is still adjusting to this post-COVID world. So the - some of those supply chain issues have been well-documented, in particular the semiconductor shortages. And they have led us to revise our 2021 forecast down by 0.5 million vehicles. So that is a temporary kind of shock, but it is a shock nonetheless. And it's slowing down the recovery of inventories in Western markets. There are some other challenges, right? So there was a bout of severe weather in the southern US a few weeks ago. That has actually created a shortfall of chemical feedstocks. That’s also impacting the supply chain. There was a fire last week in Japan in a major semiconductor plant. So all of these are sort of impacting our customers. But in the end, it’s delaying the recovery, but the recovery is coming back. We’re in a good place in the sense that we are supporting OEMs and suppliers with some of these secular structural transformations in the industry, and those are multi-year transformations, and our data and our solutions are critical to helping them. So slower recovery, but recovering nonetheless and the outlook for the industry is positive.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard…\nGeorge Tong: Got it.\nLance Uggla: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. Sort of a long-term question for you, Lance. Your business spans a number of end-markets that are going through significant industry changes. You’ve talked about the energy transition. And also within Transportation, there seems to be a shift more towards technology long-term. And I know you are providing companies with solutions to help them with these changes and shifting their strategies. I guess can you just talk about what this means within IHS? Is this - does this mean selling different products to your existing customers as these changes take place? Do the traditional datasets become sort of less used, but new datasets receive more demand? And does this enable more up-selling to existing customers, but also opportunities to get new customers, maybe technology players, et cetera, as these changes take place? So any color there would be helpful? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Okay. That's a good – that's a good question and one that definitely encompasses our strategic vision. And for all my team, they are very focused on the impact of the changing marketplaces around us that are being driven by either technology or a quest for decarbonization, and therefore, participating in a change in net zero world as we look forward. So you have to take those and go, are we going to be able to participate and take revenue from that and adjust our business positively? Or are we going to find that we get dis-intermediated because some of the revenue streams will shrink? So our strategy is very, very clear. If you look in Transportation, you are seeing it right now in Maritime and Trade, and you see it in our strong automotive recovery. And that is, is that, when you look at those revenue streams and you dig into them, you start to see how they are shifting their customer base to new solutions, new platforms and new decision making tools. And within automotive, we are an independent supplier of information that helps people make decisions. And the world – the automotive world has got more complex. And it will continue to get more complex, as we look forward, given this drive towards net zero. So I feel like the information sets around automotive are very buoyant and participating and forecasting in good or bad markets is a good thing. The second thing I’d say is that Mastermind, when we’ve acquired Mastermind, I think it was around $80 million of revenue. It’s now running towards $120 million this year. And that’s getting driven because Edouard and his team have taken the Mastermind platform, married it with Polk data, married it with CARFAX data, took full views for the OEMs. And the OEMs for the first time are saying, Geez, why do I want to provide a incentive that blankets the US? Why don’t I target market at right down to post codes, or even right down to individuals? And that’s where the Mastermind platform, which we called an enterprise Mastermind, is adapting to this new digital world, and even a world where there is less dealerships in the car just lands in your driveway. So we want to participate in that, and the team is doing a great job shifting. There is some other ones in around automotive, but I’ll shift for a second. Maritime, there, the shift is the new services. It’s supply chain, it’s decarbonization. It’s – you’ve got all the Maritime fleet information. All of your suppliers that are trying to be ESG compliant need to know what’s the carbon footprint of the delivery of my goods? And so we’re now producing a full carbon fleet analysis for our customers, and that’s a growth area. It’s being driven from the Data Lake. It’s new technology. It’s just old products adapting to new worlds and making sure we’re participating. If you go over to Energy, I think we covered that. Energy, we’re going to have to make sure that we maintain the upstream you know, $250 million to $300 million of revenue. And the rest of the revenue, we’re going to have to grow as the Energy markets transition. And we’re very well positioned. We do consulting around all those services, that’s helpful. We know where the assets are, so that’s helpful for global warming. We know where the pipelines are, the distribution. We have a lot of data that plays into the new world. And we’re transitioning and growing our solar, wind, hydrogen, battery storage businesses, and this is a growth market. So it's going to be a tough. For the Energy folks, this is going to be a year where it’s tough because we gave discounts last year and they got to recover into next year. But I think that by the time they get to 2022, they might be the darlings again in the company, and you’ll see somebody else on their back. And then Financial Services, I think we’re in all the right growth markets. So there, I feel good about it. And I don’t want to leave CMS out because, sometimes, we do, but RootMetrics, which is small, I know, but they are into 5G, and 5G is important. And if you go over to the CMS product design folks, their pipeline is all about digital transformation and focusing on the vast amounts of specs and standards that need to be added together to in-house documentation for engineers to make decisions. And we’re playing that game with our digital platform, and we’ve got a great pipeline because we can save people money. So net-net, I think, for a great – great people, a great company. We’re well-positioned to get our share. The question always is, is IHS Markit, now S&P Global, will they get their share of the growth in TAMs that are substantive? And my bet is, yes, of course, they will. They are filled with great people and great customers and therefore there’s lots to do.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nLance Uggla: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. At the beginning of the call, you mentioned the very successful CERAWeek. And I’m just curious how these virtual events compare to your in-person events in terms of economics and profitability? And going forward, what do you think your strategy is going to be on the event side?\nLance Uggla: Well, what I can tell you is that the team - the team has found that they can profitably manage virtual conferences. So they’ve done that. We have three of those, TPM, World Petrochemical Conference and CERAWeek. And all of them had record audiences. So the - and the audiences can be record because everybody’s online virtually. So instead of 4 or 5, 000 physical conference seats, you can have tens of thousands of virtual seats. People are willing to pay for top quality content and access to the right audience. And we had all the right audience. We had top government officials, new US Energy Minister, John Kerry, in his new climate envoy role. We had Bill Gates. We had heads of pharmaceutical companies. We had technology, big sessions on hydrogen. It really was impressive, and we’ll see that growth come into our next quarter. And it was - all as I can say is the team was well-ahead of their plan and pressed all of us in all three events, and we’ll give you those numbers next quarter. So, I think worst case scenario is we’re always virtual and we’re going to get better and better at it and grow from there. Best case scenario, which I think we’re all hoping for, is we get to be back together in rooms and feel safe, and can network and build relationships like humans like to do. So, let’s hope for the second. But if the first comes, it’s not going to hurt our growth path. I think the teams have proven they can make money and grow. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to the merger, a lot of focus has been paid to the cross-sell and new product opportunity for the Resources and Financial Services businesses. But I wanted to ask what that might look like for Transportation. What do you see as the major opportunity there? And since I believe one component will be to sell Transportation data and research through the Market Intelligence platform, I am wondering what are the specific client types already on that platform that make the most sense in terms of consuming that information? Thanks.\nLance Uggla: Edouard?\nEdouard Tavernier: Hi, Andrew. Yeah. This is Edouard. Thanks for your question. So, yes, you’re spot on, right? We have unique proprietary automotive content. That content is highly valuable to the investment community and the financial community as a whole. We made some significant progress since the IHS and Markit merger 4 years ago in monetizing these data assets. But we’re still in the early stages of a fairly long growth runway. So, if you look at the Market Intelligence kind of customer base, there is very, very strong penetration in the investment community. That will be our number one target. But there are also pockets of other customers which are potentially highly valuable for the order business. So, that’s the idea where we’re working hard to refine these assumptions and some more of this later.\nLance Uggla: Thanks, Edouard. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thanks. I appreciate you squeezing me in towards the end. It’s remarkable to see the strength in FI [ph] Lance, can you talk about any thoughts per investing for above trend revenue growth? I mean, do you take opportunities around, for example, robust capital markets activity to plough excess back into the business? And if so, where are those areas of focus you think could support above trend top-line growth down the road?\nLance Uggla: Right. Well, so in financial markets, we can start there. And we have made acquisitions to support our private markets activities this year. We made an investment in one of the world class fund admins in - you know, that support the alternative space. We see substantive synergies and opportunities there to invest in our reporting services like iLEVEL and the integration of those products into the administration side. So, that’s an investing side. IHS Markit, and now S&P Global, Adam’s teams are investing with PIMCO, Man Group, McKinsey, Microsoft, and others around a product called HUB, which they will ultimately consolidate back into their Solutions businesses. That’s all about new technology and efficiencies for asset managers. So, yes, continued investment. When you get over into the automotive world, I mentioned already the enterprise Mastermind, which is the broader OEM platform, that’s been an investment through COVID. CMS has been investing in the digitization of their business. And - all of these lead me to the so the upper half of our growth range if executed well. You know, I was really pleased. I’ve never seen a 10% quarter probably since 2014 or somewhere before that. So to see a 10% quarter in FI [ph] if things coming back that – its your normal businesses performing, you know, at 5% to 6% growth range, but then your new investment areas, which are big into solutions are performing at – you know, above their ranges. And that sometimes is volume, but in this case, it’s a lot of the new product development and the hard work the teams have been doing. I think in energy, it speaks for itself. It’s renewables. Its – you know, we acquired the agriculture business, ag and decarbonisation, they all kind of go hand-in-hand, land use in this new world that we head into. And I think the teams are investing. They are adding people. They are investing in their businesses. And we only - we give 100 basis points margin, but there is more than enough opportunity through the revenue side and cost management for us to create investment dollars. And all the teams are doing that. I’ll pause here and go to the next question.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to the company for any further remarks.\nEric Boyer: We thank you for your interest in IHS Markit.

            "name": "Adam Kansler",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks. So yeah, we're obviously very pleased with the quarter. We've built strong platforms and strong capabilities in a few markets that have really seen strength through Q1. We do expect some of that strength to continue throughout the year, particularly in equity capital markets, you saw a very strong first quarter. Second quarter continues to look strong. We'll see what the balance of the year brings. And similarly, in some of the loans markets, we've seen strength as well. So we feel pretty good about the core businesses. They continue to grow at the rates that we've targeted, in some cases, towards the higher ends of those targets. With the addition of strong capital markets, that gives us the opportunity to deliver a double-digit quarter like we did here. I'd love to say, we'll continue that you know, into the future. We'll see what the future brings. But it's about - just really about positioning our product to take advantage of those opportunities when the markets are strong. Yeah. And I really would refer you back to when Lance and Doug talked about it in the merger. Those core areas that were identified upfront continue to be the core areas of opportunity, whether it's in bringing together multi-asset class benchmarks in our index franchise, the scale of data assets that we can make available to customers and more efficient delivery to those customers. The combined ESG capabilities and assets of the business, the strong ability to play a role in private markets, an area growing quite rapidly, and our deep knowledge of underlying company financials, as well as the tools that are used by the private equity and private credit industry to manage their portfolios. And then, of course, a significant set of data and capabilities around credit and risk looking into the supply chain of customers. So all of the areas that were identified upfront, as we've gone through a more extended period of discovery, proven out to be quite significant opportunities for us forward. I think in the coming months, the teams will update publicly our views on synergies. It's still early to do that. We're still in a regulatory approval period and still in a discovery phase. But it's – you know, as we dug in more and more, all of the expectations that we had have proven out. Yeah. I think, that's a combination that we've talked about for a couple of years, in looking to pull together some of the core assets in the industry around post-trade processing and really not related to the merger. It wasn't done in anticipation or in connection with that. It was really part of a larger strategy around maximizing the value that assets set. It will continue to be an important part of the business. We'll look to continue to leverage it, in terms of data sets and opportunities that will come out of making that process much more efficient for our customers and those joint offerings.

            "name": "Lance Uggla",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Eric. And just before we start the call, we do have a moment of silence for all of those who have passed from COVID over the past year. This has taken place at the moment in our UK offices. And I'd just like to pause for a moment here to respect all those that have passed and people that we know and love and friends and family that may have been passed away through the pandemic. So if we could just take a moment silence and then get started. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Eric. And thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. We started the year with a very strong set of Q1 results, which provides a great foundation for the full year. Q1 revenue was $1.12 billion, with organic growth of 3%. Adjusted EBITDA of $467 million and margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, an adjusted EPS of $0.71, up 8% over the prior year. Overall, we are pleased with the start of our year and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 guidance. In terms of our core industry verticals, let me first start with our Financial Services segment, which had record organic growth of 10% in Q1. Within Financial Services, Information had another quarter of solid organic growth of 6%. Main contributors included increased demand for our pricing, reference data and valuation services, as well as continued growth in our SFTR reporting platform and indices businesses. Solutions had a very strong quarter with 15% organic growth, driven by solid performance across our Solutions businesses. Increased capital market issuance and greater adoption of our corporate actions, private markets, and reg and compliance offerings were all significant contributors. We continue to expect Solutions to be a large growth contributor for the full year. Finally, our Processing business grew 6% organically, with strength in loans and derivative performance as expected. For the full year, we now expect Financial Services to be in the higher end of our 6% to 8% targeted organic growth range. I just want to congratulate the team on that record 10% quarter. That's the first time record since Markit went public and IHS Markit together that we had a 10% quarter. So congratulations to everybody. Moving on to Transportation, which had organic revenue growth improved to 4% in Q1. As expected, we continue to see the rebound across our businesses at varying speeds. We're particularly pleased to see our recurring revenue growth improved to 8% in the quarter. Our dealer facing dealer facing experienced strong growth across CARFAX and automotiveMastermind, with revenue growth rates approaching pre-COVID levels. New business was strong across the portfolio in Q1, and we remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year. Also in Transportation, our Maritime & Trade business had a very good start to the year, which was in line with our expectations. We also hosted a successful virtual TPM conference in March. We expect strong new business and retention performance will drive an acceleration of recurring revenue growth through the rest of the year. For the full year, we now expect Transportation's organic growth to be in the 13% to 15% range, which is up from our original 12% to 15%. Moving on to Resources, where organic decline was negative 10% in Q1. Our Resources business is playing out as expected. In 2020, given the industry conditions, we put into place a number of drivers that should help us return to growth in 2022. As expected, our ACV has bottomed in Q1 and expect for it to slowly recover through the rest of the year, which bodes well for 2022 recurring revenue. Our downstream organic revenue growth performed as expected and should accelerate through the rest of the year. In the beginning of March, we held our CERAWeek conference, which had over 19,000 participants. Even with the virtual event, we were able to bring together leaders in the energy industry, world governments, finance and technology to discuss the future of energy. We also hosted a successful virtual World Petrochemical Conference. In 2021, we continue to expect organic revenue results within Resources to improve compared to 2020 and to be down year-over-year in low single digits, as upstream improves and downstream continues its growth trajectory. Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was in line with our expectations of negative 1% for the quarter. We expect improving results across Product Design, TMT and ECR to continue through the year. For the full year, we still expect CMS to deliver mid single digit organic growth. Now on March 11th, the shareholders of both IHS Markit and S&P Global overwhelmingly voted to approve the merger. We are working with the relevant regulatory bodies and still expect a second half close. And now I'll turn the call over to Jonathan. Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. It was a great start to 2021, which puts us on track to deliver strong full year results. I want to thank our colleagues for their continued focus and dedication during the challenges of the pandemic and as we work towards closing the exciting merger with S&P Global. With that, we're ready to open up for questions. Operator? So were you - you're referring to Financial Services 10% organic growth? Yeah, to just take the breakdown. Okay. I'll pass that to Adam and he can give you a bit breakdown of the 10% and where the real strong parts are and what he sees on the go-forward as well. Adam? Okay. Thanks, Adam. Also, the private markets performance and performance generally across Solutions as asset managers are assessing their cost structures has really been a strong tailwind for the team. And it's great to see the Solutions teams back to 15%, which we hadn't seen for a while. So, great results all around. Next question? Yeah. Okay. No, that's a great question, Manav. So the first off, I guess when you look at the agenda for CERAWeek, you see a strong formation of discussion in plenaries around energy transition, which is a step away from the big discussion around climate change. And when you think about how the world is responding now with the new Biden administration, with the COP26 coming up, you know, real strong support for the 1.5 degree pathway. And I think that positions IHS Markit's energy team very, very well for the energy transition associated growth that's going to come as the industrial participants start to shift gears and look for how they might participate in their businesses with respect to energy transition. That being said, it was pretty clear from the CERAWeek discussions that 100 million barrels a day is still a level of demand post-COVID that is in the crosshairs of what needs to be supplied. And therefore, our upstream business will need to continue to support and play an important role in the provision of the fossil fuels needed, as the world's transitioning towards 2050. So I think we win both ways, thought leadership, a player in the upstream to support the required supply, and a team that's working very hard to transition itself through the solar, wind, hydrogen storage solutions and a variety of other activities that are expected to decarbonize our world. So I think we're doing a good job. I think CERAWeek to me, really sung a story of energy transition stronger than it ever has. And I think we're well-positioned to get the new growth and to maintain our contracts that we've managed through 2020 to longer term and a bit lower price. And so, we'll see the slightly negative impact through this year. And I'd expect mid single digit growth as we go into 2022. Brian, do you want to add to that at all? Okay. Thanks. Hey. Thanks, Manav. Next question? Okay. Well, maybe I'll start and then hand that to Adam given he is right engaged in that post-merger integration discussions. But one thing I can say is that the cost side of the equation has been very well mapped out. Teams are aligned, and my view is that that's the low-hanging fruit over the next couple of years. And both teams are very focused on making sure they can deliver the results. The exciting side, of course, is the revenue opportunities that Doug and I spoke about. And we see substantive opportunity for revenue synergies. And the teams have started to map them out. They are meeting regularly. And maybe for Financial Services, to start, Adam, you want to chat, and you can probably add the index side in as well. Thank you, Adam. Next question. Edouard? Thanks, Edouard. Next question? Thanks, Jonathan. Next question? Next question? Adam, you want to answer that one? Thanks, Adam. Next question? Maybe I can start, Jonathan, and then you can add. So, first off, we have a strong view at IHS Markit, and that will carry on with the strategic merger, that there is a opportunity to continue to see Resources, especially through this new understanding of the virtually - virtual world, to see Resources in some of the better cost locations that we operate in. And that can be within North America, within South America, India, Eastern Europe, Europe and the Far East. All of our major centers are - have close proximity to some better cost on or offshore locations. So location plays a big role. The second thing that's playing increasingly big role is technology and the use of technology to manage our more operationally-focused jobs and that also gives us a continued opportunity for margin expansion. So as we look forward, we see that 100 basis points of margin a year, as one that we can continue to support. And there will be opportunity for margin expansion in the combination as well. Jonathan, do you want to add to that at all? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Next question? Yeah. What I can say is, is that - and if Adam, Edouard or Brian want to add anything after this, they can. What I've been impressed with is the pipeline, the growing pipeline and connectivity to the Data Lake, and the assessment of the Data Lake as a new way to consume data from us more efficiently. But also to reach some broader contracts, especially around the hedge fund community, where quantitative and qualitative decision making from vast quantities of data, you know, it's some of the bigger hedge funds that have those tools and have those capabilities. We're also seeing some mid-size vendors and some corporates [ph] who have been grappling with their own construct of a Data Lake, where they can leverage us as a technology platform to be able to, not just provide them our data, but to provide them connectivity for their own and even distribution for their own. So some very strong discussions that are starting to lead to revenue. There is paying customers for the Data Lake now, and that starts to grow. Edouard, do you want to add to that. How you're using it within automotive? And then maybe, Adam, you might want to do the same on AFS [ph]. Edouard? Thanks, Adam. Brian, do you want to add from energy, some of the initiatives you're using the Data Lake for and how it started to drive opportunity? Okay. Thank you. And just to remind everybody, when I think back to the IHS Markit merger, we said two things about building out the Data Lake over the coming years. One, that it would give us efficiencies in terms of managing our own content, which we see through margin expansion. But secondly, that would give us opportunities for distribution, combination of data with customers and third-parties and give us a real competitive edge in our ability to sell and distribute our content. The piece that I think is additive to all that, that we're starting to learn about is more that there are significant numbers of larger customers who want to be able to interrogate large data sets to identify decision-making signals and decision points. And that's been leading us to some of the bigger quantitative hedge funds, but it also exists within the corporate world for analytics and analysis. So I think we're well on our way to gaining the efficiencies and we're starting to see the revenue follow through as well. So a good story. Next question? Thanks, Edouard... Next question? Okay. That's a good – that's a good question and one that definitely encompasses our strategic vision. And for all my team, they are very focused on the impact of the changing marketplaces around us that are being driven by either technology or a quest for decarbonization, and therefore, participating in a change in net zero world as we look forward. So you have to take those and go, are we going to be able to participate and take revenue from that and adjust our business positively? Or are we going to find that we get dis-intermediated because some of the revenue streams will shrink? So our strategy is very, very clear. If you look in Transportation, you are seeing it right now in Maritime and Trade, and you see it in our strong automotive recovery. And that is, is that, when you look at those revenue streams and you dig into them, you start to see how they are shifting their customer base to new solutions, new platforms and new decision making tools. And within automotive, we are an independent supplier of information that helps people make decisions. And the world – the automotive world has got more complex. And it will continue to get more complex, as we look forward, given this drive towards net zero. So I feel like the information sets around automotive are very buoyant and participating and forecasting in good or bad markets is a good thing. The second thing I'd say is that Mastermind, when we've acquired Mastermind, I think it was around $80 million of revenue. It's now running towards $120 million this year. And that's getting driven because Edouard and his team have taken the Mastermind platform, married it with Polk data, married it with CARFAX data, took full views for the OEMs. And the OEMs for the first time are saying, Geez, why do I want to provide a incentive that blankets the US? Why don't I target market at right down to post codes, or even right down to individuals? And that's where the Mastermind platform, which we called an enterprise Mastermind, is adapting to this new digital world, and even a world where there is less dealerships in the car just lands in your driveway. So we want to participate in that, and the team is doing a great job shifting. There is some other ones in around automotive, but I'll shift for a second. Maritime, there, the shift is the new services. It's supply chain, it's decarbonization. It's – you've got all the Maritime fleet information. All of your suppliers that are trying to be ESG compliant need to know what's the carbon footprint of the delivery of my goods? And so we're now producing a full carbon fleet analysis for our customers, and that's a growth area. It's being driven from the Data Lake. It's new technology. It's just old products adapting to new worlds and making sure we're participating. If you go over to Energy, I think we covered that. Energy, we're going to have to make sure that we maintain the upstream you know, $250 million to $300 million of revenue. And the rest of the revenue, we're going to have to grow as the Energy markets transition. And we're very well positioned. We do consulting around all those services, that's helpful. We know where the assets are, so that's helpful for global warming. We know where the pipelines are, the distribution. We have a lot of data that plays into the new world. And we're transitioning and growing our solar, wind, hydrogen, battery storage businesses, and this is a growth market. So it's going to be a tough. For the Energy folks, this is going to be a year where it's tough because we gave discounts last year and they got to recover into next year. But I think that by the time they get to 2022, they might be the darlings again in the company, and you'll see somebody else on their back. And then Financial Services, I think we're in all the right growth markets. So there, I feel good about it. And I don't want to leave CMS out because, sometimes, we do, but RootMetrics, which is small, I know, but they are into 5G, and 5G is important. And if you go over to the CMS product design folks, their pipeline is all about digital transformation and focusing on the vast amounts of specs and standards that need to be added together to in-house documentation for engineers to make decisions. And we're playing that game with our digital platform, and we've got a great pipeline because we can save people money. So net-net, I think, for a great – great people, a great company. We're well-positioned to get our share. The question always is, is IHS Markit, now S&P Global, will they get their share of the growth in TAMs that are substantive? And my bet is, yes, of course, they will. They are filled with great people and great customers and therefore there's lots to do. Thank you. Next question? Well, what I can tell you is that the team - the team has found that they can profitably manage virtual conferences. So they've done that. We have three of those, TPM, World Petrochemical Conference and CERAWeek. And all of them had record audiences. So the - and the audiences can be record because everybody's online virtually. So instead of 4 or 5, 000 physical conference seats, you can have tens of thousands of virtual seats. People are willing to pay for top quality content and access to the right audience. And we had all the right audience. We had top government officials, new US Energy Minister, John Kerry, in his new climate envoy role. We had Bill Gates. We had heads of pharmaceutical companies. We had technology, big sessions on hydrogen. It really was impressive, and we'll see that growth come into our next quarter. And it was - all as I can say is the team was well-ahead of their plan and pressed all of us in all three events, and we'll give you those numbers next quarter. So, I think worst case scenario is we're always virtual and we're going to get better and better at it and grow from there. Best case scenario, which I think we're all hoping for, is we get to be back together in rooms and feel safe, and can network and build relationships like humans like to do. So, let's hope for the second. But if the first comes, it's not going to hurt our growth path. I think the teams have proven they can make money and grow. Next question? Edouard? Thanks, Edouard. Next question? Right. Well, so in financial markets, we can start there. And we have made acquisitions to support our private markets activities this year. We made an investment in one of the world class fund admins in - you know, that support the alternative space. We see substantive synergies and opportunities there to invest in our reporting services like iLEVEL and the integration of those products into the administration side. So, that's an investing side. IHS Markit, and now S&P Global, Adam's teams are investing with PIMCO, Man Group, McKinsey, Microsoft, and others around a product called HUB, which they will ultimately consolidate back into their Solutions businesses. That's all about new technology and efficiencies for asset managers. So, yes, continued investment. When you get over into the automotive world, I mentioned already the enterprise Mastermind, which is the broader OEM platform, that's been an investment through COVID. CMS has been investing in the digitization of their business. And - all of these lead me to the so the upper half of our growth range if executed well. You know, I was really pleased. I've never seen a 10% quarter probably since 2014 or somewhere before that. So to see a 10% quarter in FI [ph] if things coming back that – its your normal businesses performing, you know, at 5% to 6% growth range, but then your new investment areas, which are big into solutions are performing at – you know, above their ranges. And that sometimes is volume, but in this case, it's a lot of the new product development and the hard work the teams have been doing. I think in energy, it speaks for itself. It's renewables. Its – you know, we acquired the agriculture business, ag and decarbonisation, they all kind of go hand-in-hand, land use in this new world that we head into. And I think the teams are investing. They are adding people. They are investing in their businesses. And we only - we give 100 basis points margin, but there is more than enough opportunity through the revenue side and cost management for us to create investment dollars. And all the teams are doing that. I'll pause here and go to the next question."

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Lance. Q1 results included revenue of $1.12 billion, which represents organic growth of 3% and total revenue increase of 4%, with recurring growth of 4%. Net income of $149 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37. Our adjusted EBITDA of $467 million, an increase of 8%, with margins of 41.7%, this represents margin expansion of 180 basis points. And we also delivered adjusted EPS of $0.71, an increase of 8%. Regarding revenue, our Q1 organic growth of 3% included recurring organic growth of 4% and non-recurring organic decline of 7%. This decline in non-recurring was primarily driven by lower automotive OEM activities, lower energy consulting activities, and transactional content purchases for upstream and product design when compared to Q1 of last year. Moving on to segment performance. Our Financial Services segment drove organic growth of 10%, including 9% recurring in the quarter. Solutions, in particular had strong performance, delivering 15% organic growth, primarily from strength in equity capital markets, corporate actions, and reg and compliance offerings, and strength in our core portfolio monitoring management tools, while information and processing each had a 6% organic increase, driven by pricing and valuations and loan market activities, respectively. Our Transportation segment delivered organic growth of 4% in the quarter. This included growth of 8% recurring, as Q1 had strong growth within our CARFAX and automotiveMastermind businesses. Non-recurring revenue declined by 8%, primarily driven by continued lower activity in digital marketing and recall. Our Resources segment had 10% organic decline, which is comprised of a 9% recurring decline and 20% non-recurring decline. Q1 organic ACV decreased by $7 million in the quarter and our trailing 12 month organic ACV is down 11%, as we have largely cycled through our subscription renewals since the North American energy market was severely impacted at the end of Q1 last year. Our CMS segment had 1% organic decline, including 2% increased recurring and a decline of 25% non-recurring. Moving now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $467 million, up $35 million versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8% with a margin of 41.7%, up 180 basis points. Moving on to our segments. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $233 million, with a margin of 48.1%, up 100 basis points. Financial Services margin was driven by strong revenue growth, while supporting continued investment. Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, with a margin of 47.1%, up 740 basis points. We do expect margins to moderate to - in forward quarters, as we see more expense tied to revenue growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $74 million, with a margin of 36.6%, a decrease of 340 basis points, as a result of lower revenue. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $26 million, with a margin of 21.5%, down 250 basis points. This quarter decrease was primarily driven by mix shift, which we expect to improve during the year. Adjusted EPS was $0.71 per diluted share, an increase of 8%. Our GAAP tax rate was 17%, and our adjusted tax rate was 20%. Q1 free cash flow was $172 million. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our lowest free cash flow quarter. Turning to the balance sheet. Our Q1 ending [ph] debt balance was $5.1 billion, and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7 times on a bank covenant basis and 2.6 times net of cash. We closed the quarter with $172 million of cash, and our Q1 undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.022 billion. Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 401 million shares. As we mentioned in Q4, the merger agreement with S&P Global restricts our ability to purchase our shares. And therefore, our share repurchase program is currently suspended, other than for the repurchase of shares associated with tax withholding requirements for share based compensation. Moving to guidance. We had a great start to the year, and now expect to deliver results in the upper half of our 2021 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, which include the following, revenue of $4.535 billion to $4.635 billion, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%, adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion to $2.03 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points when adjusted for FX, an adjusted EPS of $3.11 to 3.16. Finally, we expect cash conversion in the mid 60s as we lap our 2020 one-time cash impacts. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance. Sure. This is, Jonathan. I'll jump and answer [ph] that question. We certainly are getting some benefit of FX at the top-line on revenue. That will impact some of the forward words we're saying about guidance being at the upper end of the range. However, lot of that is just core operational improvement that we're seeing from AFS [ph] that we continue to see from Transportation and also the - as the outlook for the rest of the year for both Resources and CMS. You should also note, Alex, because you know, we get a benefit from - at the top end from FX, it does impact our expenses. And so the – as the improvement you're seeing from EBITDA is really a reflection of both, of FX impacting both revenues and expenses. So the EBITDA and EPS flow through is I would call core operational improvement. Thank you. No, Lance. I think you covered it really, really well. I guess, the other thing I'll just add on top of the cost levers that you're always pulling, is, of course, we get the natural benefit of the scalability of our revenue as it comes through, which helps with that lift. But, Lance, as you said it well, I think, we see very clear path to 100 basis points at that suggested for this year."

And we're looking forward in October to having a physical event in India, and of course, next March. But, I think you've hit all the high points with energy transition, ESG, clean tech, carbon capture. All of these things that our customers are looking forward to, we're in a good position to help them. Yeah, hi. This is Brian. So yeah, the - so the consulting business is already - is bouncing back. When we look out forward, we're going to be having double-digit growth even in upstream on consulting, which is a good sign for us, because, usually, when consulting bounces back, then you have your subscriptions following. Sure, yes. So first of all, one - just to support what you said. So we do see a nice pipeline of, especially chemical companies and banking companies looking into the Data Lake for solutions they perhaps can't get in other places.  Like Edouard said, when we're looking at developing kind of clean energy, clean tech products, we can go into the lake and take information both from what we're doing, what other - what our customers are doing. So it's just a good place where we can shorten product development life cycles to build out things like emissions and things that our customers are interested in."

            "name": "Edouard Tavernier",
            "content": "Right. And hi, Jeff. Thanks for your question. And you are right, the story of the quarter is our recurring revenue growth. We're very happy with it. It's developing according to plan. And it shows the strength of the underlying business, and it should strengthen throughout the year. What's driving it? I think it's the - our core products, right? So if you look at the CARFAX offerings, if you look at the Mastermind offerings, or if you look at some of our core subscription products like supply chain and technology, all of these businesses are growing significantly and are showing good resilience in the first quarter. On the digital marketing side, so what we're seeing is advertising spending is coming back relative to where it was two or three quarters ago. But it has not yet resumed to pre-COVID levels. Why is that? A couple of reasons, but one of the big ones is low inventories. The supply chain is still catching up and trying to rebuild inventory levels in particular in the North American market. And when inventories are low, advertising spend tends to be lower. And we're still seeing this in the industry today, and we will see subdued inventory levels for the next couple of quarters at least. And that's why advertising spend and digital marketing spend is still not quite where we would like it to be. We are seeing strength in the business. We are - activities far higher than it was two quarters ago. So we expect digital marketing to be stronger as the year goes by. Yeah. Sure, Lance. And I'll address the broader point about kind of innovation, product innovation. I think that is the story, right, over the past 3 or 4 years. We measure internally - we use a metric recall with the vitality index, right? I don't think we publish it. But we measure the contribution of new products to our growth. And for division like Transportation, that contribution has increased year after year over the past 5 years. New products and high growth products are an increasing part of our kind of overall revenue growth.  To give you an example, right, in concrete terms. And if you look at our Maritime and Trade business, it's always owned a number of incredibly valuable kind of legacy data assets. But over the past 3 years, it has repositioned essentially a data business into a solutions business targeting risk management workflows, trade compliance workflows, commodities analytics workflows. And through this transformation has become essentially a high single digit growth business.  A lot of these innovations have been enabled by the Data Lake and which strongly reduces the product development life cycle. So it's certainly a good innovation story there. Adam, I don't know if you want to add something? Yes. Hi, George. This is Edouard. So the OEM customers last year had a slightly different cycle to the dealers in the sense that in Q2 they were operating sort of more normally. But if you will, the COVID crisis really hit them in Q3, and they are still recovering from this. So today they are doing much better. As you know, demand for vehicles is picking up significantly in the US and globally in 2021, as is production. The one caveat I would bring is that the supply chain is still adjusting to this post-COVID world. So the - some of those supply chain issues have been well-documented, in particular the semiconductor shortages. And they have led us to revise our 2021 forecast down by 0.5 million vehicles. So that is a temporary kind of shock, but it is a shock nonetheless. And it's slowing down the recovery of inventories in Western markets. There are some other challenges, right? So there was a bout of severe weather in the southern US a few weeks ago. That has actually created a shortfall of chemical feedstocks. That's also impacting the supply chain. There was a fire last week in Japan in a major semiconductor plant. So all of these are sort of impacting our customers. But in the end, it's delaying the recovery, but the recovery is coming back. We're in a good place in the sense that we are supporting OEMs and suppliers with some of these secular structural transformations in the industry, and those are multi-year transformations, and our data and our solutions are critical to helping them. So slower recovery, but recovering nonetheless and the outlook for the industry is positive. Hi, Andrew. Yeah. This is Edouard. Thanks for your question. So, yes, you're spot on, right? We have unique proprietary automotive content. That content is highly valuable to the investment community and the financial community as a whole. We made some significant progress since the IHS and Markit merger 4 years ago in monetizing these data assets. But we're still in the early stages of a fairly long growth runway. So, if you look at the Market Intelligence kind of customer base, there is very, very strong penetration in the investment community. That will be our number one target. But there are also pockets of other customers which are potentially highly valuable for the order business. So, that's the idea where we're working hard to refine these assumptions and some more of this later."

As we look at our financial highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics that we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for 2023 adjusted guidance. And non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from previously divested businesses in all periods. Adjusted revenue decreased 4% or 3% on a constant currency basis. As everyone on this call knows, we saw dramatic decreases in debt issuance, which drove the decline in our revenue and earnings. But what you would not be able to tell from the headline revenue growth rate is that our business has become far more diversified and resilient. While we saw a 26% decrease in our ratings revenue, the vast majority of that decrease was offset by a 6% growth in our other businesses. That growth came despite FX headwinds, and unstable macroeconomic environment and the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia. We also took decisive action to preserve margins in 2022. Despite significant inflation throughout the year, we were able to keep our adjusted expenses relatively flat year-over-year due to outperformance on our cost synergies and management actions around incentive compensation, discretionary spending and the timing and prioritization of strategic investments. Our teams have a lot to be proud of, and we've done a remarkable job setting the company up for a strong 2023. We introduced our initial guidance today, which includes 4% to 6% revenue growth and a 10% to 12% EPS growth. Importantly, we're not moving Engineering Solutions to discontinued operations, so both of these figures include the half year contribution we expect from Engineering Solutions in 2023, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions, we would have expected revenue growth to be approximately 6% to 8%. Amongst the impactful accomplishments in 2022, we completed our merger with IHS Markit and took important steps to optimize both our operations and portfolio of businesses. We optimized our capital structure as well, lowering our average cost of debt at fixed rates, protecting our earnings from further interest rate volatility. We introduced a bold strategic vision at our Investor Day, Powering Global Markets, and outlined our key growth priorities for the next few years. We're looking forward to updating our investors on our progress against those initiatives as we move forward. We also continue to shape the secular transition from active to passive asset management, and just last month celebrated the 30th anniversary of the first index-based ETF, which was based on our S&P 500 Index. As we look to the strategic initiatives we had at the beginning of 2022, it's clear that we continue to make great strides. We outperform our original 2022 cost synergy targets by more than 20%, generating $276 million in cost synergies fully realized in 2022 compared to original target of $210 million to $240 million. We successfully integrated our major infrastructure software systems, including what our ERP vendor told us was the fastest integration ever for a company of our size. We continued to drive commercial momentum, generating nearly 7,000 synergy cross-sell referrals post-merger. We also made great progress with our strategic investments and our transformational initiative to optimize our technology spend. Lastly, we continued our relentless focus on making sure S&P Global remains a destination of choice for our people and candidates. Our Internal People Survey indicated 90% or more of our employees endorse our culture and our efforts in diversity. We continued to invest for long term growth in 2022. We made several small acquisitions to bolster and round out our offerings in private market solutions, as well as sustainability and energy transition. We also had several important new product launches and upgrades that will drive customer value and financial performance in 2023 and beyond. We took steps to optimize the portfolio of businesses at S&P Global. We made several merger related divestitures that were required by regulators, but we also decided to divest the Engineering Solutions Division and announced an agreement to sell the business to KKR. These decisions help position S&P Global in growth markets where we can leverage our strengths across the entire business. As always, we will continue to be disciplined stewards of the business and periodically review the portfolio of assets to determine the optimal structure at any given time. Shifting to our financial performance, the largest macro contributor to our 2022 results has been the sharp decrease in global debt issuance, which continued to deteriorate as we move through 2022. For the full year, we saw 28% decrease in global rated issuance or a 31% decrease when including the impact of leveraged loans. This is particularly noticeable in high yield issuance, which decreased 77% from the extraordinarily high levels we saw in 2021. The issuance environment certainly impacted our financials in 2022, but we were pleased with the execution from the teams across the company despite those challenges. As I mentioned previously, our aggregate financial results provide clear evidence of our commitment to disciplined execution. Excluding the ratings business, revenue growth would have been 6% in 2022 and adjusted operating margin would have expanded by approximately 200 basis points. Ewout will discuss the fourth quarter financials in a moment. Each of our divisions performed admirably in 2022. We saw positive revenue growth in four of our six divisions and constant currency growth in five of our six divisions. We believe the strength and discipline shown in 2022 sets us up for a return to positive overall revenue growth and margin expansion in 2023. We continue to deliver impressive results in Sustainable1. In 2022, we grew ESG and climate revenue by 50% year-over-year to more than $200 million. As we outlined at Investor Day and as you'll see in the appendix, we've updated our methodology beginning in 2023 to include all of our sustainability and energy transition products and we'll be disclosing sustainability and energy transition revenues rather than just ESG revenue going forward. Under the new methodology, we generated $247 million in 2022 and we expect growth of more than 30% from that base in 2023. We ended 2022 with ESG ETF AUM reaching $40 billion. That growth is particularly impressive when you consider it is the net impact of an 18% increase in AUM from net flows and a 14% reduction in AUM from price depreciation resulting in 4% net growth year-over-year. We continued to launch new indices based on climate or sustainability factors in 2022, including the new S&P/BMV Green, Social & Sustainable Target Duration Bond Index. We also launched new products in market Intelligence, commodity insights and mobility. Within ratings, we completed 133 sustainable financing opinions, 33 green evaluations and 102nd party opinions. At the core of our sustainability efforts are the corporate sustainability assessments. This remains a key differentiator versus our competitors as they enable us to collect an enormous amount of data directly from corporations around the world. For the methodology that ends in March 2023. We have already increased CSA survey participation to more than 2,900 companies, representing a 30% growth year-over-year. We expect more than 3,000 companies to participate by the end of March. The company also continued to advance its own industry leading practices in sustainability. We issued our 11th annual Sustainability Impact Report and fourth annual TCFD Report. We launched $1.25 billion in sustainability-linked notes and adopted the sustainability-linked bond framework. We ensured the long-term funding for the S&P Global Foundation via a onetime grant of $200 million, and our efforts continue to receive recognition from several leading third parties. I'd now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2023. The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this month. The total amount of global debt maturing in this study is $11.1 trillion over the next five years. This is actually up 3% from the study a year ago and up 7% from last year's study when looking out over the full nine years. Importantly, this shows us how the maturities have evolved over the next few years. While 2023 expected maturities have unsurprisingly decreased over the course of 2022, if we look at maturities in the years 2025 to 2027, we see a 12% increase from last year's study. That increase jumps to 23% looking at maturities in 2027 to 2029. The bottom line is that there is a very healthy pipeline of debt maturities coming over the next several years. Now, looking at total rated debt outstanding, we continue to see a compound growth rate of 5% and a continued year-over-year increase in total debt outstanding on a constant currency basis. Historically, outstanding debt usually gets refinanced. And we don't see any reason why this decades long trend would change. After marked declines in issuance in 2022, our ratings research group anticipates that issuance will return to positive growth in 2023. The forecast calls for issuance gains of 8.5% for non-financials, 3% for financial services, 5% for US Public finance, and a decrease in structured finance of 7%. Please note that this is an issuance forecast, not a revenue forecast, and it does not include leveraged loans. Our financial results and guidance are more closely tied to build issuance, which can differ materially from market issuance as we have described in recent quarters. For 2023, we expect build Issuance to be up approximately 2% to 6% for the full year. Now let's move to the latest view from our economists. They're forecasting global GDP growth of 2.2% in 2023. While GDP growth is expected to be positive, we also expect it to be a story of two halves. Right now, we're assuming a mild recession in the first half followed by stabilization in the second half. Each year, we carefully assess the external factors facing the company. This slide depicts those that we think are most important going into 2023. There are a number of potential positive impacts this year and potential headwinds, many of which we've outlined on this slide. There are also a number of factors that could impact our business positively or negatively or different ways in different parts of the business. Volatility in the equities and commodities markets is a great example, as it can be a headwind to certain parts of our business while serving as a tailwind to global trading services and commodity insights and exchange traded derivatives in our indices business. While we certainly aren't immune to the macroeconomic environment, we're confident that investing for growth in these times of uncertainty and through the cycle is the right way to create long term shareholder value. While others may give in to the temptation to hunker down, we want to make sure that we're aggressively taking the steps to position S&P Global for years of profitable growth. That's why I'm so excited to finish my prepared remarks on this slide. We're optimizing our technology spend for growth, and we're leveraging the most powerful platforms available to make sure our product development teams can rapidly bring new features and products to market. We recently announced a long-term strategic partnership with Amazon AWS to further technology vision we laid out for you at Investor Day. This agreement allows us to consolidate contracts and drive long-term savings through a collaborative relationship with one of the world's most innovative technology companies. Kensho continues to be a key contributor to the culture of innovation within S&P Global. We have a bold vision for how to leverage the newest breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence and not only make those technical technologies available to our customers, but truly embed them throughout the organization to drive growth and efficiency. I visited Kensho's office this last fall and was impressed to see the work that Kensho's R&D team had been doing with respect to large language models and their transformative potential. Since then Kensho has made significant progress on models that leverage unique data across the enterprise, with the potential to power innovation using AI and machine learning to accelerate product and technology agendas across all of S& Global. This is very exciting. We'll also continue to make strategic organic investments in areas like private markets and sustainability and energy transition, and we'll selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions that enhance our growth and innovation. As we begin reporting our vitality revenue this year, we will continue our long practice of transparency and accountability. It is truly an exciting time to be at S&P Global. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. The adjusted financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for our 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from previously divested businesses in all periods. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Adjusted revenue decreased 6% to $2.9 billion, largely driven by a challenging issuance environment and macroeconomic conditions. Excluding ratings, fourth quarter revenue would have increased 4% year-over-year. Adjusted corporate and allocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive costs. Adjusted expenses were roughly flat for the full year, demonstrating strong expense discipline across the company. For the fourth quarter, expenses decreased to 4% compared to prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin contracted by 160 basis points to 41.2%, primarily driven by revenue declines in ratings. Excluding ratings, adjusted margins would have improved more than 280 basis points year-over-year. Our adjusted net interest expense increased 9%, driven by higher total debt levels, partially offset by lower average cost of debt. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but right around the midpoint of the guidance range we provided for the full year. We exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the fourth quarter were approximately $175 million in merger related expenses, the details of which can be found in the appendix. We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. In 2022, we completed our $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program with final share delivery executed earlier this week. Turning to expenses, as I noted, we managed to keep adjusted expenses roughly flat for 2022, despite a high inflationary environment. I'm pleased to report we acted decisively and delivered more than $400 million in expense reductions for the full year. Actions taken include pull forward and synergies, a reduction in incentive accruals, adjustments to the timing of certain investments, selective hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas. Looking more closely at the largest contributor to those expense savings, I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress specifically. In 2022, we have achieved $276 million in cumulative cost synergies, and our annualized run rate exiting the fourth quarter was $422 million representing 70% of target after only ten months. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies. With $19 million in cumulative synergies achieved and an annualized run rate of $34 million, the cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the fourth quarter is $807 million. For 2023, we expect to achieve cost synergies and revenue synergies of approximately $510 million and $60 million respectively. We originally targeted 80% of cost synergies in 2023, but with the outperformance in 2022, we are now targeting 85% of the $600 million target. We also originally expected 50% of our revenue synergies in 2024, but with the divestiture of engineering solutions, we now expect approximately 45%, though the full target of $350 million is unchanged. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 3%, with strong growth in data and advisory solutions, offset by slower growth in desktop and declines in enterprise solutions. Adjusted expenses decreased 2% this quarter, driven by continued realization of cost synergies, lower incentive compensation and real estate spend. Segment operating profit increased 16% and the segment operating profit margin increased 360 basis points to 31.4%, on a trading 12-month basis adjusted segment operating profit margin was 31.8%. Looking across market intelligence, there was growth in most categories and on a pro forma basis, desktop revenue grew 3%, data and advisory solutions revenue grew 7%, enterprise solutions revenue was down 4% and credit and risk solutions revenue grew 4%. For desktop, we continue to see strong demand for our subscription offerings like Capital IQ. Overall, desktop growth was below our expectations though, due primarily to the impact of some onetime sales from products reported in our desktop line. For enterprise solutions, softness in our capital markets volume-based products continued to weigh in on the business line's performance as revenue decreased 4%. This was partially offset by strength in private markets software solutions. Now turning to ratings. Ratings continued to face difficult market conditions this quarter as issuance volumes remained muted with revenue decreasing 29% year-over-year. Transaction revenue saw slight improvement sequentially, but decreased 51% compared to the prior year on continued softness in Issuance. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower initial issuer credit ratings and rating evaluation services, partially offset by increases in CRISIL. As a reminder, ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the Issuance environment and M&A activity, respectively, and the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions. In the fourth quarter, surveillance and frequent issuer fees increased year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted expenses decreased 13%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management and lower incentive expenses partially offset by increased salary expense. This resulted in a 40% decrease in segment operating profit and a 910-basis point decrease in segment operating profit margin to 48%. On a trading 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 55.9%. Now, looking at ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor was the well documented decline in Issuance, partially offset by 6% growth in CRISIL and other revenue. And now turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 4% driven by solid performance across all business lines. However, debt growth was impacted by a $13 million headwind due to the Russia- Ukraine conflict and a $4 million commercial settlement in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of Russia-Ukraine in this commercial settlement, Commodity Insights would have grown approximately 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. It's important to note we suspended commercial operations in Russia in March of 2022. Therefore, the first quarter of 2023 is the loss remaining period that we will see a material impact in the year-over-year growth rates. Adjusted expenses were roughly flat for the quarter, primarily due to higher compensation, an increase in T&E expense and bad debt provision, partially offset by merger related synergies, lower consulting spends and advertising and promotion costs. Segment operating profit increased 10% and the segment operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 44.6%. The trading 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 44.3%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 5% compared to prior year, driven by continued commercial momentum and strong subscription growth for market data offerings, particularly in gas and power and liquefied natural gas. Energy and resources data and insights grew 4% in the quarter, driven by continued strength in gas, power and renewables. Advisory and transactional services increased 3% in the quarter as we saw higher demand from energy transition advisory solutions, partially offset by revenues generated from a 2021 event that wasn't repeated in the fourth quarter of 2022. Moving to Upstream, I'm pleased to report the business line grew 4% in the fourth quarter, while upstream ACV has had good momentum ex-Russia, the revenue growth this quarter was primarily driven by upfront revenue recognition of certain software products that are not recurring. We expect upstream growth in the low single digit range for 2023. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 9% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong and broad-based performance across dealer, manufacturer and financials. Adjusted expenses increased 15% in the fourth quarter, driven by increases in headcount versus a year ago period. Timing of advertising spend and cloud expenses. We expect expense growth to moderate in 2023. This resulted in a 2% decrease in adjusted operating profit and 380 basis points margin compression year-over-year. On a trading 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 39%. Dealer revenue increased 9% year-over-year driven by strong demand for CARFAX subscription products. Manufacturing grew 8% year-over-year driven by strength in Polk Automotive Solutions and the conclusion of several major recall deals. Financials and other increased 10%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting volumes and new business. Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, revenue increased 4% year-over-year as growth in exchange rated derivatives offset declines in asset-linked fees revenue. During the quarter, adjusted expenses increased 8% as there was an uptick in one time outside services spend and continued strategic investments partially offset by decreases in compensation and other discretionary areas. Segment operating profit increased 2% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 140 basis points to 62.2%. On the trading 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.4%. Asset-linked fees were down 2%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange rated derivatives revenue increased 34% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 70% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6%, driven by new business activities and price realization. Over the past year, market depreciation totaled $506 billion, ETF AUM net inflows were $157 billion, and this resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.6 trillion, which is a 12% decrease compared to one year ago. Our average ETF AUM decreased 8% year-over-year. Engineering Solutions revenue declined 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Coat, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. Adjusted expenses increased 5% due to planned investment spend, offset by favorable FX. Before moving to guidance, I wanted to highlight some of the key drivers of our expected 2023 results and how these tie-ins with the core messages we delivered at our Investor Day. S&P Global is all about growth. 2023 will be a year of growth across the company, driven by customer growth, product enhancements, revenue synergies and strategic initiatives. We'll continue to invest in our people and you will see the annual reset of our incentive compensation targets. We'll also continue to invest in technology as we drive innovation and position the company for accelerating growth in order to help investors see and assess the positive impact of these investments, we'll begin disclosing a few new metrics with our first quarter 2023 results, including our vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation, either new or enhanced products from across the organization. We'll also disclose the revenue generated from products in our two key strategic investment areas private markets, as well as sustainability and energy transition. In addition to these new disclosures, we'll begin a regular cadence of inter quarter disclosures to help investors measure performance of market observable products. We'll begin disclosing ETD volumes and the year-over-year growth rate of build issuance on a monthly basis in area starting later this month when we will disclose the January 12, 2023 data. In addition to the monthly disclosures I just outlined we will also disclose build issuance volumes on a quarterly basis broken out between investment grade and high yield. We know that in a volatile and potentially uncertain market, transparency and accountability are more important than ever. And S&P Global maintains its commitment to best-in-class disclosure and reporting for our shareholders. Now moving to guidance, as noted in our press release, due to the pending divestiture of Engineering Solutions we will not be providing GAAP guidance at this time, and this slide depicts our initial 2023 adjusted guidance. For revenue, we expect 4% to 6% growth, reflecting our continued belief of a mild recession in the first half of 2023 and then some economic strengthening in the back half of the year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of Engineering Solutions, we expect revenue growth to be between 6% to 8%. We expect corporate and allocated expense of $140 million to $150 million. The year-over-year growth is driven in part by a reset of incentive compensation and the expectation of approximately $10 million to $20 million in stranded costs from Engineering Solutions post divestiture. We expect to expand operating margin to the range of 45.5% to 46.5%. Diluted EPS, which excludes deal related amortization of $12.35 to $12.55 which is an 11% year-over-year increase from the midpoint. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items is expected to be approximately $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion. We continue to target a return of at least 85% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We also to plan to utilize the net after tax proceeds from the Engineering Solutions divestiture for share repurchases. As such, our board has authorized a $3.3 billion share buyback for 2023, which we plan to begin with a $500 million ASR, which we expect to launch in the coming weeks. Lastly, we expect a quarterly dividend of $0.90 share. The following slide illustrates our guidance by division beginning with Market Intelligence, we expect growth in the 6.5% to 8.5% range and margins between 34% and 35%. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, this is skilled business that's well positioned in growing markets such as private markets and supply chain, and we're confident in our ability to accelerate growth as we lap the 2022 headwinds from volume driven businesses and FX. In Ratings, we expect revenue to grow between 4% and 6%, with growth to be driven by volume and price and continued growth in non-transaction revenue. Our assumption is for build issuance to be up between 2% and 6% in 2023. Margins for Ratings are expected to be between 56% and 57%. In Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the 6.5% to 8.5% range and margin between 46% and 47%. We expect continued strength in commodity markets generally and look forward to lapping the Russia impact after the first quarter. Similar to our Market Intelligence division, we expect Commodity Insights to see expense benefit from further realization of synergies in 2023. In Mobility, we expect revenue to grow between 6.5% and 8.5% and margins between 39% and 40%, driven by some normalization of auto supply chain, price realization, new business and new products adoption. Importantly, we expect expense growth to moderate quickly and substantially from the outsized increase in the fourth quarter, we expect expense growth to be below revenue growth in 2023. In indices, we expect revenue to be flat to up 2%, with margins of 66% to 67%. As we indicated at our Investor Day, revenue from asset-linked fees lags movements in underlying asset prices. So the 2022 decline in the S&P 500 will negatively impact this year's revenue, we will also lap the very strong comps in exchange traded derivatives. Before we turn it over for Q&A, I would like to take a moment to thank our people at S&P Global. The highlight of 2022 was the closing of our merger with IHS Markit. But what made it a highlight was the incredible dedication and execution demonstrated by our people. We saw strong, decisive action in the speed of execution of our cost synergy plan. We delivered critical system integration along a very fast timeline, rationalized our real estate footprint, and at the same time continued our strategic investments. 2022 truly was a year of transformation. But it was also a year of foundation. We intend to build on that foundation and drive strong growth in 2023 and for the years to come. And with that, we'll have Adam and Martina join us and turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs/\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You expect 2% to 6% growth in build issuance in 2023. Can you bridge your expectations for build issuance with guidance for ratings revenue growth of 4% to 6%, including how you expect pricing and issuance mix to impact revenue?\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, George. This is Ewout. Let me give you a couple of those components. As you know, we are always breaking out ratings revenue in two categories transactional and non-transactional. What you see in the transactional category is a combination of price and volume. And on the volume side, we have stated that 2% to 6% growth for build issuance. And then if you think about non-transaction, we continue to see, expected to see growth in the annual fees. Also, continued positive growth in Ratings is to be expected. And then ICR and RES, that's a bit uncertain because that depends very much on the overall economic environment. So those are some of the components that will add up to that range of 4% to 6% revenue expectation for Ratings in 2023. So I would say overall quite constructive after 2022. Got it.\nGeorge Tong: Market intelligence revenue growth decelerated in the quarter due to slower growth in desktop and declines in enterprise solutions. Can you elaborate on trends you're seeing in desktop and enterprise and why you believe performance may improve in 2023?\nDoug Peterson: George, this is Doug. Before I hand it over to Adam, I want to welcome Adam and Martina to the call today. As you met our presidents at the Investor Day on December 1, we're pleased to ask a couple of them to join us on each of the earnings call. And today it's going to be Adam and Martina. But Adam, over to you.\nAdam Kansler: Thanks, George. We're very confident in our desktop business, but our desktop revenue in this quarter didn't perform how we expected. Let me give you a little bit of color on that. Financial services industry obviously under pressure. You see that belt tightening, now some of the largest sell side banks, and they're taking a cautious approach right now, and we're not immune to that. That said, our core desktop offering continued to grow extremely well. Within that desktop revenue line, you have certain products that are non-recurring in nature. Consulting and advisory engagements tied to our desktop offering. These are the products that saw that impact in Q4. As we look out to 2023, we remain confident in our desktop growth, and we're excited about our forward competitive position. We saw active user growth up 9% this year. This is great growth in a challenging year. An important driver for us as we renew and expand our relationships with our customers in 2023. We're delivering significant upgrades in the offering. Speeds increased dramatically. New features being released. You saw we announced our ECR data live on our desktop in 2023. Fixed income and loan capabilities coming. So while Q4 not quite the quarter we expected, we're very confident and excited about that growth forward. I'll just spend two seconds on enterprise solutions. I know you asked about that as well. Understand that revenue line as really two separate components. Software solutions our customers use for workflow compliance and portfolio monitoring. And a section for industry platforms that are really directly impacted by capital markets activity and volumes. That first group performed really well this year, and we expect that to continue to perform really well into 2023. A lot of those are double digit growth businesses. The second bucket, the industry platform, is really impacted by significant drops in capital markets activity that saw a negative double-digit impact in the current year. When we look forward into 2023, we expect that negative impact to moderate as we lap those comparables and as markets stabilize. So we do have a very positive outlook for enterprise solutions as we go forward into ‘23.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.\nAlex Hess: Yes, hi. This is Alex Hess for Andrew Steinerman. Maybe just start with the 2024 revenue synergy target that was lowered modestly. And I believe it was mentioned that principally reflects engineering solutions. But with the focus of Investor Day having been on innovation, can you maybe update us on where 2022's vitality index came in, how promoter score is tracking, and sort of what gives you confidence that maybe that target remains pretty achievable.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Alex. Thanks for being on the call. You ask a couple of questions, so let me walk through each of those. 2024 revenue synergies are slightly tuned down due to the divestiture of Engineering Solutions. We had assumed a number of revenue synergies, both in Engineering Solutions as well as in some of our other segments in the collaboration with Engineering Solutions, for example, Commodity Insights shares a number of customers together with Engineering Solutions. But we are not concerned about that at all because we are finding so many new revenue synergies across the company that we are still firmly committed to the $350 million in total over the five-year period. You're also asking about, in general, the commercial momentum within the company. We're actually really happy what we are seeing. There is a lot of innovation, a lot of new product development, lot of really very strong customer interactions around all of that. You're seeing that we hit our revenue target for ESG sustainability for 2022. And with respect to vitality, what we told you was that we have a target to get vitality over 10% over the next few years. I'm actually very happy to report that we already got there in 2022. So our vitality was just over 10% last year as another indication of the level speed of innovation that we're increasing within the company.\nAlex Hess: Great. Thank you so much. And then maybe to turn to your build issuance assumptions, can you maybe walk us through the degree to which that is weighted to the back half of 2023 versus maybe facing some steeper comparisons in January and the front half of this year?\nMartina Cheung: Thanks for the question, Alex. This is Martina. We consistent with our overall view for 2023, both for macroeconomic as well as market Issuance not feeding into our build Issuance. We would see the chances for a mild recession in the first half with some recovery in the second half. And so you could expect to see a little bit more softness in Issuance in the first half followed by some recovery in the second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about multi asset class indices. I know it's a really meaningful opportunity and you're investing a lot there. And it seems like the market opportunity is really massive. You have leading brands within index products. And so my question is right now, do clients think that there's a need for multi asset class indices or will it be a matter of convincing them that it's better than having a combination of separate equity and fixed income indices? Like a hybrid, like, is being used now. Just what makes multi asset class indices better than just weighting equity and fixed income indices? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thanks, Toni. As you know, the basis of the index business that we have is about transparency. It's independence. It's the ability for a client to understand exactly what's in the portfolio at any point in time. Where we're especially seeing multi asset class demand is in the insurance industry. The insurance industry, which has many types of products, is looking to multi asset class. They use it for annuities, they use it for wrappers. And we're also seeing that bank structured product desks are also looking at multi asset classes. So we're seeing a lot of growth in this. You asked the question about what is the difference? The difference is that you can put together a single product which meets the needs of a client. And we're seeing that this is right now very high demand coming from those two industries. As ETFs are built from the multi asset classes, then you start getting trading around them. So we see the entire ecosystem starting to grow. And it's also part of the trend when we see active to passive anyway. So I think it's very important you ask the question. It's one of our growth areas and across all of the index business. This is one of that we're most excited about, finally, because we have within S&P Global now one of the leading franchises of Fixed Income with IBOX, CDX and iTraxx, we can actually produce these products on our own all-in house.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Then as a follow up, I wanted to ask about Commodity Insights growth. I know long term sort of thinking about 8% at the midpoint. And when I look back at sort of legacy platin and resource within IHS, I guess plat wasn't really there, resources on its own wasn't there in sort of a normal market. Is it the sustainability part that's really going to drive you to that higher level of growth or I guess what's the bridge to get from sort of like normal mid-single digit level up to the eight? Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Toni, if you think about the overall market dynamics in the commodity markets, we think that currently those markets are very constructive for our customers and that is going to be helpful also for the growth of the business over the next few years. Well, first, one point to highlight is that in 2022 we saw some headwinds from Russia, from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the fact that we stopped our commercial relationship with Russian customers. So obviously that headwind is going away going forward. Secondly, what we are seeing is that our customers are both focused on traditional energy resources and new energy resources. So we're benefiting from both trends at the same time where there is of course a lot of activity going on with respect to the current market prices in terms of exploration and additional capital expenditures that we're seeing. But our customers at the same time are also focused on energy transition and needs help from us. So we are providing data, insight, research, advisory, all of that around energy transition at the same time. So we believe this business has a lot of secular tailwinds over the next few years. What we told you is that at Investor Day that we expect this business to grow into 7% to 9% range in 2025 and 2026. And we think absolutely that is possible. We are very committed to hitting that number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlex Kramm : Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe you can touch on the margin outlook a little bit, but particularly interested in the quarterly seasonality or cadence. I know in the past there's been some surprises here and there in some of the segments. So maybe Ewout you can help us between synergies coming in and maybe typical seasonality, what would you call out in particular as it relates to maybe the seasonality, we saw in 2022? I understand ratings is probably going to be driven a lot by Issuance, but maybe in the other segments. Anything to call out?\nEwout Steenbergen: Alex, a couple of items to think about, first in terms of seasonality, realize that we are facing still high comps for the first quarter because the economy started to go more south from March of last year, as well as the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict also started about in March. So first quarter comps are still a bit high. The second item to think about here is that we are now expecting, as we also said during the Investor Day, a mild recession in the first half of the year and then some economic strengthening in the back half of the year. And the third element that I can say is you know that we are running a very tight ship with respect to expenses. So we are definitely starting this year, given the economic uncertainty in a very careful way. And then we need to time this right because the most important thing is that we're going to benefit once the markets start to turn when the GDP is going up, that we're starting to benefit from a growth perspective. We have a lot of growth investments in our plan for this year, as you know. So we have to time it right that we're going to make those investments at the right moment so that we're going to be a large beneficiary once the markets start to swing up again. So those are a couple of the elements you should think about in terms of timing for this year.\nAlex Kramm : Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just a follow up to the market intelligence question to Adam earlier. Maybe you can be a little bit more specific what you expect in the more capital market sensitive areas. I know there were some clearly some headwinds that you discussed earlier. Do you expect those businesses to be kind of like flattish or do you expect capital markets activity to actually recover decently? So maybe you can just talk about that and if you can tie that in with maybe the selling environment a little bit more of what you're seeing right now, that would be helpful as well.\nEwout Steenbergen: Okay. Thanks, Alex. In the very first part of the year, you still have pretty significant year-on-year comparables because markets were still strong in the very early parts of 2022. As we come through 2023, we do see some resilience in the early part of this year, but we do see a lot of cautiousness still in markets, and you see aggregate activity levels as well as we do. As we get towards the latter part of the year, your year-on-year comparison starts to flatten out quite significantly. And for us internally, thinking about out what we expect in the year, we budgeted modest increase in total activity across capital markets platforms. We'll obviously see how the year develops, but we think that's the right call as we sit here today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Silber from BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber: Thanks so much. I wanted to dig a little bit further into your outlook for this year. You've talked about expecting a mild recession in the first half and recovery in the second half. I know it's early, but we're about six weeks into the new year, and if anything, economic growth seems to be better than expected. If that's the case, then we either avoid a recession or push it off a little bit. Where could we see the upside in your forecast?\nEwout Steenbergen: Jeff, the forecast, the guidance we're giving is middle of the road. It's management's best estimates. This is our best expectation for the markets and for the full year at this point in time. I can give you a couple of underlying elements in terms of assumptions that have gone into our plan. So, for example, with our market sensitive businesses, think about the index business. The assumption is flat equity markets this year for the full year. You could say January looks a bit better, and February so far as well. But we're not changing our plan on a month-to-month basis. So on average we're expecting markets to be flat. That is the assumption that have gone into the index outlook, as well as 20% declines in ETD volumes coming from elevated levels last year, as well as flows to be more or less in line with what we have seen in previous years. And then with respect to the other market sensitive businesses, we already gave you some of the assumptions for ratings, so that is has gone into the plan. We think this is our best estimate at this point in time, given everything we know about the company and the markets.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay, I appreciate the color. Let me switch gears and focus on AI. Doug, I appreciate you addressing this issue. Obviously, it's a hot issue in the markets today. You guys seem to be ahead of the game with your purchase of Kensho a number of years ago. Where have you gotten the most traction there, and what should we look for going forward?\nDoug Peterson: Well, thank you, Jeff. We're very pleased by the investment we made in Kensho, in addition to investments we've made across the entire organization in decision sciences and AI and machine learning. I recently spent some time with Kensho in Cambridge, and they were able to show me some of the R&D they're doing on large language models, which is something that's in the press every day right now. We're seeing that for the financial markets, we've been able to harness the data and the language that we already have inside of the company to develop some very interesting products. But since Ewout oversees Kensho, I think I should hand it over to him to finish the answer.\nEwout Steenbergen: Jeff, let me first give you a number of data points in terms of what Kensho is exactly doing today for the organization. And it's actually really mind blowing if you hear these numbers. So a product called Kensho link has saved over 2-million-hour ingesting data sets, strategic data sets, expanding data sets for our customers. Also, link has at this moment achieved 1 million unstructured private market, private entity data into our database, into our platforms, and connected to the market intelligence ID numbers of those entities. There are two other products called EXTRACT and NERD that have enriched 73 million documents on the Cap IQ Pro platform. It has ingested $10.5 million investment research reports on the Cap IQ Pro platform. And Scribe, which is our language speech to text model, is saving 250,000 hours of men work per year for transcripts. Annual savings of that are approximately $9 million. And the list can go on. But those are some data points. Sometimes it's not really understood what Kensho is exactly doing, but it's really impressive. And I hope you agree with me when you hear those numbers. But now shifting to the future of Kensho, because you are right. Kensho's really sweet spot is natural language processing. And everything that we're reading today about large language models is exactly in that sweet spot. So Kensho is today already developing a financial language model called FinLM, which is trained on the S&P Global data assets. It's very expensive to develop large language models. The cost of the compute is very high. But if you have stronger data sets, higher quality data sets, actually that's a differentiating factor. So we're avoiding very significant compute time and costs, so to say. Also, Kensho is developing something new. That's the Kensho Solver which is the AI solution to answer the most complex financial number questions. You also can read about large language models actually not being so strong in math. And we are working on a solution in this area as well. So if you just add it all up, I think what Kensho can be doing for the company and where it's working on, it's very impressive. And we're very pleased that we are so far ahead in acquiring this company already five years ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber: Great. Good morning. My first question let's focus a little bit, if we could, on the ratings outlook you have for build issuance this year. Curious if you could give us a little further thought on your outlook for this year for high yield and for bank loans. Maybe throw in CLOs if you would as well.\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Craig. Yes, it's Martina here. Thanks for the question. So our outlook for this year is overall up 2.5%. The underlying factors, everything Doug had highlighted in his presentation, but 8.5% on corporates, 3% on FS US Public finance around 5%. And we're projecting a decline in structured finance of about 7%. We don't break out high yield and bank loans specifically, Craig. But what I can say is as you all know, high yield in 2022 was a really low year. And so we see growth in the high yield market this year. I think on the bank loans and CLOs, maybe what I can just touch on is the expectation for the research team underpinning that 7% decline in structured finance does reflect some concern around the pipeline for CLOs which we characterize or capture in the Structured Finance Act.\nCraig Huber: Okay, thank you. And my follow up. When you think about pricing throughout the portfolio, where should we expect pricing that might be higher this year than normal, maybe more normalized 3% to 4% price. What areas would you highlight the price might be coming ahead of that. Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Craig, in general terms, we always start to think first about what we do for the customer, the value we generate. The good news is that most of our products are must have products with a very high contribution to our customers. And obviously, that is the first element we take into consideration when we start to think about pricing. Pricing obviously needs to reflect also our cost price. Cost price is going up given the higher inflationary environment. So we believe we have across the board, depending on facts and circumstances, customer relationships, depending on certain products in one area or another area. But in general, we have an opportunity to pass on higher price increases given the higher inflationary environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, good morning. So my first question is I want to take advantage of Martina being on the call. Martina, it seems like the high yield market has really outperformed expectations so far this year. It's only been a few weeks, but I think just today we have a new deal announced for [inaudible], which is high yield and I think has been surprising. So give us your view on has this been surprising for you and how do you expect sort of the high yield market to evolve through the course of this year?\nMartina Cheung: Yes, thanks so much for the question. Look, I mean, as I mentioned at the last point, ‘22 was just a really low base from which to compare so we absolutely do expect to see growth and high yield as it relates to January and this week, it's really too early to call. We still have quite a few puts and takes on this in terms of the macro variables. But overall, I would guide to what we've been saying around our expectations first half, second half, how the macro factors play into our overall issuance expectation and how that plays into our build issuance trends.\nFaiza Alwy: Got it. Thank you. And then secondly, a bigger picture question around the revenue synergies. Question around revenue synergies. You've talked about an $85 million run rate for 2023. Give us some additional color on again, sort of where you've seen these revenue synergies take place, where you have the best result, and then how do we bridge sort of what's the next step to get to that at $350 million loan term.\nEwout Steenbergen: Faiza, let me start with a general answer, and then I hand it over to Adam for some additional color in market intelligence. So in general, what we are seeing is very good activity from a cross-sell perspective. We're speaking about 6,700 referrals or leads that have already been generated, both intra deficient and inter-deficient, with very positive conversion levels across the company. So what we're seeing in general is that customers are really happy to talk to us about what more we can bring to them, how we can add more value. The next phase is, of course, to start to focus on new product development. So that will be the next wave of revenue synergies. But we feel we're definitely well on track ahead of the timing and the planning that we had originally. And I handed over to Adam for some additional color.\nAdam Kansler: Thanks. It's a great question because this is probably the most exciting part of what happens in a merger and bringing together the set of capabilities that we now have. In 2022, this was mostly about cross-sell, selling our products to expanded customer bases that gave us a good early start. And in this first year, we were able to perform on that type of synergy realization. As we move into 2023, as Ewout described, it really becomes about building new products that we're able to now deliver because of a combined set of capabilities. Already in 2023, I think five of our combined product capabilities are already generating revenue. We have over 20 in the pipeline, and this is just in market intelligence alone. These are things like building our sustainability data and capabilities into our workflow solutions, expanding the capacity and capabilities of our desktop with fixed income and loans information, bringing together workflow solutions, and incorporating much larger data sets for customers to think about private markets customer who also wants to look at public company comparables for basic financial analysis. Those types of combined product offerings are what give us a lot of confidence in our total revenue synergy targets over $300 million as we get out into later years. And as I mentioned, the most exciting part of what we're doing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer.\nOwen Lau: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Could you please add more color on your partnership with AWS, you announced yesterday? And I think it's also somehow related to how you will deploy Kensho in this partnership. But how should we think about the incremental revenue and expense control opportunity here would be great. Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Owen, this is a relationship that we've had for many years. And when we put together the two companies and had our merger, we realized that both of us had already very strong relationships with AWS. We had been on a cloud switch for many years. A few years ago, before the pandemic, I was visiting an acre of a data site where we had hundreds and hundreds of servers. And I said, why do we have all these servers? Should we be in the business of having server farms? And we started a transition in moving to AWS. So over the years, we've developed an incredible partnership with them. And you saw yesterday the culmination of the merger where we've come together to combine contracts to come up with a new approach to how we're going to run our day-to-day operations. But most exciting is the opportunities as this brings for strategic cooperation, for developing new products, for being able to serve customers with completely new opportunities. When we look at our data sets that we have, some of the data that AWS has, how we can bring those together to do completely new innovation. We talked earlier about large language models, the other types of artificial intelligence and machine learning that are shaping markets of the future. We think that the two companies together can accelerate what we're already doing. We see that AWS has, for us been an incredible partner. We're pleased with this approach to a contract. We just signed the contract yesterday. In addition, that we will follow up with some strategic aspects later on and follow up. But you asked some questions about the financial aspects, and I'll ask Ewout to answer that part.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Owen. If you're think about the contractual agreement we're having with AWS, this is about a $1 billion spent in total over the next five years. And to put that in perspective, we will continue with a multi cloud philosophy and in total according to our forecast, we would actually be spending more than a $1 billion on cloud computes over the next couple of years. So this is not an increase in spend in total. This is exactly in line, or actually is our total cloud forecast is actually higher than this particular number. But what this brings to us is two very significant benefits. The first is of course that by combining the S&P Global and IHS Markit contracts at this moment in this new partnership with AWS, we will be able to generate very significant cost synergies as part of the new contract. And secondly, as Doug already said, and this is actually more important from my perspective is the strategic partnership because this will help to advance our technology innovation. We will be able to combine leading technologies and platforms and data sets of both companies. We'll be able to add specific capabilities that we are having on both sides, including the Kensho AI capabilities of course. And the most important that will end up with a really very incredible customer experience that we expect to enhance over the next few years.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That's very helpful. And then the other one is on your investment in private market. So what kind of angle or what kind of new solutions you will be launching this year? And I know you're going to provide more disclosures on revenue this year, but do you have any target this year? Thank you.\nAdam Kansler: Hi, Owen. It’s Adam. Happy to take that. So private markets continue to expand. You're seeing continued issuance of private debt, increasing regulatory pressures for disclosure, needs to monitor, report, test and report against sustainability metrics. Manage large private equity and private credit portfolios that requires things like valuations, reporting tools, portfolio monitoring tools. These are all areas where we already have a significant footprint, and we're well positioned to deliver additional solutions to the market. While you see in this year some tempering and fundraising, I think everyone agrees this is an asset class that will continue to grow. And the types of solutions that I described, workflow solutions, regulatory reporting, valuations, portfolio monitoring, all have significant room for continued growth.\nMartina Cheung: And Owen, this is Martina. I'll just add in a little bit here from a rating standpoint. So private markets, it does contribute quite a bit to our overall business, whether it's in syndicated loans through M&A, LBO activity, et cetera. And we also obviously rate the asset managers, the portfolio companies sponsor, BDCs, and we do quite a bit of credit analysis work to support multiple users in that sector. We have good relationships with key players, and we've been ramping up engagement over the last couple of years. A lot of good dialogue, a lot of interest in new opportunities. What we saw in private debt specifically in 2022, was a growth that was fueled somewhat by the closure of the public markets. And we have heard a lot of interest from customers with pent-up demand looking to come back to the public markets. But overall, we see there's a lot of opportunity here, not just in business and activity coming back to the public markets, but also in working very closely with our private market clients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. I wanted to touch on the mobility business. I think there's a lot of dynamics that are happening in 2023, whether it's a decline in used car prices, increased production in new, how do you view the business is going to kind of stack up this year just given all these dynamics, I think in the CARFAX has proven to be pretty resilient, but at the same time, I think could benefit in this environment. But would love to get your thoughts that maybe that's not the right way to think about it or if there's other drivers that we should be aware of. Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Yes, Stephanie, this is Doug. When you look at the mobility business, you have to think about all of the different capabilities that we have across the business. And this starts with CARFAX, which you mentioned. There's a set of products, automotive mastermind, Polk Analytics. What you think about is it all the way from the OEMs to the suppliers, to the dealers, to the insurance companies, to the financial institutions that are financing the automotive sector. All of them are looking for data and analytics. And we've seen an incredible digital transformation that has taken place over the last three years with a lot of volatility in the automotive markets. And all of this has driven all of these different types of players to the mobility business for data, for analytics, for research, for forecasting. In addition to that, we see an incredible transformation taking place in the industry with electric vehicles. And so electric vehicles are also introducing a new element which is also bringing all of these types of people back to the markets for more data and analytics. We've seen that we can benefit in different of types of markets depending on whether it's used cars, it's new cars, whether it's, how a dealer is going to be working with incentives. And so we believe that the market is’ that the business is very resilient depending on whatever the factors are. We're watching very carefully and we actually use our own data to forecast our own business.\nEwout Steenbergen: And, Stephanie, let me give you in terms of some of the revenue drivers a little bit, in addition to what Doug said. So with the market normalization, the higher inventory levels, the prices for new and used cars that are coming down, we see the following dynamics for our revenue drivers. On the one hand, that will mean that margins for OEMs and dealers most likely will come down a bit, having an impact on some of the retention levels. But on the other hand, we have the marketing and sales products that are being used and there will be a higher demand going forward for those products. So you could say there is a kind of an offset in terms of the new dynamics in the different revenue streams that we're having. Therefore, we are quite confident that we're able to hit that 6.5% to 8.5% growth level in the current automotive market and the new dynamics that we're are seeing.\nStephanie Moore: Thank you. And then, just given the current market dynamics, do you think that we could expect to see maybe more and potential M&A activity as well as, are there other opportunities as you kind of evaluate your current portfolio for maybe divestitures or sales that might make sense kind of going forward. How would you kind of characterize those opportunities? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: As you know, we look at the key secular trends and drivers of value across all of the markets. And you heard us talk about those on Investor Day. They relate to things like the changes that are taking place in capital markets, internationalization of financial markets, private markets. We've talked about sustainability, the shift from active to passive, supply chain analytics, the approach to all companies looking at becoming digitized, and how data and analytics play. And so we look across our portfolio, we look at what are those growth drivers for each of our businesses? And as you know, we could be opportunistic if we looked at something for some sort of opportunity to bring a business into the portfolio. But we also know that we are going to look over the long run and see what is the type of portfolio we want to have. Are we the best owner of the businesses that we have in the portfolio? So you should assume that we're going to continue with the discipline we've always had when it comes to M&A.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Brendan on for Manav. Just wanted to ask on the ESG and climate transition revenue, which you guys are reporting on, which will be great. So what are you including in that and what's driving your assumption for the growth in 2023?\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning. So if you look at the revenue that's we have reported for 2022, under the old definition and inclusion for ESG, $209 million. We're adding three new categories. And therefore we call the new revenue base sustainability and energy transition. You can find the details in the appendix of the slide deck. But the three main categories that we're adding is revenues from e-fees and that is coming from the mobility business, revenues with respect to energy transition for the commodities insights business and then thematic factors coming from the index business. So those three categories we are adding into the new definition that brings the baseline for 2022 to $247 million and then we expect to grow from there with the CAGR of about 34% over the next few years. And our expectation is still that this will become an $800 million business by 2026.\nUnidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. And then just switching over just to the maturity walls, I guess just what are you hearing from corporate treasurers? I know obviously the 2024 we expect to see pick up in the next couple of years, but they could still wait a little longer if they want to. But at the same time, rates and spreads have kind of settled. So just what are you hearing from treasurers on that?\nMartina Cheung: Hey Brendon, it's Martina. I can answer that question. So obviously, as part of our issuance, we look for associate the maturity wall data. It's a little difficult to figure out specifically the precise numbers around things like refinancing, which I think goes to the heart of your question. We know historically much of what gets labeled as general corporate purposes has been used for refinancing. What I would say is we're seeing, as you would have seen in our presentation, about $2 trillion to $2.5 trillion in corporate debt rated by us maturing over the next six years. 2023 still has about $1.8 trillion of maturities as of January 1. So we expect refinancing activity this year with any potential early refinancing coming from 2024 maturities. A couple of the key points in terms of what we hear, we don't see any indication of deleveraging, for example, on a meaningful scale. We also are paying close attention to what we see in terms of inflation and interest rates stabilizing somewhat in the second part of the year. So there's still some room for opportunistic issuance, but it's pretty uncertain, as I'd mentioned earlier.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes, thank you. I think, for Martina, how closely our current resources within ratings aligned to recent volume trends. Obviously, there's been a lot of ebb and flow in volumes in recent years. I guess just wondering to what extent you have excess capacity. And we see good incremental margins other than the incentive comp normalization with incremental revenues or I don't know if you're running tighter than it may appear, given that maybe things were stretched in a couple of years ago. Thank you.\nMartina Cheung: Thanks for the question, Jeff. Well, we try to manage our business to absorb shocks, and you'll see that we've maintained our analytical capacity over the last couple of years in some higher growth areas, we've invested a little more capacity ahead of a recovery that we're expecting later this year. The market, as you know, needs our research or insights around the ratings. And the demand for this increased dramatically during the last couple of years with the uncertainty and the volatility. So we've worked very hard to maintain our capacity for that, as well as to anticipate increases in the latter part of this year in volumes. We have done some small changes in the past year or so as part of continuing to enhance our operating model. And as I said during Investor Day, always prudent with our expenses, very disciplined around all the levers that we have, whether it's location, strategy, T&E. And of course, we have benefited substantially from the shared cost synergies with the merger. And the last point I would make on this is in any extreme scenario, we clearly examine all of our options, but right now, we are very comfortable with the analytical levels that we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra: Hi. Thanks for taking a question. I just wanted to, I have two-part question on the market intelligence, first is on the credit and risk solution. There was a modest slowdown there. There was a reference to financial risk analytics. I was wondering if you can talk about how should we think about those trends going into ‘23? And then my second question was just on the data and advisory solution that continues to be pretty strong. And I was wondering if you can talk about how the combination of IHS and S&P data on global marketplace has been driving more customer conversations on that front, and also how the cloud distribution can potentially -- sorry, has the potential to further accelerate the growth in that business. Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Ashish, thanks for the question. First, let me just take the credit and risk solutions piece of the question. We mentioned FRA, this is a business that is a large software delivery, had a large delivery in Q4 of 2021. So you have a year-on-year comparable that made Q4 of 2022 a challenging quarter. So I think that's the thing that Ewout called out earlier that you're referring to, the underlying business remains very strong. This is our ratings direct; ratings express capabilities and they continues to grow as it has historically. Actually it has a really exciting path forward as we move more and more capabilities into our corporate customers and in particularly our credit analytics capabilities. So quite excited about that forward. Second, I think you asked about our data and advisory solutions. This is the broad set of data capabilities that we can bring to bear for our customers. Even just this morning, I saw a large win with an Australian bank where because of the combined sets of data that we now have in the combined enterprise, we're able to respond to very broad RFPs to satisfy needs of customers across a wide range of applications and credit and risk management within their firms. So I do expect that to continue. I think even as the synergies come more to the front and we're able to integrate those data sets together. And this will lead into an answer to your cloud question, I think as we integrate those data sets together more and more, we're increasing the scope of opportunity we have to even further accelerate in our data advisory businesses. On the cloud, many of our applications today already run in the cloud, as Ewout highlighted in the description of the AWS relationship. This is a long-standing relationship. What we're about to do now is to launch the next phase and really complete that full cloud migration. Once all applications and our data capabilities are in the cloud and we've launched a full multi cloud capability across our data sets, this gives us the opportunity to be much more efficient in developing new products, delivering those products out to customers in the way that they want, making available wide sets of data for the application of data science and artificial intelligence. I really do think this is a very important part of the continued acceleration and the broad scope of capabilities we have within market intelligence and you'll see that reflected in that data advisory business and many of the other solutions that we deliver out to customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Russell Quelch from Redburn.\nRussell Quelch: Yes, thanks very much. First question is on buybacks. This may just be a check, but when you return the after-tax capital from the Engineering Solution sale, will that be considered part of the $3.3 billion permissible buyback for 2023, or would this be incremental to that?\nEwout Steenbergen: That’s included in the $3.3 billion, Russell, so how that build up is how you can take our free cash flow forecast and guidance for this year, 85% of debt deduct, the dividends that we will pay out after the $750 million proceeds for Engineering solutions. And that brings you to the $3.3 billion capacity for buybacks for 2023.\nRussell Quelch: Perfect. Thank you. And my second question is probably for Martina, it is for Martina. The chart on slide 15 shows maturities is always expected to be about $1.8 billion, if I get my [inaudible] out for this year. Can you give us an idea of how big maturities were last year in 2022 so we can back out what the impact of maturities is on expected growth versus pricing and new issues?\nMartina Cheung: Yes, thanks for the question, Russell. I don't have the ‘22 maturity numbers in front of me. There's maybe a way to let me know if this is helpful. 2022, we saw overall lower volume of maturities, and the reason why is because you actually have to go back two years prior to that, there was a ton of pull forward done and opportunistic tapping to the market done in 2020 and 2021 because rates were so low. So not sure if that's helpful for you, but the number you're seeing for 2023 in our charts is $1.8 trillion as of the 1 January of this year. We're anticipating that. We think there is possibility for a little bit of pull forward from ‘24, but we really have to see how the year plays out between the first and second half.\nRussell Quelch: Okay, yes. Sorry. That's a billion. Yes. So just to check your answer there so the number of $1.8 trillion is higher than what you saw in 2022 or lower than what you saw in ‘22?\nMartina Cheung: It's higher what was executed, compared to what was executed in ’22 was higher on refinancing.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Adam for Shlomo. What were the onetime expenses for indices? And can you provide more color on the strategic investments in this unit? I know you mentioned multi asset class indices earlier. Can you talk about anything else beyond that?\nEwout Steenbergen: So, if you look at expenses for the index business in the fourth quarter, you should see that in the context of that, this is a business that is investing in the context of driving faster future growth. And one of those things that you see in the quarter is some consulting spend to help the business with a very large transformation to move to more agile working environment, to be much faster in terms of product development, much faster in terms of new entrepreneurial initiatives. And that needed some investments in the quarter from a consulting perspective to make those changes. Also, what you see is strategic investments in new product areas like multi asset class that was already discussed early in the call, but also sustainability, thematic factors, et cetera. So that should position the index business very well to deliver on the double-digit revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 that we discussed during our Investor Day with margins in the high 60s level. So really, I have to say I'm really impressed by the index business. They take very decisive actions. They're transforming their business and setting themselves up on a faster growth trajectory. And the expenses you see in the fourth quarter, you should interpret in the context of that.\nDoug Peterson: Well, thank you everyone. As I mentioned earlier, despite the challenging market conditions, 2022 was a year of resilience, decisive action, and investment for the future. We're really proud of all the accomplishments we had last year, especially the merger with IHS Markit and our bold new strategic vision powering global markets. This is going to allow us to take advantage of secular trends that we've been mentioning throughout the call, like energy transition and private market markets, and the need for analytics and insights in turbulent markets. And we think we're very well positioned for growth in 2023 and beyond. But the reason we're successful is because of the tremendous people that we have in this company. And I want to thank them again for all the work that they did throughout 2022 and all they're doing to help shape the future of S&P Global. I also want to thank all of you to join the call today for your excellent questions. We are very excited about our future and can't wait to share more with you throughout the year. So thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&P Global's website for one year.

            "name": "Adam Kansler",
            "content": "Thanks, George. We're very confident in our desktop business, but our desktop revenue in this quarter didn't perform how we expected. Let me give you a little bit of color on that. Financial services industry obviously under pressure. You see that belt tightening, now some of the largest sell side banks, and they're taking a cautious approach right now, and we're not immune to that. That said, our core desktop offering continued to grow extremely well. Within that desktop revenue line, you have certain products that are non-recurring in nature. Consulting and advisory engagements tied to our desktop offering. These are the products that saw that impact in Q4. As we look out to 2023, we remain confident in our desktop growth, and we're excited about our forward competitive position. We saw active user growth up 9% this year. This is great growth in a challenging year. An important driver for us as we renew and expand our relationships with our customers in 2023. We're delivering significant upgrades in the offering. Speeds increased dramatically. New features being released. You saw we announced our ECR data live on our desktop in 2023. Fixed income and loan capabilities coming. So while Q4 not quite the quarter we expected, we're very confident and excited about that growth forward. I'll just spend two seconds on enterprise solutions. I know you asked about that as well. Understand that revenue line as really two separate components. Software solutions our customers use for workflow compliance and portfolio monitoring. And a section for industry platforms that are really directly impacted by capital markets activity and volumes. That first group performed really well this year, and we expect that to continue to perform really well into 2023. A lot of those are double digit growth businesses. The second bucket, the industry platform, is really impacted by significant drops in capital markets activity that saw a negative double-digit impact in the current year. When we look forward into 2023, we expect that negative impact to moderate as we lap those comparables and as markets stabilize. So we do have a very positive outlook for enterprise solutions as we go forward into ‘23. Thanks. It's a great question because this is probably the most exciting part of what happens in a merger and bringing together the set of capabilities that we now have. In 2022, this was mostly about cross-sell, selling our products to expanded customer bases that gave us a good early start. And in this first year, we were able to perform on that type of synergy realization. As we move into 2023, as Ewout described, it really becomes about building new products that we're able to now deliver because of a combined set of capabilities. Already in 2023, I think five of our combined product capabilities are already generating revenue. We have over 20 in the pipeline, and this is just in market intelligence alone. These are things like building our sustainability data and capabilities into our workflow solutions, expanding the capacity and capabilities of our desktop with fixed income and loans information, bringing together workflow solutions, and incorporating much larger data sets for customers to think about private markets customer who also wants to look at public company comparables for basic financial analysis. Those types of combined product offerings are what give us a lot of confidence in our total revenue synergy targets over $300 million as we get out into later years. And as I mentioned, the most exciting part of what we're doing. Hi, Owen. It's Adam. Happy to take that. So private markets continue to expand. You're seeing continued issuance of private debt, increasing regulatory pressures for disclosure, needs to monitor, report, test and report against sustainability metrics. Manage large private equity and private credit portfolios that requires things like valuations, reporting tools, portfolio monitoring tools. These are all areas where we already have a significant footprint, and we're well positioned to deliver additional solutions to the market. While you see in this year some tempering and fundraising, I think everyone agrees this is an asset class that will continue to grow. And the types of solutions that I described, workflow solutions, regulatory reporting, valuations, portfolio monitoring, all have significant room for continued growth."

            "name": "Martina Cheung",
            "content": "Thanks for the question, Alex. This is Martina. We consistent with our overall view for 2023, both for macroeconomic as well as market Issuance not feeding into our build Issuance. We would see the chances for a mild recession in the first half with some recovery in the second half. And so you could expect to see a little bit more softness in Issuance in the first half followed by some recovery in the second half. Hi, Craig. Yes, it's Martina here. Thanks for the question. So our outlook for this year is overall up 2.5%. The underlying factors, everything Doug had highlighted in his presentation, but 8.5% on corporates, 3% on FS US Public finance around 5%. And we're projecting a decline in structured finance of about 7%. We don't break out high yield and bank loans specifically, Craig. But what I can say is as you all know, high yield in 2022 was a really low year. And so we see growth in the high yield market this year. I think on the bank loans and CLOs, maybe what I can just touch on is the expectation for the research team underpinning that 7% decline in structured finance does reflect some concern around the pipeline for CLOs which we characterize or capture in the Structured Finance Act. Yes, thanks so much for the question. Look, I mean, as I mentioned at the last point, ‘22 was just a really low base from which to compare so we absolutely do expect to see growth and high yield as it relates to January and this week, it's really too early to call. We still have quite a few puts and takes on this in terms of the macro variables. But overall, I would guide to what we've been saying around our expectations first half, second half, how the macro factors play into our overall issuance expectation and how that plays into our build issuance trends. And Owen, this is Martina. I'll just add in a little bit here from a rating standpoint. So private markets, it does contribute quite a bit to our overall business, whether it's in syndicated loans through M&A, LBO activity, et cetera. And we also obviously rate the asset managers, the portfolio companies sponsor, BDCs, and we do quite a bit of credit analysis work to support multiple users in that sector. We have good relationships with key players, and we've been ramping up engagement over the last couple of years. A lot of good dialogue, a lot of interest in new opportunities. What we saw in private debt specifically in 2022, was a growth that was fueled somewhat by the closure of the public markets. And we have heard a lot of interest from customers with pent-up demand looking to come back to the public markets. But overall, we see there's a lot of opportunity here, not just in business and activity coming back to the public markets, but also in working very closely with our private market clients. Hey Brendon, it's Martina. I can answer that question. So obviously, as part of our issuance, we look for associate the maturity wall data. It's a little difficult to figure out specifically the precise numbers around things like refinancing, which I think goes to the heart of your question. We know historically much of what gets labeled as general corporate purposes has been used for refinancing. What I would say is we're seeing, as you would have seen in our presentation, about $2 trillion to $2.5 trillion in corporate debt rated by us maturing over the next six years. 2023 still has about $1.8 trillion of maturities as of January 1. So we expect refinancing activity this year with any potential early refinancing coming from 2024 maturities. A couple of the key points in terms of what we hear, we don't see any indication of deleveraging, for example, on a meaningful scale. We also are paying close attention to what we see in terms of inflation and interest rates stabilizing somewhat in the second part of the year. So there's still some room for opportunistic issuance, but it's pretty uncertain, as I'd mentioned earlier. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Well, we try to manage our business to absorb shocks, and you'll see that we've maintained our analytical capacity over the last couple of years in some higher growth areas, we've invested a little more capacity ahead of a recovery that we're expecting later this year. The market, as you know, needs our research or insights around the ratings. And the demand for this increased dramatically during the last couple of years with the uncertainty and the volatility. So we've worked very hard to maintain our capacity for that, as well as to anticipate increases in the latter part of this year in volumes. We have done some small changes in the past year or so as part of continuing to enhance our operating model. And as I said during Investor Day, always prudent with our expenses, very disciplined around all the levers that we have, whether it's location, strategy, T&E. And of course, we have benefited substantially from the shared cost synergies with the merger. And the last point I would make on this is in any extreme scenario, we clearly examine all of our options, but right now, we are very comfortable with the analytical levels that we have. Yes, thanks for the question, Russell. I don't have the ‘22 maturity numbers in front of me. There's maybe a way to let me know if this is helpful. 2022, we saw overall lower volume of maturities, and the reason why is because you actually have to go back two years prior to that, there was a ton of pull forward done and opportunistic tapping to the market done in 2020 and 2021 because rates were so low. So not sure if that's helpful for you, but the number you're seeing for 2023 in our charts is $1.8 trillion as of the 1 January of this year. We're anticipating that. We think there is possibility for a little bit of pull forward from ‘24, but we really have to see how the year plays out between the first and second half. It's higher what was executed, compared to what was executed in '22 was higher on refinancing."

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. The adjusted financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for our 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from previously divested businesses in all periods. Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. Adjusted revenue decreased 6% to $2.9 billion, largely driven by a challenging issuance environment and macroeconomic conditions. Excluding ratings, fourth quarter revenue would have increased 4% year-over-year. Adjusted corporate and allocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive costs. Adjusted expenses were roughly flat for the full year, demonstrating strong expense discipline across the company. For the fourth quarter, expenses decreased to 4% compared to prior year. Adjusted operating profit margin contracted by 160 basis points to 41.2%, primarily driven by revenue declines in ratings. Excluding ratings, adjusted margins would have improved more than 280 basis points year-over-year. Our adjusted net interest expense increased 9%, driven by higher total debt levels, partially offset by lower average cost of debt. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but right around the midpoint of the guidance range we provided for the full year. We exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the fourth quarter were approximately $175 million in merger related expenses, the details of which can be found in the appendix. We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. In 2022, we completed our $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program with final share delivery executed earlier this week. Turning to expenses, as I noted, we managed to keep adjusted expenses roughly flat for 2022, despite a high inflationary environment. I'm pleased to report we acted decisively and delivered more than $400 million in expense reductions for the full year. Actions taken include pull forward and synergies, a reduction in incentive accruals, adjustments to the timing of certain investments, selective hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas. Looking more closely at the largest contributor to those expense savings, I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress specifically. In 2022, we have achieved $276 million in cumulative cost synergies, and our annualized run rate exiting the fourth quarter was $422 million representing 70% of target after only ten months. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies. With $19 million in cumulative synergies achieved and an annualized run rate of $34 million, the cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the fourth quarter is $807 million. For 2023, we expect to achieve cost synergies and revenue synergies of approximately $510 million and $60 million respectively. We originally targeted 80% of cost synergies in 2023, but with the outperformance in 2022, we are now targeting 85% of the $600 million target. We also originally expected 50% of our revenue synergies in 2024, but with the divestiture of engineering solutions, we now expect approximately 45%, though the full target of $350 million is unchanged. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 3%, with strong growth in data and advisory solutions, offset by slower growth in desktop and declines in enterprise solutions. Adjusted expenses decreased 2% this quarter, driven by continued realization of cost synergies, lower incentive compensation and real estate spend. Segment operating profit increased 16% and the segment operating profit margin increased 360 basis points to 31.4%, on a trading 12-month basis adjusted segment operating profit margin was 31.8%. Looking across market intelligence, there was growth in most categories and on a pro forma basis, desktop revenue grew 3%, data and advisory solutions revenue grew 7%, enterprise solutions revenue was down 4% and credit and risk solutions revenue grew 4%. For desktop, we continue to see strong demand for our subscription offerings like Capital IQ. Overall, desktop growth was below our expectations though, due primarily to the impact of some onetime sales from products reported in our desktop line. For enterprise solutions, softness in our capital markets volume-based products continued to weigh in on the business line's performance as revenue decreased 4%. This was partially offset by strength in private markets software solutions. Now turning to ratings. Ratings continued to face difficult market conditions this quarter as issuance volumes remained muted with revenue decreasing 29% year-over-year. Transaction revenue saw slight improvement sequentially, but decreased 51% compared to the prior year on continued softness in Issuance. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower initial issuer credit ratings and rating evaluation services, partially offset by increases in CRISIL. As a reminder, ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the Issuance environment and M&A activity, respectively, and the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions. In the fourth quarter, surveillance and frequent issuer fees increased year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted expenses decreased 13%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management and lower incentive expenses partially offset by increased salary expense. This resulted in a 40% decrease in segment operating profit and a 910-basis point decrease in segment operating profit margin to 48%. On a trading 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 55.9%. Now, looking at ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributor was the well documented decline in Issuance, partially offset by 6% growth in CRISIL and other revenue. And now turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 4% driven by solid performance across all business lines. However, debt growth was impacted by a $13 million headwind due to the Russia- Ukraine conflict and a $4 million commercial settlement in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of Russia-Ukraine in this commercial settlement, Commodity Insights would have grown approximately 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. It's important to note we suspended commercial operations in Russia in March of 2022. Therefore, the first quarter of 2023 is the loss remaining period that we will see a material impact in the year-over-year growth rates. Adjusted expenses were roughly flat for the quarter, primarily due to higher compensation, an increase in T&E expense and bad debt provision, partially offset by merger related synergies, lower consulting spends and advertising and promotion costs. Segment operating profit increased 10% and the segment operating profit margin increased 230 basis points to 44.6%. The trading 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 44.3%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 5% compared to prior year, driven by continued commercial momentum and strong subscription growth for market data offerings, particularly in gas and power and liquefied natural gas. Energy and resources data and insights grew 4% in the quarter, driven by continued strength in gas, power and renewables. Advisory and transactional services increased 3% in the quarter as we saw higher demand from energy transition advisory solutions, partially offset by revenues generated from a 2021 event that wasn't repeated in the fourth quarter of 2022. Moving to Upstream, I'm pleased to report the business line grew 4% in the fourth quarter, while upstream ACV has had good momentum ex-Russia, the revenue growth this quarter was primarily driven by upfront revenue recognition of certain software products that are not recurring. We expect upstream growth in the low single digit range for 2023. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 9% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong and broad-based performance across dealer, manufacturer and financials. Adjusted expenses increased 15% in the fourth quarter, driven by increases in headcount versus a year ago period. Timing of advertising spend and cloud expenses. We expect expense growth to moderate in 2023. This resulted in a 2% decrease in adjusted operating profit and 380 basis points margin compression year-over-year. On a trading 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 39%. Dealer revenue increased 9% year-over-year driven by strong demand for CARFAX subscription products. Manufacturing grew 8% year-over-year driven by strength in Polk Automotive Solutions and the conclusion of several major recall deals. Financials and other increased 10%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting volumes and new business. Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, revenue increased 4% year-over-year as growth in exchange rated derivatives offset declines in asset-linked fees revenue. During the quarter, adjusted expenses increased 8% as there was an uptick in one time outside services spend and continued strategic investments partially offset by decreases in compensation and other discretionary areas. Segment operating profit increased 2% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 140 basis points to 62.2%. On the trading 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.4%. Asset-linked fees were down 2%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange rated derivatives revenue increased 34% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 70% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6%, driven by new business activities and price realization. Over the past year, market depreciation totaled $506 billion, ETF AUM net inflows were $157 billion, and this resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.6 trillion, which is a 12% decrease compared to one year ago. Our average ETF AUM decreased 8% year-over-year. Engineering Solutions revenue declined 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Coat, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. Adjusted expenses increased 5% due to planned investment spend, offset by favorable FX. Before moving to guidance, I wanted to highlight some of the key drivers of our expected 2023 results and how these tie-ins with the core messages we delivered at our Investor Day. S&P Global is all about growth. 2023 will be a year of growth across the company, driven by customer growth, product enhancements, revenue synergies and strategic initiatives. We'll continue to invest in our people and you will see the annual reset of our incentive compensation targets. We'll also continue to invest in technology as we drive innovation and position the company for accelerating growth in order to help investors see and assess the positive impact of these investments, we'll begin disclosing a few new metrics with our first quarter 2023 results, including our vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation, either new or enhanced products from across the organization. We'll also disclose the revenue generated from products in our two key strategic investment areas private markets, as well as sustainability and energy transition. In addition to these new disclosures, we'll begin a regular cadence of inter quarter disclosures to help investors measure performance of market observable products. We'll begin disclosing ETD volumes and the year-over-year growth rate of build issuance on a monthly basis in area starting later this month when we will disclose the January 12, 2023 data. In addition to the monthly disclosures I just outlined we will also disclose build issuance volumes on a quarterly basis broken out between investment grade and high yield. We know that in a volatile and potentially uncertain market, transparency and accountability are more important than ever. And S&P Global maintains its commitment to best-in-class disclosure and reporting for our shareholders. Now moving to guidance, as noted in our press release, due to the pending divestiture of Engineering Solutions we will not be providing GAAP guidance at this time, and this slide depicts our initial 2023 adjusted guidance. For revenue, we expect 4% to 6% growth, reflecting our continued belief of a mild recession in the first half of 2023 and then some economic strengthening in the back half of the year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of Engineering Solutions, we expect revenue growth to be between 6% to 8%. We expect corporate and allocated expense of $140 million to $150 million. The year-over-year growth is driven in part by a reset of incentive compensation and the expectation of approximately $10 million to $20 million in stranded costs from Engineering Solutions post divestiture. We expect to expand operating margin to the range of 45.5% to 46.5%. Diluted EPS, which excludes deal related amortization of $12.35 to $12.55 which is an 11% year-over-year increase from the midpoint. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items is expected to be approximately $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion. We continue to target a return of at least 85% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. We also to plan to utilize the net after tax proceeds from the Engineering Solutions divestiture for share repurchases. As such, our board has authorized a $3.3 billion share buyback for 2023, which we plan to begin with a $500 million ASR, which we expect to launch in the coming weeks. Lastly, we expect a quarterly dividend of $0.90 share. The following slide illustrates our guidance by division beginning with Market Intelligence, we expect growth in the 6.5% to 8.5% range and margins between 34% and 35%. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, this is skilled business that's well positioned in growing markets such as private markets and supply chain, and we're confident in our ability to accelerate growth as we lap the 2022 headwinds from volume driven businesses and FX. In Ratings, we expect revenue to grow between 4% and 6%, with growth to be driven by volume and price and continued growth in non-transaction revenue. Our assumption is for build issuance to be up between 2% and 6% in 2023. Margins for Ratings are expected to be between 56% and 57%. In Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the 6.5% to 8.5% range and margin between 46% and 47%. We expect continued strength in commodity markets generally and look forward to lapping the Russia impact after the first quarter. Similar to our Market Intelligence division, we expect Commodity Insights to see expense benefit from further realization of synergies in 2023. In Mobility, we expect revenue to grow between 6.5% and 8.5% and margins between 39% and 40%, driven by some normalization of auto supply chain, price realization, new business and new products adoption. Importantly, we expect expense growth to moderate quickly and substantially from the outsized increase in the fourth quarter, we expect expense growth to be below revenue growth in 2023. In indices, we expect revenue to be flat to up 2%, with margins of 66% to 67%. As we indicated at our Investor Day, revenue from asset-linked fees lags movements in underlying asset prices. So the 2022 decline in the S&P 500 will negatively impact this year's revenue, we will also lap the very strong comps in exchange traded derivatives. Before we turn it over for Q&A, I would like to take a moment to thank our people at S&P Global. The highlight of 2022 was the closing of our merger with IHS Markit. But what made it a highlight was the incredible dedication and execution demonstrated by our people. We saw strong, decisive action in the speed of execution of our cost synergy plan. We delivered critical system integration along a very fast timeline, rationalized our real estate footprint, and at the same time continued our strategic investments. 2022 truly was a year of transformation. But it was also a year of foundation. We intend to build on that foundation and drive strong growth in 2023 and for the years to come. And with that, we'll have Adam and Martina join us and turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Good morning, George. This is Ewout. Let me give you a couple of those components. As you know, we are always breaking out ratings revenue in two categories transactional and non-transactional. What you see in the transactional category is a combination of price and volume. And on the volume side, we have stated that 2% to 6% growth for build issuance. And then if you think about non-transaction, we continue to see, expected to see growth in the annual fees. Also, continued positive growth in Ratings is to be expected. And then ICR and RES, that's a bit uncertain because that depends very much on the overall economic environment. So those are some of the components that will add up to that range of 4% to 6% revenue expectation for Ratings in 2023. So I would say overall quite constructive after 2022. Got it. Good morning, Alex. Thanks for being on the call. You ask a couple of questions, so let me walk through each of those. 2024 revenue synergies are slightly tuned down due to the divestiture of Engineering Solutions. We had assumed a number of revenue synergies, both in Engineering Solutions as well as in some of our other segments in the collaboration with Engineering Solutions, for example, Commodity Insights shares a number of customers together with Engineering Solutions. But we are not concerned about that at all because we are finding so many new revenue synergies across the company that we are still firmly committed to the $350 million in total over the five-year period. You're also asking about, in general, the commercial momentum within the company. We're actually really happy what we are seeing. There is a lot of innovation, a lot of new product development, lot of really very strong customer interactions around all of that. You're seeing that we hit our revenue target for ESG sustainability for 2022. And with respect to vitality, what we told you was that we have a target to get vitality over 10% over the next few years. I'm actually very happy to report that we already got there in 2022. So our vitality was just over 10% last year as another indication of the level speed of innovation that we're increasing within the company. Toni, if you think about the overall market dynamics in the commodity markets, we think that currently those markets are very constructive for our customers and that is going to be helpful also for the growth of the business over the next few years. Well, first, one point to highlight is that in 2022 we saw some headwinds from Russia, from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the fact that we stopped our commercial relationship with Russian customers. So obviously that headwind is going away going forward. Secondly, what we are seeing is that our customers are both focused on traditional energy resources and new energy resources. So we're benefiting from both trends at the same time where there is of course a lot of activity going on with respect to the current market prices in terms of exploration and additional capital expenditures that we're seeing. But our customers at the same time are also focused on energy transition and needs help from us. So we are providing data, insight, research, advisory, all of that around energy transition at the same time. So we believe this business has a lot of secular tailwinds over the next few years. What we told you is that at Investor Day that we expect this business to grow into 7% to 9% range in 2025 and 2026. And we think absolutely that is possible. We are very committed to hitting that number. Alex, a couple of items to think about, first in terms of seasonality, realize that we are facing still high comps for the first quarter because the economy started to go more south from March of last year, as well as the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict also started about in March. So first quarter comps are still a bit high. The second item to think about here is that we are now expecting, as we also said during the Investor Day, a mild recession in the first half of the year and then some economic strengthening in the back half of the year. And the third element that I can say is you know that we are running a very tight ship with respect to expenses. So we are definitely starting this year, given the economic uncertainty in a very careful way. And then we need to time this right because the most important thing is that we're going to benefit once the markets start to turn when the GDP is going up, that we're starting to benefit from a growth perspective. We have a lot of growth investments in our plan for this year, as you know. So we have to time it right that we're going to make those investments at the right moment so that we're going to be a large beneficiary once the markets start to swing up again. So those are a couple of the elements you should think about in terms of timing for this year. Okay. Thanks, Alex. In the very first part of the year, you still have pretty significant year-on-year comparables because markets were still strong in the very early parts of 2022. As we come through 2023, we do see some resilience in the early part of this year, but we do see a lot of cautiousness still in markets, and you see aggregate activity levels as well as we do. As we get towards the latter part of the year, your year-on-year comparison starts to flatten out quite significantly. And for us internally, thinking about out what we expect in the year, we budgeted modest increase in total activity across capital markets platforms. We'll obviously see how the year develops, but we think that's the right call as we sit here today. Jeff, the forecast, the guidance we're giving is middle of the road. It's management's best estimates. This is our best expectation for the markets and for the full year at this point in time. I can give you a couple of underlying elements in terms of assumptions that have gone into our plan. So, for example, with our market sensitive businesses, think about the index business. The assumption is flat equity markets this year for the full year. You could say January looks a bit better, and February so far as well. But we're not changing our plan on a month-to-month basis. So on average we're expecting markets to be flat. That is the assumption that have gone into the index outlook, as well as 20% declines in ETD volumes coming from elevated levels last year, as well as flows to be more or less in line with what we have seen in previous years. And then with respect to the other market sensitive businesses, we already gave you some of the assumptions for ratings, so that is has gone into the plan. We think this is our best estimate at this point in time, given everything we know about the company and the markets. Jeff, let me first give you a number of data points in terms of what Kensho is exactly doing today for the organization. And it's actually really mind blowing if you hear these numbers. So a product called Kensho link has saved over 2-million-hour ingesting data sets, strategic data sets, expanding data sets for our customers. Also, link has at this moment achieved 1 million unstructured private market, private entity data into our database, into our platforms, and connected to the market intelligence ID numbers of those entities. There are two other products called EXTRACT and NERD that have enriched 73 million documents on the Cap IQ Pro platform. It has ingested $10.5 million investment research reports on the Cap IQ Pro platform. And Scribe, which is our language speech to text model, is saving 250,000 hours of men work per year for transcripts. Annual savings of that are approximately $9 million. And the list can go on. But those are some data points. Sometimes it's not really understood what Kensho is exactly doing, but it's really impressive. And I hope you agree with me when you hear those numbers. But now shifting to the future of Kensho, because you are right. Kensho's really sweet spot is natural language processing. And everything that we're reading today about large language models is exactly in that sweet spot. So Kensho is today already developing a financial language model called FinLM, which is trained on the S&P Global data assets. It's very expensive to develop large language models. The cost of the compute is very high. But if you have stronger data sets, higher quality data sets, actually that's a differentiating factor. So we're avoiding very significant compute time and costs, so to say. Also, Kensho is developing something new. That's the Kensho Solver which is the AI solution to answer the most complex financial number questions. You also can read about large language models actually not being so strong in math. And we are working on a solution in this area as well. So if you just add it all up, I think what Kensho can be doing for the company and where it's working on, it's very impressive. And we're very pleased that we are so far ahead in acquiring this company already five years ago. Craig, in general terms, we always start to think first about what we do for the customer, the value we generate. The good news is that most of our products are must have products with a very high contribution to our customers. And obviously, that is the first element we take into consideration when we start to think about pricing. Pricing obviously needs to reflect also our cost price. Cost price is going up given the higher inflationary environment. So we believe we have across the board, depending on facts and circumstances, customer relationships, depending on certain products in one area or another area. But in general, we have an opportunity to pass on higher price increases given the higher inflationary environment. Faiza, let me start with a general answer, and then I hand it over to Adam for some additional color in market intelligence. So in general, what we are seeing is very good activity from a cross-sell perspective. We're speaking about 6,700 referrals or leads that have already been generated, both intra deficient and inter-deficient, with very positive conversion levels across the company. So what we're seeing in general is that customers are really happy to talk to us about what more we can bring to them, how we can add more value. The next phase is, of course, to start to focus on new product development. So that will be the next wave of revenue synergies. But we feel we're definitely well on track ahead of the timing and the planning that we had originally. And I handed over to Adam for some additional color. Good morning, Owen. If you're think about the contractual agreement we're having with AWS, this is about a $1 billion spent in total over the next five years. And to put that in perspective, we will continue with a multi cloud philosophy and in total according to our forecast, we would actually be spending more than a $1 billion on cloud computes over the next couple of years. So this is not an increase in spend in total. This is exactly in line, or actually is our total cloud forecast is actually higher than this particular number. But what this brings to us is two very significant benefits. The first is of course that by combining the S&P Global and IHS Markit contracts at this moment in this new partnership with AWS, we will be able to generate very significant cost synergies as part of the new contract. And secondly, as Doug already said, and this is actually more important from my perspective is the strategic partnership because this will help to advance our technology innovation. We will be able to combine leading technologies and platforms and data sets of both companies. We'll be able to add specific capabilities that we are having on both sides, including the Kensho AI capabilities of course. And the most important that will end up with a really very incredible customer experience that we expect to enhance over the next few years. And, Stephanie, let me give you in terms of some of the revenue drivers a little bit, in addition to what Doug said. So with the market normalization, the higher inventory levels, the prices for new and used cars that are coming down, we see the following dynamics for our revenue drivers. On the one hand, that will mean that margins for OEMs and dealers most likely will come down a bit, having an impact on some of the retention levels. But on the other hand, we have the marketing and sales products that are being used and there will be a higher demand going forward for those products. So you could say there is a kind of an offset in terms of the new dynamics in the different revenue streams that we're having. Therefore, we are quite confident that we're able to hit that 6.5% to 8.5% growth level in the current automotive market and the new dynamics that we're are seeing. Good morning. So if you look at the revenue that's we have reported for 2022, under the old definition and inclusion for ESG, $209 million. We're adding three new categories. And therefore we call the new revenue base sustainability and energy transition. You can find the details in the appendix of the slide deck. But the three main categories that we're adding is revenues from e-fees and that is coming from the mobility business, revenues with respect to energy transition for the commodities insights business and then thematic factors coming from the index business. So those three categories we are adding into the new definition that brings the baseline for 2022 to $247 million and then we expect to grow from there with the CAGR of about 34% over the next few years. And our expectation is still that this will become an $800 million business by 2026. That's included in the $3.3 billion, Russell, so how that build up is how you can take our free cash flow forecast and guidance for this year, 85% of debt deduct, the dividends that we will pay out after the $750 million proceeds for Engineering solutions. And that brings you to the $3.3 billion capacity for buybacks for 2023. So, if you look at expenses for the index business in the fourth quarter, you should see that in the context of that, this is a business that is investing in the context of driving faster future growth. And one of those things that you see in the quarter is some consulting spend to help the business with a very large transformation to move to more agile working environment, to be much faster in terms of product development, much faster in terms of new entrepreneurial initiatives. And that needed some investments in the quarter from a consulting perspective to make those changes. Also, what you see is strategic investments in new product areas like multi asset class that was already discussed early in the call, but also sustainability, thematic factors, et cetera. So that should position the index business very well to deliver on the double-digit revenue growth in 2025 and 2026 that we discussed during our Investor Day with margins in the high 60s level. So really, I have to say I'm really impressed by the index business. They take very decisive actions. They're transforming their business and setting themselves up on a faster growth trajectory. And the expenses you see in the fourth quarter, you should interpret in the context of that."

            "name": "Doug Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Welcome to everyone joining today's earnings call. We're looking forward to a very exciting and innovative year at S&P Global. As we shared with you at Investor Day, we're accelerating the pace of innovation and taking advantage of all we have to drive profitable growth over the next three to five years. In 2022, we built on our incredible history at S&P Global to position the company to create significant value for our customers, our people and our shareholders in 2023. 2022 was a year of resilience, decisive action and discipline. As we look at our financial highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics that we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for 2023 adjusted guidance. And non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from previously divested businesses in all periods. Adjusted revenue decreased 4% or 3% on a constant currency basis. As everyone on this call knows, we saw dramatic decreases in debt issuance, which drove the decline in our revenue and earnings. But what you would not be able to tell from the headline revenue growth rate is that our business has become far more diversified and resilient. While we saw a 26% decrease in our ratings revenue, the vast majority of that decrease was offset by a 6% growth in our other businesses. That growth came despite FX headwinds, and unstable macroeconomic environment and the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia. We also took decisive action to preserve margins in 2022. Despite significant inflation throughout the year, we were able to keep our adjusted expenses relatively flat year-over-year due to outperformance on our cost synergies and management actions around incentive compensation, discretionary spending and the timing and prioritization of strategic investments. Our teams have a lot to be proud of, and we've done a remarkable job setting the company up for a strong 2023. We introduced our initial guidance today, which includes 4% to 6% revenue growth and a 10% to 12% EPS growth. Importantly, we're not moving Engineering Solutions to discontinued operations, so both of these figures include the half year contribution we expect from Engineering Solutions in 2023, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions, we would have expected revenue growth to be approximately 6% to 8%. Amongst the impactful accomplishments in 2022, we completed our merger with IHS Markit and took important steps to optimize both our operations and portfolio of businesses. We optimized our capital structure as well, lowering our average cost of debt at fixed rates, protecting our earnings from further interest rate volatility. We introduced a bold strategic vision at our Investor Day, Powering Global Markets, and outlined our key growth priorities for the next few years. We're looking forward to updating our investors on our progress against those initiatives as we move forward. We also continue to shape the secular transition from active to passive asset management, and just last month celebrated the 30th anniversary of the first index-based ETF, which was based on our S&P 500 Index. As we look to the strategic initiatives we had at the beginning of 2022, it's clear that we continue to make great strides. We outperform our original 2022 cost synergy targets by more than 20%, generating $276 million in cost synergies fully realized in 2022 compared to original target of $210 million to $240 million. We successfully integrated our major infrastructure software systems, including what our ERP vendor told us was the fastest integration ever for a company of our size. We continued to drive commercial momentum, generating nearly 7,000 synergy cross-sell referrals post-merger. We also made great progress with our strategic investments and our transformational initiative to optimize our technology spend. Lastly, we continued our relentless focus on making sure S&P Global remains a destination of choice for our people and candidates. Our Internal People Survey indicated 90% or more of our employees endorse our culture and our efforts in diversity. We continued to invest for long term growth in 2022. We made several small acquisitions to bolster and round out our offerings in private market solutions, as well as sustainability and energy transition. We also had several important new product launches and upgrades that will drive customer value and financial performance in 2023 and beyond. We took steps to optimize the portfolio of businesses at S&P Global. We made several merger related divestitures that were required by regulators, but we also decided to divest the Engineering Solutions Division and announced an agreement to sell the business to KKR. These decisions help position S&P Global in growth markets where we can leverage our strengths across the entire business. As always, we will continue to be disciplined stewards of the business and periodically review the portfolio of assets to determine the optimal structure at any given time. Shifting to our financial performance, the largest macro contributor to our 2022 results has been the sharp decrease in global debt issuance, which continued to deteriorate as we move through 2022. For the full year, we saw 28% decrease in global rated issuance or a 31% decrease when including the impact of leveraged loans. This is particularly noticeable in high yield issuance, which decreased 77% from the extraordinarily high levels we saw in 2021. The issuance environment certainly impacted our financials in 2022, but we were pleased with the execution from the teams across the company despite those challenges. As I mentioned previously, our aggregate financial results provide clear evidence of our commitment to disciplined execution. Excluding the ratings business, revenue growth would have been 6% in 2022 and adjusted operating margin would have expanded by approximately 200 basis points. Ewout will discuss the fourth quarter financials in a moment. Each of our divisions performed admirably in 2022. We saw positive revenue growth in four of our six divisions and constant currency growth in five of our six divisions. We believe the strength and discipline shown in 2022 sets us up for a return to positive overall revenue growth and margin expansion in 2023. We continue to deliver impressive results in Sustainable1. In 2022, we grew ESG and climate revenue by 50% year-over-year to more than $200 million. As we outlined at Investor Day and as you'll see in the appendix, we've updated our methodology beginning in 2023 to include all of our sustainability and energy transition products and we'll be disclosing sustainability and energy transition revenues rather than just ESG revenue going forward. Under the new methodology, we generated $247 million in 2022 and we expect growth of more than 30% from that base in 2023. We ended 2022 with ESG ETF AUM reaching $40 billion. That growth is particularly impressive when you consider it is the net impact of an 18% increase in AUM from net flows and a 14% reduction in AUM from price depreciation resulting in 4% net growth year-over-year. We continued to launch new indices based on climate or sustainability factors in 2022, including the new S&P/BMV Green, Social & Sustainable Target Duration Bond Index. We also launched new products in market Intelligence, commodity insights and mobility. Within ratings, we completed 133 sustainable financing opinions, 33 green evaluations and 102nd party opinions. At the core of our sustainability efforts are the corporate sustainability assessments. This remains a key differentiator versus our competitors as they enable us to collect an enormous amount of data directly from corporations around the world. For the methodology that ends in March 2023. We have already increased CSA survey participation to more than 2,900 companies, representing a 30% growth year-over-year. We expect more than 3,000 companies to participate by the end of March. The company also continued to advance its own industry leading practices in sustainability. We issued our 11th annual Sustainability Impact Report and fourth annual TCFD Report. We launched $1.25 billion in sustainability-linked notes and adopted the sustainability-linked bond framework. We ensured the long-term funding for the S&P Global Foundation via a onetime grant of $200 million, and our efforts continue to receive recognition from several leading third parties. I'd now like to shift the presentation to our outlook for 2023. The latest global refinancing study was issued earlier this month. The total amount of global debt maturing in this study is $11.1 trillion over the next five years. This is actually up 3% from the study a year ago and up 7% from last year's study when looking out over the full nine years. Importantly, this shows us how the maturities have evolved over the next few years. While 2023 expected maturities have unsurprisingly decreased over the course of 2022, if we look at maturities in the years 2025 to 2027, we see a 12% increase from last year's study. That increase jumps to 23% looking at maturities in 2027 to 2029. The bottom line is that there is a very healthy pipeline of debt maturities coming over the next several years. Now, looking at total rated debt outstanding, we continue to see a compound growth rate of 5% and a continued year-over-year increase in total debt outstanding on a constant currency basis. Historically, outstanding debt usually gets refinanced. And we don't see any reason why this decades long trend would change. After marked declines in issuance in 2022, our ratings research group anticipates that issuance will return to positive growth in 2023. The forecast calls for issuance gains of 8.5% for non-financials, 3% for financial services, 5% for US Public finance, and a decrease in structured finance of 7%. Please note that this is an issuance forecast, not a revenue forecast, and it does not include leveraged loans. Our financial results and guidance are more closely tied to build issuance, which can differ materially from market issuance as we have described in recent quarters. For 2023, we expect build Issuance to be up approximately 2% to 6% for the full year. Now let's move to the latest view from our economists. They're forecasting global GDP growth of 2.2% in 2023. While GDP growth is expected to be positive, we also expect it to be a story of two halves. Right now, we're assuming a mild recession in the first half followed by stabilization in the second half. Each year, we carefully assess the external factors facing the company. This slide depicts those that we think are most important going into 2023. There are a number of potential positive impacts this year and potential headwinds, many of which we've outlined on this slide. There are also a number of factors that could impact our business positively or negatively or different ways in different parts of the business. Volatility in the equities and commodities markets is a great example, as it can be a headwind to certain parts of our business while serving as a tailwind to global trading services and commodity insights and exchange traded derivatives in our indices business. While we certainly aren't immune to the macroeconomic environment, we're confident that investing for growth in these times of uncertainty and through the cycle is the right way to create long term shareholder value. While others may give in to the temptation to hunker down, we want to make sure that we're aggressively taking the steps to position S&P Global for years of profitable growth. That's why I'm so excited to finish my prepared remarks on this slide. We're optimizing our technology spend for growth, and we're leveraging the most powerful platforms available to make sure our product development teams can rapidly bring new features and products to market. We recently announced a long-term strategic partnership with Amazon AWS to further technology vision we laid out for you at Investor Day. This agreement allows us to consolidate contracts and drive long-term savings through a collaborative relationship with one of the world's most innovative technology companies. Kensho continues to be a key contributor to the culture of innovation within S&P Global. We have a bold vision for how to leverage the newest breakthroughs in machine learning and artificial intelligence and not only make those technical technologies available to our customers, but truly embed them throughout the organization to drive growth and efficiency. I visited Kensho's office this last fall and was impressed to see the work that Kensho's R&D team had been doing with respect to large language models and their transformative potential. Since then Kensho has made significant progress on models that leverage unique data across the enterprise, with the potential to power innovation using AI and machine learning to accelerate product and technology agendas across all of S& Global. This is very exciting. We'll also continue to make strategic organic investments in areas like private markets and sustainability and energy transition, and we'll selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions that enhance our growth and innovation. As we begin reporting our vitality revenue this year, we will continue our long practice of transparency and accountability. It is truly an exciting time to be at S&P Global. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout? George, this is Doug. Before I hand it over to Adam, I want to welcome Adam and Martina to the call today. As you met our presidents at the Investor Day on December 1, we're pleased to ask a couple of them to join us on each of the earnings call. And today it's going to be Adam and Martina. But Adam, over to you. Yes. Thanks, Toni. As you know, the basis of the index business that we have is about transparency. It's independence. It's the ability for a client to understand exactly what's in the portfolio at any point in time. Where we're especially seeing multi asset class demand is in the insurance industry. The insurance industry, which has many types of products, is looking to multi asset class. They use it for annuities, they use it for wrappers. And we're also seeing that bank structured product desks are also looking at multi asset classes. So we're seeing a lot of growth in this. You asked the question about what is the difference? The difference is that you can put together a single product which meets the needs of a client. And we're seeing that this is right now very high demand coming from those two industries. As ETFs are built from the multi asset classes, then you start getting trading around them. So we see the entire ecosystem starting to grow. And it's also part of the trend when we see active to passive anyway. So I think it's very important you ask the question. It's one of our growth areas and across all of the index business. This is one of that we're most excited about, finally, because we have within S&P Global now one of the leading franchises of Fixed Income with IBOX, CDX and iTraxx, we can actually produce these products on our own all-in house. Well, thank you, Jeff. We're very pleased by the investment we made in Kensho, in addition to investments we've made across the entire organization in decision sciences and AI and machine learning. I recently spent some time with Kensho in Cambridge, and they were able to show me some of the R&D they're doing on large language models, which is something that's in the press every day right now. We're seeing that for the financial markets, we've been able to harness the data and the language that we already have inside of the company to develop some very interesting products. But since Ewout oversees Kensho, I think I should hand it over to him to finish the answer. Owen, this is a relationship that we've had for many years. And when we put together the two companies and had our merger, we realized that both of us had already very strong relationships with AWS. We had been on a cloud switch for many years. A few years ago, before the pandemic, I was visiting an acre of a data site where we had hundreds and hundreds of servers. And I said, why do we have all these servers? Should we be in the business of having server farms? And we started a transition in moving to AWS. So over the years, we've developed an incredible partnership with them. And you saw yesterday the culmination of the merger where we've come together to combine contracts to come up with a new approach to how we're going to run our day-to-day operations. But most exciting is the opportunities as this brings for strategic cooperation, for developing new products, for being able to serve customers with completely new opportunities. When we look at our data sets that we have, some of the data that AWS has, how we can bring those together to do completely new innovation. We talked earlier about large language models, the other types of artificial intelligence and machine learning that are shaping markets of the future. We think that the two companies together can accelerate what we're already doing. We see that AWS has, for us been an incredible partner. We're pleased with this approach to a contract. We just signed the contract yesterday. In addition, that we will follow up with some strategic aspects later on and follow up. But you asked some questions about the financial aspects, and I'll ask Ewout to answer that part. Yes, Stephanie, this is Doug. When you look at the mobility business, you have to think about all of the different capabilities that we have across the business. And this starts with CARFAX, which you mentioned. There's a set of products, automotive mastermind, Polk Analytics. What you think about is it all the way from the OEMs to the suppliers, to the dealers, to the insurance companies, to the financial institutions that are financing the automotive sector. All of them are looking for data and analytics. And we've seen an incredible digital transformation that has taken place over the last three years with a lot of volatility in the automotive markets. And all of this has driven all of these different types of players to the mobility business for data, for analytics, for research, for forecasting. In addition to that, we see an incredible transformation taking place in the industry with electric vehicles. And so electric vehicles are also introducing a new element which is also bringing all of these types of people back to the markets for more data and analytics. We've seen that we can benefit in different of types of markets depending on whether it's used cars, it's new cars, whether it's, how a dealer is going to be working with incentives. And so we believe that the market is' that the business is very resilient depending on whatever the factors are. We're watching very carefully and we actually use our own data to forecast our own business. As you know, we look at the key secular trends and drivers of value across all of the markets. And you heard us talk about those on Investor Day. They relate to things like the changes that are taking place in capital markets, internationalization of financial markets, private markets. We've talked about sustainability, the shift from active to passive, supply chain analytics, the approach to all companies looking at becoming digitized, and how data and analytics play. And so we look across our portfolio, we look at what are those growth drivers for each of our businesses? And as you know, we could be opportunistic if we looked at something for some sort of opportunity to bring a business into the portfolio. But we also know that we are going to look over the long run and see what is the type of portfolio we want to have. Are we the best owner of the businesses that we have in the portfolio? So you should assume that we're going to continue with the discipline we've always had when it comes to M&A. Ashish, thanks for the question. First, let me just take the credit and risk solutions piece of the question. We mentioned FRA, this is a business that is a large software delivery, had a large delivery in Q4 of 2021. So you have a year-on-year comparable that made Q4 of 2022 a challenging quarter. So I think that's the thing that Ewout called out earlier that you're referring to, the underlying business remains very strong. This is our ratings direct; ratings express capabilities and they continues to grow as it has historically. Actually it has a really exciting path forward as we move more and more capabilities into our corporate customers and in particularly our credit analytics capabilities. So quite excited about that forward. Second, I think you asked about our data and advisory solutions. This is the broad set of data capabilities that we can bring to bear for our customers. Even just this morning, I saw a large win with an Australian bank where because of the combined sets of data that we now have in the combined enterprise, we're able to respond to very broad RFPs to satisfy needs of customers across a wide range of applications and credit and risk management within their firms. So I do expect that to continue. I think even as the synergies come more to the front and we're able to integrate those data sets together. And this will lead into an answer to your cloud question, I think as we integrate those data sets together more and more, we're increasing the scope of opportunity we have to even further accelerate in our data advisory businesses. On the cloud, many of our applications today already run in the cloud, as Ewout highlighted in the description of the AWS relationship. This is a long-standing relationship. What we're about to do now is to launch the next phase and really complete that full cloud migration. Once all applications and our data capabilities are in the cloud and we've launched a full multi cloud capability across our data sets, this gives us the opportunity to be much more efficient in developing new products, delivering those products out to customers in the way that they want, making available wide sets of data for the application of data science and artificial intelligence. I really do think this is a very important part of the continued acceleration and the broad scope of capabilities we have within market intelligence and you'll see that reflected in that data advisory business and many of the other solutions that we deliver out to customers. Well, thank you everyone. As I mentioned earlier, despite the challenging market conditions, 2022 was a year of resilience, decisive action, and investment for the future. We're really proud of all the accomplishments we had last year, especially the merger with IHS Markit and our bold new strategic vision powering global markets. This is going to allow us to take advantage of secular trends that we've been mentioning throughout the call, like energy transition and private market markets, and the need for analytics and insights in turbulent markets. And we think we're very well positioned for growth in 2023 and beyond. But the reason we're successful is because of the tremendous people that we have in this company. And I want to thank them again for all the work that they did throughout 2022 and all they're doing to help shape the future of S&P Global. I also want to thank all of you to join the call today for your excellent questions. We are very excited about our future and can't wait to share more with you throughout the year. So thank you for joining us today."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Mark. We're pleased to discuss our third quarter results and how we're growing, innovating and executing with discipline even in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. With each quarter that passes, we see further evidence of the strength of our combined company. While no one could have predicted what this year would have looked like, we have benefited from the diversification of our revenue and profit streams and that ballast has provided great resilience as we continue to navigate choppy waters. . It's been nearly two years since we announced the merger, and I'm proud of the progress we've made. We continue to put the customer at the core of everything we do and we continue to demonstrate a clear commitment to our people while maintaining a high standard of operational excellence. We have an incredibly bright future, and I'm excited to share more with you about our strategic vision at our Investor Day on December 1. As we look at our third quarter financial highlights, I want to remind you that the adjusted financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period. Revenue decreased 8% year-over-year or 6% ex FX, with growth in four of our six divisions being offset by continued decreases in Ratings, as well as a year-over-year decline in Engineering Solutions this quarter due to the timing impact of a single product that Ewout will discuss later. Recurring revenue increased 2% year-over-year, representing 84% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses declined 5% year-over-year as cost synergies and disciplined expense management offset some of the inflationary impact we're seeing in labor and technology. Outside of the Ratings business, we saw an average of approximately 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. We're updating our guidance ranges to reflect continued headwinds in Ratings as well as better-than-expected performance in Indices. Guidance ranges for our other four divisions are unchanged from last quarter. I'd also like to share a few other highlights from the third quarter. As I mentioned, we're coming up on two years since the merger was announced and nearly eight months since the close. Our post-merger integration efforts are proceeding on track, but very importantly, we're outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Our customer conversations remain encouraging despite the economic environment. We continue to see significant growth in multiple business lines due to secular trends that will likely benefit us for years to come, like energy transition as well as the near-term benefit we see from volatility and the need for insights and analytics in times of turbulence. We also remain committed to the capital allocation plan we laid out for you at the time the merger closed. We're on track to deploy the full $12 billion in funds for accelerated share repurchases by year-end.  Turning to the commercial success we're seeing in the business. The merger continues to generate encouraging conversations with our customers about the increased value we offer as a combined company. In Market Intelligence, we developed a strong commercial pipeline in September, and we believe we will see a reacceleration of the Desktop business in the fourth quarter. Between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we've generated well over 3,000 cross-sell referrals since the merger closed, and the conversion rates are strong. Despite the issuance environment, our Ratings teams remain highly engaged. We remain connected with investors and issuers to maintain relationships and ensure we have the appropriate understanding of their needs in advance of any recovery in the debt markets. Commodity Insights and Mobility are both seeing significantly improved retention rates relative to recent history as well as strong competitive wins and new customer growth. We saw a very important win in our Indices business this quarter as a large Japanese asset manager launched the first cross-asset ETF in Japan based on both iBoxx Fixed Income and S&P Dow Jones Equity Indices. While it's still early in our efforts in cross-asset indices, this launch is powerful proof of the demand for such products among global asset managers. Now to recap the financial results for the third quarter. Revenue decreased 8% to $2.86 billion or 6% constant currency. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 12% to $1.3 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 46% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in Ratings transaction revenue, partially offset by cost synergies realized in the quarter. Our non-Ratings businesses in aggregate grew revenue 4% in the quarter compared to prior year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 45.5% as of the third quarter. Despite the impact of the issuance environment, we benefited from the resiliency of our businesses as well as disciplined cost management and cost synergies to significantly moderate the impact to our adjusted EPS, which declined only 4% year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I'm pleased to report positive growth across four of our divisions, with Ratings continuing to work through a difficult issuance cycle and Engineering Solutions entering an off-cycle quarter without the sale of a core product that is released once every two years. Throughout the year, we've seen outsized growth in certain products as customers depend on our data and information to make informed decisions during uncertain times. We saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result. Within our Indices business, revenue from exchange-traded derivatives outperformed our internal expectations, growing nearly 40% year-over-year. Our CDS Indices, which include the CDX and iTraxx index families, increased 66%. Markets continue to recognize our leadership in areas like climate and financial data, and we provide a consolidated platform on which to access information, whether it's tracking market movements, company performance or identifying physical risk from weather events, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating the uncertainty. This is evident in the growth we saw in key product offerings for Market Intelligence, including Trucost and Equities, Data and Analytics. I'm pleased to mark the first anniversary of the launch of Platts Dimensions Pro, a one-stop experience across Platts benchmark price assessments; news and analytics spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. Over the last year, we've continuously increased functionality, introducing new features on a regular basis. This unified platform is gaining clear recognition with active user growth nearly doubling in just the last six months. Moreover, some of our newer benchmarks continue to expand their market presence, our low-sulfur marine fuel assessment is a great indicator of the trajectory of a successful new benchmark. Assessments like this often take multiple years to truly scale and become literal market benchmarks. In the third quarter, approximately 1.3 billion barrels of fuel were traded based on price assessment, representing a 15% increase compared to last year. Our iron ore assessment has been the primary physical market pricing reference for seaborne fine iron ore delivered to China for over 10 years, and it's still growing at an impressive rate. We understand the importance of reliable market benchmarks to the secular energy transition story, and we're positioning ourselves for long-term success. The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched and energy transition over the last two years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices covering one of the key producers of this future fuel as well as the Methane Performance Certificate that we believe will be an integral component of low-carbon crude trading. Now turning to issuance. During the third quarter, global-rated issuance decreased 40% year-over-year; in the U.S., rated issuance in aggregate decreased 47%; European-rated issuance decreased 19%; and in Asia, rated issuance declined 47%. High yield was down by 80% year-over-year in both United States and Europe and was down nearly 100% in Asia. Structured finance in Europe was the only positive regional category in the quarter, increasing 7% year-over-year. We've included additional details on the subcomponents of issuance by region in the slide deck.  We continue to make significant progress in our sustainability products. ESG revenue increased nearly 40% year-over-year to nearly $50 million in the quarter. We saw continued innovation in our ESG indices and the market recognition of our strength. We launched the S&P Net Zero 2050 Carbon Budget Indices, and we ended the quarter with ESG ETF AUM of $35 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year in a down market. Within Market Intelligence, we launched enhanced Physical Risk Exposure Scores and Financial Impact data sets to support clients as they seek to understand and manage the physical and financial exposure to climate change. Our Ratings division continues to see success here as well, completing 13 ESG evaluations and 23 Sustainable Financing Opinions in the quarter. One of the most important competitive advantages in our ESG efforts is the Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is an annual comprehensive assessment completed in partnership with participating companies. The S&P Global brand and everything it stands for continues to drive growth in the number of companies seeking to partner with us in this assessment process. Year-to-date, we've seen more than 2,300 companies opt in, a more than 25% increase from the same time last year. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. Beginning with our issuance forecast. Our Ratings research team is expecting an approximately 19% decline in global market issuance, including both rated and unrated issuance for the full year. This compares to the previous forecast of down 16%. Importantly, our financial results and guidance are more closely tied to billed issuance, which can differ materially from market issuance as we described last quarter. Year-to-date, market issuances declined approximately 14%, while billed issuances declined approximately 42%. Based on the trends we saw in September and October, we now expect billed issuance to be down approximately 45% to 50% for the full year. When we look to the broader macroeconomic environment for the rest of 2022, we continue to see further deterioration from what we expected in August. In addition to the downward trend in issuance, our expectations for GDP growth, inflation and the commodities markets have all lowered. With only two months left in 2022, we wanted to provide what will likely be the final update on some of the macroeconomic indicators we're using to help inform our financial guidance for the year. We'll not be discussing our expectations for 2023 on this call, but we will be closely monitoring both the internal and external indicators of our business over the coming months. And we'll plan to provide our initial 2023 outlook at the customary time when we report our fourth quarter results early next year. Before I turn the call over to Ewout, I want to thank the incredible people we have at S&P Global. Our people have executed well in a challenging environment this year and have delivered great value for our customers and the organization while managing a complex integration. I'm confident that we're well positioned to drive long-term growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ewout to walk through financials and guidance. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. Doug has already discussed the headline financial results, and I would like to cover a few other items. As Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods. Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive costs. Our net interest expense decreased 17% as we benefit from lower average rates due to refinancings following the merger. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but towards the low end of the guidance range we expect for the full year. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the third quarter were approximately $108 million in merger-related expenses. The details of which can be found in the appendix. We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $965 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have deployed $11 billion towards share repurchases, and we expect the final $1 billion of our previously announced ASR program to be completed by year-end. We note that the U.S. dollar remained strong against many foreign currencies, and we've seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. As a reminder, approximately 3/4 of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have a hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings. For the third quarter, we saw a $0.03 favorable impact to EPS from foreign exchange and hedging programs. Turning to expenses. We are committed to disciplined expense management in this current environment. And similar to last quarter, we highlight the levers we continue to pull to protect margins where we can while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include pull forward in synergies, a reduction in incentive accruals, adjustments to the timing of certain investments and pausing select hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas. Through cost synergies and other management actions we have taken so far this year, we expect to generate more than $400 million in expense savings for 2022.  Now I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the third quarter, we achieved $165 million in cumulative cost synergies and our current annualized run rate is $311 million. I'm pleased to report we continue to outperform our initial time line on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the third quarter is $641 million. Given the outperformance on the timing of our synergies, we now expect to achieve slightly more than the 35% to 40% of total cost synergies in 2022 that we were targeting previously. Now let's turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence revenue increased 4% with strong growth in Data and Analytics, offset by slower growth in Desktop and flat growth in Enterprise Solutions. For this quarter, recurring revenue accounted for approximately 96% of Market Intelligence total revenue. Expenses were roughly flat this quarter with increases in compensation expense, cloud spend and outside services being offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation. Market Intelligence remains the biggest driver of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date. Segment operating profit increased 13%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.9%. The OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division contributed $19 million in adjusted operating profit to the company. As a reminder, because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture operating independent of the company, we recognize their results on an after-tax basis and do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was growth in most categories. And on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 3%, Data & Advisory Solutions revenue grew 7%, Enterprise Solutions revenue was flat and Credit & Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. For Desktop, we saw slower growth this quarter, driven in part by the timing of certain revenue recognition items, and we expect desktop to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter. For Enterprise Solutions, the business line continues to see headwinds in several of our volume-driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity under variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of FX and these volume-driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would have been approximately 7% year-over-year. While we remain confident in the long-term growth of all these product lines, we expect deceleration in categories outside of Desktop to persist in the fourth quarter. Now turning to Ratings. Ratings continued to face difficult market conditions this quarter as issuance volumes remained muted with revenue decreasing 33% year-over-year. Transaction revenue decreased to 56% on the continued softness in issuance we highlighted earlier. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower Rating Evaluation Services and initial Issuer Credit Ratings, partially offset by increases in CRISIL, ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the issuance environment and M&A activity, respectively, and the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions. Expenses decreased 19%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses. This resulted in a 41% decrease in segment operating profit and a 750 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin to 55.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 57.9%. Now looking at Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were a 44% decrease in Corporates and a 31% decrease in Structured Finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, Financial Services decreased 20%, Governments decreased 33%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 9%. And now turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 5%, driven by strong performance of subscription products, including those within Price Assessments and Energy & Resources, Data & Insights lines. However, that growth was impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As noted on the slide, revenue related to Russia contributed $12 million in the third quarter last year and made no contribution in the third quarter this year. Excluding this impact, Commodity Insights would have grown approximately 8% in the third quarter. There's no change to the expected impact from this conflict. But as a reminder, on an annualized run rate basis, we expect Commodity Insights revenue and operating income to be lower by approximately $52 million and $51 million, respectively. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 91% of Commodity Insights revenues.  Expenses increased 1%, primarily due to salary and fringe and an increase in T&E expense partially offset by merger-related synergies, lower consulting spend and lower real estate costs. Segment operating profit increased 9%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 45.8%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.8%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 8% compared to the prior year, driven by continued commercial momentum and strong subscription growth for market data offerings. Energy & Resources, Data & Insights also grew 8% in the quarter, driven by strength in gas, power and renewables and in petrochemicals. Advisory and Transactional Services decreased 1% in the third quarter. The Upstream business was down 2% compared to prior year, mainly driven by higher comps for Software and Analytics products offerings as well as the impact of Russia. Excluding that impact and the impact of FX, Upstream ACV growth would have been positive in the quarter.  In our Mobility division, revenue increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued high retention rates and new business growth in CARFAX. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 78% of Mobility's total revenue. Expenses grew 5% year-over-year as we have yet to lap planned increases in headcounts, and we saw continued cloud expense growth, which were partially offset by lower data cost and favorable FX. This resulted in a 14% growth in adjusted operating profit and 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 40%.  Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for CARFAX as dealerships profitability remain at elevated levels. Manufacturing grew 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in subscriptions and an uptick in the Recall business. Inventory shortfalls continue to temper growth as OEMs spend on marketing initiatives powered by Mobility products remains muted. Financials and other increased 9%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products and new business. S&P Dow Jones Indices revenue increased 3% year-over-year with strong margin expansion despite lower assets under management. For the third quarter, recurring revenue contributed 84% of the total for indices. During the quarter, expenses were roughly flat as strategic investments and higher information services costs were offset primarily by lower incentives and other expenses. Segment operating profit increased 5%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 70.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.8%. Asset-linked fees were down 5%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange-rated derivative revenue increased 37% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 60% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 10%, driven by new business activities. Over the past year, market depreciation totaled $472 billion. ETF AUM net inflows were $194 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.3 trillion, which is an 11% decrease compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which decreased 4% year-over-year. As a reminder, revenue tends to lag changes in asset prices. Given the declines across equity markets so far in the back half of this year, we continue to expect softness in asset-linked fees as we close out 2022. Engineering Solutions revenue declined 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. The BPVC contributed approximately $1 million in revenue this quarter compared to approximately $8 million in the year ago period. For this quarter, 94% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses decreased 7% due to favorable impact on BPVC royalties. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.1%. Non-subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions decreased 63% year-over-year for the reasons I mentioned on the previous slide, while subscription revenue increased 3% over the same period.  Now moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance due to the continued softening of the issuance environment, we now expect revenue to decrease mid-single digits compared to our prior guidance. Some of that impact is offset by the outperformance in indices. The net impact of our lower ratings revenue expectations, combined with the cost measures and capital allocation measures we have outlined today result in our slightly lower margin outlook and a new adjusted EPS range of $11 to $11.15. This margin outlook reflects our continued expectation for approximately 180 basis points of margin expansion outside of our Ratings business. Interest expense is expected in the range of $345 million to $355 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to higher interest on our cash deposits and positive impact from currency hedges. We're also reducing our outlook for capital expenditures to $115 million due to intentional delays in real estate investments. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, is now expected to be approximately $4 billion. The following slide illustrates our guidance by division. Based on this past quarter's performance, we're updating our expectations for adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin for Ratings and Indices. The guidance ranges for our other divisions are unchanged.  In closing, despite the geopolitical tensions and a challenging macroeconomic environment weighing on the markets, our portfolio of strong businesses continue to prove resilient. Furthermore, I'm pleased with the progress our teams have made since the closing of the merger earlier this year. We look forward to providing you with a deep dive into our businesses and the longer-term outlook of the company at our Investor Day on December 1.  And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Owen Lau from Oppenheimer.\nOwen Lau: For the MI Credit Risk Solutions and Data & Advisory Solutions, could you please unpack a little bit on the products and services driving that growth in current backdrop? Are they new customers? Because based on my understanding, many of these products are subscription based. I just want to get a better sense of how you can further monetize it and drive that growth?\nDouglas Peterson: Hi, Owen, this is Doug, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start, first of all, by mentioning that within Market Intelligence, Credit and Risk Solutions has always been a long-term outperformer. It's an area that we see very high demand from the markets for information about credit risk and other types of risk, especially in this market. As you know, the core products in this area are the basic products that are providing information from the Ratings business. So things like RatingsDirect, RatingsXpress. We also have a suite of products like Credit Analytics. And we do see a lot of growth now related to credit climate analytics. This is an area where we're seeing increased interest and demand, especially from financial institutions, especially large global banks.  In addition, we're seeing some other growth from areas like traded market risks some names of, I'll say, ex VA, CCR. We have a VAR product, et cetera. And then we have some additional buy-side risk opportunities for clients to look at for market risk and stress scenarios. So if you look at the entire suite of products, we're able to provide the market information at the time when they really want to understand risk.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up is somehow related to the Ratings business. Could you please talk about your view on how private credit market might have impacted S&P Global Rating business? And how S&P can provide services in this area.\nDouglas Peterson: Yes. Thanks. On the private markets, as we saw earlier this year, there was a retreat of institutional investors and retail investors from credit funds. So there was really no liquidity at the beginning part of this year. It was a combination of people that were risk averse and also looking at the shift between fixed and floating. There were a lot of moves in interest rates. So we saw a retreat from the traditional loan funds and high-risk investors that left the markets. That left an opportunity for the private credit funds that had traditionally been focusing on mid-market credit. So SME credit was their expertise. Many of them also had started moving into the higher quality, higher level of risk and large-cap companies. So they were there to fill the gap. The gap was filled by private credit at the beginning of the year. And we know that they've also been able to take on loans with a faster, also with a higher risk level. And so we've seen that increase during the year. Now how do we think about that? First of all, we look at that as an opportunity for us going forward. We believe that the private credit funds will be looking over time to have some sort of risk transformation, whether it's related to fixed floating or it has to do with securitization or syndication. We think at that time, they're going to be wanting some Estimate services, potentially Rating services. In addition, we've identified private credit as one of our most important strategic growth drivers. We already have a base of private credit businesses that were part of IHS Markit. And related to that, we have a strong starting point with products like iLEVEL provides information to portfolio managers. So we've identified private credit is a growth area for us for ratings as well as for Market Intelligence going forward. And we're watching the trend very carefully. We know at some point, investors will come back to the markets, and we'll see a broadening of the market again. But we've been watching this very closely and are actually interested in this as a growth area for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra : I wanted to drill down further on the Ratings and the issuance guidance. I believe my back of math -- envelope math suggests that you're assuming a similar growth in fourth quarter as third quarter for transaction revenues. I just wanted to see if I'm in the right ballpark I was just wondering if you could provide any color on what your expectations are for issuance for the rest of the year. Are you assuming any rebound? And how are the conversations with the issuers coming along?\nEwout Steenbergen: Ashish, if you look at the outlook, as you know, we are not really providing quarterly guidance. So we're not really speaking about the quarterly outlook for either our financial results or some of the input variables like issuance. But of course, if you look at the numbers that we put out today, then if you would do a backward calculation, you would assume that the most recent trends we are seeing in terms of issuance is what we expect to continue also in the fourth quarter. So, definitely, that’s the main reason why we took our guidance down. I would say that's the only reason, because overall the impact on our results from a top line perspective is about $200 million reduction in revenue outlook for the Ratings business, so about $0.50 of EPS. And then there were a couple of smaller things. But net-net, I think that's the main driver of why the EPS outlook is down for the full year.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe just switching gears on Mobility, pretty strong momentum there despite what we are seeing in the auto lending space or in the auto space. And so I was just wondering, as we start to see the demand for auto slow down, how should we think about the growth in the business? Is there some counter-cyclicality as well here in the business?\nDouglas Peterson : Yes, Ashish, thank you for your questions. When it comes to Mobility, we see that there's a very interesting shift going on over the last couple of years. As you know, when the market started slowing down from the pandemic and the supply chain interruptions, we saw the used auto market really start expanding and we benefited from the CARFAX products and the CARFAX suite of products, especially at the dealer level. We know that there's some counter-cyclicality as you say, it as the market returns to new autos coming into the market and inventories rise that we will benefit from products and services to the OEMs and as well as the dealers are going to start having a different type of relationship again with the manufacturers and suppliers.  So we're watching right now very closely three big trends in the automotive market: what's happening with the used car market where we have a strong position, what's happening with the OEMs and the supply chain for the new automobiles. They've been in historic lows over the last two years. So we expect that's going to start going up. And then there's also a transformation taking place in the industry as more and more vehicles start to become electric based with the drivetrain as opposed to internal combustion. So a lot of trends, which are all play to our advantage because we have data analytics and research products that we can serve all of the users in these markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS.\nAlex Kramm: I understand that you don't really want to comment much on 2023 quite yet, I guess, we'll wait until December. Just on the issuance side, however, your own research group yesterday put out not only the 2022 update but also the 2023 initial look, which I think calls, if I got this right, for 2% issuance growth and 10% growth, in particular, for the Corporate side, which I think is the most important for you. So since this is out there, I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about that forecast? And what's kind of items you would think about as you think about how that flows into billed issuance and revenues? I know it's early, but given that your own company has an issue outlook out there already, figured it's relevant.\nDouglas Peterson : Yes. Thanks, Alex. As you say, we produce a report. And what we're looking at right now is, understanding what are going to be the main factors driving us towards the end of the year. We've given you those in that report as well. That showed that issuance was expected to be down by 19% for the full year, which compared to 16% from our last report. As you know, we will wait to provide guidance for 2023 until February when we provide our full issuance report as well as our guidance for the year. What you saw from the report from our team, our credit research team is product research and it's not necessarily geared directly to how we're going to find billed issuance. As you recall, last quarter, we explained very clearly what is included in billed issuance. We take the -- what would be expectations for issuance overall. We add in leveraged loans. And then we extract some debt areas like unrated categories such as MTNs, most of the domestic debt from China. And we also exclude the international public finance from those calculations to come up with our expectations. But maybe more importantly to your question, we're always in the market.  As you saw, we talked about having had 3,000 interactions with the markets during the quarter. We are all over the market to understand what are the factors that are going on that are driving issuance and will drive issuance. So we do provide our guidance going forward. But we're looking at the issuance forecast, GDP growth, macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates. We're looking at spreads, which have been quite high over the last few quarters. Maturity schedules, which are quite encouraging going forward into 2023, '24, '25, et cetera, M&A pipeline. So as you know, at the time we come out with our guidance, we will have looked at all of these factors. But maybe the most important point is that we're not just standing around and waiting. We're very actively engaged with the markets.\nAlex Kramm: All right. Fair enough. Then maybe just going to Market Intelligence. I think since the deal was announced or closed, I think we have had this expectation that more and more of the, I guess, subscriptions on the IHS Markit side will be moving onto our S&P kind of enterprise umbrella. So just wondering if that's still true, if there's a time line for moving more and more that legacy market subscription under that S&P umbrella. And yes, how far we're along if you're able to pick up any sort of incremental pricing as you do that? Or how should we think about that transition over time, if that is a plan?\nDouglas Peterson : Yes, Alex, it's very, very early for us to talk about it. But what I'll tell you is going back to the last comment I made that we're incredibly linked into the markets right now. We have all of our commercial teams are out speaking with our customers. What we're finding is that there's a lot of opportunities for us to start with cross-sell. So our initial early wins have been with cross-sell, selling different products within the divisions and sometimes across the divisions. But we are hearing opportunities for moving data into the Desktop, finding some products for data and research and analytics fit together. So to your point, it's a vision that we have, but it's really early for us to give you any kind of detailed analytics about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan : I wanted to ask about Ratings margins. They were down sequentially, but they were still really resilient just given the environment and especially relative to one of your big competitors. Just wanted to ask you if you could talk about some drivers that enabled you to flex cost outside of incentive comp?\nEwout Steenbergen: Toni, you're right. We are quite pleased with the overall expense discipline of the company in the third quarter. You've heard us announce last quarter that we're taking additional actions to deal with the macro environment and we're actually really pleased how that is playing out, and you may continue to see that kind of a result from us going forward across the company. And of course, we take the benefit also from the cost synergies that we can implement and accelerate during this period. So if you look specifically at the Ratings business, it is a mix. On the one hand, we continue to make sure that we invest in future growth, making sure that we stay competitive on a compensation perspective. We want to preserve the capacity we have on the analytical side.  But on the other hand, there are also discretionary costs that we are bringing down. There are allocated costs that are benefiting from the synergies that we are realizing across the company, and then also incentive compensation is down year-over-year. So it's actually a balance of different elements that go into the mix. But definitely, as you have seen in the past, we're always focused in terms of trying to preserve margins in our business businesses as much as possible, particularly in more challenging macro environments.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And this is a little bit of a broad question and you could take it where you want. But just -- could you talk about any changes in customer behavior over the last six months, and this could be elongation of the sales cycle in some places? Or maybe it's just different products that have been more in demand? Just wanted to get a sense of sort of changes in the businesses over the last recent history?\nDouglas Peterson: Yes. Toni, thanks for that question. And as you know, the markets are going through a lot of uncertainty and turmoil. We've never lived through a period where you have an end of a pandemic, a war, inflation, interest rates going up, all sorts of different impacts. I mentioned earlier on the mobility discussion what kind of impact that's had on the markets overall. We've seen this interest in talking about risk. It's a topic which has increased dramatically. When we meet with customers, they want to talk about the external environment. They want the expertise of S&P Global that comes from our entire company to understand what's happening with risk, with markets, with credit as well as equities, commodities. So we start with very broad dialogues. And then we dig deeper into some specific topics. One that comes up in almost every single conversation we have is energy transition, climate and sustainability. That's a really common discussion. It's increasing in terms of how much time we spend on it.  And another one is Data and Analytics. How are customers thinking about their own application of AI, Data and Analytics? They want to learn from us how we're managing S&P Global, but they also want to learn how they can be deploying new types of products and services using more AI. But overall, we have not seen any kind of initial pushback on slowing down a sales cycle. Clearly, there are some markets, as I mentioned, the ratings market, there's not a lot of issuance right now, but we've stayed engaged with the market. But maybe net-net, the big topics we spent a lot of time on the macroeconomic environment, sustainability as well as AI and data. Those are big conversations we have in almost every customer interaction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber : I wanted to start with a Ratings-related question. I asked your competitor -- your large competitor the same question. I'm just wondering like your thoughts. What are you looking for in terms of signs of an uptick in that market, green shoots, et cetera? What should we be focusing on?\nDouglas Peterson : There's a few things that I'm focusing on myself, and I know that if we had our Ratings team specifically on the call, they might tell me that there's others that are looking at beyond that. But clearly, there's a set of factors, M&A activity is one for me, which is -- it's kind of an informal indicator. M&A activity has been quite weak recently. Typical M&A has a set of transactions come along with it, may be a bridge loan, which turns into a deal loan, which turns into a bond or rated loan, et cetera. M&A activity has been weak. IPOs is another one. The reason I look at those myself is that those are just their activity, which denotes confidence in the markets that people are willing to invest. But then as you recall, we're having conversations with issuers. We mentioned 3,000 that we had last quarter with issuers. And we see a lot of interest in investing people that have plans for investing in new markets for innovation, for investing in venture capital, ways that they can see new shoots in their own businesses. So we're watching when is it that people actually pull the trigger. And maybe the takeaway is it's not, if it's when. We know that there's a lot of people out there that are ready to go. They have great ideas, but the question is when will those conditions of interest rates, of stability of market confidence, when will those be back when people start going back to the market.  Finally, we do look at the maturity schedules, and we know that there's a point starting towards the middle of next year that there will be maturity schedules are going to start kicking in and we're going to watch that carefully as well. We'll there be pull forward from that, but that's another factor we're going to be watching.\nJeffrey Silber : Okay. That's really helpful. And I can shift over to the Mobility line of business. Margins, at least by our record, looks like it hit an all-time high, even I think compared to IHS's business, and I know it's a different segment right now. But can you talk about what's going on there? And should we expect margins to continue to go higher from here?\nEwout Steenbergen : Jeff, we are always aspiring to improve margins across all of our businesses. So mobility is not an exception to that. That is because of the fact that we're focused on operating leverage. We always like to see the top line growing faster than the expense line. And of course, aided then by strategic investments to aim for future growth as well. What we are seeing in the mobility business is really a positive overall environment that helps and is very supportive for the business, particularly with low inventory levels, we see margins high for the OEMs and for the dealers and that is driving high retention rates. The offset of that is that we see lower spend for sales and marketing products that we are having, and that's because of the same factor that the inventory levels are low. So you could say there's a kind of an inherent hedge in that business. If the market starts to turn, if we see that the demand supply starts to shift in the car market, then we would also see those different revenue streams moving in opposite directions. But we think that with that, we're insulated from our overall financial impact, and therefore, we can continue to focus on margin expansion as well.  And as Doug mentioned before, we also are taking a benefit from used car markets, and that has been proven to be quite resilient the cycle. So yes, overall, we are really happy with the growth of mobility, the margins, and we would see that continuing going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Billed issuance was down 40% in the third quarter. You're assuming full year billed issuance declines of 45% to 50% will be worse than the third quarter decline. What are you seeing that suggests 4Q could potentially be worse than 3Q in terms of billed issuance? Any color there would be helpful.\nDouglas Peterson : Yes. First of all, let me just give a little bit more color on that. As you know, at the last forecast, we saw that issuance of the non-financials or Corporates would be down about 30%. We now see it down about 35%. And then we see that in Financial Services, they had expected to be down 10%, now down about 14% or so. When you look at the total billed issuance, and we mentioned that it was going to -- year-to-date was down 42% and we're expecting it to be down now 45%, this is going to be based on what we see in the pipeline.  As I mentioned in the answer I gave a few minutes ago, we see that the market itself is quite hesitant. It's not a question of, if, it's a question of when. And we see that during the fourth quarter, what we've picked up from investment banks from issuers directly that right now, they're still waiting to see what the conditions are going to be around economic growth, interest rates and spreads. So it's just based on our forecast, not our issuance forecast. This is based on our market forecast based on people that are meeting with issuers and meeting with investors that the current conditions are still such that people are holding back before they go to market.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. And related to that, we're likely going to be in a higher interest rate environment for some time relative to pre-COVID. What are your thoughts on whether corporates may enter a phase of balance sheet delevering and implications for issuance performance.\nDouglas Peterson : Yes, that's a theoretical question, but let me go back and look at history. I know that many of us have been in the market for many years, remember when interest rates were 4%; 3%, 4%, 5% base rates and the markets were incredibly active. I think that we'll settle into a range once there's stability and we understand what the longer-term rates are going to be, what longer-term inflation and growth are going to be. Companies and financial institutions will go back to the markets because they want to invest and grow. We know that organizations like to grow and to grow, you deploy capital. We also look at the trend around the globe where more and more markets are shifting from being banking markets to capital markets.  Right now, in Europe, there's a couple of shifts going on in the support programs that the ECB was providing to the banks. This was very easy, very low-cost funding. They're starting to wean the banks off of those, and they're going to the capital markets to raise more capital as well as to deploy more capital into bonds instead of into loans. So we see this trend of capital marketization around the globe, and we think that's another trend in the long run that will drive a lot of positive tailwinds for the Ratings business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.\nCraig Huber : My first question on pricing, can you just update us on a like-for-like basis? What would you say the average price increase is this year? And how does it vary across the segments? Is it 3% to 4%? Or is a little bit higher?\nEwout Steenbergen : Greg. Well, we are always very careful when we speak about pricing in isolation because, first and foremost, we start with customer value. What do we deliver for our customers? And the good news is that based on the very high value of our products and services, we should be able to pass on cost/price increases and to achieve more favorable contract terms and fees over time at renewal. Of course, it depends on facts and circumstances of each and every product, each and every customer situation and of the situation of each and every of our businesses. But that is our overall philosophy. I can't give you specifically a number for across the company, how much price increases are up compared to previous periods, but there are definitely areas where we are looking at price increases or have already implemented price increases that have been higher than in the past. But again, that all has started with that there is a good balance with the overall customer value that we are delivering.\nCraig Huber : My second question, please, on Market Intelligence. Can you just talk a little further about the health of your clients, the sales pipeline there a little bit further? I mean your numbers speak for themselves. How do you feel about the outlook for Market Intelligence right now?\nDouglas Peterson : Yes. We still feel very, very positive, and we're optimistic about the Market Intelligence pipeline. You read every one so about some of the financial institutions here and there that might be slowing down some of their growth, but we're not seeing that in terms of negotiations with clients. But very importantly, one of the propositions of the merger between IHS Markit and S&P Global was to cross-sell the excellent products from both groups to the client bases on the other. We believe that we have a strong diversification of our client base. And as an example, in the IHS Markit businesses, their financial services business was mostly focused on financial services. We're finding that a lot of the opportunities and a lot of our initial cross-sell has been selling IHS Markit products to corporate clients. We think that there is a lot of upside and a lot of opportunity. We are out in the market actively talking with our customers about ways we can bring value through new products, new services through data, et cetera. So right now, we're not seeing any pullback or any kind of major slowdown of our sales activities or pushback from clients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Maybe just specific to Market Intelligence and the Desktop side. Can you just help us understand the accounting issue, I guess, that will help reaccelerate the growth? And then just thinking out a little bit longer in there, how do you expect the trajectory of the growth there to play? Because I mean, similar to yourselves, I imagine the sell side and other customers will be tightening budgets as well.\nEwout Steenbergen : Good morning, Manav. We recognized that the third quarter revenue growth of the Desktop was below our normal growth potential. But you have to look at it from a particular perspective that there is always some timing of revenue recognition of certain contracts. That was particularly impacting this quarter, but we expect the Desktop growth to normalize again in the fourth quarter. Also for Market Intelligence, in general, if you take out the volume effect of the capital markets business, and also FX, then the overall growth for the full quarter was north of 7%, and we believe that's more indicative of the normal growth opportunity for Market Intelligence as well.\nManav Patnaik : Okay. Got it. And then can I just ask on the non-transaction side of the Ratings business? It's obviously down 2%, I think you said ex FX. But how long will that keep, I guess, slowly declining? Like when do we lap the Ratings evaluation services, tough comps or whatever it is that's driving that down?\nEwout Steenbergen : Well, Manav, that is directly correlated with the overall economic environment, capital markets activity, debt issuance, M&A environment. And we have, of course, seen that the beginning of this year was still relatively strong, and it started to deteriorate somewhere from March onwards. Non-transaction revenue is usually quite stable as a revenue stream. We have two particular areas that are mostly sensitive for the more general macro environment. This is initial credit ratings. We don't see a lot of new issuers coming to the market. And then rating evaluation services, this has a correlation with the M&A market. These are issuers that are thinking about IPOs, spin-offs and so on, want to have some kind of an insight in terms of implications for their ratings. So obviously, those are revenue streams that will come back once the markets start to turn. The more stable elements in non-transaction are around surveillance, around frequent issuer programs. And then most notably, I want to point out that CRISIL is doing very well and is supporting the non-transaction revenue in that category.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird.\nJeffrey Meuler : I hear you that there's some inherent hedges in the Mobility business, but I think the used car business is a decent amount larger than the new car market for you. So if the market, I guess, shifts back from a mix perspective and some of the profit pools for use target hit, I'm just wondering if there's a net benefit or a net detriment to you? And I recognize CARFAX has good structural growth, historically resilient. So could you just give us any more detail on what product lines the competitive wins and new customer growth was coming in or any more detail on CARFAX's innovation that's driving the growth, given that the core report is fairly well penetrated.\nEwout Steenbergen : Jeff, you're absolutely right that the used car market is a significant component of the overall revenue stream for the Mobility business. And the good news there is that it has been a very resilient market through the cycles. So we're not overly concerned about if the cycle in the car market start to turn that it will have a material impact. And as I mentioned before, we have other revenue streams actually that we expect to pick up if the equilibrium in the car market start to change, particularly about our sales and marketing products where we have seen relatively lower growth in the more recent past. The mobility business in general is a phenomenal business. There's a lot of innovation, a lot of new product developments, a lot of good support for our customers. CARFAX is really a gem from my perspective in terms of growth and in terms of innovation and new business activity, very close to the customers, a lot of new business launches and new product launches. So I think this business is in a very good position, and we would expect -- also if the car markets start to turn and go in a different direction, that we see continued good performance from this segment.\nJeffrey Meuler : Okay. And then, Doug, you answered the deleveraging question. Can you also give us the historical view of like how much issuance was there in a falling rate environment of bonds being issued that was refinancing debt that wasn't coming due the next, say, three, four years but bonds that had significant duration remaining on them where there was issuance to get the interest expense savings from a falling rate environment. Just I guess on the theoretical that we might not have that type of activity for a while, if you could help me understand roughly if that was meaningful in the past or not?\nDouglas Peterson : Yes. Basically, this is a question about pull forward. And we saw in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic, there was what we felt now was structural pull forward. It was a combination of low rates, but probably more importantly, if you are a CFO of any organization, you were not being criticized for having ample liquidity during what people didn't understand was the pandemic as we went into it.  So we did see a lot of structural pull forward during that period. But historically, I think the treasurers and CFOs of organizations are quite thoughtful and looking at their overall funding strategies. And so the funding is not -- when people look at their balance sheet, it's not only just looking at what they have on what their costs are. But the opportunities that organizations have now are much more complex than they used to be. Securitizations, looking at how they're going to use a maturity transformation, what they do in terms of derivatives. So yes, we do see the balance sheets. We do see that there was pull forward into '20 and 2021, but we know the maturities are coming now. And we think that the sort of tools that corporations have to -- and banks have to manage their risk and their liquidity have really changed a lot in the last 10 or 15 years.  So it's hard to go back and compare to history, but we do know what happened in the last few years, where we did see pull forward, but the upcoming maturity schedule, which starts in the second half of 2023 going forward, in a sense it's kind of what was all the issuance that came after the financial crisis, in 2013, '14, '15. Just think about that huge boom of issuance that took place, that's going to start maturing next year. It was a seven-year, 10-year paper. We see a lot of that will start maturing and that -- we know that, that's going to be in the queue very soon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy : First, I just wanted to ask about the commodity business. You mentioned climate transition. So it sounds like there are some underlying drivers that are sustainable. I'm curious if you could talk about the cyclical aspects of the business and maybe areas where you're running into tougher comps. And just how sustainable you think the overall growth rate is there?\nEwout Steenbergen : Yes. Let me start with giving you an overall perspective on the Commodity Insights business and how it's doing in the current environment, and then I hand it over to Doug more for the energy transition and climate part. So if you look at the overall macro environment, it's very supportive for the Commodity Insight business at this moment. Definitely, where commodity prices are today is benefiting most of our customers. And therefore, we're seeing also, I would say, based on the very attractive proposition of the combined businesses that we have now brought together under the Commodity Insights segment. We're delivering a lot of new opportunities to our customers. And therefore, we have seen really one of the best sales momentums in this business. If I look at actual sales levels, this will probably one of the very best years for the last maybe a decade or so. So very positive trends that we're seeing that is helping Data & Insights that is helping price assessments.  The Global Trading Services business was a little lower this quarter. The main reason there is that we're lapping more difficult comps. But generally, we also see elevated hedging activity on commodity prices, and we're also benefiting from that as well. And then if you look at the upstream business, there, we have seen a turnaround. That was a business that for many years was in a more difficult period. But clearly, our customers are healthier there as well. We see larger CapEx budgets for those customers, and that is helping that business to grow. And we said in our prepared remarks that if you take out the effect of Russia, on a constant currency basis, actually the subscription book of business in the upstream business was growing during the quarter. So overall, very favorable macro environment for Commodity Insights, and that is clearly helping the business this quarter and also in the next couple of quarters.\nDouglas Peterson : Ewout, I just want to add two points. The first is that all of us know that energy transition is on everyone's mind, whether it's a corporation or government, regulator, financial institution. And as I mentioned earlier, almost every conversation we have talks about this. And where else do you want to go to find about -- learn about energy and energy transition? It's commodity insights of S&P Global. We have the expertise. We have the experts that can talk about current markets, transition markets, and we're finding an incredible amount of engagement. We have conferences. It's one of the areas that Commodity Insights excels at. And we see very high demand for people to participate in those conferences and we're now back in person and the attendance is above the charts. But the second point I want to make is that we're launching new products all the time. Just in the last quarter, we launched some new products that were related to energy transition and new ways to find information about markets. As an example, there's -- in the tanker market, we talked earlier in my -- we had one of our points on our slide showed the low-sulfur fuel oil market, which we -- I remember on an earnings call about three years ago talking about when we launched that and now it's become a benchmark in the market. But in addition, there's things like the carbon accounted tanker rate price assessments, there's interest around the world for understanding freight emissions and what would be under the EU emissions trading system. You're going to need to have much more information for every single tanker and what is its carbon output, and we will have a product for that. As an example, there's a whole information that's needed in Brazil and India and Turkey on energy certificates in emerging markets.  And then finally, we have some examples. Recently, as you know, in the United States, there was the new climate bill, which was issued by the United States, by the Congress. And we've done very special research which is really industry-leading about the clean energy procurement and what that's going to mean for industry. So when it comes to energy and energy transition, we’re the place you want to go.\nFaiza Alwy : Great. That's all very helpful. Just as a follow-up. Ewout, on Market Intelligence. I think you had you had -- the margin performance was really strong. And I'm curious if -- is that the area where you're maybe getting the most synergies? Or just give us a little bit more color on the margin performance, whether it's mix related? And how we should think about that going forward..\nEwout Steenbergen : Faiza, yes, we're seeing the largest benefit from cost synergies and revenue synergies in the Market Intelligence division. That's because it's the largest division. It's also the largest combination of different businesses that we're bringing together. And also based on the size of that division, it will also benefit, of course, from a large part of the synergies that we're realizing in the corporate center and the allocation of those costs down to the divisions. What you see is, in general, that we continue to invest in Market Intelligence for future growth. So you see new product launches continuing strategic investments in new areas and initiatives. That was already touching on private credit, private markets, ESG investments we're having there as well. We're having expansion still continuing in China, in the marketplace and many different areas that we are continuing to invest as well as cloud expenses. We're also continuing on our cloud journey and Market Intelligence is continuing to invest there as well. But then the opposite factors, there are some of the expense reductions, the expense discipline and the synergies and the combination of all of that led to the significant margin expansion in Market Intelligence.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.\nHans Hoffman : This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Stephanie. Could you just comment a bit on what you're seeing across your European revenue base and how that region did relative to your expectations either by segment or overall?\nEwout Steenbergen : Yes, overall, not so much of a different trend we are seeing in Europe compared to other parts of the world. I understand the background of the question because definitely, the economic outlook in Europe is, of course, quite difficult given the inflation levels, given, of course, the close proximity to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But overall, from a customer dynamics perspective, overall in terms of commercial activity, we're not seeing a significant difference compared to North America or Asia.\nHans Hoffman : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the revenue synergy side, I guess where have you seen the most success so far and then sort of where do you kind of see the most opportunity?\nEwout Steenbergen : Yes. Most success so far, we see in our largest divisions that we're bringing together, Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights in the Index business. It's mostly cross-sell at this moment, which was as expected because cross sell is the introduction of one product group to existing customers and making sure that we can sell new activities there. For example, in Market Intelligence, we had a nice sale of KYC, KY3P product to an existing customer that was more a customer from the legacy S&P Global side where we could sell a product from the legacy IHS Markit side. So just as an example, so we see -- continue to see good cross-sell. At the same time, we're investing in new product development, in system development that will help them with that growth wave going forward. So it's still early, I have to say around revenue synergies, but we are clearly ahead compared to our original expectations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Russell Quelch from Redburn.\nRussell Quelch : I just wanted to talk about capital allocation priorities. You still got about $2 billion on cash on the balance sheet and you're on course to generate around $5 billion of free cash flow in '23, I believe consensus. Just wondered where you look to do further M&A? Or do you have enough integrations on your hand such that you can look to return perhaps north of 100% of free cash flow again in '23?\nEwout Steenbergen : Overall, no change with respect to our capital philosophy, capital management targets. We think consistency and reliability there is the most important, particularly in this environment. You have seen us continuing with the $12 billion ASR, even despite that we have seen some impact of the current environment on the rating issuance levels we are able to execute on our plans this year. And you may expect the same from us over the next couple of years. So at least 85% of return of capital to our shareholders, a combination of dividends and share buybacks, dividend payout ratio between 20% and 30%. And M&A, the focus is really on small tuck-in and bolt-on, where we see that we can add a nice capability to some of our core strategic focus areas, but nothing large because we first, of course, need to focus on the integration of the large merger and organically building out our businesses. So no changes at all, and we think that is actually the right approach.\nRussell Quelch : Okay. And then just one housekeeping question, I guess. Given the earlier comment on being able to achieve the lower-than-average rates due to the refinancing of the IHS debt, what's the level of interest that was delivered in Q3, now the right quarterly rate to assume going forward?\nEwout Steenbergen : Yes. This is the new run rate with respect to the interest expense on our debt. We were very fortunate with hindsight that we refinanced a large part of the debt at the beginning of March when the 10-year U.S. Treasury was around 1.73 at that point in time. So we are very happy that we locked ourselves in with long-term debt at very low levels. And actually, if you look at the average cost of debt for any player in our industry, we're at one of the lowest levels. So yes, this is the normalized level. If you look, though, at the interest expense line, there's one point that I want to make, it's a net number. So we're generating more interest income on our cash balances. So that is helping us a little bit and obviously, that might fluctuate over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum : Ewout, I just wanted to ask you a little bit about your labor cost trends. Obviously, it's a significant component of costs. Everyone in the industry has been dealing with the rising labor costs given what's going on in the market. What's your outlook for that? And do you see that kind of letting up in terms of just how we should think about the costs of the business on a go-forward basis, let's say, over the next six to 12 months?\nEwout Steenbergen: Shlomo, obviously, we are exposed as everyone else, to increases from an overall labor market perspective and comp expectations, and we need to stay competitive in order to attract and retain the best talent. So let me expand a little bit on that answer. So about 60% of our overall expense base is people cost. And obviously, we have people across the whole world in many different job groups and categories. It's not a one-size-fits-all. We see more competitive situations in certain markets and jurisdictions. We see it more in certain job groups. And we are continuously making sure that we stay competitive from an overall comp perspective. And we will continue to do that. So we're definitely expecting to see also some of the changes over the next period flowing through our P&L. But at the same time, we are also taking advantage of a lot of levers that we are having and maybe levers that are given to us through the merger.  So we have, of course, the opportunity to realize cost synergies and reduction of headcount is an element to that. So that goes in an opposite direction as well as synergies, cost synergies around real estate, around procurement. And then as you see this year, given the performance of the company, also incentive compensation costs are down and we gave you the overall impact of around $120 million to $140 million. So it is a bit of a mix. On the one hand, staying competitive from a labor market perspective; but on the other hand, using a lot of levers in order to offset the overall impact on our expense line and on our margins.\nShlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. And then I just want to ask a little bit more about trying to figure out how far we are from the bottom, just in terms of the Ratings revenue. Doug, you talked about refunding laws becoming more meaningful in the middle of next year. if you take the revenue that you would expect from those refunding walls together with your subscription revenue, that you're getting, say, this year. How far away are you from, let's say, 2022 revenue that you're expecting? In other words, how much further downward you really have to go just to kind of hit that number?\nDouglas Peterson : Shlomo, we're not really trying to call a bottom or a top to the market. We are also not providing any guidance or outlook for 2023 at this time. As I mentioned, we've been very engaged with the markets with issuers and investors. We're also -- we have world-class economists and experts that are providing us with input. So we're looking at all of that, what you just discussed, but we're -- there's no -- we have no ability to actually call a bottom.\nOperator: We will now take our final question from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Referring to Slide 38, I just wanted to talk about implied Rating margins for the fourth quarter. To get to that mid-50s rating margin for the full year, my math says it's about 49% Ratings margins for the fourth quarter. Ewout, if you could just please confirm that? And then just help us appreciate the 49% because that's a notable step down from third quarter Ratings margins. Please comment about seasonality or any other factors we would need to understand fourth quarter Ratings margins on Slide 38.\nEwout Steenbergen : Andrew, as you understand, we're not giving quarterly guidance, so I can't give you numbers by quarter by segment margins. But what we are, of course, trying to do is if we give you a full year picture, we give you a full year outlook, then of course you can backwards calculate what is the expectation for the quarter itself. I do want to point out that the third quarter in general is the lowest quarter for us from an expense perspective. That is due to seasonality. The fourth quarter is higher. But you have seen that in previous years as well. So from a trend perspective, there's nothing different than what you -- that you should have seen in the past. But sequentially, you should expect expenses to roll out. Again, that is normal seasonality.\nDouglas Peterson: Well, that was the last question. So I'd like to make a quick closing comment. So first of all, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today for your questions and your support. But I'm really pleased with the progress we've made since closing the merger. It's only been 8 months. And we've been able to unify our management team under a strong vision and set of purposes and values. We see strong commercial success. You heard about it on this call, our cross-sell and our product innovation, and we're ahead of schedule to achieve our cost synergies. And all of that in a challenging macroeconomic backdrop where we discuss some of those topics today.  But we also have very important secular trends that are creating opportunities for S&P Global: the energy transition, the continued interest in climate and sustainability, the need for analytics and insights in very turbulent markets. So we're very pleased with our progress, and I'm excited that we'll be able to share more with you on our strategic vision and our multiyear targets at our Investor Day on December 1. But let me end by thanking again our people who are absolutely fantastic, they're world-class. And I want to thank all of you again for joining us on this call today. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&P Global's website for one year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month. On behalf of S&P Global, we thank you for participating, and wish you a good day.",

            "name": "Douglas Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. We're pleased to discuss our third quarter results and how we're growing, innovating and executing with discipline even in the face of a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. With each quarter that passes, we see further evidence of the strength of our combined company. While no one could have predicted what this year would have looked like, we have benefited from the diversification of our revenue and profit streams and that ballast has provided great resilience as we continue to navigate choppy waters. . It's been nearly two years since we announced the merger, and I'm proud of the progress we've made. We continue to put the customer at the core of everything we do and we continue to demonstrate a clear commitment to our people while maintaining a high standard of operational excellence. We have an incredibly bright future, and I'm excited to share more with you about our strategic vision at our Investor Day on December 1. As we look at our third quarter financial highlights, I want to remind you that the adjusted financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period. Revenue decreased 8% year-over-year or 6% ex FX, with growth in four of our six divisions being offset by continued decreases in Ratings, as well as a year-over-year decline in Engineering Solutions this quarter due to the timing impact of a single product that Ewout will discuss later. Recurring revenue increased 2% year-over-year, representing 84% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses declined 5% year-over-year as cost synergies and disciplined expense management offset some of the inflationary impact we're seeing in labor and technology. Outside of the Ratings business, we saw an average of approximately 250 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. We're updating our guidance ranges to reflect continued headwinds in Ratings as well as better-than-expected performance in Indices. Guidance ranges for our other four divisions are unchanged from last quarter. I'd also like to share a few other highlights from the third quarter. As I mentioned, we're coming up on two years since the merger was announced and nearly eight months since the close. Our post-merger integration efforts are proceeding on track, but very importantly, we're outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Our customer conversations remain encouraging despite the economic environment. We continue to see significant growth in multiple business lines due to secular trends that will likely benefit us for years to come, like energy transition as well as the near-term benefit we see from volatility and the need for insights and analytics in times of turbulence. We also remain committed to the capital allocation plan we laid out for you at the time the merger closed. We're on track to deploy the full $12 billion in funds for accelerated share repurchases by year-end.  Turning to the commercial success we're seeing in the business. The merger continues to generate encouraging conversations with our customers about the increased value we offer as a combined company. In Market Intelligence, we developed a strong commercial pipeline in September, and we believe we will see a reacceleration of the Desktop business in the fourth quarter. Between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we've generated well over 3,000 cross-sell referrals since the merger closed, and the conversion rates are strong. Despite the issuance environment, our Ratings teams remain highly engaged. We remain connected with investors and issuers to maintain relationships and ensure we have the appropriate understanding of their needs in advance of any recovery in the debt markets. Commodity Insights and Mobility are both seeing significantly improved retention rates relative to recent history as well as strong competitive wins and new customer growth. We saw a very important win in our Indices business this quarter as a large Japanese asset manager launched the first cross-asset ETF in Japan based on both iBoxx Fixed Income and S&P Dow Jones Equity Indices. While it's still early in our efforts in cross-asset indices, this launch is powerful proof of the demand for such products among global asset managers. Now to recap the financial results for the third quarter. Revenue decreased 8% to $2.86 billion or 6% constant currency. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 12% to $1.3 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 46% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in Ratings transaction revenue, partially offset by cost synergies realized in the quarter. Our non-Ratings businesses in aggregate grew revenue 4% in the quarter compared to prior year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which was 45.5% as of the third quarter. Despite the impact of the issuance environment, we benefited from the resiliency of our businesses as well as disciplined cost management and cost synergies to significantly moderate the impact to our adjusted EPS, which declined only 4% year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I'm pleased to report positive growth across four of our divisions, with Ratings continuing to work through a difficult issuance cycle and Engineering Solutions entering an off-cycle quarter without the sale of a core product that is released once every two years. Throughout the year, we've seen outsized growth in certain products as customers depend on our data and information to make informed decisions during uncertain times. We saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result. Within our Indices business, revenue from exchange-traded derivatives outperformed our internal expectations, growing nearly 40% year-over-year. Our CDS Indices, which include the CDX and iTraxx index families, increased 66%. Markets continue to recognize our leadership in areas like climate and financial data, and we provide a consolidated platform on which to access information, whether it's tracking market movements, company performance or identifying physical risk from weather events, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating the uncertainty. This is evident in the growth we saw in key product offerings for Market Intelligence, including Trucost and Equities, Data and Analytics. I'm pleased to mark the first anniversary of the launch of Platts Dimensions Pro, a one-stop experience across Platts benchmark price assessments; news and analytics spanning 13 commodities, including energy transition. Over the last year, we've continuously increased functionality, introducing new features on a regular basis. This unified platform is gaining clear recognition with active user growth nearly doubling in just the last six months. Moreover, some of our newer benchmarks continue to expand their market presence, our low-sulfur marine fuel assessment is a great indicator of the trajectory of a successful new benchmark. Assessments like this often take multiple years to truly scale and become literal market benchmarks. In the third quarter, approximately 1.3 billion barrels of fuel were traded based on price assessment, representing a 15% increase compared to last year. Our iron ore assessment has been the primary physical market pricing reference for seaborne fine iron ore delivered to China for over 10 years, and it's still growing at an impressive rate. We understand the importance of reliable market benchmarks to the secular energy transition story, and we're positioning ourselves for long-term success. The chart on the right shows the cumulative number of new assessments we have launched and energy transition over the last two years. These include a new suite of Australian hydrogen prices covering one of the key producers of this future fuel as well as the Methane Performance Certificate that we believe will be an integral component of low-carbon crude trading. Now turning to issuance. During the third quarter, global-rated issuance decreased 40% year-over-year; in the U.S., rated issuance in aggregate decreased 47%; European-rated issuance decreased 19%; and in Asia, rated issuance declined 47%. High yield was down by 80% year-over-year in both United States and Europe and was down nearly 100% in Asia. Structured finance in Europe was the only positive regional category in the quarter, increasing 7% year-over-year. We've included additional details on the subcomponents of issuance by region in the slide deck.  We continue to make significant progress in our sustainability products. ESG revenue increased nearly 40% year-over-year to nearly $50 million in the quarter. We saw continued innovation in our ESG indices and the market recognition of our strength. We launched the S&P Net Zero 2050 Carbon Budget Indices, and we ended the quarter with ESG ETF AUM of $35 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year in a down market. Within Market Intelligence, we launched enhanced Physical Risk Exposure Scores and Financial Impact data sets to support clients as they seek to understand and manage the physical and financial exposure to climate change. Our Ratings division continues to see success here as well, completing 13 ESG evaluations and 23 Sustainable Financing Opinions in the quarter. One of the most important competitive advantages in our ESG efforts is the Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is an annual comprehensive assessment completed in partnership with participating companies. The S&P Global brand and everything it stands for continues to drive growth in the number of companies seeking to partner with us in this assessment process. Year-to-date, we've seen more than 2,300 companies opt in, a more than 25% increase from the same time last year. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. Beginning with our issuance forecast. Our Ratings research team is expecting an approximately 19% decline in global market issuance, including both rated and unrated issuance for the full year. This compares to the previous forecast of down 16%. Importantly, our financial results and guidance are more closely tied to billed issuance, which can differ materially from market issuance as we described last quarter. Year-to-date, market issuances declined approximately 14%, while billed issuances declined approximately 42%. Based on the trends we saw in September and October, we now expect billed issuance to be down approximately 45% to 50% for the full year. When we look to the broader macroeconomic environment for the rest of 2022, we continue to see further deterioration from what we expected in August. In addition to the downward trend in issuance, our expectations for GDP growth, inflation and the commodities markets have all lowered. With only two months left in 2022, we wanted to provide what will likely be the final update on some of the macroeconomic indicators we're using to help inform our financial guidance for the year. We'll not be discussing our expectations for 2023 on this call, but we will be closely monitoring both the internal and external indicators of our business over the coming months. And we'll plan to provide our initial 2023 outlook at the customary time when we report our fourth quarter results early next year. Before I turn the call over to Ewout, I want to thank the incredible people we have at S&P Global. Our people have executed well in a challenging environment this year and have delivered great value for our customers and the organization while managing a complex integration. I'm confident that we're well positioned to drive long-term growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ewout to walk through financials and guidance. Ewout? Hi, Owen, this is Doug, and thanks for joining us today. Let me start, first of all, by mentioning that within Market Intelligence, Credit and Risk Solutions has always been a long-term outperformer. It's an area that we see very high demand from the markets for information about credit risk and other types of risk, especially in this market. As you know, the core products in this area are the basic products that are providing information from the Ratings business. So things like RatingsDirect, RatingsXpress. We also have a suite of products like Credit Analytics. And we do see a lot of growth now related to credit climate analytics. This is an area where we're seeing increased interest and demand, especially from financial institutions, especially large global banks.  In addition, we're seeing some other growth from areas like traded market risks some names of, I'll say, ex VA, CCR. We have a VAR product, et cetera. And then we have some additional buy-side risk opportunities for clients to look at for market risk and stress scenarios. So if you look at the entire suite of products, we're able to provide the market information at the time when they really want to understand risk. Yes. Thanks. On the private markets, as we saw earlier this year, there was a retreat of institutional investors and retail investors from credit funds. So there was really no liquidity at the beginning part of this year. It was a combination of people that were risk averse and also looking at the shift between fixed and floating. There were a lot of moves in interest rates. So we saw a retreat from the traditional loan funds and high-risk investors that left the markets. That left an opportunity for the private credit funds that had traditionally been focusing on mid-market credit. So SME credit was their expertise. Many of them also had started moving into the higher quality, higher level of risk and large-cap companies. So they were there to fill the gap. The gap was filled by private credit at the beginning of the year. And we know that they've also been able to take on loans with a faster, also with a higher risk level. And so we've seen that increase during the year. Now how do we think about that? First of all, we look at that as an opportunity for us going forward. We believe that the private credit funds will be looking over time to have some sort of risk transformation, whether it's related to fixed floating or it has to do with securitization or syndication. We think at that time, they're going to be wanting some Estimate services, potentially Rating services. In addition, we've identified private credit as one of our most important strategic growth drivers. We already have a base of private credit businesses that were part of IHS Markit. And related to that, we have a strong starting point with products like iLEVEL provides information to portfolio managers. So we've identified private credit is a growth area for us for ratings as well as for Market Intelligence going forward. And we're watching the trend very carefully. We know at some point, investors will come back to the markets, and we'll see a broadening of the market again. But we've been watching this very closely and are actually interested in this as a growth area for us. Yes, Ashish, thank you for your questions. When it comes to Mobility, we see that there's a very interesting shift going on over the last couple of years. As you know, when the market started slowing down from the pandemic and the supply chain interruptions, we saw the used auto market really start expanding and we benefited from the CARFAX products and the CARFAX suite of products, especially at the dealer level. We know that there's some counter-cyclicality as you say, it as the market returns to new autos coming into the market and inventories rise that we will benefit from products and services to the OEMs and as well as the dealers are going to start having a different type of relationship again with the manufacturers and suppliers.  So we're watching right now very closely three big trends in the automotive market: what's happening with the used car market where we have a strong position, what's happening with the OEMs and the supply chain for the new automobiles. They've been in historic lows over the last two years. So we expect that's going to start going up. And then there's also a transformation taking place in the industry as more and more vehicles start to become electric based with the drivetrain as opposed to internal combustion. So a lot of trends, which are all play to our advantage because we have data analytics and research products that we can serve all of the users in these markets. Yes. Thanks, Alex. As you say, we produce a report. And what we're looking at right now is, understanding what are going to be the main factors driving us towards the end of the year. We've given you those in that report as well. That showed that issuance was expected to be down by 19% for the full year, which compared to 16% from our last report. As you know, we will wait to provide guidance for 2023 until February when we provide our full issuance report as well as our guidance for the year. What you saw from the report from our team, our credit research team is product research and it's not necessarily geared directly to how we're going to find billed issuance. As you recall, last quarter, we explained very clearly what is included in billed issuance. We take the -- what would be expectations for issuance overall. We add in leveraged loans. And then we extract some debt areas like unrated categories such as MTNs, most of the domestic debt from China. And we also exclude the international public finance from those calculations to come up with our expectations. But maybe more importantly to your question, we're always in the market.  As you saw, we talked about having had 3,000 interactions with the markets during the quarter. We are all over the market to understand what are the factors that are going on that are driving issuance and will drive issuance. So we do provide our guidance going forward. But we're looking at the issuance forecast, GDP growth, macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates. We're looking at spreads, which have been quite high over the last few quarters. Maturity schedules, which are quite encouraging going forward into 2023, '24, '25, et cetera, M&A pipeline. So as you know, at the time we come out with our guidance, we will have looked at all of these factors. But maybe the most important point is that we're not just standing around and waiting. We're very actively engaged with the markets. Yes, Alex, it's very, very early for us to talk about it. But what I'll tell you is going back to the last comment I made that we're incredibly linked into the markets right now. We have all of our commercial teams are out speaking with our customers. What we're finding is that there's a lot of opportunities for us to start with cross-sell. So our initial early wins have been with cross-sell, selling different products within the divisions and sometimes across the divisions. But we are hearing opportunities for moving data into the Desktop, finding some products for data and research and analytics fit together. So to your point, it's a vision that we have, but it's really early for us to give you any kind of detailed analytics about it. Yes. Toni, thanks for that question. And as you know, the markets are going through a lot of uncertainty and turmoil. We've never lived through a period where you have an end of a pandemic, a war, inflation, interest rates going up, all sorts of different impacts. I mentioned earlier on the mobility discussion what kind of impact that's had on the markets overall. We've seen this interest in talking about risk. It's a topic which has increased dramatically. When we meet with customers, they want to talk about the external environment. They want the expertise of S&P Global that comes from our entire company to understand what's happening with risk, with markets, with credit as well as equities, commodities. So we start with very broad dialogues. And then we dig deeper into some specific topics. One that comes up in almost every single conversation we have is energy transition, climate and sustainability. That's a really common discussion. It's increasing in terms of how much time we spend on it.  And another one is Data and Analytics. How are customers thinking about their own application of AI, Data and Analytics? They want to learn from us how we're managing S&P Global, but they also want to learn how they can be deploying new types of products and services using more AI. But overall, we have not seen any kind of initial pushback on slowing down a sales cycle. Clearly, there are some markets, as I mentioned, the ratings market, there's not a lot of issuance right now, but we've stayed engaged with the market. But maybe net-net, the big topics we spent a lot of time on the macroeconomic environment, sustainability as well as AI and data. Those are big conversations we have in almost every customer interaction. There's a few things that I'm focusing on myself, and I know that if we had our Ratings team specifically on the call, they might tell me that there's others that are looking at beyond that. But clearly, there's a set of factors, M&A activity is one for me, which is -- it's kind of an informal indicator. M&A activity has been quite weak recently. Typical M&A has a set of transactions come along with it, may be a bridge loan, which turns into a deal loan, which turns into a bond or rated loan, et cetera. M&A activity has been weak. IPOs is another one. The reason I look at those myself is that those are just their activity, which denotes confidence in the markets that people are willing to invest. But then as you recall, we're having conversations with issuers. We mentioned 3,000 that we had last quarter with issuers. And we see a lot of interest in investing people that have plans for investing in new markets for innovation, for investing in venture capital, ways that they can see new shoots in their own businesses. So we're watching when is it that people actually pull the trigger. And maybe the takeaway is it's not, if it's when. We know that there's a lot of people out there that are ready to go. They have great ideas, but the question is when will those conditions of interest rates, of stability of market confidence, when will those be back when people start going back to the market.  Finally, we do look at the maturity schedules, and we know that there's a point starting towards the middle of next year that there will be maturity schedules are going to start kicking in and we're going to watch that carefully as well. We'll there be pull forward from that, but that's another factor we're going to be watching. Yes. First of all, let me just give a little bit more color on that. As you know, at the last forecast, we saw that issuance of the non-financials or Corporates would be down about 30%. We now see it down about 35%. And then we see that in Financial Services, they had expected to be down 10%, now down about 14% or so. When you look at the total billed issuance, and we mentioned that it was going to -- year-to-date was down 42% and we're expecting it to be down now 45%, this is going to be based on what we see in the pipeline.  As I mentioned in the answer I gave a few minutes ago, we see that the market itself is quite hesitant. It's not a question of, if, it's a question of when. And we see that during the fourth quarter, what we've picked up from investment banks from issuers directly that right now, they're still waiting to see what the conditions are going to be around economic growth, interest rates and spreads. So it's just based on our forecast, not our issuance forecast. This is based on our market forecast based on people that are meeting with issuers and meeting with investors that the current conditions are still such that people are holding back before they go to market. Yes, that's a theoretical question, but let me go back and look at history. I know that many of us have been in the market for many years, remember when interest rates were 4%; 3%, 4%, 5% base rates and the markets were incredibly active. I think that we'll settle into a range once there's stability and we understand what the longer-term rates are going to be, what longer-term inflation and growth are going to be. Companies and financial institutions will go back to the markets because they want to invest and grow. We know that organizations like to grow and to grow, you deploy capital. We also look at the trend around the globe where more and more markets are shifting from being banking markets to capital markets.  Right now, in Europe, there's a couple of shifts going on in the support programs that the ECB was providing to the banks. This was very easy, very low-cost funding. They're starting to wean the banks off of those, and they're going to the capital markets to raise more capital as well as to deploy more capital into bonds instead of into loans. So we see this trend of capital marketization around the globe, and we think that's another trend in the long run that will drive a lot of positive tailwinds for the Ratings business. Yes. We still feel very, very positive, and we're optimistic about the Market Intelligence pipeline. You read every one so about some of the financial institutions here and there that might be slowing down some of their growth, but we're not seeing that in terms of negotiations with clients. But very importantly, one of the propositions of the merger between IHS Markit and S&P Global was to cross-sell the excellent products from both groups to the client bases on the other. We believe that we have a strong diversification of our client base. And as an example, in the IHS Markit businesses, their financial services business was mostly focused on financial services. We're finding that a lot of the opportunities and a lot of our initial cross-sell has been selling IHS Markit products to corporate clients. We think that there is a lot of upside and a lot of opportunity. We are out in the market actively talking with our customers about ways we can bring value through new products, new services through data, et cetera. So right now, we're not seeing any pullback or any kind of major slowdown of our sales activities or pushback from clients. Yes. Basically, this is a question about pull forward. And we saw in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic, there was what we felt now was structural pull forward. It was a combination of low rates, but probably more importantly, if you are a CFO of any organization, you were not being criticized for having ample liquidity during what people didn't understand was the pandemic as we went into it.  So we did see a lot of structural pull forward during that period. But historically, I think the treasurers and CFOs of organizations are quite thoughtful and looking at their overall funding strategies. And so the funding is not -- when people look at their balance sheet, it's not only just looking at what they have on what their costs are. But the opportunities that organizations have now are much more complex than they used to be. Securitizations, looking at how they're going to use a maturity transformation, what they do in terms of derivatives. So yes, we do see the balance sheets. We do see that there was pull forward into '20 and 2021, but we know the maturities are coming now. And we think that the sort of tools that corporations have to -- and banks have to manage their risk and their liquidity have really changed a lot in the last 10 or 15 years.  So it's hard to go back and compare to history, but we do know what happened in the last few years, where we did see pull forward, but the upcoming maturity schedule, which starts in the second half of 2023 going forward, in a sense it's kind of what was all the issuance that came after the financial crisis, in 2013, '14, '15. Just think about that huge boom of issuance that took place, that's going to start maturing next year. It was a seven-year, 10-year paper. We see a lot of that will start maturing and that -- we know that, that's going to be in the queue very soon. Ewout, I just want to add two points. The first is that all of us know that energy transition is on everyone's mind, whether it's a corporation or government, regulator, financial institution. And as I mentioned earlier, almost every conversation we have talks about this. And where else do you want to go to find about -- learn about energy and energy transition? It's commodity insights of S&P Global. We have the expertise. We have the experts that can talk about current markets, transition markets, and we're finding an incredible amount of engagement. We have conferences. It's one of the areas that Commodity Insights excels at. And we see very high demand for people to participate in those conferences and we're now back in person and the attendance is above the charts. But the second point I want to make is that we're launching new products all the time. Just in the last quarter, we launched some new products that were related to energy transition and new ways to find information about markets. As an example, there's -- in the tanker market, we talked earlier in my -- we had one of our points on our slide showed the low-sulfur fuel oil market, which we -- I remember on an earnings call about three years ago talking about when we launched that and now it's become a benchmark in the market. But in addition, there's things like the carbon accounted tanker rate price assessments, there's interest around the world for understanding freight emissions and what would be under the EU emissions trading system. You're going to need to have much more information for every single tanker and what is its carbon output, and we will have a product for that. As an example, there's a whole information that's needed in Brazil and India and Turkey on energy certificates in emerging markets.  And then finally, we have some examples. Recently, as you know, in the United States, there was the new climate bill, which was issued by the United States, by the Congress. And we've done very special research which is really industry-leading about the clean energy procurement and what that's going to mean for industry. So when it comes to energy and energy transition, we're the place you want to go. Shlomo, we're not really trying to call a bottom or a top to the market. We are also not providing any guidance or outlook for 2023 at this time. As I mentioned, we've been very engaged with the markets with issuers and investors. We're also -- we have world-class economists and experts that are providing us with input. So we're looking at all of that, what you just discussed, but we're -- there's no -- we have no ability to actually call a bottom. Well, that was the last question. So I'd like to make a quick closing comment. So first of all, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today for your questions and your support. But I'm really pleased with the progress we've made since closing the merger. It's only been 8 months. And we've been able to unify our management team under a strong vision and set of purposes and values. We see strong commercial success. You heard about it on this call, our cross-sell and our product innovation, and we're ahead of schedule to achieve our cost synergies. And all of that in a challenging macroeconomic backdrop where we discuss some of those topics today.  But we also have very important secular trends that are creating opportunities for S&P Global: the energy transition, the continued interest in climate and sustainability, the need for analytics and insights in very turbulent markets. So we're very pleased with our progress, and I'm excited that we'll be able to share more with you on our strategic vision and our multiyear targets at our Investor Day on December 1. But let me end by thanking again our people who are absolutely fantastic, they're world-class. And I want to thank all of you again for joining us on this call today. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. Doug has already discussed the headline financial results, and I would like to cover a few other items. As Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods. Adjusted corporate unallocated expenses improved from a year ago, driven by a combination of synergies and reduced incentive costs. Our net interest expense decreased 17% as we benefit from lower average rates due to refinancings following the merger. Adjusted effective tax rate was up modestly, but towards the low end of the guidance range we expect for the full year. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the third quarter were approximately $108 million in merger-related expenses. The details of which can be found in the appendix. We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, of $965 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have deployed $11 billion towards share repurchases, and we expect the final $1 billion of our previously announced ASR program to be completed by year-end. We note that the U.S. dollar remained strong against many foreign currencies, and we've seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. As a reminder, approximately 3/4 of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have a hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings. For the third quarter, we saw a $0.03 favorable impact to EPS from foreign exchange and hedging programs. Turning to expenses. We are committed to disciplined expense management in this current environment. And similar to last quarter, we highlight the levers we continue to pull to protect margins where we can while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include pull forward in synergies, a reduction in incentive accruals, adjustments to the timing of certain investments and pausing select hiring and limiting consulting spend in some areas. Through cost synergies and other management actions we have taken so far this year, we expect to generate more than $400 million in expense savings for 2022.  Now I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the third quarter, we achieved $165 million in cumulative cost synergies and our current annualized run rate is $311 million. I'm pleased to report we continue to outperform our initial time line on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the third quarter is $641 million. Given the outperformance on the timing of our synergies, we now expect to achieve slightly more than the 35% to 40% of total cost synergies in 2022 that we were targeting previously. Now let's turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence revenue increased 4% with strong growth in Data and Analytics, offset by slower growth in Desktop and flat growth in Enterprise Solutions. For this quarter, recurring revenue accounted for approximately 96% of Market Intelligence total revenue. Expenses were roughly flat this quarter with increases in compensation expense, cloud spend and outside services being offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation. Market Intelligence remains the biggest driver of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date. Segment operating profit increased 13%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 260 basis points to 33.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.9%. The OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division contributed $19 million in adjusted operating profit to the company. As a reminder, because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture operating independent of the company, we recognize their results on an after-tax basis and do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was growth in most categories. And on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 3%, Data & Advisory Solutions revenue grew 7%, Enterprise Solutions revenue was flat and Credit & Risk Solutions revenue grew 7%. For Desktop, we saw slower growth this quarter, driven in part by the timing of certain revenue recognition items, and we expect desktop to reaccelerate in the fourth quarter. For Enterprise Solutions, the business line continues to see headwinds in several of our volume-driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity under variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of FX and these volume-driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would have been approximately 7% year-over-year. While we remain confident in the long-term growth of all these product lines, we expect deceleration in categories outside of Desktop to persist in the fourth quarter. Now turning to Ratings. Ratings continued to face difficult market conditions this quarter as issuance volumes remained muted with revenue decreasing 33% year-over-year. Transaction revenue decreased to 56% on the continued softness in issuance we highlighted earlier. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower Rating Evaluation Services and initial Issuer Credit Ratings, partially offset by increases in CRISIL, ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the issuance environment and M&A activity, respectively, and the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions. Expenses decreased 19%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses. This resulted in a 41% decrease in segment operating profit and a 750 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin to 55.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 57.9%. Now looking at Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were a 44% decrease in Corporates and a 31% decrease in Structured Finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, Financial Services decreased 20%, Governments decreased 33%, and the CRISIL and other category increased 9%. And now turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 5%, driven by strong performance of subscription products, including those within Price Assessments and Energy & Resources, Data & Insights lines. However, that growth was impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As noted on the slide, revenue related to Russia contributed $12 million in the third quarter last year and made no contribution in the third quarter this year. Excluding this impact, Commodity Insights would have grown approximately 8% in the third quarter. There's no change to the expected impact from this conflict. But as a reminder, on an annualized run rate basis, we expect Commodity Insights revenue and operating income to be lower by approximately $52 million and $51 million, respectively. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 91% of Commodity Insights revenues.  Expenses increased 1%, primarily due to salary and fringe and an increase in T&E expense partially offset by merger-related synergies, lower consulting spend and lower real estate costs. Segment operating profit increased 9%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 190 basis points to 45.8%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.8%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 8% compared to the prior year, driven by continued commercial momentum and strong subscription growth for market data offerings. Energy & Resources, Data & Insights also grew 8% in the quarter, driven by strength in gas, power and renewables and in petrochemicals. Advisory and Transactional Services decreased 1% in the third quarter. The Upstream business was down 2% compared to prior year, mainly driven by higher comps for Software and Analytics products offerings as well as the impact of Russia. Excluding that impact and the impact of FX, Upstream ACV growth would have been positive in the quarter.  In our Mobility division, revenue increased 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued high retention rates and new business growth in CARFAX. For this quarter, recurring revenue contributed 78% of Mobility's total revenue. Expenses grew 5% year-over-year as we have yet to lap planned increases in headcounts, and we saw continued cloud expense growth, which were partially offset by lower data cost and favorable FX. This resulted in a 14% growth in adjusted operating profit and 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 40%.  Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for CARFAX as dealerships profitability remain at elevated levels. Manufacturing grew 4% year-over-year, driven by strength in subscriptions and an uptick in the Recall business. Inventory shortfalls continue to temper growth as OEMs spend on marketing initiatives powered by Mobility products remains muted. Financials and other increased 9%, primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products and new business. S&P Dow Jones Indices revenue increased 3% year-over-year with strong margin expansion despite lower assets under management. For the third quarter, recurring revenue contributed 84% of the total for indices. During the quarter, expenses were roughly flat as strategic investments and higher information services costs were offset primarily by lower incentives and other expenses. Segment operating profit increased 5%, and the segment operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 70.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 68.8%. Asset-linked fees were down 5%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs. Exchange-rated derivative revenue increased 37% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including a more than 60% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 10%, driven by new business activities. Over the past year, market depreciation totaled $472 billion. ETF AUM net inflows were $194 billion. This resulted in quarter-ending ETF AUM of $2.3 trillion, which is an 11% decrease compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which decreased 4% year-over-year. As a reminder, revenue tends to lag changes in asset prices. Given the declines across equity markets so far in the back half of this year, we continue to expect softness in asset-linked fees as we close out 2022. Engineering Solutions revenue declined 8% in the quarter, driven primarily by the negative impact of the timing of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. The BPVC contributed approximately $1 million in revenue this quarter compared to approximately $8 million in the year ago period. For this quarter, 94% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses decreased 7% due to favorable impact on BPVC royalties. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.1%. Non-subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions decreased 63% year-over-year for the reasons I mentioned on the previous slide, while subscription revenue increased 3% over the same period.  Now moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance due to the continued softening of the issuance environment, we now expect revenue to decrease mid-single digits compared to our prior guidance. Some of that impact is offset by the outperformance in indices. The net impact of our lower ratings revenue expectations, combined with the cost measures and capital allocation measures we have outlined today result in our slightly lower margin outlook and a new adjusted EPS range of $11 to $11.15. This margin outlook reflects our continued expectation for approximately 180 basis points of margin expansion outside of our Ratings business. Interest expense is expected in the range of $345 million to $355 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance due to higher interest on our cash deposits and positive impact from currency hedges. We're also reducing our outlook for capital expenditures to $115 million due to intentional delays in real estate investments. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, is now expected to be approximately $4 billion. The following slide illustrates our guidance by division. Based on this past quarter's performance, we're updating our expectations for adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin for Ratings and Indices. The guidance ranges for our other divisions are unchanged.  In closing, despite the geopolitical tensions and a challenging macroeconomic environment weighing on the markets, our portfolio of strong businesses continue to prove resilient. Furthermore, I'm pleased with the progress our teams have made since the closing of the merger earlier this year. We look forward to providing you with a deep dive into our businesses and the longer-term outlook of the company at our Investor Day on December 1.  And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Ashish, if you look at the outlook, as you know, we are not really providing quarterly guidance. So we're not really speaking about the quarterly outlook for either our financial results or some of the input variables like issuance. But of course, if you look at the numbers that we put out today, then if you would do a backward calculation, you would assume that the most recent trends we are seeing in terms of issuance is what we expect to continue also in the fourth quarter. So, definitely, that's the main reason why we took our guidance down. I would say that's the only reason, because overall the impact on our results from a top line perspective is about $200 million reduction in revenue outlook for the Ratings business, so about $0.50 of EPS. And then there were a couple of smaller things. But net-net, I think that's the main driver of why the EPS outlook is down for the full year. Toni, you're right. We are quite pleased with the overall expense discipline of the company in the third quarter. You've heard us announce last quarter that we're taking additional actions to deal with the macro environment and we're actually really pleased how that is playing out, and you may continue to see that kind of a result from us going forward across the company. And of course, we take the benefit also from the cost synergies that we can implement and accelerate during this period. So if you look specifically at the Ratings business, it is a mix. On the one hand, we continue to make sure that we invest in future growth, making sure that we stay competitive on a compensation perspective. We want to preserve the capacity we have on the analytical side.  But on the other hand, there are also discretionary costs that we are bringing down. There are allocated costs that are benefiting from the synergies that we are realizing across the company, and then also incentive compensation is down year-over-year. So it's actually a balance of different elements that go into the mix. But definitely, as you have seen in the past, we're always focused in terms of trying to preserve margins in our business businesses as much as possible, particularly in more challenging macro environments. Jeff, we are always aspiring to improve margins across all of our businesses. So mobility is not an exception to that. That is because of the fact that we're focused on operating leverage. We always like to see the top line growing faster than the expense line. And of course, aided then by strategic investments to aim for future growth as well. What we are seeing in the mobility business is really a positive overall environment that helps and is very supportive for the business, particularly with low inventory levels, we see margins high for the OEMs and for the dealers and that is driving high retention rates. The offset of that is that we see lower spend for sales and marketing products that we are having, and that's because of the same factor that the inventory levels are low. So you could say there's a kind of an inherent hedge in that business. If the market starts to turn, if we see that the demand supply starts to shift in the car market, then we would also see those different revenue streams moving in opposite directions. But we think that with that, we're insulated from our overall financial impact, and therefore, we can continue to focus on margin expansion as well.  And as Doug mentioned before, we also are taking a benefit from used car markets, and that has been proven to be quite resilient the cycle. So yes, overall, we are really happy with the growth of mobility, the margins, and we would see that continuing going forward. Greg. Well, we are always very careful when we speak about pricing in isolation because, first and foremost, we start with customer value. What do we deliver for our customers? And the good news is that based on the very high value of our products and services, we should be able to pass on cost/price increases and to achieve more favorable contract terms and fees over time at renewal. Of course, it depends on facts and circumstances of each and every product, each and every customer situation and of the situation of each and every of our businesses. But that is our overall philosophy. I can't give you specifically a number for across the company, how much price increases are up compared to previous periods, but there are definitely areas where we are looking at price increases or have already implemented price increases that have been higher than in the past. But again, that all has started with that there is a good balance with the overall customer value that we are delivering. Good morning, Manav. We recognized that the third quarter revenue growth of the Desktop was below our normal growth potential. But you have to look at it from a particular perspective that there is always some timing of revenue recognition of certain contracts. That was particularly impacting this quarter, but we expect the Desktop growth to normalize again in the fourth quarter. Also for Market Intelligence, in general, if you take out the volume effect of the capital markets business, and also FX, then the overall growth for the full quarter was north of 7%, and we believe that's more indicative of the normal growth opportunity for Market Intelligence as well. Well, Manav, that is directly correlated with the overall economic environment, capital markets activity, debt issuance, M&A environment. And we have, of course, seen that the beginning of this year was still relatively strong, and it started to deteriorate somewhere from March onwards. Non-transaction revenue is usually quite stable as a revenue stream. We have two particular areas that are mostly sensitive for the more general macro environment. This is initial credit ratings. We don't see a lot of new issuers coming to the market. And then rating evaluation services, this has a correlation with the M&A market. These are issuers that are thinking about IPOs, spin-offs and so on, want to have some kind of an insight in terms of implications for their ratings. So obviously, those are revenue streams that will come back once the markets start to turn. The more stable elements in non-transaction are around surveillance, around frequent issuer programs. And then most notably, I want to point out that CRISIL is doing very well and is supporting the non-transaction revenue in that category. Jeff, you're absolutely right that the used car market is a significant component of the overall revenue stream for the Mobility business. And the good news there is that it has been a very resilient market through the cycles. So we're not overly concerned about if the cycle in the car market start to turn that it will have a material impact. And as I mentioned before, we have other revenue streams actually that we expect to pick up if the equilibrium in the car market start to change, particularly about our sales and marketing products where we have seen relatively lower growth in the more recent past. The mobility business in general is a phenomenal business. There's a lot of innovation, a lot of new product developments, a lot of good support for our customers. CARFAX is really a gem from my perspective in terms of growth and in terms of innovation and new business activity, very close to the customers, a lot of new business launches and new product launches. So I think this business is in a very good position, and we would expect -- also if the car markets start to turn and go in a different direction, that we see continued good performance from this segment. Yes. Let me start with giving you an overall perspective on the Commodity Insights business and how it's doing in the current environment, and then I hand it over to Doug more for the energy transition and climate part. So if you look at the overall macro environment, it's very supportive for the Commodity Insight business at this moment. Definitely, where commodity prices are today is benefiting most of our customers. And therefore, we're seeing also, I would say, based on the very attractive proposition of the combined businesses that we have now brought together under the Commodity Insights segment. We're delivering a lot of new opportunities to our customers. And therefore, we have seen really one of the best sales momentums in this business. If I look at actual sales levels, this will probably one of the very best years for the last maybe a decade or so. So very positive trends that we're seeing that is helping Data & Insights that is helping price assessments.  The Global Trading Services business was a little lower this quarter. The main reason there is that we're lapping more difficult comps. But generally, we also see elevated hedging activity on commodity prices, and we're also benefiting from that as well. And then if you look at the upstream business, there, we have seen a turnaround. That was a business that for many years was in a more difficult period. But clearly, our customers are healthier there as well. We see larger CapEx budgets for those customers, and that is helping that business to grow. And we said in our prepared remarks that if you take out the effect of Russia, on a constant currency basis, actually the subscription book of business in the upstream business was growing during the quarter. So overall, very favorable macro environment for Commodity Insights, and that is clearly helping the business this quarter and also in the next couple of quarters. Faiza, yes, we're seeing the largest benefit from cost synergies and revenue synergies in the Market Intelligence division. That's because it's the largest division. It's also the largest combination of different businesses that we're bringing together. And also based on the size of that division, it will also benefit, of course, from a large part of the synergies that we're realizing in the corporate center and the allocation of those costs down to the divisions. What you see is, in general, that we continue to invest in Market Intelligence for future growth. So you see new product launches continuing strategic investments in new areas and initiatives. That was already touching on private credit, private markets, ESG investments we're having there as well. We're having expansion still continuing in China, in the marketplace and many different areas that we are continuing to invest as well as cloud expenses. We're also continuing on our cloud journey and Market Intelligence is continuing to invest there as well. But then the opposite factors, there are some of the expense reductions, the expense discipline and the synergies and the combination of all of that led to the significant margin expansion in Market Intelligence. Yes, overall, not so much of a different trend we are seeing in Europe compared to other parts of the world. I understand the background of the question because definitely, the economic outlook in Europe is, of course, quite difficult given the inflation levels, given, of course, the close proximity to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But overall, from a customer dynamics perspective, overall in terms of commercial activity, we're not seeing a significant difference compared to North America or Asia. Yes. Most success so far, we see in our largest divisions that we're bringing together, Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights in the Index business. It's mostly cross-sell at this moment, which was as expected because cross sell is the introduction of one product group to existing customers and making sure that we can sell new activities there. For example, in Market Intelligence, we had a nice sale of KYC, KY3P product to an existing customer that was more a customer from the legacy S&P Global side where we could sell a product from the legacy IHS Markit side. So just as an example, so we see -- continue to see good cross-sell. At the same time, we're investing in new product development, in system development that will help them with that growth wave going forward. So it's still early, I have to say around revenue synergies, but we are clearly ahead compared to our original expectations. Overall, no change with respect to our capital philosophy, capital management targets. We think consistency and reliability there is the most important, particularly in this environment. You have seen us continuing with the $12 billion ASR, even despite that we have seen some impact of the current environment on the rating issuance levels we are able to execute on our plans this year. And you may expect the same from us over the next couple of years. So at least 85% of return of capital to our shareholders, a combination of dividends and share buybacks, dividend payout ratio between 20% and 30%. And M&A, the focus is really on small tuck-in and bolt-on, where we see that we can add a nice capability to some of our core strategic focus areas, but nothing large because we first, of course, need to focus on the integration of the large merger and organically building out our businesses. So no changes at all, and we think that is actually the right approach. Yes. This is the new run rate with respect to the interest expense on our debt. We were very fortunate with hindsight that we refinanced a large part of the debt at the beginning of March when the 10-year U.S. Treasury was around 1.73 at that point in time. So we are very happy that we locked ourselves in with long-term debt at very low levels. And actually, if you look at the average cost of debt for any player in our industry, we're at one of the lowest levels. So yes, this is the normalized level. If you look, though, at the interest expense line, there's one point that I want to make, it's a net number. So we're generating more interest income on our cash balances. So that is helping us a little bit and obviously, that might fluctuate over time. Shlomo, obviously, we are exposed as everyone else, to increases from an overall labor market perspective and comp expectations, and we need to stay competitive in order to attract and retain the best talent. So let me expand a little bit on that answer. So about 60% of our overall expense base is people cost. And obviously, we have people across the whole world in many different job groups and categories. It's not a one-size-fits-all. We see more competitive situations in certain markets and jurisdictions. We see it more in certain job groups. And we are continuously making sure that we stay competitive from an overall comp perspective. And we will continue to do that. So we're definitely expecting to see also some of the changes over the next period flowing through our P&L. But at the same time, we are also taking advantage of a lot of levers that we are having and maybe levers that are given to us through the merger.  So we have, of course, the opportunity to realize cost synergies and reduction of headcount is an element to that. So that goes in an opposite direction as well as synergies, cost synergies around real estate, around procurement. And then as you see this year, given the performance of the company, also incentive compensation costs are down and we gave you the overall impact of around $120 million to $140 million. So it is a bit of a mix. On the one hand, staying competitive from a labor market perspective; but on the other hand, using a lot of levers in order to offset the overall impact on our expense line and on our margins. Andrew, as you understand, we're not giving quarterly guidance, so I can't give you numbers by quarter by segment margins. But what we are, of course, trying to do is if we give you a full year picture, we give you a full year outlook, then of course you can backwards calculate what is the expectation for the quarter itself. I do want to point out that the third quarter in general is the lowest quarter for us from an expense perspective. That is due to seasonality. The fourth quarter is higher. But you have seen that in previous years as well. So from a trend perspective, there's nothing different than what you -- that you should have seen in the past. But sequentially, you should expect expenses to roll out. Again, that is normal seasonality."

This information is provided to enable investors to make meaningful comparisons of the corporation’s operating performance between periods and to view the corporation’s business from the same perspective as management. The earnings release contains exhibits that reconcile the difference between the non-GAAP measures and the comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. I would also like to call your attention to European Regulation. Any investor who has or expects to obtain ownership of 5% or more of S&P Global should contact Investor Relations to better understand the potential impact of this legislation on the Investor and the Company. We are aware that we have some media representatives with us on the call. However, this call is intended for investors and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team whose contact information can be found in the press release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Mark. Welcome to today’s second quarter earnings call. Our second quarter results demonstrate the combined efforts of our truly incredible team. After our first 100 days as a combined company, it’s clear than ever that after the merger S&P Global is stronger, more resilient, more diversified and better positioned than ever. We’re maintaining fiscal and operational discipline and controlling what can be controlled, which is allowing us to post aggregate results in a challenging issuance environment that would’ve been inconceivable prior to the merger. Let me start with our financial highlights. As a reminder, the adjusted financial metrics will be discussing today referred to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period. Revenue decreased 5% year-over-year with growth in five of our six divisions providing significant ballast against a 26% decrease in ratings revenue. Recurring revenue increased 5% year-over-year, representing 81% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses only increased 1% as continued investment in inflation pressures on compensation and technology were almost entirely offset by cost synergies in the quarter. We’re reinstating our guidance, which reflects the challenging macroeconomic environment. Though, we will be able to offset some of the EPS impact is Ewout will discuss in a moment. Importantly, our updated guidance calls for a smaller than 2% decrease in adjusted EPS at the midpoint, illustrating the resilience of the businesses and the positive impact of our capital allocation strategy. I would also like to share a few other highlights from the second quarter. As I mentioned, we are now more than 100 days past the merger close. Our post integration efforts are proceeding on schedule, but very importantly, we’re outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Momentum continues on product development with several areas of innovation that will highlight for you on today’s call. We see benefits from market volatility in parts of our businesses, and we’re able to accelerate our share repurchase efforts relative to our original plan with $8.5 billion near completion at an average share price below $360. We expect to launch an additional $2.5 billion ASR in the coming weeks, which we expect to complete in October with the final $1 billion to be completed by year end. We’ve already seen remarkable progress in our integration efforts in a relatively short period. I’m pleased with our progress in integrating our commercial and marketing teams. We’ve recorded more than 2,000 cross-sell referrals across the divisions. We’re also ahead of expectations on our cost synergies realizing approximately $80 million year-to-date and exiting the quarter in an annualized run rate of more than $260 million. Beyond the transactional milestones related to the merger like the necessary divestitures, we’ve also reached multiple operational milestones. We’ve standardized business practices invested in culture and training and established leadership teams multiple layers deep across the enterprise. We’re moving fast on our office integration plan and consolidated 10 of our office locations around the world lowering our real estate costs. We completed our major New York City consolidation and are on track to complete our London consolidation in the fourth quarter. When we announced the merger, we highlighted our expectation that the combined company would be more agile, innovative, and entrepreneurial. And we’ve seen that in initiatives such as the Data Lake Hackathon led by Kensho’s Head of AI Research and teams of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and software developers. These teams spent two days exploring how to best leverage Kensho tools in other technologies to derive value from the Data Lake datasets and we’re thrilled with what these teams have found in just two days. In addition to finding ways that Kensho solutions can add commercial value to unstructured datasets across the Data Lake. We identified new datasets for training Kensho Scribe, NERD, Link, and Extract, more than doubling current training datasets in some cases. We also identified datasets to improve S&P Global’s country risk assessments and found compelling new ways to classify and improve data for ESG. This hackathon enabled us to better realize the full capabilities of our combined datasets. We also re-launch the cross-divisional S&P Global research council with new leadership and membership to reflect the expertise in our combined company following the merger. This council consists of both research and operational leaders with the core mandate to drive customer value and greater insights for markets. One of the first actions of the council was to align on key research teams that have the greatest potential for large scale disruption and have a meaningful impact on the success of our customers. We’ll be leveraging the full capabilities across the company and engaging meaningfully with customers and other stakeholders across industry and regulatory bodies. There’s incredible demand for insights and thought leadership on topics like energy security, climate, technology and digital disruptions, supply chains, and capital markets. We have unique datasets and insights in all of these areas and we see the research council as a way to make sure that our insights are most impactful for our customers and drive innovation within S&P Global. That focus on accelerating innovation was on full display in the second quarter. We launched exciting new products from commodity insights, including a new basin level methane intensity calculation product for 19 U.S. natural gas production areas. We’re using satellite imagery and data models trained in-house to significantly disrupt what has historically been a very manual process using data extracted from self-reported EPA forms. We also launched carbon intensity measures for all six crude grades in the global Brent benchmark. In Mobility, we saw commercial success from our new auto credit insights product to help deliver insights to financial customers serving the automotive credit space. In Engineering Solutions, we continue to make progress building out our new software platform and have two successful proof-of-concept engagements in market now. We continue to innovate in market intelligence as well, making new datasets available via feeds and introducing new products like PVR Source, which is a diligence platform aimed at helping clients get ahead of the compliance challenges of an ever changing regulatory landscape. Now to recap the financial results for the second quarter, revenue decreased 5% to $2.97 billion. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $1.4 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 280 basis points to 47% as both profits and margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in ratings transaction revenue and the expense growth I mentioned earlier. Importantly, our non-ratings businesses in aggregate posted strong growth in the quarter, increasing revenue by 7% year-over-year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which is 46.1% as of the second quarter through strong and disciplined execution and prudent capital allocation, we were able to offset much of the earnings impact of the issuance environment posting fully diluted EPS of $2.81, representing a 7% decrease year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I’m pleased to report positive growth across five of our divisions with ratings executing very well in an extraordinarily difficult issuance environment. Our more diversified portfolio of products provides many opportunities to thrive in uncertain markets. And we saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result. Within our indices business, we continue to see remarkable strength in our exchange traded derivatives, which grew more than 60% year-over-year, as well as our CDS Indices, which increased 40%. Uncertain in the markets continues to spur demand for our thought leadership and insights and a consolidated platform on which to access information, whether it’s tracking market movements, company performance, or supply chain constraints, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating uncertain waters. This help drive 25% growth in aftermarket research and market intelligence. In the second quarter, we celebrated the second anniversary of the S&P Global marketplace. Customers continue to come to S&P Global as a trusted source for differentiated data around ESG, fundamentals, machine readable text, and workflow tools like our work bench. We’ve seen explosive growth in the marketplace since launch and in the last year, a nearly 30% increase in the content and solutions available, 75% growth in deals closed and more than 200% growth in engagement is measured by page views. Now turning to issuance. During the second quarter, global issuance decreased 37% year-over-year deteriorating further from what we saw last quarter. In the U.S. rated issuance and aggregate decreased 34%, European rated issuance decreased 45%, and in Asia, rated issuance declined 32%. We saw sharp declines in high yield, which was down nearly 80% year-over-year in Asia, and was down more than 80% in the U.S. and Europe. Interestingly, this is the first time that I can recall seeing declines in every category in every region since I’ve been doing earnings calls. We’ve included additional details on the sub components of issuance by region in the slide deck. Each year S&P Dow Jones Indices conducts a survey of assets as depicted in this slide, asset levels and actively managed funds that benchmark against our indices increased 38% to $12.8 trillion as of the end of 2021. Assets and passive funds invested in products indexed to our indices increased 32% to $9.9 trillion. Numerous indices support the $9.9 trillion including the S&P 500, the largest with $7 trillion in assets. We’ve seen strong growth in factor and sector indices as well as many of our ESG and climate related indices. While the S&P 500 still accounts for the majority of AUM, we continue to see strong demand for that historic index among asset managers. We saw even faster growth among our other indices in 2021 evidenced by the fact that the S&P 500 accounted for 71% of indexed AUM in 2021, down from 72% in 2020. While this is historical AUM as of December 2021, we’re very excited about what this slide will look like in the years to come, as we integrate IHS Markit Indices like iBoxx and iTraxx and drive commercial innovation in fixed income and cross asset indices. We delivered extraordinary growth in our ESG initiatives this quarter. ESG revenue growth accelerated on both reported and organic basis in the second quarter, growing 66% year-over-year to reach nearly $52 million. We continue to introduce new ESG related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace. In the second quarter, we saw the launch of multiple ESG and sustainability related ETFs based on our indices. And we ended the second quarter with AUM and ESG ETFs growing 16% year-over-year to approximately $30 billion. Our Indices and Commodity Insights teams continued their collaboration and launched the S&P Battery Metals index. Within ratings, we completed 20 ESG evaluations and 34 sustainable financing opinions driven by strong demand for second party opinions. Lastly, we hosted the S&P Global Sustainable1 Summit with events in several major cities around the world, bringing together leaders from various stakeholder groups to discuss the future of sustainability. Now turning to our outlook. Twice a year, we update our global refinancing study, but given the issuance environment, we wanted to provide a bit more color this quarter. Specifically, there are two impacts to highlight as investors look at total global debt outstanding. The two impacts are average time to maturity and FX rates. When we look at global corporate bond maturities, we see a similar phenomenon to what we have witnessed historically. Over the next three years, we see a decrease in near-term maturities as refinancing push those maturity dates out. We’ve witnessed this phenomena in the July update each year, so we aren’t surprised by it. While total global debt maturing over the next three years is down significantly from six months ago, it’s important to note that debt maturing over the next 10 years is not down significantly, and it starts to increase over the next three to five years. We expect 2024 and 2025 refinancing activity to start next year. This is particularly true for total debt outstanding on an FX adjusted basis. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since January, foreign denominated debt is lowered by 1% when converted to U.S. dollars at July rates. This slide shows total global debt rated by S&P Global of all maturities on a constant currency basis, which increased 2% if measured at January FX rates. While we don’t expect a significant rebound in issuance in a back half of this year, this demonstrates that over the long-term, the public debt markets remain very healthy and have a strong history of resilience. They also reinforce our view that the issuance headwinds we’re seeing in the market now will likely moderate, if not reverse in the future. Now for issuance outlook, S&P Global Ratings Research has updated its bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect a decrease in the second quarter and more conservative assumptions around the back half. Global market issuance is now expected to decline approximately 16% year-over-year within a range of down 9% to down 24% in 2022. This forecast implies an approximate 21% decline in the second half compared to the 11% decline seen in the first half. Non-financials are expected to see a 30% decrease in issuance, partially tempered by a smaller, roughly 10% decrease in financial services issuance. U.S. public finance and structured finance are expected to soften by 12% and 14% respectively and international public finance is expected to be roughly flat. As a reminder, the global debt issuance forecast is a product of the S&P Global Ratings Research team and reflects market issuance, including unrated issuance. We wanted to take the opportunity to explain the different categories of issuance that we discussed from time to time. The most frequently cited forecast is out of our S&P Global Ratings Research team, which I just outlined. But our ratings revenue is more closely tied to S&P build issuance, which is a subset of market issuance. Build issuance includes leverage loans, which are not included in the market issuance forecast. It does not, however, include debt from unrated categories, such as medium-term notes and most domestic debt from China, nor would our build issuance include international public finance. While there are other nuances as well, these differences in aggregate bridge the gap between our market issuance forecast and the assumption for build issuance that underpins our ratings revenue guidance for the year. As Ewout will outline, our ratings revenue guidance assumes a 30% to 45% decrease in build issuance. Looking beyond issuance, we see a number of secular trends that stand to benefit the company both this year and beyond. Our experts in Commodity Insights expect oil prices in volatility to remain above historical norms for some time. This volatility often creates more demand among customers for price assessments and benchmarks, as well as our data and insights. Our Mobility team also expects light vehicle sales to increase next year and beyond, returning to levels more in line with pre-pandemic production by 2025. As volumes continue to grow, we expect to see tailwinds in our Mobility segment across multiple product lines, including CARFAX and Automotive Mastermind. As we evaluate the remainder of this year, however, we wanted to discuss some of the assumptions that underpin our outlook. As we noted in June, when we suspended guidance, we’ve seen a deterioration several economic indicators over the course of the second quarter. We expect slightly lower GDP growth, higher inflation, and a lower debt issuance environment to impact not only our businesses, but our customers, as well. As Ewout will discuss in a moment, we’re seeing inflationary pressure on our costs with approximately 70% of our expenses tied to headcount. That pressure is showing up most in our compensation and technology costs. As a reminder, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but we wanted to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions that we make about the global economy when formulating guidance. While we’re not discussing 2023 or beyond on today’s call, we’re pleased to announce an Investor Day that we expect to hold on December 1 in New York City. We’re looking forward to sharing with you some preliminary views on 2023, as well as a more holistic update on our strategy positioning and medium term financial targets at that time. Before, handing it over to Ewout, I’d like to reiterate how pleased we are with the progress we’re making on integration and the clear proof points we see reinforcing the industrial logic of the merger and the resilience of our businesses. We have a world-class team and appreciate the hard work and dedication of our people in every area across the firm. Our teams continue to execute incredibly well evidenced by our early outperformance on synergies. And we believe we’re positioning the company to accelerate growth, expand margins and deliver innovation in the years to come. With that, I’ll turn it over to Ewout, to walk through the results and guidance. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. With five of our six divisions, once again, posting revenue growth, we continue to see evidence that we are a stronger, more resilient company. Doug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. As Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics that we will be discussing today, refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude a contribution from divested businesses in all periods. Adjusted corporate and allocated expenses declined from a year ago, caused by synergies as well as a combination of reduced incentive and fringe cost, as well as the release of certain accruals. Our net interest expense increased 3%, as we increased gross debt partially offset the lower average rates due to refinancings. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the post merger change in the mix of income by jurisdiction. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the second quarter were $220 million in merger-related expenses. The details of which can be found in the appendix. We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items of $924 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. Year-to-date, as Doug mentioned, we have repurchased $8.5 billion in shares, and we expect to launch an additional $2.5 billion in the coming weeks. We expect that $2.5 billion will be completed in October with the final $1 billion to be completed by year-end. We note that U.S. dollar has strengthened against many foreign currencies year-to-date, and we have seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. Approximately three-fourth of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have an active hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings. Year-to-date, we have seen an unfavorable revenue impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound. Expenses saw a favorable impact due to FX movements against those same currencies and the Indian Rupee. Turning to expenses, as we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to prudent management of the P&L and shareholder capital. This year, we have already taken decisive actions to protect margins where we can, while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include a reduction in incentive accruals pull forward in synergies, adjustments to the timing of select investments, forcing selective hiring, and limiting consulting spend in some areas. We remain committed to our strategic investments, which are key to the growth of our business. These include investments in our people, innovation, infrastructure, and our ability to execute merger-related integration and synergies. Looking at the year-over-year change in expenses this quarter, we’re clearly seeing the impact of inflation, most notably in compensation expenses. We’re also seeing higher cloud and T&E cost as we highlighted last quarter as well. Even with those headwinds, the decisive actions I outlined, together with our acceleration of synergies and favorable FX have allowed us to keep expenses relatively flat year-over-year. Now, I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the second quarter, we have achieved $80 million in cumulative cost synergies and our current annualized run rate is $260 million. Through the combined efforts of our teams across the divisions and corporate, we’re very pleased to see we’re outperforming our initial timeline on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the second quarter is $540 million. Our teams have been diligent and disciplined and have pulled forward some of the synergies we previously identified without materially impacting our ability to drive growth and revenue synergies. We have previously said that we expect to realize in 2022, approximately 35% to 40% of the $600 million in cost synergies, we’re targeting through 2024. We’re still operating in an uncertain environment. So while we’re not changing the expected range for 2022, we’re confident that we’re more likely to come out at the higher end of the 35% to 40% target range. Now let’s turn to the deficient results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 7% with growth across all product lines. We want to emphasize the increased resilience and stickiness of most of our revenue and the more diversified portfolio of products in our deficient post merger. To highlight this improvement, we know that in Market Intelligence recurring revenue, which includes variable recurring revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue this quarter, slightly higher compared to the same period last year. Expenses increased 6% primarily due to increases in compensation expense, cloud spent and outside services, offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation. Market Intelligence remains the biggest drive of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date. Segment operating profit increased 8% and the segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 33%. On a trailing 12 month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.2%. You can see on the slide, our operating profit from the OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division. The JV contributed $25 million in adjusted operating profit to the company because the JV is a 50%-owned joint venture operating independent of the company. We do not include the financial results OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category and on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 6%, Data And Advisory Solutions revenue grew 9%, Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 2%, and Credit and Risk Solutions revenue grew 10%. For Enterprise Solutions, we continue to see headwinds in several of our volume driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity, and the variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of these volume driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would've been approximately 8% year-over-year in the quarter. We expect those volume driven headwinds to persist through the rest of the year. While we are pleased with the outperformance of credit and risk solutions in the first half, we're lapping some difficult columns in the second half and expect revenue growth to decelerate in debt part of the business. Ratings faced continued difficult market conditions this quarter, with revenue declining 26% year-over-year. Expenses decreased 6%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, as well as lower occupancy cost and favorable FX, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses and T&E spent. This resulted in a 35% decrease in segment operating profit and 850 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 12-month basis adjusted segment operating profit margin was 59.8%. Non-transaction revenue increased 2% on a constant currency basis and decreased 1% as reported primarily due to lower initial credit ratings and ratings evaluation services revenues, partially offset by increases in CRISIL and annual fees. Transaction revenue decreased 44% on the continued soft issuance already discussed. This slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in ratings revenue were a 39% decrease in corporates and a 20% decrease in structured finance, driven predominantly a structured credit. In addition, financial services decreased 9%, governments decreased 15% and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 4%. However, debt growth was impacted significantly by the suspension of commercial activity in Russia and Belarus, and other impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Adjusting for the impact of that conflict revenues would have grown approximately 7% compared to prior year. On an annualized run rate basis, this conflict is expected to impact CI revenue and operating income by approximately $52 million and $51 million respectively. For this quarter, 90% of Commodity Insights revenues were classified as recurring. Expenses increased 4% primarily due to salary and fringe, and increase in T&E expense, partially offset by realization of merger related synergies. Segment operating profit increased 3% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 44%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.3%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 5% compared to prior year driven by strong subscription growth for market data offerings and continued commercial momentum. We also saw strong performance from advisory and transactional services, and energy and resources, data and insights, both growing 4% respectively. Upstream data and insights increased marginally with second quarter 2022, representing the third consecutive quarter of ACV growth, when adjusting for the impact of Russia. In our Mobility division revenue increased 7% year-over-year driven primarily by strength in planning solutions and used car offerings. For this quarter 78% of mobility's revenues were classified as recurring. Expenses grew 5%, unplanned increases in headcount and advertising expense, which were somewhat offset by reduction in purchase data and office cost, and incentive compensation. This resulted in a 9% growth in adjusted operating profit and 90 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 39.5%. Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance from CARFAX and very high dealer retention as well as growth in new stores. Growth in manufacturing was 3% year-over-year driven by demand for supply chain products among suppliers though growth are tempered by relatively flat original equipment manufacturer or OEM spent on marketing initiatives powered by mobility products. Financials, and other increased 3% primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products tempered by slowing consumer activity and persistent low volumes across auto sales. S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth of 12% year-over-year primarily due to gains in ETD volumes. For this quarter, 83% of Indices revenues were classified as recurring during the quarter expenses increased 1% due to increased technology and T&E expense. Segment operating profit increased 16% and the segment operating profit margin increased 290 basis points to 71.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin are 68.6%. Once again, every category increased revenue this quarter, asset-linked fees were up 5% primarily from AUM driven gains in mutual funds and ETFs. Exchange traded derivative revenue increased 64% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including the more than 60% increase in S&P 500 index options volume. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6% driven by new business activities. Over the past year, ETF AUM net inflows were $231 billion and market depreciation totaled $352 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is a 5% decrease compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM which increased 5% year-over-year. Revenue tends to lack changes in asset prices, which helped drive outperformance this quarter. However, we expect asset-linked fees to decrease in the back half of this year, sequentially versus the end of the first quarter ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $6 billion in marketed depreciation totaled $436 billion. Within our Engineering Solutions division, we saw 3% revenue growth driven primarily by growth in non-subscription offerings. Most notably the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. For this quarter 93% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses, increased 5% driven by investment in product development and increased royalties. This resulted in a 7% decline in segments operating profit and 300 basis points contraction to margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.4%. Subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions increased 2% year-over-year, while non-subscription revenue increased 10% over the same period. As you look toward next quarter for Engineering Solutions, it will be important to remember we'll lap the August 2021 duplication of the BPVC, which typically contributes approximately $8 million in the third quarter of odd years, but is not published in even years. Now moving to our guidance. And this slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our reinstated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. For revenue, we now expect a low-to-mid single digit decrease year-over-year, reflecting the issuance environment, partially offset by the strength we're seeing in our non-ratings businesses. We now expect corporate and allocated expense between $70 million and $80 million, approximately $15 million lower than our previous guidance on lower forecasted incentive compensation. This drives our expectation for adjusted operating margins between 45.3% and 45.8% as declines in high margin ratings revenue disproportionately impacts margins to the downside this year. We wanted to emphasize the margin expansion we expect to see elsewhere in the business. In aggregate within our five non-ratings divisions, we expect approximately 180 basis points of operating margin expansion this year. Interest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, in-line with our most recent guidance. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $165 million and free cash flow excluding certain items in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. The following slide illustrates our guidance by division. We now expect adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin in the following ranges. For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digit range and margins in the low-30%. For Ratings, we now expect revenue declines in the low-to-mid 20% range and margins in the mid-to-high 50%. For Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digit range and margins in the mid 40%. For Mobility we expect revenue growth in the high single digit range and margins in the high 30%. For Indices we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digit range and margins in the mid-to-high 60%. For Engineering Solutions, we expect low single digit revenue growth and margins in the mid-teens. In closing this quarter provides further proof of the resilience of our business. Our ability to outperforming synergies speaks volumes on the focus and discipline of the teams we have at S&P Global. Those teams combined with a phenomenal set of truly differentiated products and capabilities position us well to drive profitable growth in the years to go. And with that Let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\nA - Mark Grant: Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from Ashish Sabadra, you may go – with RBC Capital. You may go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering for the issuance guidance, would it be possible for you to provide some color around how we should think about third versus fourth quarter momentum in the back half of the year? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Hi, Ashish. This is Doug. Thanks for the question. Let me just give you first of all, some overall view of what we've given you today. We provided you with information starting with our ratings credit research team, and then gave you some new disclosure about how we look at the difference between that research report and what we call our build issuance assumptions. We see right now, the beginning of the third quarter was actually quite weak. One month doesn't make a quarter, but at the beginning of July, there was issuance of high yield loans and high yield debt was down overall in the high-80%, low-90% range. Investment grade issuance was up actually for the month, but the quarter is off to a, what I'd say is still a pretty weak start, answering your question specifically.\nAshish Sabadra: That that's very helpful color. And then on the cost synergies, obviously pretty strong execution on that front with almost a $260 million run rate achieved in the quarter. I understand you expect to achieve at the high end of that 40% range being realized by 2022, but I was also wondering if you could only provide any color on how we should think about the run rate of cost synergies exiting 2022. Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Ashih Good morning. This is Ewout. So 40% of $600 million, so we expect therefore in year 2022, approximately $240 million benefit from cost synergies. We think that's phenomenal that we're already having that pace of execution and integration of our organizations. We don't have a precise number for you in terms of the run rate exit, but you should expect that it is a significant amount above the $240 million, because obviously the more we execute this year, the better we are positioned for 2023. So I can't give you a precise number on that, but that will be a number significantly north of that $240 million.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Thanks.\nMark Grant: Thanks Ashish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Manav Patnaik, you may go – with Barclays. You may go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning guys. My first question was just broadly on guidance, I think, Ewout said that the non-ratings businesses should help offset the ratings weakness, but I think in the guidance summary, you pretty much lowered some of the non-ratings businesses, at least to the lower end. So can you just talk about, that gap and perhaps your level of conserve you've taken in this attempted guidance today?\nEwout Steenbergen: Manav, good morning. Yes. We have always said that our businesses are very resilient, but of course they're not immune to an external environment. So is some slight impact you are seeing in terms of, for example the Index business, the assumption for the second half of the year is that assets under management will remain flat from the June 30 point. So that will have an impact on the index business. So there's several of those. Another example is the Russia impact on Commodity Insights. But overall these impacts are relatively minimal and modest. So let me give you a few other data points with respect to the assumptions that have gone into the guidance. So as already mentioned, build issuance negative 37%, then for the market appreciation flat to the June 30 level, exchange traded derivative, we expect those to be up about 10% from the second half of 2021 that is lower growth than you have seen in the first half of the year. And the reason is that the comps become more difficult, but also when there is a period of extended volatility, we expect this trading to taper off at some point. And then the brand overall[ph] price to remain in range bound until end of the year. Having said that if you look at the overall performance of the company, we're actually really pleased with the outlook for five of our six division. They are expected to perform very well to be very strong, expenses to be more or less flat year-over-year, which we think is really a phenomenal outcome in a high inflationary environment. And then margins excluding ratings to be up for the full year 180 basis points. So overall we think these are actually really strong outlooks for the company, taking aside of course the market impact for ratings.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then maybe if I can ask you a similar question on the margin front, I mean, you talked about obviously a lot of the cost synergies being ahead of schedule, et cetera, but I think you've still taken the margin outlook down mostly. So is that just maybe being conservative or the run rate doesn't kick in for a while, I guess?\nEwout Steenbergen: Well we are seeing a lot of dynamics in the overall expenses of the company. We have pointed at some inflationary pressures on compensation, on some of our procurement, elements and other parts of the company, but we are in a very fortunate position that we have so many levers as a company, particularly the levers that are being given to us due to the merger with respect to the cost synergies, duplication of roles that we can eliminate, the volume benefits in terms of synergies in the procurement and the sourcing area, some of the consolidation of real estate and many other areas, plus the decisive management actions we're taking at this moment. So being flat with expenses as I just said, in this environment we think is a very strong outcome. The non ratings businesses were achieving about $200 million or north of $200 million of margin expansion in the second quarter. And we think 180 basis points margin expansion for the full year would be a very strong outcome and would position us very well for 2023.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks Manav.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just following up on Manav’s margin questionnaire for a little bit, maybe this is nitpicking, but if I look at two of the segments, Commodity Insights and Mobility you did basically leave your adjusted revenue growth and forecast unchanged from the prior guidance, but the margins are actually now lower. So with everything you just changed as I said, it does seem like some costs are higher. So maybe you can flush it out specifically to those two segments because not sure why the margins would be lower if the revenues unchanged.\nEwout Steenbergen: Alex these are really small changes and movements on the revenue line and with respect to the expense line for those two segments, which could drive that, for example, you're just staying within the range on revenues, but just having a slight adjustment with respect to the expected margins for that segment. So let me take as an example Commodity Insights, as we have highlighted, this is the segment where we have some impact of the Russian situation, but then that is offset by very positive momentum commercially in the Commodity Insights businesses. So we can offset a part of it. And as a result, you see a little bit of impact on revenue and margins and that is being reflected in those changes. But overall, I wouldn't read too much into it. These are just really minor impacts that we are seeing on those businesses.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. Helpful. Thank you. And then just second just on the Market Intelligence side, hoping that you can give us a little bit more color around the commercial success you're having so far, what I'm asking specifically is I've had some client conversations and it sounds like for at least for some clients, you're not really integrating the sales force, yes. And they are operating basically at two organizations until next year. So I don't know if those are one-offs or this representative of the whole book of business, but I would've expect with all the planning that basically you're going to be operating at as one company. And so maybe just flush out what's been done and why maybe we're hearing that it's not fully integrated quite yet?\nDoug Peterson: Yeah. Alex, thanks for that. And we're actually fully integrated. Market Intelligence is the division that's absolutely the furthest ahead on that. We have done full training of all of the products across the two divisions. We have seen the ability to now go out with joint planning for all customers across the financial services and the Market Intelligence to prior segments. We have a lot of early wins both with clients as well as with products, a couple of examples, some of the early wins have come by moving more and more data sets from financial services into what we talked about earlier on the call to marketplace. We've also seen some early wins on selling products, which would've been traditionally financial service products into the corporate client base of Market Intelligence. And then we have some new products which have also been launched. We talked about one of them, the PVR which is responsive to some new SEC rules, which are coming out later this year. So that must be anecdotal. I'm not sure you were speaking with, but we are really excited about the integration and the speed that we're able to develop a cross-sell. We mentioned that we have over 2,000 cross-sell ideas and leads, and we're following up on those very, very quickly. And as you saw, we're also ahead of our prior assumptions about how we'd be doing with synergy. So this is one of the areas that I think we're actually doing the best on.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect, thanks. Wanted to ask another one on synergies. It looks like you're making really great progress on the cost side, on the revenue side. It makes sense that it'll take a longer time just given the need to create new products. But I guess, are you aware you thought you'd be on the revenue synergy side or is it taking longer and do you still feel good about the 2024 target there?\nDoug Peterson: Yeah. Thanks Toni. Well, I feel actually really positive about the projections that we have on the revenue synergies. It's something that we've always known that would take a while to understand the customers, to be able to integrate data sets to have a fully integrated sales force. But to have the ability to already be running it at $15 million run rate which we announced this quarter for me is ahead of what we would've thought we would've been. We still haven't changed the view that a lot of the revenue synergies will be more back-ended in the next two to three years. But the early projections in the early progress is excellent.\nToni Kaplan: That sounds great. And then just on Market Intelligence, the Enterprise Solutions piece only up 2% year-over-year, just want to clarify, is this the legacy IHS Solutions business? I think it used to be comprised of enterprise software and managed services. I just – I wasn't as familiar, I guess, with the volume based offerings that are in there, which is driving maybe the slow down, just any additional color on that thing?\nDoug Peterson: Yeah. Thanks Toni. Yeah, you're right about, what's comprised of that solutions group. It includes IPO as well. But there's a portion of the revenues in that business which come from IPOs and as you know, the IPO market has been incredibly weak. So that's the main issue which has seen slowed down of growth, but the underlying business is doing quite well. We're delivering software, we're delivering solutions. This is one of the areas where we've seen some of the early wins on being able to position products, which traditionally have been sold to financial services into the corporate sector. So off to a great start, but having some impact from the very, very weak capital markets in IPO positioning.\nToni Kaplan: Makes sense. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks Toni.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. You may go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. My question is on the non-transactional side of the ratings business, maybe you could just comment on how stable is that business through the cycle and what are your sort of assumptions there for the balance of the year?\nDoug Peterson: Good morning Hamzah, of course I will give you some further insights on that. As you know non-transaction revenues is a bucket of different elements and they are not all pointing in the same direction. So let me give you a little bit further insight in what we're expecting here. So what is looking strong is annual fees as well as CRISIL. So we would expect those to continue to do well for the remainder of the year, in-line of what you have seen for the second quarter. And that will be offset by some impact of FX, ratings evaluation services, which is more linked to M&A and initial credit ratings, which is also down. So I think best to expect a low single digit decline for non-transaction revenue this year, but that is of course in the bigger scheme for ratings providing some offset and stability for the transaction revenue declines.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Very helpful. And just my follow-up is just on the Indices side of the business, I think the SEC was looking at whether Indices businesses should be treated as investment advisors versus data publishers. Is there anything, I guess on the regulatory front on the Indices side that you are looking at or that investors should be cracking or is this just not really material? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yeah. Hamzah, as you know our business has already run as if we're regulated and we are regulated in some jurisdictions like the European jurisdiction under what's called the BMR. The SEC has a request for comment out about – for about index providers. We will file a response. As you know, there's a long term trend from active to passive. It's an industry that has very low cost independence, a lot of transparency. We have a very strong performance over the last 65 years, and we'll obviously highlight all of that in our response to the SEC. But as of now, this is just a request for comment. There's nothing related to it. That is any regulatory proposals. And we were not surprised given the size of the growth of the index industry.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks Hamzah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. In looking at Slide 23 where you have your economic assumptions, you’re forecasting obviously slower growth in real GDP, but not really forecasting a recession. We can argue what the definition of a recession is later. But let me play devil’s advocate. Let’s assume that the U.S. more importantly the global economy might be going into a recession in the second half of this year. What would be the impact on your different business segments?\nDoug Peterson: Let me start, and then I’m going to hand it over to Ewout to give you some more color. But first of all, we have the assumptions that you saw on Slide 23. We have seen a significant slowdown in growth in the United States, the Eurozone and globally, and China being one of those markets, which is also seemed substantial slowdown given their current policies. This has also been matched with a higher inflation. Each of our businesses have different types of impact in this scenario with the ratings business you’ve already seen is being directly impacted already by the increase in inflation, by the weak issuance environment, by the uncertainty in the markets. If you looked at our commodity insight business, we could see some growth in the volatility from the higher cost of oil, which you saw here, we have a projected that the crude price will be at $106 and a range that’s much higher than it had been in the prior years. That leads to some increase in interest in trading information for risk information and then the overall energy industry does quite well in that positioning. So we could see some benefits from that. Our other businesses market intelligence should see some benefits from people interested in information and data about the risk environment, but at the same time, if we – if our customers start going under stress, we might have to think about how we negotiate with them to accompany them in their – in if they have difficult times. I’m going to hand it over to Ewout to mention a little bit more about indices impact as well as the other businesses.\nEwout Steenbergen: Jeff of course, immediately thinking at the more market sensitive businesses, ratings transaction revenue, the AUM fees in the index business, but offset by of course a higher ETD volumes. And as Doug mentioned before, the capital markets platform business in the enterprise solutions part of market intelligence, but the offset is that we are seeing other parts of the businesses doing well when we have higher volatility for example global trading services and commodity insight just to mention one area. On top of it, we are then having the opportunity to take further actions. You could say to some extent, we’re already executing on our downturn playbook at this moment and taking those actions for the second half of this year, and that is to protect our margins. And we can of course pull those levers even harder. I would like to point out that actually the merger gives us a very good basis and a strong benefit to deal with a more uncertain environment and future. The resiliency of the business, the higher level of recurring revenues that we are having, the diversification benefit and then also of course, all the synergies that we can achieve. And those gives us levers in terms of offsetting an environment that we think is a clear benefit and is a differentiator for us compared to many others.\nJeff Silber: Okay. That’s really helpful. If I could shift back to the ratings business, we saw a pretty large bond sale yesterday from Apple. I don’t know if there were a frequent issue or not. I don’t know if you were involved, if that’ll impact your transactional revenues, but more importantly, they seem to be a pretty good timer over the market. Do you think that might be a bellwether that we’ll see other companies come to market that we might not have expected a few weeks ago?\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Jeff, we’ve actually seen pretty strong issuance from the investment grade sector. A lot of those large issuers, especially financial institutions tend to be on frequent issuer programs, where we really see the biggest impact on the downdraft of issuances in the non-investment grade, the high yield sector, you’re looking at the B, CCC, BB sectors. So there’s been very low formation of CLOs. In fact, we’ve seen the retail sector have withdrawals from risk positions and so we’ve seen a decrease in funding for CLOs. So there – the real part of the issuance curve, which we’re not seeing any life at all is really the high yield sector. But on the on the investment grade, there has been a lot of activity, we’ve seen in particular financial institutions very active, and then people like Apple, you’ve seen there, but the real story, we need to look deeper across all of the different segments. And it’s the high yield sector both for loans and bonds that we’ve seen the biggest weakness.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Really helpful. Thanks so much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, thank you, and good morning. I was hoping to follow-up on revenue synergies. And curious if you could give us some examples of areas where you’re seeing the most traction at this point.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. So first of all, we’re – as I said earlier, we’re really excited that we’re off to such a fast start on the cross-sell. And so the initial opportunities have are on cross-sell and the two biggest areas we’ve seen the growth is in the market intelligence business, it’s been with the sales of what had traditionally been financial services products for example, products which are used for Investor Relations teams and finding the corporate segment, which market intelligence had a lot of penetration with being able to open that door and bring those types of products to the corporate sector. In the commodity insights world, we see a lot of opportunities for data and research products, which were coming from the ENR side from IHS Markit that are now being marketed to the traditional plats clients that were benchmark clients. And so we’ve seen a lot of upside there. A third area would be within the index business. As you know, we brought the IHS Markit’s fixed income index business over, and there’s a lot of opportunities. These are not necessarily in our run rate yet, but they’re in our pipeline related to ESG Indices that will be on fixed income indices. So that’s a big theme that we haven’t seen necessarily the revenue coming in yet, but a lot of interest in that, but those would be the three largest areas so far.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the rating side of the business, you were just talking about high yield. And I’m curious as we look at your refinancing study, assuming the volatility eases as we get into 2023. And I know you said you won’t comment on 2023, but I just wanted to get just a holistic view around how you think about the high yield market normalizing from here.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. The high yield market we look at in a few ways, one of them is obviously there’s a large amount of firepower of capital that’s available for the private equity in the sponsor industry. We estimate that that’s well north of $1 trillion somewhere around $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion of capital be deployed. We also look at the M&A pipeline, the M&A pipeline right now there’s a lot of deals to be completed, but they’re actually taking a lot of time. So there’s a slow realization of M&A, which has already been announced, but not completed. So that’s another one of the levers we look at quite closely. And then there’s going to be a refinancing requirement, they’ll be start coming in over, which relates to 2023, 2024, 2025. Traditionally, we’ve seen some of that pull forward into earlier times as people look at how the interest rate market is playing out what their growth prospects are, et cetera, but those would be the key factors we’re looking at the what’s happening with rates, what’s happening with the private equity industry, with M&A, with refinancing. And then just generally speaking, as you know, I mentioned earlier to one of the other answers, there’s kind of a risk off approach, especially from the retail and the wealth management sectors. They have not been participating in the formation of new CLOs. And in fact, have been withdrawing their liquidity from the high yield products. So we think that we will start seeing people go back into that when there’s some more uncertainty and stability in the markets as well.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Faiza.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. You may go ahead.\nTrevor Romeo: Hi, good morning. This is actually Trevor Romeo on for Andrew. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Just two quick ones for me. First of all, the ESG revenue growth of 66% in a quarter, it’s encouraging to see that accelerate kind of even further. Just wondering if there’s anything in the current environment that’s kind of boosting that ESG growth above trend or if there’s kind of any evidence that even higher growth rates might be sustainable over a longer period of time.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Good morning. So let me give you a little bit more color on the ESG growth, which is of course phenomenal and we’re very happy because we have been guiding to a 46% CAGR for a multi-year period and to be coming in at this kind of a level of growth of 66% is of course really great. So a couple of underlying elements, we’re seeing nice growth in commodity insights that’s written by clean energy technology, energy transition activities, as well as new price assessments around ESG. Also market intelligence doing well, particularly around climate and the true cost offerings and the ESG data sales. If we look at the Indices business, we have been investing a lot in new ESG Indices, and that is also clearly starting to payoff. And then in ratings, although coming from a small base, we see some positive momentum in second party or opinion, so good momentum. We’re clearly investing in it. There’s a lot of market demands and we would expect that positive momentum in ESG to continue.\nTrevor Romeo: That’s great. Thanks. And then maybe a somewhat related follow-up. The Inflation Reduction Act that’s been proposed out there has pretty significant climate investments and tax credits for the clean energy industry. So would you see something like that if it actually were to get past kind of having any demand on either the commodity insights business or the ESG business? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: It’s something that’s still obviously in discussion in Washington. Generally speaking, infrastructure bills something like this, which is going to be geared towards the climate sector could see some benefit as it – as the financing gets into the market, but this could take a while before we really start seeing it layer into the market.\nTrevor Romeo: Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Trevor.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may go ahead.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. My first question, on commodity insights, curious in the second quarter, what percent of the revenues there were fossil fuel based about by the end customer? And then along the same lines there, when are you guys expecting peak oil use globally? Then I have a follow-up\nDoug Peterson: On the first question about the fossil fuel based, I don’t have the answer. We’ll have to get back to you on that. But just remember that across the business, a large part of our complex relates to – it relates to energy. But in addition, we’ve seen some great opportunities to increase our knowledge across the group. As an example, we issued a special study on copper, which even though copper isn’t a fossil fuel, copper is going to be necessary component for the energy transition. So we’ll have to get back to you to the answer on the fossil fuel question.\nCraig Huber: And then also can you talk a little bit about the your market intelligence area that the health of the – of your customers there right now given the market volatility. What’s the sales pipeline looking like? Just talk about that, please. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. The commodity insights business actually despite knowing that the price of oil is quite high is a healthy pipeline right now. There’s a lot of demand for information. As I mentioned, the special copper study we’ve done, we have been deploying a whole new set of energy transition products. So even if there’s been some concern, some of the traditional areas of some of the consumers of oil and gas might have a little bit more stress. The overall market is still very robust with the energy industry itself in a strong position, the commodity industries are looking for a lot new insights, information and data. And then we’re being able to find new opportunities to mix and match our data across the entire company. As an example, we’ve launched some new indices through the index business, which relate to commodities data. So we’re finding a lot of opportunities across the company to mix and match products. We see a strong growth pipeline.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks. Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Could you please give us an update on your ability to pass through some of the inflationary cost to your customers through with pricing in each segment. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Hello, Owen, and let me give you some further insights on that. So when we think about pricing, we always first start to think about the value we generate for our customers. So that’s the starting point. And as you know, our products are very valuable. They’re important, particularly in an current environment with high volatility, lot of economic uncertainty, our research, our datasets, our insights, all the consumption of it is even higher in the current period of times. And then we also know our base products itself are very valuable for our customers. So that is always the starting point before we start to think about pricing. Obviously in an high inflationary environment, it’s fair to consider passing on a part of our cost price increases to our customers, if that is appropriate and balanced in relation to what I said before. And we’re doing that selectively. So think about custom and data subscriptions in index, there we have made some changes and also we have made a list price change in the ratings business now starting on August 1. So a mid-year change also for the ratings fees. So those are a couple of examples, but always in the context of finding the right balance for the company and thinking about the health of the company, the retention levels and the interest of our customers from a medium and long-term perspective.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That’s helpful. And then on the dealer revenue in your Mobility segment, I think it was quite strong up 10% year-over-year. Could you please talk about maybe the drive of that strength from CARFAX and also the sustainability of this growth? And then more broadly, could you please also talk about the retention rate of the Mobility business? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yeah. Thanks, Owen. This is a business that is benefiting tremendously from all of the disruption in the supply chain and the automotive manufacturing sector. The dealers right now are really in a high need for information about the used car sector, which is where the most movement is going. They’re working very closely with the manufacturers and the OEMs on programs about providing discounts, providing incentives for new car sales. So the dealers right now are in the middle of a very high demand low product environment. And so CARFAX has been benefiting across the board. So all the CARFAX businesses, as well as Automotive Mastermind, there were a couple of new products that were launched. One that’s called – it’s called an EyeQ, spelled E-Y-E-Q product, which provides a balance between the manufacturing and the dealer segment to look at how incentives and discounts are provided. So this is an area where CARFAX has been tremendously benefited by this difficult environment. And it’s really the dealers that have the highest demand.\nOwen Lau: Got it. Thank you very much.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thanks Owen.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. I see that you have your third straight quarter of upstream data ACV growth adjusted for Russia-Ukraine. I guess my question, is it continuing to accelerate or can you just give us any sense of the order of the magnitude of the growth in that business, given obviously revenue is lagging.\nEwout Steenbergen: Jeff, in fact, this is the third consecutive quarter that we’re seeing ACV growth in the upstream business. Of course, a bit impacted by the Russia situation. So think about it more in the revenue growth of around 3.5%, if you exclude that Russia impact for the quarter itself for revenues in the upstream business. So I would call this a turnaround. This is a business that had a very difficult period for the last few years, but coming out of it in a very strong way, clearly, the overall situation in the energy markets are helping this business. The levels of CapEx that are going into this industry are going up. So very positive momentum and we would expect that also to continue in the near future.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then Ewout, I get that you’re saying the adjustments in terms of segment margin guidance are small. I get that, I guess, are the adjustments driven by the pricing or the inflationary pressure that you’re seeing. Or is there also some reallocation of corporate cost, because of the lower revenue outlook in the rating segment that get absorbed into those other segments? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: No changes with respect to financial reporting allocations and so on, actually allocations are coming down, because of the synergies, of course, also helped by the management actions that we highlighted. So what you are seeing is actually a really a very mix shift of reasons what is happening in the different businesses. So I was speaking about the assumptions, for example, in the Index business, with respect to the AUM level, staying flat in our assumption for the second half of the year, the impact of Russia in Commodity Insights offset by strong commercial momentum. So a very different set of reasons for each of the segments. But I think overall, these impacts are relatively small. I think the main area, of course, that you are seeing is the impact of the outlook for ratings, where we are not assuming any improvements in the issuance environment for the second half of the year compared to what we’ve seen in the more recent past. But five of our six divisions from our perspective, performing very well, quite resilient are seeing good, healthy revenue growth and strong margin expansion. And we think margin expansion in this environment is actually a really positive that we can deliver to our shareholders.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to your issuance outlook. You’re forecasting a 30% to 45% decline in build issuance for this year. Can you clarify if your updated guidance assumes that issuance trends will mirror performance we’ve seen in June and July? Or if you’re assuming issuance over the remaining five months will be similar to the first seven months of the year effectively calling up bottoming in issuance performance year-to-date.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. George, the second half of the year’s assumption is that it’s similar to June and July. If you actually look at any year, the second half of the year is always has lower level of issuance in the first half of the year. If you think about it, you’ve got the summer months in there, you’ve got July and August, which are always quite slow. And then you’ve got some holidays towards the end of the year in the U.S. market, which are also quite slow. So we’re expecting that there will be the issuance level will be similar to what it’s been the last couple months.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. And is that on an absolute dollar basis of issuance or is that seasonally adjusted looking at year-over-year growth trends?\nDoug Peterson: Both.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. Got it. And then a as a follow-up, maybe going back to Commodity Insights, you’re calling for mid-single-digit growth and that outlook was unchanged from your prior outlook. You mentioned Russia, of course, being a headwind, but can you talk about other moving pieces in the business? I would’ve expect Commodity Insights potentially to benefit more from some of the commodity prices we’ve seen.\nEwout Steenbergen: George. So if we look at the underlying components and the sales activity, we’re actually seeing record sales levels of the last few quarters for Commodity Insights, clearly highlighting the benefit of the combined business. We are now having the benefit are the commodity prices today net-net, that’s a good situation for our customers. The benefit we are seeing from some of the revenue synergies, although, it’s early and the numbers are low that is clearly benefit. And then of course, on top of that, also the focus on energy transition, which leads to additional investments. And we have of course, an incredible level of expertise around that, that we can help our customers. So across the Board, in each of the categories, if it is advisory and transactional, if it is upstream, price assessments and the resource data and insights, I think all of that is looking very positive. Yes, there is a little bit of the impact of Russia 10 months of impact this year, because that impact started more or less in March. Then you will see a little bit of impact for two months next year, then we will be lapping that and then I think all the underlying drivers of positive momentum will continue.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. You may go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you. I cut out a little bit, and so I’m not sure if you addressed this in prior discussions. But in the Mobility segment, dealing with very strong demand in CARFAX because of used cars in the like. If you would see – if we start to see some improvement in supply chain over the next year or so, do you expect that we’re going to see a little bit of a balancing out in some of the other areas we’ll do better? Or do you expect that we’re going to start to see just not seeing the same kind of growth that we saw beforehand in terms of CARFAX.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thanks, Shlomo. We think that this Mobility segment has a many – has a very high growth trajectory ahead of it. If you look at a couple of different factors, one that I described earlier relates to the used car environment, where right now there’s very low production of new automobiles, which is taking place, which means that there is a need for dealers to have product. They don’t have product right now. So when they get it, they can sell it, they can sell it at premium. They need the data in the analytics, whether it’s from Automotive Mastermind or it’s the CARFAX product. So there’s a high demand right now for that. And the dealer’s approach to working with customers is not going to go away even as the global production starts coming back. And there’s going to be a revolution taking place in the transmission system such will move toward electric vehicles. So the dealer approach is going to stay quite important. We think the manufacturing approach could actually benefit from much higher growth of production. You see that we think that the global production will start continuing to increase over the next few years going up – even up to 9% in 2023 in the Slide that we produced. There’s another area which we think has some opportunities for growth, which is financials. And we’ve been producing some new products for the financial sector. We talked about one of them earlier, which is some credit information for the insurance industry, as well as the financial services industry on the automotive sector. So across the board, we think this is a segment, which is going through a lot of change. There’s a lot of disruption taking place and it’s an opportunity for us to be at the middle of that to provide the data and the insights and analytics, the dealers and audit manufacturers and financial institutions need to make informed decisions.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. And then, Ewout, this is just maybe a housekeeping one. But what was the ending share count? Not the average share count in the quarter, but kind of the ending share count. And should we expect that to be very different next quarter in terms of kind of finishing up the ASRs. Just trying to figure out, make sure we’re – at least our modeling the share count appropriately.\nEwout Steenbergen: Shlomo, we put a specific slide in the appendix to help you with your question and where you can see the decline of the overall share count over the period of this year. So we started with 360 – sorry, 356 million of combined shares after the issuance of shares for the IHS Markit shareholders. That has come down to 339 million most recently. We expect about 5 million of shares to be delivered as a true up for the $8.5 billion ASR that will be ended soon. Then we will enter into the new $2.5 billion ASR, the upfront delivery of that would be something like 6 million of share, so somewhere later this month, we all have those also taken out. So you could say about 25% of the shares that were issued for the IHS Markit have already been removed in a period of six months, which we think is phenomenal. And then of course, we get the true up of the new ASR of $2.5 billion and shares that will be delivered for the 1 million at the end of the year. So that is the decline, but more details you can find in the appendix of the slide to help you and all your colleagues with the mobile link.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Shlomo.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. I just wanted to go back to Slide 31 Market Intelligence, where desktop, which is where I want to focus was up 6%. And you did mention strong new sales and renewals. I know this is an area where you’re adding content and data to Cap IQ Pro, I just wanted to know how much of this is kind of market driven versus your kind of product upgrade driven. And do you expect momentum in your desktop business in the second half of the year?\nDoug Peterson: Good morning, Andrew. We are very pleased with the trends we’re seeing with respect to desktop, very stable business, growing in a steady way. We see good commercial momentum. We see good user satisfaction levels, and that is translating in high retention, nice growth of annualized contract value, pickup of price increases based on the enterprise approach we are doing with respect to our contracts. And then also [indiscernible] of the products is going up. Satisfaction level also better think about page loads that are going much faster than we had in the past. So overall, we like what we are seeing in desktop growing nicely steadily and good commercial momentum and great customer satisfaction around it.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our final question from Russell Quelch with Redburn. You may go ahead.\nRussell Quelch: Yes. Thank you for having me and appreciate it. To be on the current catch up buyback, can you just lay out your priorities for use of excess capital? Should we be expecting our phones in the second half of this year? And if we should, perhaps, what areas do you believe you are light in terms of data and product suite? Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: So I would say this in the following way and by the way, thank you for joining the call and thank you for initiating your coverage on S&P Global. We are looking at continued return of capital. We have our specific targets with respect to our capital management philosophies, and we will continue to execute on that. We’re very happy that we will continue with the 12 billion share buyback, despite lowering our adjusted free cash flow for the full year. We have sufficient ability to complete to 12 billion, and then we’ll continue with returning capital to our shareholders next year with the at least 85% of free cash flow. We have no plans with respect to large M&A at this moment, maybe some small tuck-in and bolt-ons where we can find some nice additions to our propositions. Think about ESG, but otherwise no changes with respect to the plans, the philosophy and the targets will continue on the path that you’re used to see from us.\nRussell Quelch: Thanks, Ewout. I’ll leave it there. Thanks for your comments.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Russell. Well, as we close the call, I want to thank everyone again for joining it for your questions and for your support. As I said at the beginning of the call, it’s incredible to see that within just five months, how much stronger and resilient we are as a new company with S&P Global and IHS Markit. We have a very robust integration management office in place, we call it the IMO. We’re partnering with all of the businesses together with a new management team to create value and to ensure that we can create this unified vision to deliver S&P Global. None of the progress would be possible without the commitment and really hard work of our people. They’ve done a fantastic job and I do want to thank them again for their effort as they’ve been working for over 1.5 years, two years to get ready for this deal. And now the last five months to really make sure it’s moving along. I’m really pleased that all of us have come together to do such a great job so far, and we want to continue to deliver. I hope that everyone has an enjoyable summer and want to thank everybody for joining the call today. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes this morning’s call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&P Global’s website for one year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month. On behalf of S&P Global, we thank you for participating and wish you a good day.",

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. With five of our six divisions, once again, posting revenue growth, we continue to see evidence that we are a stronger, more resilient company. Doug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. As Doug mentioned, the adjusted financial metrics that we will be discussing today, refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude a contribution from divested businesses in all periods. Adjusted corporate and allocated expenses declined from a year ago, caused by synergies as well as a combination of reduced incentive and fringe cost, as well as the release of certain accruals. Our net interest expense increased 3%, as we increased gross debt partially offset the lower average rates due to refinancings. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the post merger change in the mix of income by jurisdiction. As most are aware, we exclude the impact of certain items from our adjusted diluted EPS number. Among those items in the second quarter were $220 million in merger-related expenses. The details of which can be found in the appendix. We generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items of $924 million. We remain committed to returning the majority of this cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. Year-to-date, as Doug mentioned, we have repurchased $8.5 billion in shares, and we expect to launch an additional $2.5 billion in the coming weeks. We expect that $2.5 billion will be completed in October with the final $1 billion to be completed by year-end. We note that U.S. dollar has strengthened against many foreign currencies year-to-date, and we have seen a corresponding impact on both our revenue and expenses. Approximately three-fourth of our international revenue is invoiced in U.S. dollars, which provides some protection to revenue against FX volatility. In addition to the natural hedges that exist due to the global footprint of our people, we have an active hedging program in place that further mitigates the ultimate impact on our earnings. Year-to-date, we have seen an unfavorable revenue impact due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and British Pound. Expenses saw a favorable impact due to FX movements against those same currencies and the Indian Rupee. Turning to expenses, as we have demonstrated in the past, we are committed to prudent management of the P&L and shareholder capital. This year, we have already taken decisive actions to protect margins where we can, while still preserving our investments to drive future growth. Actions taken include a reduction in incentive accruals pull forward in synergies, adjustments to the timing of select investments, forcing selective hiring, and limiting consulting spend in some areas. We remain committed to our strategic investments, which are key to the growth of our business. These include investments in our people, innovation, infrastructure, and our ability to execute merger-related integration and synergies. Looking at the year-over-year change in expenses this quarter, we're clearly seeing the impact of inflation, most notably in compensation expenses. We're also seeing higher cloud and T&E cost as we highlighted last quarter as well. Even with those headwinds, the decisive actions I outlined, together with our acceleration of synergies and favorable FX have allowed us to keep expenses relatively flat year-over-year. Now, I would like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the second quarter, we have achieved $80 million in cumulative cost synergies and our current annualized run rate is $260 million. Through the combined efforts of our teams across the divisions and corporate, we're very pleased to see we're outperforming our initial timeline on both revenue and cost synergies year-to-date. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the second quarter is $540 million. Our teams have been diligent and disciplined and have pulled forward some of the synergies we previously identified without materially impacting our ability to drive growth and revenue synergies. We have previously said that we expect to realize in 2022, approximately 35% to 40% of the $600 million in cost synergies, we're targeting through 2024. We're still operating in an uncertain environment. So while we're not changing the expected range for 2022, we're confident that we're more likely to come out at the higher end of the 35% to 40% target range. Now let's turn to the deficient results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 7% with growth across all product lines. We want to emphasize the increased resilience and stickiness of most of our revenue and the more diversified portfolio of products in our deficient post merger. To highlight this improvement, we know that in Market Intelligence recurring revenue, which includes variable recurring revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue this quarter, slightly higher compared to the same period last year. Expenses increased 6% primarily due to increases in compensation expense, cloud spent and outside services, offset by cost synergies and lower incentive compensation. Market Intelligence remains the biggest drive of cost synergies from the merger and the synergy outperformance we have seen year-to-date. Segment operating profit increased 8% and the segment operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 33%. On a trailing 12 month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin was 30.2%. You can see on the slide, our operating profit from the OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division. The JV contributed $25 million in adjusted operating profit to the company because the JV is a 50%-owned joint venture operating independent of the company. We do not include the financial results OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category and on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 6%, Data And Advisory Solutions revenue grew 9%, Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 2%, and Credit and Risk Solutions revenue grew 10%. For Enterprise Solutions, we continue to see headwinds in several of our volume driven products that rely on equity and debt capital markets activity, and the variable subscription terms. Excluding the impact of these volume driven products, growth across Market Intelligence would've been approximately 8% year-over-year in the quarter. We expect those volume driven headwinds to persist through the rest of the year. While we are pleased with the outperformance of credit and risk solutions in the first half, we're lapping some difficult columns in the second half and expect revenue growth to decelerate in debt part of the business. Ratings faced continued difficult market conditions this quarter, with revenue declining 26% year-over-year. Expenses decreased 6%, primarily driven by disciplined expense management, including lower incentive expenses, as well as lower occupancy cost and favorable FX, partially offset by increased salary and fringe expenses and T&E spent. This resulted in a 35% decrease in segment operating profit and 850 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 12-month basis adjusted segment operating profit margin was 59.8%. Non-transaction revenue increased 2% on a constant currency basis and decreased 1% as reported primarily due to lower initial credit ratings and ratings evaluation services revenues, partially offset by increases in CRISIL and annual fees. Transaction revenue decreased 44% on the continued soft issuance already discussed. This slide depicts ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in ratings revenue were a 39% decrease in corporates and a 20% decrease in structured finance, driven predominantly a structured credit. In addition, financial services decreased 9%, governments decreased 15% and the CRISIL and other category increased 14%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 4%. However, debt growth was impacted significantly by the suspension of commercial activity in Russia and Belarus, and other impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Adjusting for the impact of that conflict revenues would have grown approximately 7% compared to prior year. On an annualized run rate basis, this conflict is expected to impact CI revenue and operating income by approximately $52 million and $51 million respectively. For this quarter, 90% of Commodity Insights revenues were classified as recurring. Expenses increased 4% primarily due to salary and fringe, and increase in T&E expense, partially offset by realization of merger related synergies. Segment operating profit increased 3% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 44%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin was 43.3%. Looking across the Commodity Insights business categories, price assessments grew 5% compared to prior year driven by strong subscription growth for market data offerings and continued commercial momentum. We also saw strong performance from advisory and transactional services, and energy and resources, data and insights, both growing 4% respectively. Upstream data and insights increased marginally with second quarter 2022, representing the third consecutive quarter of ACV growth, when adjusting for the impact of Russia. In our Mobility division revenue increased 7% year-over-year driven primarily by strength in planning solutions and used car offerings. For this quarter 78% of mobility's revenues were classified as recurring. Expenses grew 5%, unplanned increases in headcount and advertising expense, which were somewhat offset by reduction in purchase data and office cost, and incentive compensation. This resulted in a 9% growth in adjusted operating profit and 90 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 39.5%. Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong performance from CARFAX and very high dealer retention as well as growth in new stores. Growth in manufacturing was 3% year-over-year driven by demand for supply chain products among suppliers though growth are tempered by relatively flat original equipment manufacturer or OEM spent on marketing initiatives powered by mobility products. Financials, and other increased 3% primarily driven by continued strength in our insurance underwriting products tempered by slowing consumer activity and persistent low volumes across auto sales. S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth of 12% year-over-year primarily due to gains in ETD volumes. For this quarter, 83% of Indices revenues were classified as recurring during the quarter expenses increased 1% due to increased technology and T&E expense. Segment operating profit increased 16% and the segment operating profit margin increased 290 basis points to 71.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin are 68.6%. Once again, every category increased revenue this quarter, asset-linked fees were up 5% primarily from AUM driven gains in mutual funds and ETFs. Exchange traded derivative revenue increased 64% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including the more than 60% increase in S&P 500 index options volume. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6% driven by new business activities. Over the past year, ETF AUM net inflows were $231 billion and market depreciation totaled $352 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.5 trillion, which is a 5% decrease compared to one year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM which increased 5% year-over-year. Revenue tends to lack changes in asset prices, which helped drive outperformance this quarter. However, we expect asset-linked fees to decrease in the back half of this year, sequentially versus the end of the first quarter ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $6 billion in marketed depreciation totaled $436 billion. Within our Engineering Solutions division, we saw 3% revenue growth driven primarily by growth in non-subscription offerings. Most notably the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. For this quarter 93% of Engineering Solutions revenues were classified as recurring. Adjusted expenses, increased 5% driven by investment in product development and increased royalties. This resulted in a 7% decline in segments operating profit and 300 basis points contraction to margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin was 19.4%. Subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions increased 2% year-over-year, while non-subscription revenue increased 10% over the same period. As you look toward next quarter for Engineering Solutions, it will be important to remember we'll lap the August 2021 duplication of the BPVC, which typically contributes approximately $8 million in the third quarter of odd years, but is not published in even years. Now moving to our guidance. And this slide depicts our new GAAP guidance. And this slide depicts our reinstated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. For revenue, we now expect a low-to-mid single digit decrease year-over-year, reflecting the issuance environment, partially offset by the strength we're seeing in our non-ratings businesses. We now expect corporate and allocated expense between $70 million and $80 million, approximately $15 million lower than our previous guidance on lower forecasted incentive compensation. This drives our expectation for adjusted operating margins between 45.3% and 45.8% as declines in high margin ratings revenue disproportionately impacts margins to the downside this year. We wanted to emphasize the margin expansion we expect to see elsewhere in the business. In aggregate within our five non-ratings divisions, we expect approximately 180 basis points of operating margin expansion this year. Interest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, in-line with our most recent guidance. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $165 million and free cash flow excluding certain items in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. The following slide illustrates our guidance by division. We now expect adjusted revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin in the following ranges. For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digit range and margins in the low-30%. For Ratings, we now expect revenue declines in the low-to-mid 20% range and margins in the mid-to-high 50%. For Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the mid single digit range and margins in the mid 40%. For Mobility we expect revenue growth in the high single digit range and margins in the high 30%. For Indices we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digit range and margins in the mid-to-high 60%. For Engineering Solutions, we expect low single digit revenue growth and margins in the mid-teens. In closing this quarter provides further proof of the resilience of our business. Our ability to outperforming synergies speaks volumes on the focus and discipline of the teams we have at S&P Global. Those teams combined with a phenomenal set of truly differentiated products and capabilities position us well to drive profitable growth in the years to go. And with that Let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Ashih Good morning. This is Ewout. So 40% of $600 million, so we expect therefore in year 2022, approximately $240 million benefit from cost synergies. We think that's phenomenal that we're already having that pace of execution and integration of our organizations. We don't have a precise number for you in terms of the run rate exit, but you should expect that it is a significant amount above the $240 million, because obviously the more we execute this year, the better we are positioned for 2023. So I can't give you a precise number on that, but that will be a number significantly north of that $240 million. Manav, good morning. Yes. We have always said that our businesses are very resilient, but of course they're not immune to an external environment. So is some slight impact you are seeing in terms of, for example the Index business, the assumption for the second half of the year is that assets under management will remain flat from the June 30 point. So that will have an impact on the index business. So there's several of those. Another example is the Russia impact on Commodity Insights. But overall these impacts are relatively minimal and modest. So let me give you a few other data points with respect to the assumptions that have gone into the guidance. So as already mentioned, build issuance negative 37%, then for the market appreciation flat to the June 30 level, exchange traded derivative, we expect those to be up about 10% from the second half of 2021 that is lower growth than you have seen in the first half of the year. And the reason is that the comps become more difficult, but also when there is a period of extended volatility, we expect this trading to taper off at some point. And then the brand overall[ph] price to remain in range bound until end of the year. Having said that if you look at the overall performance of the company, we're actually really pleased with the outlook for five of our six division. They are expected to perform very well to be very strong, expenses to be more or less flat year-over-year, which we think is really a phenomenal outcome in a high inflationary environment. And then margins excluding ratings to be up for the full year 180 basis points. So overall we think these are actually really strong outlooks for the company, taking aside of course the market impact for ratings. Well we are seeing a lot of dynamics in the overall expenses of the company. We have pointed at some inflationary pressures on compensation, on some of our procurement, elements and other parts of the company, but we are in a very fortunate position that we have so many levers as a company, particularly the levers that are being given to us due to the merger with respect to the cost synergies, duplication of roles that we can eliminate, the volume benefits in terms of synergies in the procurement and the sourcing area, some of the consolidation of real estate and many other areas, plus the decisive management actions we're taking at this moment. So being flat with expenses as I just said, in this environment we think is a very strong outcome. The non ratings businesses were achieving about $200 million or north of $200 million of margin expansion in the second quarter. And we think 180 basis points margin expansion for the full year would be a very strong outcome and would position us very well for 2023. Thanks Manav. Alex these are really small changes and movements on the revenue line and with respect to the expense line for those two segments, which could drive that, for example, you're just staying within the range on revenues, but just having a slight adjustment with respect to the expected margins for that segment. So let me take as an example Commodity Insights, as we have highlighted, this is the segment where we have some impact of the Russian situation, but then that is offset by very positive momentum commercially in the Commodity Insights businesses. So we can offset a part of it. And as a result, you see a little bit of impact on revenue and margins and that is being reflected in those changes. But overall, I wouldn't read too much into it. These are just really minor impacts that we are seeing on those businesses. Jeff of course, immediately thinking at the more market sensitive businesses, ratings transaction revenue, the AUM fees in the index business, but offset by of course a higher ETD volumes. And as Doug mentioned before, the capital markets platform business in the enterprise solutions part of market intelligence, but the offset is that we are seeing other parts of the businesses doing well when we have higher volatility for example global trading services and commodity insight just to mention one area. On top of it, we are then having the opportunity to take further actions. You could say to some extent, we're already executing on our downturn playbook at this moment and taking those actions for the second half of this year, and that is to protect our margins. And we can of course pull those levers even harder. I would like to point out that actually the merger gives us a very good basis and a strong benefit to deal with a more uncertain environment and future. The resiliency of the business, the higher level of recurring revenues that we are having, the diversification benefit and then also of course, all the synergies that we can achieve. And those gives us levers in terms of offsetting an environment that we think is a clear benefit and is a differentiator for us compared to many others. Jeff, in fact, this is the third consecutive quarter that we're seeing ACV growth in the upstream business. Of course, a bit impacted by the Russia situation. So think about it more in the revenue growth of around 3.5%, if you exclude that Russia impact for the quarter itself for revenues in the upstream business. So I would call this a turnaround. This is a business that had a very difficult period for the last few years, but coming out of it in a very strong way, clearly, the overall situation in the energy markets are helping this business. The levels of CapEx that are going into this industry are going up. So very positive momentum and we would expect that also to continue in the near future. No changes with respect to financial reporting allocations and so on, actually allocations are coming down, because of the synergies, of course, also helped by the management actions that we highlighted. So what you are seeing is actually a really a very mix shift of reasons what is happening in the different businesses. So I was speaking about the assumptions, for example, in the Index business, with respect to the AUM level, staying flat in our assumption for the second half of the year, the impact of Russia in Commodity Insights offset by strong commercial momentum. So a very different set of reasons for each of the segments. But I think overall, these impacts are relatively small. I think the main area, of course, that you are seeing is the impact of the outlook for ratings, where we are not assuming any improvements in the issuance environment for the second half of the year compared to what we've seen in the more recent past. But five of our six divisions from our perspective, performing very well, quite resilient are seeing good, healthy revenue growth and strong margin expansion. And we think margin expansion in this environment is actually a really positive that we can deliver to our shareholders. George. So if we look at the underlying components and the sales activity, we're actually seeing record sales levels of the last few quarters for Commodity Insights, clearly highlighting the benefit of the combined business. We are now having the benefit are the commodity prices today net-net, that's a good situation for our customers. The benefit we are seeing from some of the revenue synergies, although, it's early and the numbers are low that is clearly benefit. And then of course, on top of that, also the focus on energy transition, which leads to additional investments. And we have of course, an incredible level of expertise around that, that we can help our customers. So across the Board, in each of the categories, if it is advisory and transactional, if it is upstream, price assessments and the resource data and insights, I think all of that is looking very positive. Yes, there is a little bit of the impact of Russia 10 months of impact this year, because that impact started more or less in March. Then you will see a little bit of impact for two months next year, then we will be lapping that and then I think all the underlying drivers of positive momentum will continue. Thanks George. Shlomo, we put a specific slide in the appendix to help you with your question and where you can see the decline of the overall share count over the period of this year. So we started with 360 – sorry, 356 million of combined shares after the issuance of shares for the IHS Markit shareholders. That has come down to 339 million most recently. We expect about 5 million of shares to be delivered as a true up for the $8.5 billion ASR that will be ended soon. Then we will enter into the new $2.5 billion ASR, the upfront delivery of that would be something like 6 million of share, so somewhere later this month, we all have those also taken out. So you could say about 25% of the shares that were issued for the IHS Markit have already been removed in a period of six months, which we think is phenomenal. And then of course, we get the true up of the new ASR of $2.5 billion and shares that will be delivered for the 1 million at the end of the year. So that is the decline, but more details you can find in the appendix of the slide to help you and all your colleagues with the mobile link. So I would say this in the following way and by the way, thank you for joining the call and thank you for initiating your coverage on S&P Global. We are looking at continued return of capital. We have our specific targets with respect to our capital management philosophies, and we will continue to execute on that. We're very happy that we will continue with the 12 billion share buyback, despite lowering our adjusted free cash flow for the full year. We have sufficient ability to complete to 12 billion, and then we'll continue with returning capital to our shareholders next year with the at least 85% of free cash flow. We have no plans with respect to large M&A at this moment, maybe some small tuck-in and bolt-ons where we can find some nice additions to our propositions. Think about ESG, but otherwise no changes with respect to the plans, the philosophy and the targets will continue on the path that you're used to see from us."

            "name": "Doug Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Welcome to today's second quarter earnings call. Our second quarter results demonstrate the combined efforts of our truly incredible team. After our first 100 days as a combined company, it's clear than ever that after the merger S&P Global is stronger, more resilient, more diversified and better positioned than ever. We're maintaining fiscal and operational discipline and controlling what can be controlled, which is allowing us to post aggregate results in a challenging issuance environment that would've been inconceivable prior to the merger. Let me start with our financial highlights. As a reminder, the adjusted financial metrics will be discussing today referred to non-GAAP adjusted metrics in the current period and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period. Revenue decreased 5% year-over-year with growth in five of our six divisions providing significant ballast against a 26% decrease in ratings revenue. Recurring revenue increased 5% year-over-year, representing 81% of revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses only increased 1% as continued investment in inflation pressures on compensation and technology were almost entirely offset by cost synergies in the quarter. We're reinstating our guidance, which reflects the challenging macroeconomic environment. Though, we will be able to offset some of the EPS impact is Ewout will discuss in a moment. Importantly, our updated guidance calls for a smaller than 2% decrease in adjusted EPS at the midpoint, illustrating the resilience of the businesses and the positive impact of our capital allocation strategy. I would also like to share a few other highlights from the second quarter. As I mentioned, we are now more than 100 days past the merger close. Our post integration efforts are proceeding on schedule, but very importantly, we're outperforming on both cost and revenue synergies. Momentum continues on product development with several areas of innovation that will highlight for you on today's call. We see benefits from market volatility in parts of our businesses, and we're able to accelerate our share repurchase efforts relative to our original plan with $8.5 billion near completion at an average share price below $360. We expect to launch an additional $2.5 billion ASR in the coming weeks, which we expect to complete in October with the final $1 billion to be completed by year end. We've already seen remarkable progress in our integration efforts in a relatively short period. I'm pleased with our progress in integrating our commercial and marketing teams. We've recorded more than 2,000 cross-sell referrals across the divisions. We're also ahead of expectations on our cost synergies realizing approximately $80 million year-to-date and exiting the quarter in an annualized run rate of more than $260 million. Beyond the transactional milestones related to the merger like the necessary divestitures, we've also reached multiple operational milestones. We've standardized business practices invested in culture and training and established leadership teams multiple layers deep across the enterprise. We're moving fast on our office integration plan and consolidated 10 of our office locations around the world lowering our real estate costs. We completed our major New York City consolidation and are on track to complete our London consolidation in the fourth quarter. When we announced the merger, we highlighted our expectation that the combined company would be more agile, innovative, and entrepreneurial. And we've seen that in initiatives such as the Data Lake Hackathon led by Kensho's Head of AI Research and teams of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and software developers. These teams spent two days exploring how to best leverage Kensho tools in other technologies to derive value from the Data Lake datasets and we're thrilled with what these teams have found in just two days. In addition to finding ways that Kensho solutions can add commercial value to unstructured datasets across the Data Lake. We identified new datasets for training Kensho Scribe, NERD, Link, and Extract, more than doubling current training datasets in some cases. We also identified datasets to improve S&P Global's country risk assessments and found compelling new ways to classify and improve data for ESG. This hackathon enabled us to better realize the full capabilities of our combined datasets. We also re-launch the cross-divisional S&P Global research council with new leadership and membership to reflect the expertise in our combined company following the merger. This council consists of both research and operational leaders with the core mandate to drive customer value and greater insights for markets. One of the first actions of the council was to align on key research teams that have the greatest potential for large scale disruption and have a meaningful impact on the success of our customers. We'll be leveraging the full capabilities across the company and engaging meaningfully with customers and other stakeholders across industry and regulatory bodies. There's incredible demand for insights and thought leadership on topics like energy security, climate, technology and digital disruptions, supply chains, and capital markets. We have unique datasets and insights in all of these areas and we see the research council as a way to make sure that our insights are most impactful for our customers and drive innovation within S&P Global. That focus on accelerating innovation was on full display in the second quarter. We launched exciting new products from commodity insights, including a new basin level methane intensity calculation product for 19 U.S. natural gas production areas. We're using satellite imagery and data models trained in-house to significantly disrupt what has historically been a very manual process using data extracted from self-reported EPA forms. We also launched carbon intensity measures for all six crude grades in the global Brent benchmark. In Mobility, we saw commercial success from our new auto credit insights product to help deliver insights to financial customers serving the automotive credit space. In Engineering Solutions, we continue to make progress building out our new software platform and have two successful proof-of-concept engagements in market now. We continue to innovate in market intelligence as well, making new datasets available via feeds and introducing new products like PVR Source, which is a diligence platform aimed at helping clients get ahead of the compliance challenges of an ever changing regulatory landscape. Now to recap the financial results for the second quarter, revenue decreased 5% to $2.97 billion. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $1.4 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 280 basis points to 47% as both profits and margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in ratings transaction revenue and the expense growth I mentioned earlier. Importantly, our non-ratings businesses in aggregate posted strong growth in the quarter, increasing revenue by 7% year-over-year. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which is 46.1% as of the second quarter through strong and disciplined execution and prudent capital allocation, we were able to offset much of the earnings impact of the issuance environment posting fully diluted EPS of $2.81, representing a 7% decrease year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I'm pleased to report positive growth across five of our divisions with ratings executing very well in an extraordinarily difficult issuance environment. Our more diversified portfolio of products provides many opportunities to thrive in uncertain markets. And we saw double-digit revenue growth in multiple product lines as a result. Within our indices business, we continue to see remarkable strength in our exchange traded derivatives, which grew more than 60% year-over-year, as well as our CDS Indices, which increased 40%. Uncertain in the markets continues to spur demand for our thought leadership and insights and a consolidated platform on which to access information, whether it's tracking market movements, company performance, or supply chain constraints, our customers continue to come to us for help navigating uncertain waters. This help drive 25% growth in aftermarket research and market intelligence. In the second quarter, we celebrated the second anniversary of the S&P Global marketplace. Customers continue to come to S&P Global as a trusted source for differentiated data around ESG, fundamentals, machine readable text, and workflow tools like our work bench. We've seen explosive growth in the marketplace since launch and in the last year, a nearly 30% increase in the content and solutions available, 75% growth in deals closed and more than 200% growth in engagement is measured by page views. Now turning to issuance. During the second quarter, global issuance decreased 37% year-over-year deteriorating further from what we saw last quarter. In the U.S. rated issuance and aggregate decreased 34%, European rated issuance decreased 45%, and in Asia, rated issuance declined 32%. We saw sharp declines in high yield, which was down nearly 80% year-over-year in Asia, and was down more than 80% in the U.S. and Europe. Interestingly, this is the first time that I can recall seeing declines in every category in every region since I've been doing earnings calls. We've included additional details on the sub components of issuance by region in the slide deck. Each year S&P Dow Jones Indices conducts a survey of assets as depicted in this slide, asset levels and actively managed funds that benchmark against our indices increased 38% to $12.8 trillion as of the end of 2021. Assets and passive funds invested in products indexed to our indices increased 32% to $9.9 trillion. Numerous indices support the $9.9 trillion including the S&P 500, the largest with $7 trillion in assets. We've seen strong growth in factor and sector indices as well as many of our ESG and climate related indices. While the S&P 500 still accounts for the majority of AUM, we continue to see strong demand for that historic index among asset managers. We saw even faster growth among our other indices in 2021 evidenced by the fact that the S&P 500 accounted for 71% of indexed AUM in 2021, down from 72% in 2020. While this is historical AUM as of December 2021, we're very excited about what this slide will look like in the years to come, as we integrate IHS Markit Indices like iBoxx and iTraxx and drive commercial innovation in fixed income and cross asset indices. We delivered extraordinary growth in our ESG initiatives this quarter. ESG revenue growth accelerated on both reported and organic basis in the second quarter, growing 66% year-over-year to reach nearly $52 million. We continue to introduce new ESG related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace. In the second quarter, we saw the launch of multiple ESG and sustainability related ETFs based on our indices. And we ended the second quarter with AUM and ESG ETFs growing 16% year-over-year to approximately $30 billion. Our Indices and Commodity Insights teams continued their collaboration and launched the S&P Battery Metals index. Within ratings, we completed 20 ESG evaluations and 34 sustainable financing opinions driven by strong demand for second party opinions. Lastly, we hosted the S&P Global Sustainable1 Summit with events in several major cities around the world, bringing together leaders from various stakeholder groups to discuss the future of sustainability. Now turning to our outlook. Twice a year, we update our global refinancing study, but given the issuance environment, we wanted to provide a bit more color this quarter. Specifically, there are two impacts to highlight as investors look at total global debt outstanding. The two impacts are average time to maturity and FX rates. When we look at global corporate bond maturities, we see a similar phenomenon to what we have witnessed historically. Over the next three years, we see a decrease in near-term maturities as refinancing push those maturity dates out. We've witnessed this phenomena in the July update each year, so we aren't surprised by it. While total global debt maturing over the next three years is down significantly from six months ago, it's important to note that debt maturing over the next 10 years is not down significantly, and it starts to increase over the next three to five years. We expect 2024 and 2025 refinancing activity to start next year. This is particularly true for total debt outstanding on an FX adjusted basis. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since January, foreign denominated debt is lowered by 1% when converted to U.S. dollars at July rates. This slide shows total global debt rated by S&P Global of all maturities on a constant currency basis, which increased 2% if measured at January FX rates. While we don't expect a significant rebound in issuance in a back half of this year, this demonstrates that over the long-term, the public debt markets remain very healthy and have a strong history of resilience. They also reinforce our view that the issuance headwinds we're seeing in the market now will likely moderate, if not reverse in the future. Now for issuance outlook, S&P Global Ratings Research has updated its bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect a decrease in the second quarter and more conservative assumptions around the back half. Global market issuance is now expected to decline approximately 16% year-over-year within a range of down 9% to down 24% in 2022. This forecast implies an approximate 21% decline in the second half compared to the 11% decline seen in the first half. Non-financials are expected to see a 30% decrease in issuance, partially tempered by a smaller, roughly 10% decrease in financial services issuance. U.S. public finance and structured finance are expected to soften by 12% and 14% respectively and international public finance is expected to be roughly flat. As a reminder, the global debt issuance forecast is a product of the S&P Global Ratings Research team and reflects market issuance, including unrated issuance. We wanted to take the opportunity to explain the different categories of issuance that we discussed from time to time. The most frequently cited forecast is out of our S&P Global Ratings Research team, which I just outlined. But our ratings revenue is more closely tied to S&P build issuance, which is a subset of market issuance. Build issuance includes leverage loans, which are not included in the market issuance forecast. It does not, however, include debt from unrated categories, such as medium-term notes and most domestic debt from China, nor would our build issuance include international public finance. While there are other nuances as well, these differences in aggregate bridge the gap between our market issuance forecast and the assumption for build issuance that underpins our ratings revenue guidance for the year. As Ewout will outline, our ratings revenue guidance assumes a 30% to 45% decrease in build issuance. Looking beyond issuance, we see a number of secular trends that stand to benefit the company both this year and beyond. Our experts in Commodity Insights expect oil prices in volatility to remain above historical norms for some time. This volatility often creates more demand among customers for price assessments and benchmarks, as well as our data and insights. Our Mobility team also expects light vehicle sales to increase next year and beyond, returning to levels more in line with pre-pandemic production by 2025. As volumes continue to grow, we expect to see tailwinds in our Mobility segment across multiple product lines, including CARFAX and Automotive Mastermind. As we evaluate the remainder of this year, however, we wanted to discuss some of the assumptions that underpin our outlook. As we noted in June, when we suspended guidance, we've seen a deterioration several economic indicators over the course of the second quarter. We expect slightly lower GDP growth, higher inflation, and a lower debt issuance environment to impact not only our businesses, but our customers, as well. As Ewout will discuss in a moment, we're seeing inflationary pressure on our costs with approximately 70% of our expenses tied to headcount. That pressure is showing up most in our compensation and technology costs. As a reminder, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but we wanted to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions that we make about the global economy when formulating guidance. While we're not discussing 2023 or beyond on today's call, we're pleased to announce an Investor Day that we expect to hold on December 1 in New York City. We're looking forward to sharing with you some preliminary views on 2023, as well as a more holistic update on our strategy positioning and medium term financial targets at that time. Before, handing it over to Ewout, I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the progress we're making on integration and the clear proof points we see reinforcing the industrial logic of the merger and the resilience of our businesses. We have a world-class team and appreciate the hard work and dedication of our people in every area across the firm. Our teams continue to execute incredibly well evidenced by our early outperformance on synergies. And we believe we're positioning the company to accelerate growth, expand margins and deliver innovation in the years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Ewout, to walk through the results and guidance. Ewout? Hi, Ashish. This is Doug. Thanks for the question. Let me just give you first of all, some overall view of what we've given you today. We provided you with information starting with our ratings credit research team, and then gave you some new disclosure about how we look at the difference between that research report and what we call our build issuance assumptions. We see right now, the beginning of the third quarter was actually quite weak. One month doesn't make a quarter, but at the beginning of July, there was issuance of high yield loans and high yield debt was down overall in the high-80%, low-90% range. Investment grade issuance was up actually for the month, but the quarter is off to a, what I'd say is still a pretty weak start, answering your question specifically. Yeah. Alex, thanks for that. And we're actually fully integrated. Market Intelligence is the division that's absolutely the furthest ahead on that. We have done full training of all of the products across the two divisions. We have seen the ability to now go out with joint planning for all customers across the financial services and the Market Intelligence to prior segments. We have a lot of early wins both with clients as well as with products, a couple of examples, some of the early wins have come by moving more and more data sets from financial services into what we talked about earlier on the call to marketplace. We've also seen some early wins on selling products, which would've been traditionally financial service products into the corporate client base of Market Intelligence. And then we have some new products which have also been launched. We talked about one of them, the PVR which is responsive to some new SEC rules, which are coming out later this year. So that must be anecdotal. I'm not sure you were speaking with, but we are really excited about the integration and the speed that we're able to develop a cross-sell. We mentioned that we have over 2,000 cross-sell ideas and leads, and we're following up on those very, very quickly. And as you saw, we're also ahead of our prior assumptions about how we'd be doing with synergy. So this is one of the areas that I think we're actually doing the best on. Thanks Alex. Yeah. Thanks Toni. Well, I feel actually really positive about the projections that we have on the revenue synergies. It's something that we've always known that would take a while to understand the customers, to be able to integrate data sets to have a fully integrated sales force. But to have the ability to already be running it at $15 million run rate which we announced this quarter for me is ahead of what we would've thought we would've been. We still haven't changed the view that a lot of the revenue synergies will be more back-ended in the next two to three years. But the early projections in the early progress is excellent. Yeah. Thanks Toni. Yeah, you're right about, what's comprised of that solutions group. It includes IPO as well. But there's a portion of the revenues in that business which come from IPOs and as you know, the IPO market has been incredibly weak. So that's the main issue which has seen slowed down of growth, but the underlying business is doing quite well. We're delivering software, we're delivering solutions. This is one of the areas where we've seen some of the early wins on being able to position products, which traditionally have been sold to financial services into the corporate sector. So off to a great start, but having some impact from the very, very weak capital markets in IPO positioning. Thanks Toni. Good morning Hamzah, of course I will give you some further insights on that. As you know non-transaction revenues is a bucket of different elements and they are not all pointing in the same direction. So let me give you a little bit further insight in what we're expecting here. So what is looking strong is annual fees as well as CRISIL. So we would expect those to continue to do well for the remainder of the year, in-line of what you have seen for the second quarter. And that will be offset by some impact of FX, ratings evaluation services, which is more linked to M&A and initial credit ratings, which is also down. So I think best to expect a low single digit decline for non-transaction revenue this year, but that is of course in the bigger scheme for ratings providing some offset and stability for the transaction revenue declines. Yeah. Hamzah, as you know our business has already run as if we're regulated and we are regulated in some jurisdictions like the European jurisdiction under what's called the BMR. The SEC has a request for comment out about – for about index providers. We will file a response. As you know, there's a long term trend from active to passive. It's an industry that has very low cost independence, a lot of transparency. We have a very strong performance over the last 65 years, and we'll obviously highlight all of that in our response to the SEC. But as of now, this is just a request for comment. There's nothing related to it. That is any regulatory proposals. And we were not surprised given the size of the growth of the index industry. Thanks Hamzah. Let me start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Ewout to give you some more color. But first of all, we have the assumptions that you saw on Slide 23. We have seen a significant slowdown in growth in the United States, the Eurozone and globally, and China being one of those markets, which is also seemed substantial slowdown given their current policies. This has also been matched with a higher inflation. Each of our businesses have different types of impact in this scenario with the ratings business you've already seen is being directly impacted already by the increase in inflation, by the weak issuance environment, by the uncertainty in the markets. If you looked at our commodity insight business, we could see some growth in the volatility from the higher cost of oil, which you saw here, we have a projected that the crude price will be at $106 and a range that's much higher than it had been in the prior years. That leads to some increase in interest in trading information for risk information and then the overall energy industry does quite well in that positioning. So we could see some benefits from that. Our other businesses market intelligence should see some benefits from people interested in information and data about the risk environment, but at the same time, if we – if our customers start going under stress, we might have to think about how we negotiate with them to accompany them in their – in if they have difficult times. I'm going to hand it over to Ewout to mention a little bit more about indices impact as well as the other businesses. Yes. Jeff, we've actually seen pretty strong issuance from the investment grade sector. A lot of those large issuers, especially financial institutions tend to be on frequent issuer programs, where we really see the biggest impact on the downdraft of issuances in the non-investment grade, the high yield sector, you're looking at the B, CCC, BB sectors. So there's been very low formation of CLOs. In fact, we've seen the retail sector have withdrawals from risk positions and so we've seen a decrease in funding for CLOs. So there – the real part of the issuance curve, which we're not seeing any life at all is really the high yield sector. But on the on the investment grade, there has been a lot of activity, we've seen in particular financial institutions very active, and then people like Apple, you've seen there, but the real story, we need to look deeper across all of the different segments. And it's the high yield sector both for loans and bonds that we've seen the biggest weakness. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. So first of all, we're – as I said earlier, we're really excited that we're off to such a fast start on the cross-sell. And so the initial opportunities have are on cross-sell and the two biggest areas we've seen the growth is in the market intelligence business, it's been with the sales of what had traditionally been financial services products for example, products which are used for Investor Relations teams and finding the corporate segment, which market intelligence had a lot of penetration with being able to open that door and bring those types of products to the corporate sector. In the commodity insights world, we see a lot of opportunities for data and research products, which were coming from the ENR side from IHS Markit that are now being marketed to the traditional plats clients that were benchmark clients. And so we've seen a lot of upside there. A third area would be within the index business. As you know, we brought the IHS Markit's fixed income index business over, and there's a lot of opportunities. These are not necessarily in our run rate yet, but they're in our pipeline related to ESG Indices that will be on fixed income indices. So that's a big theme that we haven't seen necessarily the revenue coming in yet, but a lot of interest in that, but those would be the three largest areas so far. Yes. The high yield market we look at in a few ways, one of them is obviously there's a large amount of firepower of capital that's available for the private equity in the sponsor industry. We estimate that that's well north of $1 trillion somewhere around $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion of capital be deployed. We also look at the M&A pipeline, the M&A pipeline right now there's a lot of deals to be completed, but they're actually taking a lot of time. So there's a slow realization of M&A, which has already been announced, but not completed. So that's another one of the levers we look at quite closely. And then there's going to be a refinancing requirement, they'll be start coming in over, which relates to 2023, 2024, 2025. Traditionally, we've seen some of that pull forward into earlier times as people look at how the interest rate market is playing out what their growth prospects are, et cetera, but those would be the key factors we're looking at the what's happening with rates, what's happening with the private equity industry, with M&A, with refinancing. And then just generally speaking, as you know, I mentioned earlier to one of the other answers, there's kind of a risk off approach, especially from the retail and the wealth management sectors. They have not been participating in the formation of new CLOs. And in fact, have been withdrawing their liquidity from the high yield products. So we think that we will start seeing people go back into that when there's some more uncertainty and stability in the markets as well. Thanks, Faiza. Yes. Good morning. So let me give you a little bit more color on the ESG growth, which is of course phenomenal and we're very happy because we have been guiding to a 46% CAGR for a multi-year period and to be coming in at this kind of a level of growth of 66% is of course really great. So a couple of underlying elements, we're seeing nice growth in commodity insights that's written by clean energy technology, energy transition activities, as well as new price assessments around ESG. Also market intelligence doing well, particularly around climate and the true cost offerings and the ESG data sales. If we look at the Indices business, we have been investing a lot in new ESG Indices, and that is also clearly starting to payoff. And then in ratings, although coming from a small base, we see some positive momentum in second party or opinion, so good momentum. We're clearly investing in it. There's a lot of market demands and we would expect that positive momentum in ESG to continue. It's something that's still obviously in discussion in Washington. Generally speaking, infrastructure bills something like this, which is going to be geared towards the climate sector could see some benefit as it – as the financing gets into the market, but this could take a while before we really start seeing it layer into the market. Thanks, Trevor. On the first question about the fossil fuel based, I don't have the answer. We'll have to get back to you on that. But just remember that across the business, a large part of our complex relates to – it relates to energy. But in addition, we've seen some great opportunities to increase our knowledge across the group. As an example, we issued a special study on copper, which even though copper isn't a fossil fuel, copper is going to be necessary component for the energy transition. So we'll have to get back to you to the answer on the fossil fuel question. Yes. The commodity insights business actually despite knowing that the price of oil is quite high is a healthy pipeline right now. There's a lot of demand for information. As I mentioned, the special copper study we've done, we have been deploying a whole new set of energy transition products. So even if there's been some concern, some of the traditional areas of some of the consumers of oil and gas might have a little bit more stress. The overall market is still very robust with the energy industry itself in a strong position, the commodity industries are looking for a lot new insights, information and data. And then we're being able to find new opportunities to mix and match our data across the entire company. As an example, we've launched some new indices through the index business, which relate to commodities data. So we're finding a lot of opportunities across the company to mix and match products. We see a strong growth pipeline. Thanks. Thanks, Craig. Hello, Owen, and let me give you some further insights on that. So when we think about pricing, we always first start to think about the value we generate for our customers. So that's the starting point. And as you know, our products are very valuable. They're important, particularly in an current environment with high volatility, lot of economic uncertainty, our research, our datasets, our insights, all the consumption of it is even higher in the current period of times. And then we also know our base products itself are very valuable for our customers. So that is always the starting point before we start to think about pricing. Obviously in an high inflationary environment, it's fair to consider passing on a part of our cost price increases to our customers, if that is appropriate and balanced in relation to what I said before. And we're doing that selectively. So think about custom and data subscriptions in index, there we have made some changes and also we have made a list price change in the ratings business now starting on August 1. So a mid-year change also for the ratings fees. So those are a couple of examples, but always in the context of finding the right balance for the company and thinking about the health of the company, the retention levels and the interest of our customers from a medium and long-term perspective. Yeah. Thanks, Owen. This is a business that is benefiting tremendously from all of the disruption in the supply chain and the automotive manufacturing sector. The dealers right now are really in a high need for information about the used car sector, which is where the most movement is going. They're working very closely with the manufacturers and the OEMs on programs about providing discounts, providing incentives for new car sales. So the dealers right now are in the middle of a very high demand low product environment. And so CARFAX has been benefiting across the board. So all the CARFAX businesses, as well as Automotive Mastermind, there were a couple of new products that were launched. One that's called – it's called an EyeQ, spelled E-Y-E-Q product, which provides a balance between the manufacturing and the dealer segment to look at how incentives and discounts are provided. So this is an area where CARFAX has been tremendously benefited by this difficult environment. And it's really the dealers that have the highest demand. Yes. Thanks Owen. Yes. George, the second half of the year's assumption is that it's similar to June and July. If you actually look at any year, the second half of the year is always has lower level of issuance in the first half of the year. If you think about it, you've got the summer months in there, you've got July and August, which are always quite slow. And then you've got some holidays towards the end of the year in the U.S. market, which are also quite slow. So we're expecting that there will be the issuance level will be similar to what it's been the last couple months. Both. Yes. Thanks, Shlomo. We think that this Mobility segment has a many – has a very high growth trajectory ahead of it. If you look at a couple of different factors, one that I described earlier relates to the used car environment, where right now there's very low production of new automobiles, which is taking place, which means that there is a need for dealers to have product. They don't have product right now. So when they get it, they can sell it, they can sell it at premium. They need the data in the analytics, whether it's from Automotive Mastermind or it's the CARFAX product. So there's a high demand right now for that. And the dealer's approach to working with customers is not going to go away even as the global production starts coming back. And there's going to be a revolution taking place in the transmission system such will move toward electric vehicles. So the dealer approach is going to stay quite important. We think the manufacturing approach could actually benefit from much higher growth of production. You see that we think that the global production will start continuing to increase over the next few years going up – even up to 9% in 2023 in the Slide that we produced. There's another area which we think has some opportunities for growth, which is financials. And we've been producing some new products for the financial sector. We talked about one of them earlier, which is some credit information for the insurance industry, as well as the financial services industry on the automotive sector. So across the board, we think this is a segment, which is going through a lot of change. There's a lot of disruption taking place and it's an opportunity for us to be at the middle of that to provide the data and the insights and analytics, the dealers and audit manufacturers and financial institutions need to make informed decisions. Thanks, Shlomo. Good morning, Andrew. We are very pleased with the trends we're seeing with respect to desktop, very stable business, growing in a steady way. We see good commercial momentum. We see good user satisfaction levels, and that is translating in high retention, nice growth of annualized contract value, pickup of price increases based on the enterprise approach we are doing with respect to our contracts. And then also [indiscernible] of the products is going up. Satisfaction level also better think about page loads that are going much faster than we had in the past. So overall, we like what we are seeing in desktop growing nicely steadily and good commercial momentum and great customer satisfaction around it. Thanks Andrew. Thanks, Russell. Well, as we close the call, I want to thank everyone again for joining it for your questions and for your support. As I said at the beginning of the call, it's incredible to see that within just five months, how much stronger and resilient we are as a new company with S&P Global and IHS Markit. We have a very robust integration management office in place, we call it the IMO. We're partnering with all of the businesses together with a new management team to create value and to ensure that we can create this unified vision to deliver S&P Global. None of the progress would be possible without the commitment and really hard work of our people. They've done a fantastic job and I do want to thank them again for their effort as they've been working for over 1.5 years, two years to get ready for this deal. And now the last five months to really make sure it's moving along. I'm really pleased that all of us have come together to do such a great job so far, and we want to continue to deliver. I hope that everyone has an enjoyable summer and want to thank everybody for joining the call today. Thank you very much."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin.\nMark Grant: Thank you for joining today’s S&P Global first quarter 2022 earnings call.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Mark. Welcome to today’s first quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by highlighting the historic event that occurred in the first quarter of 2022. We completed our merger with IHS Markit. And I'm incredibly excited to be joining you for our first quarterly earnings call as a combined company. The promise of the merger has already begun to manifest itself in our culture and our financial performance. Beginning with a few financial highlights. We reported strong financial results with adjusted pro forma revenue increasing 2% and adjusted pro forma diluted EPS increasing $0.01 year-over-year despite one of the most challenging issuance environments in recent history. We saw positive revenue growth in five of our six divisions, including double-digit growth in three of them. Adjusted pro forma expenses increased 8% as we continue to invest in events, people and technology. Though much of this expense growth is non-recurring as we'll discuss later on. We're updating our guidance to reflect the increased uncertainty caused by the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape. And Ewout will walk through these details in a moment. I'd also like to share a few highlights from the first quarter. As I mentioned, we completed the merger with IHS Markit, had a number of exciting achievements. We announced a $12 billion accelerated share repurchase or ASR and launched the first tranche of $7 billion dollars in March with the remainder to be executed by the end of the year. We took advantage of this still historically low interest rate environment to optimize our capital structure and lower our average cost of debt. And we had strong attendance at some of the industry's most important conferences, including CERAWeek, World Petrochemical Conference and TPM22. While we've only been together for 2 months, we're already starting to see validation of our investment thesis, and the results of our comprehensive planning are paying off. We've begun leveraging technology like Kensho across the broader organization to automate processes to increase efficiencies. We've begun development of several new products and features across the divisions. We're integrating our divisional commercial teams, and we've already closed synergy deals in multiple divisions. I want to take a moment to touch on culture and leadership. We brought our combined leadership team together in person for the first time in March. We were thrilled to see so many of our colleagues brainstorming, planning, working and functioning as if they had already been together for years. We saw the free exchange of ideas, strong proposals for new growth engines, and clear alignment on our strategy, purpose and values. We also heard a unified voice among our leadership in support of our people first initiatives and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We came away energized and full of confidence that we'll be able to take the absolute best not only from each company, but from each person in the organization and create something exceptional with S&P Global. I have never been more inspired by our people, and I'm more excited than ever to work with them to drive sustainable, profitable growth. When we announced the merger in November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions. We received final regulatory approval on February 25, 2022, and officially closed the merger 3 days later on February 28. We immediately went to work optimizing the capital structure issuing $5.5 billion in new debt, most of which was used to refinance existing debt at lower rates. We completed that refinancing in April 2022. In order to secure regulatory approval for the merger, we will require to divest a number of businesses. The table on this slide lays out the details of those divestitures. As we have shared with you before, the aggregate revenue from all of the businesses being divested is approximately $425 million. And the margins for each of these businesses are higher than the margins for each of the divisions they were in. We're confident that we negotiated well on behalf of our shareholders in these transactions, evidenced by approximately 9.5x revenue multiple paid by the acquirers of these businesses in aggregate. Net after tax proceeds will total $2.85 billion. Now to recap, the financial results for the first quarter. Revenue increased 2% to $3.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 6% to $1.4 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 340 basis points to 45% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in ratings transaction revenue and expense growth I mentioned earlier. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which decreased 60 basis points to 47%. In addition to our strong overall revenue performance and continued expense management, we launched a $7 billion ASR and began optimizing our capital structure. Combined with tax effects of merger related synergies and prudent investment, we increased adjusted pro forma diluted EPS year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I'm encouraged by the fact that even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, we were able to deliver strong revenue across five of our six divisions, including double-digit growth in Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices. In line with the expectations we laid out on our call in March, we did see a year-over-year decrease in ratings driven by an exceptionally soft issuance environment. During the first quarter, global bond issuance decreased 12%. This understates the impact to our business, however, as high yield issuance declined far more dramatically. In the U.S., issuance in aggregate decreased 25%. Its investment grade decreased 19%, high yield decreased 75%, public finance decreased 15%, structured finance increased 9% due to large increases in mortgage-backed securities offset by declines in structured credit. Bank loan ratings declined 35% year-over-year. European issuance decreased 14% as investment grade decreased 11%, high yield decreased 54% and structured finance increased 27% due to increases in RMBS and covered bonds, partially offset by declines in ABS, CMBS and structured credit. In Asia, issuance was flat. The next two slides look at the difference we saw in the quarter between investment grade issuance, and the issuance of high yield and leveraged loans. This slide shows an investment grade issuances resilient relative to other categories, decreasing only 5% year-over-year. This slide depicts the combination of high yield issuance in leveraged loan volume. This quarter we saw a decrease of over 50% from the incredible levels in the year ago period. High yield was particularly impacted by the uncertainty in the market, with issuance decreasing 68% year-over-year. While difficult to pinpoint exact causes, issuance in the first quarter was impacted both by the pull-forward we witnessed and discussed last year as well as the intentional delay we're hearing from customers, as many issuers wait for clear signs of stability before re-entering the market. Now turning to some of the factors that made this quarter successful for S&P Global. We saw significant increases in engagement and usage of our products and our content this quarter. The metrics on this slide are clear evidence that in periods of increased uncertainty, whether that's in the macroeconomic picture, market volatility or geopolitical tensions, our customers turn to us. They turn to us for the insights, data and tools that they need to make well informed business and investment decisions. It's also important to remember that S&P Global's stronger more diverse product portfolio allows areas of the business to thrive in times of elevated volatility and uncertainty. Within the S&P Dow Jones indices business, we saw more than 20% growth in revenue from our exchange-traded derivatives, whose volumes are directly correlated with market volatility. In the commodities markets, our global trading services business within Commodity Insights grew 17% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we held a number of Premier conferences attracting thousands of leaders from multiple industries. Several of these conferences returned to being in-person events for the first time in 3 years. One of these was CERAWeek. For some S&P Global Investors CERAWeek may be unfamiliar. CERAWeek is the world's leading event for the energy industry taking place in the first quarter each year and hosted in Houston, Texas. We were thrilled to welcome attendees back in-person. And it's clear that all of the factors impacting the energy industry right now, industry and government leaders wanted to be there. We had record attendance with over 5,200 delegates, 900 speakers and 50 senior government officials. With the combined resources, S&P Global Platts and IHS Markit, we're confident that CERAWeek will continue to grow and set itself apart as the must attend event for energy industry leaders. We also hosted the annual World Petrochemical Conference and the TPM Conference in the first quarter. Both conferences aimed to help industry leaders navigate some of the most pressing challenges facing our global economy. WPC convened this year to discuss how the chemical industry can help facilitate and thrive in a world progressing towards more sustainable operations, including net zero emissions targets. Our conferences bring people together to drive innovation and growth in different industries. But they also demonstrate the strength of S&P Global as a source and a destination for global leadership. We're thrilled with the progress we've made as we celebrate the first anniversary of Sustainable1. ESG revenue growth accelerate on both reported and organic basis in the first quarter, growing 57% year-over-year to reach nearly $50 million. We continue to introduce new ESG-related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace. In the first quarter, we saw the launch of 17 ESG ETFs based on our indices, and we ended the first quarter with AUM in ESG ETFs growing 28% to surpass $33 billion. Our Indices and Commodity Insights teams collaborated to launch the S&P GSCI Electric Vehicle Metals Index, and we continue to enhance ESG scores made available through our Capital IQ pro platform. One of the greatest advantages we have in ESG is the robust set of data that comes to us through the active participation of covered companies. Our 2021 corporate sustainability assessment saw a 64% increase in the number of companies working with us directly to ensure the datasets behind our ESG scores are robust, accurate and comprehensive. Our coverage of more than 11,000 companies includes approximately 2,300, which provide datasets and disclosure directly to CSA. Our commitment to active partnership with covered companies ensures our ESG scores are informed by the best data available. Now turning to our outlook. We have updated our bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect a decrease in the first quarter, as well as to better reflect the ongoing impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We now expect global issuance to decline approximately 5% year-over-year within a range of down 14% to flat in 2022. We expect corporates to see a 12% decrease in issuance partially offset by a 2% increase in financial services issuance. We expect U.S public finance and structured finance to each soften by 7%, and international public finance to shrink by about 1.5%. As we evaluate the remainder of the year, we wanted to discuss some of the assumptions that underpin our guidance. Let me start with our response to the tragic events taking place in Ukraine, and the impact on our business. As we've shared with you previously, combined revenue from Russia and Belarus is less than 1% of our total revenue. We have suspended commercial operations in Russia and Belarus including all customer contracts. We've suspended ratings of Russian entities and removed stocks and bonds listed or domiciled in Russia from our indices. While the direct financial impact on our business is not material, we acknowledged the indirect impact on the issuance environment and market volatility. We also wanted to illustrate some of the changes in the macroeconomic environment and inform our financial outlook for the company. In addition to lower debt issuance, we now expect slightly lower global GDP growth. Inflation is also likely to have a greater impact on our business and the economy as a whole relative to our expectations earlier this year. We're seeing some upward pressure on compensation expense that we expect to continue throughout the rest of the year. Commodities prices remain elevated relative to our early expectations as well. To be clear, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but rather to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions we make about the global economy when formulating guidance. Before handing it over to Ewout. I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the execution success we've seen in a challenging quarter. Our ability to drive positive growth in both revenue and adjusted pro forma earnings per share in a quarter like this would have been much more challenging before a merger with IHS Markit. The strength, stability and scale of our businesses gives us great confidence to invest for future growth and be optimistic about the years ahead. We remain committed to our strategic organic investments, as illustrated on this slide. And we remain confident these investments will power significant future growth and profitability for the company. With that I'll turn it over to Ewout to walk through our results and guidance. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. I want to start by emphasizing the successful execution we saw this quarter. With five of our six divisions posting pro forma revenue growth, it's already clear that we are more resilient, both operationally and financially as a combined company. With our larger scale and more diversified revenue streams, we're more insulated to volatility in the debt issuance market. As such, we were able to grow pro forma revenue and adjusted EPS year-over-year even during a period of sharp decreases in issuance. Doug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. But as a reminder, when we discuss financial results from operations and cash flows, we're discussing those results on an adjusted pro forma basis, as if S&P Global and IHS Markit were combined for the entirety of all periods presented, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods. We have also made minor refinements to the recast pro forma financials for all four quarters of 2021, which can be found in the amended 8-K filed today. Adjusted corporate and allocated expenses declined from a year ago, caused by a combination of reduced incentive and fringe costs, as well as the release of certain benefits accruals. Our net interest expense increased 5% as we increase gross debt partially offset the lower average rates due to refinancings. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to tax deductions related to stock-based compensation and merger related optimization of capital and liquidity structure. As we introduced last year, we'll continue to disclose these three categories of non-GAAP adjustments to provide insights into the type of expenses that we are incurring related to the merger and the synergies we have discussed. Transaction costs in the quarter were $281 million. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. Integration cost in the quarter were $58 million. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure, and retention cost. Costs to achieve synergies amounted to $88 million in the quarter. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease termination, severance, contract exit fees, and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements. During the first quarter, the non-GAAP operating adjustments collectively totaled to $504 million, including a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of businesses and a $200 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation in addition to the merger related items I mentioned. Given the growth in expenses this quarter, we wanted to provide some insight into the drivers, many of which are transitional. Importantly, we expect expense growth to moderate as we progress through the year, even excluding the impact of cost synergies. In the first quarter, we recognized $8 million in additional T&E expenses as we saw a limited resumption of travel relative to the last 2 years. We've also saw a $10 million increase in advertising expense associated with our Mobility division. Investments in growth initiatives contributed to $28 million of the increase. We are specifically disclosing the increase from what we're calling a step-up impact in the quarter. This relates to increases in expenses that we view as a re-establishment of baseline cost. The return of in-person events included several major conferences in the first quarter as Doug mentioned. Together, these live events added more than $20 million of incremental expense relative to last year when these events were still virtual. Step-up costs also incorporate a comprehensive process to align compensation practices across our employee base. One of these changes is to harmonize the timing of annual merit increases to March from April. The pull-forward of that merit increase costs one month of impact in the first quarter that did not occur in the year ago periods. We also recognized $15 million in additional expense related to the ongoing cloud transition. Free cash flow excluding certain items was $701 million in the first 3 months of 2022. Note that this is meant to reflect the estimated free cash flow of the combined company as if the merger were closed on January 1, 2022. We will provide some additional color on the drivers of our cash balance and our gross debt in the next few slides. Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with ample liquidity. As of the end of the first quarter, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.4 billion and debt of $11.4 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITA at the end of the first quarter was 2.57x. As you can see, our cash balance declined sequentially to $4.4 billion. The single largest drive in the reduction was a $7 billion in cash paid to fund the first tranche of our 2022 $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program. We also received net proceeds from divestitures of $2.6 billion and net proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of debt. Now to gross debt. We issued $5.5 billion of new debt in the first quarter, $3.5 billion of which has been allocated to refinancing existing debt. After the quarter closed, we also made a final debt redemption payment of $600 million, which brought our adjusted gross debt leverage down to 2.47x. Now, I'd like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the first quarter, we have achieved $23 million in cost synergies, and our current annualized run rate is $135 million. While we are already seeing significant progress in pipeline and customer conversations, with only 1 month as a combined company, revenue synergies are negligible. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the first quarter is $365 million. Now let's turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 7% with growth across all product lines. Expenses increased 8% primarily due to factors I mentioned earlier. Investments in technology, especially cloud transition cost and continued investment in strategic initiatives like ESG. Segment operating profit increased 5% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 29%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 30%. You can see on the slide our operating profit from the OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division. The JV contributed $26 million in adjusted operating profit to the company because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture, operating independent of the company, we do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category, and on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 7%, Data & Advisory solutions revenue grew 12%, Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 2%, and Credit & Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. As Doug discussed at length, ratings faced a challenging issuance environment in the first quarter with revenue declining 15% year-over-year. Expenses increased 7% primarily due to compensation expense and information service cost partially offset by lower occupancy cost. This resulted in a 25% decrease in segment operating profit and 820 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased approximately 105 basis points to 62%. Non-transaction revenue increased 7% primarily due to growth in fees associated with surveillance and growth in CRISIL revenue. Transaction revenue decreased 31% on the soft issuance already discussed. This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were the 21% decrease in corporates and the 12% decrease in structured finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, financial services decreased 9%, governments decreased 11% and the CRISIL and other category increased 12%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 14%. Return of in-person conferences, most notably CERAWeek and World Petrochemical Conference drove 70% year-over-year growth in Advisory & Transactional Services revenue. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, revenue growth would have been 8% year-over-year. Global Trading Services had a great quarter, increasing 17%, mainly due to strong fuel oil and iron ore volumes. As Doug noted earlier, GTS revenue often picks up when commodity prices become more volatile, which we certainly witnessed in the first quarter. Expenses increased 18% primarily due to cost associated with the return of in-person conferences and headcount and compensation expense. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, expenses would have increased 10% year-over-year. Segment operating profit increased 8% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 210 basis points to 43%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 43%. In addition to the exceptional quarter in Advisory & Transactional Services, we saw strong demand driving growth in price assessments and energy and resources, data and insights. Growth was partially offset by a modest decrease in Upstream data and insights. Though we note positive signs of inflection in the Upstream business, but for the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, Upstream would have had its second consecutive quarter of positive ACV growth, which is a leading indicator for revenue. We also saw a dramatic improvement in retention in the Upstream business as retention rates improved by more than 10 full percentage points over the last 12-month. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in Planning Solutions and Used Car offerings. Expenses grew 11% on increased advertising expense in the quarter and headcount growth in 2021, as the business restores capacity to better align with strong growth over the past 18 months. This resulted in an 8% growth in adjusted operating profit and 80 basis points of margin contraction year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased approximately 400 basis points to 39%. Dealer revenue increased to 12% year-over-year benefiting from successful prior period promotions and from retention rates that remain above pre-COVID levels. Growth in manufacturing was 3% year-over-year related to the well-publicized supply chain challenges faced by automotive OEMs. Financials and other increased 12%, driven primarily by strength in our insurance underwriting products. S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered strong revenue growth of 14% year-over-year, primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. During the quarter, expenses increased 9%, largely due to strategic investments, increased compensation and IT costs. Segment operating profit increased 16% and the segment operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 69.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased approximately 10 basis points to 68%. Every category increased revenue this quarter. Asset linked fees increased 15%, primarily from AUM driven gains in ETFs, mutual funds and insurance. Exchange traded derivative revenue increased 22% on the increased trading volumes. Data and customs subscriptions increased 4%. Over the past year, ETF net inflows were $286 billion and market appreciation totaled $244 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.9 trillion, which is 22% higher compared to 1 year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 24% year-over-year. Sequentially versus the end of the fourth quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $68 billion and market depreciation totaled $123 billion. Within our Engineering Solutions division we saw 7% revenue growth, driven primarily by growth in non-subscription offerings, most notably the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. Investment in growth initiatives and an increase in royalty expense led to a 5% increase in adjusted expenses This resulted in segment operating profit growth of 17% and 160 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin contracted approximately 115 basis points to 20%. Subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions increased 3% year-over-year, while non-subscription revenue increased 60% over the same period. Now moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance, and this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. For revenue, we now expect a low single-digit increase year-over-year, reflecting the issuance environment, partially offset by the strength we are seeing in our non-Ratings businesses. We now expect corporate unallocated expense between $85 million and $95 million, approximately $30 million lower than our previous guidance on lower forecast incentive compensation and professional fees. Interest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, down $10 million from prior guidance. This is due to a slightly lower average cost of debt than we initially expected. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $165 million and free cash flow, excluding certain items in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. There is no change to our expectations for deal-related amortization, operating profit margin expansion or tax rate. This slide illustrates our guidance by division. For Ratings, we now expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits and for margins to be in the low to mid-60s. This compares to previous guidance calling for low single-digit revenue growth and margins in the mid-60s. Our outlook for other segments is unchanged from previous guidance. Overall, we are incredibly encouraged by the team's ability to execute so well even in the current macro environment. We are focused on the enormous long-term opportunity ahead of us as a combined company, and we are more confident than ever in our ability to execute against that opportunity. Our differentiated data, insights, analytics and services help our customers to thrive and accelerate progress. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Ewout. For those on the line, if you would like to ask a question, please press \"*\", \"1\" and record your name. To cancel or withdraw your question, simply press \"*\", \"2\". Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up in order to allow time for other callers during today's Q&A session. Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You've updated your full year outlook for debt issuance. Can you discuss what your expectations are for issuance on a quarterly basis directionally? And how much of your guidance increase or guidance update reflects performance in the quarter compared to performance over the rest of the year?\nDoug Peterson: Thanks for that question. This is Doug. Let me start with that. Well, knowing that issuance is going to be one of the key questions that we're going to be talking about, let me just review a little bit what we saw during the quarter and then some of the expectations for the rest of the year. As you know, it was a very weak quarter for issuance. We saw that the total global issuance was down 9% excluding bank loan ratings and 12% including bank loan ratings. We saw, as an example, U.S. bonds were down 22%; U.S. corporates were down almost 50%; and high yield globally was down 68%, and the U.S. was down 75%. So, with that backdrop, as you see, we've looked towards the rest of the year. We expect that issuance during the second quarter will be recovering, but not necessarily to the full extent that it would have been compared to last year. And the second half of the year, the comparables are not quite as difficult as they were earlier in the year, and we do believe that there will be a rebound in issuance given the situation and current positioning in the market. But let me hand it over to Ewout, who will provide some more color.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, George. Indeed, as Doug said, we are expecting still the second quarter to see some impact with respect to our quarterly expectations, but then to see some improvement in the second half of this year and particularly also because the comps will get easier during the second half of this year. I also would like to point out, of course, the benefits we have of the broader company we are at this point in time because five of our -- the six divisions are performing in line or better than expectations. We will see during the course of this year coming in the benefits from our cost synergies, the benefits from our buyback program and so on. So that should help drive the earnings per share growth in a very strong way during the rest of the year. Hence, that we're still guiding to double-digit EPS growth for the full year. So definitely, those elements will help to strengthen the performance of the company during the course of 2022.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on that point. You mentioned that five of the six divisions are performing in line or better than expectations. Can you elaborate on which of the segments actually outperformed your initial expectations heading into the quarter? And what were the key factors driving the upside performance?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, let me give you a quick overview for each of the divisions and happy to go deeper in some of the next questions. But for example, Market Intelligence, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity. The first conversations we are having with customers are really showing the benefit of the combined company. And we saw actually the subscription revenue going up in a very strong way, actually growing more in the double-digit space. Commodity Insights, very strong commercial momentum. The main issue with respect to the Russian revenue impact will be in Commodity Insights, but we expect to be able to offset a significant part of that based on the very strong commercial momentum we are seeing and also very excited about what we can offer our customers on a combined basis. Mobility, clearly some positive trends as well as we have pointed out, particularly because we see higher retention of our customers. The Index business, a strong AUM growth. Keep in mind, we are looking at this year-over-year. And of course, we started at much lower AUM levels at the beginning of 2021, and then also the derivative activity and volumes are much higher. And then you also saw Engineering Solutions growing in a healthy way during the quarter. So overall, we think that our businesses are very well-positioned, five of the six and that the issues with respect to the debt issuance environment are very isolated within the Ratings division itself. And also keep in mind that we have a significant component in Ratings with respect to non-transaction revenue. So that is clearly also an element of stability and offset for the overall transactional revenue.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, George.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. So, the negative 5% issuance forecast obviously is much different than what Moody's reported yesterday. And I was just hoping for -- is there some sensitivity perhaps you can provide us in terms of if things get worse, how that would impact your guidance? Or does the EPS range account for that flat to down 14% that you talked about earlier?\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Well, first of all, let me share with you a little bit more about what our outlook is for the full year and what some of the sensitivities are in that forecast. As you know, we are expecting that the overall issuance of bonds will be down 5% for 2022. But if you look at what the components are in the corporates, we already saw very weak issuance in the first quarter. And so we've forecasted to be a 12% decline for the full year with a downside of up to 25%. And it could recover and have a 5% -- down 5% full year. We do see strength in financial services. They continue to outpace the issuance last year. We expect it for the full year will be up 2%. But again, with the current environment, that could drop to up to 5% down. Structured finance and U.S. public finance could be down at 7% this year. That's what our current forecast is, and they could also see downside up to 12%. And then there's other factors such as international public finance that as well would be down 2%. But as you know, we are very close to the markets. We watch what's happening. Our forecast is based on many, many different factors. We look at what is the current situation of maturing bonds in the market whether it's on people's balance sheets. As you know, there was very little -- hardly any issuance at all of either loans, high-yield loans or high-yield bonds during the first quarter. There's a pipeline out there that still wants to go to the markets. We also know that there is a set of M&A transactions which have not been completed. There's $1 trillion of private equity capital on the sideline that still has not been deployed. So, we look at all of these factors and weigh them together to come up with our estimate for the year of 5% down. So, this isn't just one single factor that goes into it. We are looking across many, many different factors. And as Ewout just said, we also expect that through the year, there will be recovery in issuance as we keep going deeper into the year.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then maybe somewhat similarly just on the Indices side of the business, what's embedded in the assumption in terms of at least the asset-linked fees portion of the business?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, we are always looking, Manav, at the actual asset levels. And then we are assuming with respect to the growth and market appreciation, a very modest development for the remainder of the year. But keep in mind that this is a business where we have the natural offset, the partial hedge because if the asset levels will come down, we see the derivative trading activity going up and the other way around. And as you have seen this quarter, actually, the Index business has performed very well based on those kind of dynamics. So, if you look at it historically, the Index business actually has been growing revenues for many, many years in a row in very volatile market circumstances, very different circumstances over the years. And that is exactly due to the dynamics of the business and the business model that we have the different revenue streams in the Index business.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Manav.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the margins. You kept the adjusted pro forma operating margin flat. Obviously, there'll be some Ratings weakness. I'm imagining that's maybe offset by some of the other segments. But just talk about anything sort of on the cost side, maybe labor inflation, how that’s trending? Just what are the risks to the margin guide? And what gives you the sort of confidence to stay at that level despite the Ratings weakness? Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Ton. You're right. There are many different elements that go in the mix with respect to our margin expectation. But let me first reemphasize our margin expectations. So, what we are guiding to is still 130 basis points margin expansion during 2022. And the reason is we will see some natural growth in our businesses. We, of course, have our business as usual expense growth based on the activities of the business. We, of course, have some impact of the overall compensation environment. We have done some targeted increases in certain job groups. We have raised the merit in certain jurisdictions, a bit higher than we have done in previous years. But then at the same time, we also have several management actions that we are taking. Definitely, in the current environment, we're, of course, very careful from an expense perspective. So, we will see benefits from some of those management actions. We also have the benefit of some of our variable expenses that will come down during the course of this year. And then if you layer on top of that the cost synergies that will be very meaningful and significant, we are actually very pleased that in an environment -- macro environment where we are today, that we, as a company, still can improve our margins, increase our margins in a very significant way.\nToni Kaplan: That's great. And then just on the revenue side, I'm sure you mentioned it. I just happened to miss it. The organic growth expectation for the year, are you still sort of expecting the same 6.5% to 8% for the next 2 years? Just any update on overall organic growth? And maybe just how the different levers -- is pricing easier this year because of the rising cost environment, et cetera? Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. Toni, with respect to our own effort, 6.5% to 8% revenue growth for '22 and '23 combined, we have no reason to back away from that at this point in time. But obviously, we will continue to monitor that very closely. And the reason is that, as we mentioned, five of our six divisions are performing in line or better than expected. So, the main question is when is the issuance environment coming back. And we have been in that movie many times before. If you look back for the last decade, there's maybe three situations where the issuance environment was negative, and there were impacts on the Ratings revenue. But what we usually have seen then is after one or a few quarters, that came back in a very strong way. So, it is really the matter of the uncertainty about the timing when that is coming back. So, for that reason, we have no reason at this moment to back away from our revenue expectations for '22 and '23 combined.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, Toni.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. So first on the cost synergies, pretty good progress in the quarter itself. So, I was wondering if you could drill down further on how -- what kind of traction you're seeing on that front? How should we think about the quarterly cadence this year? And any initial feedback from the cost takeout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. Thank you, Ashish. I think it's important first to point out that we are in these results only 1-month in as a combined company. So, in that context that we are already being able to report $123 million of cost synergies on an annualized basis, we think actually that’s already a very strong indicator. With respect to the absolute number and the phasing of our cost synergies, nothing has changed compared to our information that we provided on March 1 during the merger call. But what is important to point out is that we made good progress. We are very comfortable and confident that we can hit those numbers. And you recall that we said that we will be able to achieve about $600 million of cost synergies in total and that we expect something like 35% to 40% in 2022, so realized in this year. And as I said, we are very confident that we are on track to hit those numbers.\nAshish Sabadra: That’s great color. And then maybe a follow-up question on the revenue synergies. Again, there was a reference to Kensho being used across the broader organization to automate processes and then also the strength in subscription on the MI front. So, question there was any initial feedback from your customers as you started integrating some of the IHS Markit data into the global marketplaces and traction or ability to cross-sell, upsell those INFO products into SMB customer base and the other way around? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Let me start with that. We’ve been thrilled with the response we've been getting from our customers as we started the merger and working together. We’ve been able to get all of our teams merged within the divisions commercial team. So, they're out listening to customers. Ewout and I have been out listening to customers and hearing what they talk about. They're talking a lot about ESG, about energy transition, about some of the key thesis of this deal where we began with. In addition, they're interested in data and AI and machine learning, how they can link their data with ours.  And we've seen that our commercial organizations have already been out in the market. We have strong pipelines of cross-sell within all the divisions. We also have a set of products that we'll be looking at over time. As you know, the merger will be very powerful for us, but the main synergies coming from the revenue side are built towards the back end. But we are already seeing very, very strong relationships with customers, very good dialogue and with all of the different areas that were the core thesis of the deal itself.\nAshish Sabadra: That’s great color, Doug. Congrats on solid results. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Ashish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe just as a follow-up to what you just talked about on the Market Intelligence commercial opportunities. Can you maybe give a little bit more detail how exactly you've integrated the sales force? I think historically speaking, S&P over the last few years has moved to a very enterprise license approach. I think IHS Markit was very product specialist-focused. So just wondering what exactly commercially you've made changes on already? And if there's opportunity to maybe as you align things to pick up a little incremental revenue synergies quickly?\nDoug Peterson: Yes. So, thank you for that. As you pointed out, we had really two different approaches. At Market Intelligence at S&P Global, we generally had more of an approach that was an enterprise model. It gave us an opportunity for customers to have all of the users having access to the products and services, where financial services comes in with an approach where some of their products are priced more on a per user basis or a volume basis. There are some of the products within the new Market Intelligence, which came from IHS Markit that are going to be priced differently because they're installed software, which for us is an exciting new area, also some of the enterprise services that are provided as well. So, some of those are not going to necessarily fit within the product merger. But there are a lot of opportunities that we've seen of moving data, which is within the IHS Markit, things like bond pricing, reference pricing, moving that into the Desktop. In addition, there's data that we have for even something that we've had as long as Compustat, where some of that data can be moved into the products and services that are software solutions. So, the commercial teams have been brought together. There's been immediate cross-training so that every single person from both of the two companies understand the products of each other. We’ve also seen opportunities for the traditional cross-sell customers that don't have products on one side or the other that we started servicing. And as I mentioned, some of the biggest themes in ESG. We have the new scores, which we have 11,000 scores, which we've taken and put them into the Desktop. We can put those into many other areas. So, we see ESG as a theme, data as a theme. There's a lot of interest in credit risk. Private markets is another area. So, it's only been 1 month for this quarter since we closed. It's been 2 months since we closed, but the enthusiasm, the momentum is excellent.\nAlex Kramm: Thanks for the color. Thank you, there. And maybe a direct follow-up standing or keeping it on Market Intelligence. Still a very large portion of the combined business seems to be true subscription-based, but just wondering if you could talk about the cyclicality in this business a little bit more. When I look at your press release, recurring variable fees were down 13% year-over-year. And I guess that hit the Enterprise Solutions revenue only up 2%. So maybe just flush out what exactly those variable components are that were impacting you on a year-over-year basis. And as you think about the remainder of the year with capital markets a little bit choppy, what the impacts could be here on the Market Intelligence side that we should be thinking about as this business seems a little bit more cyclical than maybe the core Market Intelligence previously?\nEwout Steenbergen: Alex, yes, let me give you a bit of the breakdown and explanation what is happening exactly in recurring variable. You're right. If you look at MI as a whole, approximately 83% is subscription-based, 5% is non-subscription. And then you have that category in between that is subscription variable at approximately 12%. There you see a bit more impact from market fluctuations, capital market fluctuations because that's the business that has some of those capital markets platforms, some of the origination platforms, some of the equity platforms. And that is being impacted by some of the general M&A and capital market activity and issuance environment that we are seeing, both in fixed income and equity in the markets. And yes, that is a market and a business where you see a bit of that impact. But overall, you see that the Market Intelligence, nevertheless, was growing in a very strong way. And when we see more stability in the markets over time, when we see the M&A environment coming back, we would also expect to see the subscription variable component growing faster again. So that’s the underlying dynamic that is happening in the MI business.\nAlex Kramm: All right. Very helpful. Thanks again.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start with issuance or drill -- drill into the issuance expectations a bit further. I realized that it was a really tough first quarter on that front. But I’m curious, when you gave your guidance on March 1 with the merger call, I think you had some sense of at least February weakness in high yield. Could you spend some time talking about maybe what specifically changed in the outlook over the past 2 months? Has it been a weaker-than-expected April? Or are there certain subsegments or asset classes that have deteriorated more quickly than you expected? That would be helpful.\nDoug Peterson: Well, first of all, thank you for the question and drilling down a little bit more, there's really two key factors. First of all, if you looked at the high-yield issuance in February then into March and into April, it has been quite weak. There's times when we've gone an entire week and even longer without even one issuer coming to market. Given the external environment, that's also had a change. If you go back to the beginning of March, the last time we spoke, there had -- the invasion of Ukraine had just started. We hadn't seen yet the major impact on the markets of volatility of the energy markets and commodity markets. And we also, at the time, didn't have any clear guidance yet from the Fed what they were going to be doing on interest rates. So, if I take a step back and look at very specific dynamics in the high-yield market itself, when will that be coming back and what are our expectations. And then second, the overall macroeconomic geopolitical environment and then more specifically in the U.S., we are just starting to get a window into what will be the programs that the Fed is going to institute to try to combat inflation and the timing of some of their interest rate increases.\nAndrew Nicholas: Makes sense. Thank you for the color. And then sticking with Ratings for my follow-up. Obviously, transaction revenue has the headwinds we've talked about. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for non-transaction revenue growth if I didn't miss that? Obviously, a really strong year last year on that front. I think there were some one-time items in 2021. But if you could talk about your expectations for non-transaction revenue in that segment, that would be helpful. Thanks again.\nEwout Steenbergen: So, if you look at non-transaction, there is a bit of a mix of elements that go into that bucket. What we see is particularly strength in annual fees. So, for example, that is surveillance, and of course, with more bonds and loans outstanding after the very strong issuance environment over the last 2 years, we see some benefit from that. Also, frequent issuer fees are going in that category. So that is also very stable. And at the same time, we see also the CRISIL performance that goes in non-transaction being very strong. So CRISIL is growing very rapidly, both on the domestic Indian Ratings business as well as in the global research, risk and benchmarking business. Where we see in the non-transaction bucket the revenue are not moving up, it's mostly Rating Evaluation Services, less M&A activity. So that is impacting Rating Evaluation Service and also new issuer credit ratings. Given the current environment, we also see less activity there. Nevertheless, of course, 7% is a nice growth for non-transaction. We would probably see that slowing down that growth a little bit for the remainder of the year, but I would expect it still to be in a positive territory.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. I also wanted to ask about issuance. When looking at Slide 18, the minus 5% forecast, I just wanted to know if that issuance forecast is for all credit issuance or just weighted issuance? I know usually they're similar. But in this case, my question is, is there a large difference between the minus 5%? And if I ask you just for kind of rated issuances, and I don't quite get that footnote, like is China included in credit for the minus 5% or not?\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Take this as an estimate for global issuance. This is what our team looks at. It includes all markets and all types of issuance. It's the exact same base that we use when we talk about what the overall issuance has been quarter-by-quarter.\nAndrew Steinerman: And would rated issuance be much different than minus 5%?\nDoug Peterson: Yes, rated issuance would be -- if you look at -- if you could adjust a little bit for Asia, where the fees are not quite the same and there's issuance in China still a different kind of a market, but that's the forecast that we use. It's the basis we use for the guidance that we provided.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nHans Hoffman: Hi. This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamzah. Could you just comment a bit on what you're seeing across your European revenue base? And how that region did relative to your expectations, either by segment or overall?\nDoug Peterson: Yes. When we look at Europe, there's a couple of different factors. First of all, on the Rating side, it was similar to the rest of the world. The issuance levels were down. We saw that in Europe itself that for the quarter, the corporate issuance is down about 25%. Financial services was down 13%. That compares to in the U.S., corporates are down almost 50%. Financial services were down less in the U.S., 5% versus the 13% in Europe. But in addition, Europe did have some strong structured finance issuance. But overall, Europe continues to be a market that we're quite interested in because we see the transformation from a banking market to a capital market. There's also very strong growth in ESG. Europe is one of the sectors and one of the regions of the world that's really setting the fastest pace on ESG. We see a lot of interest there for the different ESG funds we've launched. We've seen fastest growth for S&P 500 ESG and Dow Jones Sustainable Indices that have been launched. Europe is the pace setter there. And we also know that in Europe, there's been a slower uptake of inflation. Right now, inflation is not quite as high as it is in the U.S. The ECB has not moved as fast when they are looking at increasing the core rates. So right now, the negative side of Europe is clearly that you've got the Ukraine invasion and that horrific war that's going on there. And we will have to see what kind of impact that has on Europe. Europe is also impacted potentially by the energy markets. But net-net, our European businesses have been on the same pace as the rest that we've seen in the U.S. But there are a few downsides, but we also see a lot of upside as the market doesn't have the same inflation impacts as well as the opportunities for the capital markets to play a much larger role.\nHans Hoffman: Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then just for my follow-up, could you just -- in terms of the portfolio post the deal, can you just comment on whether there are any further noncore assets that you're looking to prune? Or is sort of most of that behind you now? And any update on your view and how you're thinking about where your long-term leverage should be given the combined portfolio? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, first on the portfolio, we are very committed on driving growth and success of each of our businesses at this point in time. We see multiple opportunities, as we mentioned during the prepared remarks, of value creation across the enterprise. There's a lot of cross links we are seeing with respect to revenue synergies. And I think it's really exciting to see what we can do altogether. Having said that, you know us and our management style and philosophy will always be very disciplined portfolio managers. And we will always determine ultimately over time if we are the best owners of certain assets. But at this moment, really our focus on driving the economic value generation of the portfolio of businesses we have at S&P Global.\nHans Hoffman: Okay. Thanks so much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Tom (sic) [Hans].\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. So, energy companies have been doing very well this year. Could you please remind us the competitive advantage of the Commodity Insight business? I mean, the demand of your offerings during this volatile period and how investors can understand better this business given that revenue is up 14% year-over-year? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Owen Lau. Well, first of all, in this environment, the combination of Platts and IHS, the energy natural resources business is providing the knowledge and the resources that the markets look to in a volatile environment like this. Clearly, there's a combination of volatility in the energy markets, both with gas and in oil. You see the commodities related to agriculture also going -- undergoing a lot of volatility. And we have a combination of the benchmarks, which are embedded in people's contracts, in the research and the analytics. We have advisory services. We also have the energy transition that people are looking to. We have a combination of new products and services that we're coming together with IHS Markit in carbon markets, in battery metals, in things that are the transition energy economy. So, we think that the two together really bring a powerful voice that people are looking to. And let me just end with something we talked about on the earnings -- on the prepared transcript, which was related to CERAWeek. CERAWeek is the premier conference for the energy industry. And this year, there are over 5,000 participants. And it was a very, very lively dialogue, including government officials talking about what's the future of commodities. And we are really at the center of that dialogue and think that it's one of the best times for us and one of the most exciting things about the combination.\nOwen Lau: Got it. And I have two quick follow-up. One is cloud. You mentioned some of the cloud initiatives and investments. Could you please talk about some of your near-term and long-term goal of this initiative? And another quick one is on buyback. Should we expect -- from a modeling perspective, should we expect you would start the second tranche of the $5 billion remaining in the third quarter or not the right way to think about that? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Let me start with the question about cloud. And one of the -- another one of the exciting things about the transformation with the merger is that we have an opportunity to have scale in all of our negotiations and discussions with our providers when it comes to cloud and our digital transformation. Both S&P Global and IHS Markit, we are far advanced on cloud transformation. We are able to bring those two programs together and get scale. In addition, we have really interesting opportunities in data and data sciences that you'll be hearing much more about in the future. But I will let Ewout answer the other part of your question.\nEwout Steenbergen: And maybe one quick addition on cloud. There is a bit of a bubble [ph] cost, mostly in Market Intelligence because we are still in the transition there in that particular segment from on-prem to the cloud. So, we would expect over time to see that expense growth to go away. So, it's more transitional in terms of the expense impact on the Market Intelligence segment. With respect to the buyback question, Owen, we expect that the current $7 billion ASR program will be completed at the beginning of August. And then we are ready to enter into the next phase of our buyback program to complete the full $12 billion at the end of 2022.\nOwen Lau: Got it. Thank you very much.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, Owen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. My first question, historically, you guys have generally raised prices in your legacy portfolio, call it, 3% to 4%. How are you thinking about pricing this year, particularly with the new IHS assets? Or is the pricing would be up similar in that part of the portfolio this year?\nEwout Steenbergen: I think if you look at that, Craig, we always start with what is the added value we deliver for our customers. What is -- what will contribute in terms of usage, what kind of data sets are these, proprietary data sets, hard-to-achieve data sets, how are we embedded in workflows and processes? That is the starting point. And then we look at the overall value we generate for the enterprise and think about what is appropriate in terms of pricing and price increases for such a contract going forward. So, we don't just look at that simply by a percentage. We always look at first, what do we deliver to the customers and then reason back to what is appropriate in terms of the economic level of the fee that we will charge to the customer.\nCraig Huber: And then also on the cost synergy side, as you think out here longer term, if there's going to be any upside to your cost synergy target, what segment or segments do you guys think it most likely would come in?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, that is a bit speculative, Craig, as you understand. So, I have to be careful answer that question in a too specific way. But you know our management philosophy and approach. We always will be looking to raise the bar to find new opportunities, to leave no stone unturned. We will be looking across the whole company about what we can do better, more efficient, where we can integrate, where we have opportunities to automate, where we can use AI and Kensho across the board. So that is what we are planning to do. I think you know that the biggest areas of integration will be in Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and in Corporate. So, if we will find upside ultimately in synergies, most likely it's in those areas. But again, we will be continuing to look for opportunities across the board.\nCraig Huber: Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. I know it's late, I will just ask one, and forgive me if you covered this already. I know you’ve talked about some of the cost synergies, but I want to just focus specifically on Ratings, where there probably won't be a lot of cost synergies given the merger. How quickly can you adjust your expenses in that division when we see a kind of Ratings drop that we saw in the first quarter and something that you're expecting in the second quarter? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Well, first of all, clearly, Ratings has different levers they can pull. If we need to, we could move costs. When it comes to compensation, we could slow down hiring, we could slow down investments. But at the same time, as Ewout mentioned earlier, there are times where there's variability in the issuance environment where you've seen big drops. We’ve always mentioned that you could see a quarter or two quarters with very weak issuance. So we also want to make sure that we don't cut too quickly, too fast. We think that the markets are complex. There is growing. People want to see a variety of opinions. We're also investing in ESG across the Ratings team. We have a specialized unit within the Ratings business that is doing sustainability analytics. We're seeing high growth there. We want to make sure that all of our analysts are ready to provide any type of support for those markets. So clearly, there's a lot of levers we can pull, and we will already do some of those. But at the same time, we want to make sure that we keep investing in that business because it's so critical to our overall franchise.\nEwout Steenbergen: And one quick addition to Doug's answer. Although you're right, Jeff, that the direct cost synergies in Ratings will be relatively small, Ratings will be a beneficiary of cost synergies in the Corporate segment that is being allocated to all divisions. And because Ratings has a very large base in revenues and employees based on those allocation keys, Ratings will be, in the end, also significant beneficiary from the corporate cost synergies that we will accomplish.\nJeff Silber: Okay. That’s really helpful. Thanks so much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. On Mobility, you stressed that the retention rate is up relative to pre-pandemic. Just curious if you have the root cause analysis or have the thesis as to why? I guess, my concern would be cyclically used car sales are great, maybe unsustainably so right now. But I know there's other things in there, the CARFAX for Life initiative, Automotive Mastermind, whatnot. So curious as to why it's up and if you think it's sustainable?\nDoug Peterson: Yes. There's a couple of opportunities there. One of them is that the overall mobility industry itself, the automotive industry is going through a lot of change. This is a time when dealers, OEMs as well as suppliers to the OEMs are looking for more and more information about the supply chain, about the supply chain disruption. They want to understand more about what's happening at the dealer level, who's walking in the cars, who's walking into the dealership. In addition, there's been a lot of changes in the financing environment. As you know, the dealers as well as the OEMs have been using a lot of information in the last few years with different types of rebates with low interest rate loans, low interest rate leases. And so, the market is really going through a lot of changes in addition to electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. And with all of that, there is a value in having this data and analytics that come from the Mobility division embedded in people's workflow. And we just see that there's a high need for it right now in this disruptive environment and a lot of change going on. So, this is an area that we're pleased to see that this kind of stickiness, especially in this kind of an environment.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then apologies if you gave this in response to Manav's question. I missed it. But the revenue and EPS guidance ranges, do they embed the issuance forecast range? Or do you use the minus 5% point estimate?\nEwout Steenbergen: It's based on management's best estimates, our own internal forecasting models, which is the midpoint, the best estimate point that the Ratings Research Group has put out in terms of the issuance outlook. So that is that minus 5% level.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Good morning. Just a couple of clarifying questions, I guess. The first one on the Commodity business. I understand that growth was particularly strong this quarter because of the Advisory & Transactional Services. But it does seem like you're calling for some deceleration in the back half, just in the -- or in the rest of the year in the underlying business. So, I'm curious if you could just talk about some of the drivers in that business? Like how correlated is it to oil prices or other commodities? Or are you just being conservative on that business?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. Faiza, first of all, welcome to the call, and we are very happy that you're part of the analyst group now covering us as a company. So first, on Commodity Insights in terms of the expectation in terms of revenue growth for the year, we have said mid single digits. And then in terms of margins, mid to high 40s. And nothing has changed there compared to what we said to you a few months ago. And what you see is maybe first, I should speak about the impact of the Russian situation and the fact that we have suspended our commercial activities with Russian customers. Overall, not material for the company as a whole, but the largest impact is in Commodity Insights. But as I said at the answer of a previous question, we are very pleased to see the commercial momentum in the Commodity Insights business, and we expect that they are able to make up a significant part of that during the course of this year. So that's clearly a positive. You're right that revenues looked a bit high during the quarter 14%. But take into account that we had that CERAWeek event that had a significant impact on revenues during the first quarter. If you take CERAWeek out, revenue increase was approximately 8% during the quarter. So still strong, but definitely at a different level. Final commentary is we are really excited to see what is happening in that business because you could say there is, in fact, really a benefit of two trends at the same time. Traditional energy doing well. Of course, with the current commodity prices, you see that producers are in a healthy situation. And then there is so much focus at the same time on energy transition that we will have a benefit of helping our customers on both angles, and that’s clearly driving some of the underlying growth in this division. And therefore, we are overall very, very optimistic and positive about the outlook for Commodity Insights.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you. And then just on the Ratings margins specifically, if we assume like a downside scenario where maybe issuance volumes are at the low end of what you’ve talked about, which is I believe it was down 13%. Like is it fair to think about Ratings margins sort of in line with what you did this quarter, like around 59%? Is that the right way to think about those margins?\nEwout Steenbergen: Well, we are not giving any particular guidance on a downside scenario in a quantitative way. So, I would like to be careful to answer your question in too much specifics. I think the overall perspective that we have on the Ratings business is that at some point, we will see the issuance environment coming back. We have seen this in many times in the past. At some point, this will improve. And we really think that we should lower the level of anxiety around all of this because there is uncertainty around timing. But ultimately, we have always said there could be one or a few quarters where Ratings revenue will be under pressure. But if you are having a mid- to long-term perspective of the company, nothing has changed with respect to outstanding debt. Nothing has changed with respect to overall trends and correlations with GDP and other growth drivers. So, the secular trends in this business are still there. Maybe short-term, there could be some fluctuations. But if the perspective is more mid to long-term, I think nothing is different with respect to the overall activity of the markets and also the economics of the business, both the top line growth and the margin expectations for the Ratings business.\nFaiza Alwy: Understood. Thank you so much.\nEwout Steenbergen: Faiza.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Your line is open.\nSimon Clinch: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just quickly on the Rating side. I was wondering if you could help me just reconcile how to think about the transactional revenue streams relative to our own assumptions around the global issuance growth? Because clearly, in the first quarter, the transaction revenues a lot more than the issuance due to mix, I presume. I’m just wondering as the growth comes back, do we -- should we anticipate growth to far outpace issuance on the upside, and what are the nuances that we need to consider?\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Well, first of all, you're right that there's a different kind of mix and different sort of revenue profile. This last quarter, we did have many of the issuers that were out in the market, which were the frequent issuers that have a different pricing profile than those which are more transactional. So, we do look carefully at the mix. The more high yield, sometimes there's higher volumes, higher pricing there as opposed to some of the frequent issuers. So, it's something to watch, but there's no necessary -- no specific guideline, but mix is important when you look at the transaction revenues.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. That’s great. And just as a follow-up to the question about Commodity Insights. I was kind of curious, as you get the conference business coming back as we had in the first quarter, does that typically lead to better growth, organic growth when you strip away the conference benefit in the first quarter. Does that generally lead to better growth in the future quarters versus environments where you just don't have that conference business?\nDoug Peterson: Yes. The conferences are clearly a critical part of our brand building and relationship building. As you know, across all of our businesses, we think about our relationships as long-term professional relationships that we manage in a way that we always want to bring the best products and best services. And our conferences serve as a way to convene thought leadership. They allow us to convene the leaders across industries. And that always gives us opportunities to improve our ACV, improve our relationships, improve our access to clients. So, it's not -- you can't find necessarily a direct relationship. But there's definitely an indirect relationship over time that allows us to build our customer revenues and ensure that we are really relevant to the markets.\nSimon Clinch: That’s really helpful. Thanks very much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Simon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. I just want to start just on the energy side. Doug, maybe you could talk a little bit. The legacy INFO assets took a little bit of time to turn whenever there was an upturn in the energy markets, but we used to get some good indications in terms of accelerated consulting business and other things that were kind of a precursor to things getting a lot better. I was wondering if you're seeing the same things in the business right now. Is the fact that some of the energy prices spiking have to do with the war making it that it's not the same kind of demand that we would have normally seen? Just a little bit of context around that. And then I have a quick follow-up.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. I think there's three factors I would like to mention. One of them you talked about, which is the war and the very specific environment right now with the volatility of energy prices as other commodity prices, including metals and agriculture. This is creating a lot of demand for knowledge, for thought leadership, for opening up stronger relationships. And the second, I would say, really relates to energy transition, which is a longer-term view that companies and governments are very interested in what will be the long-term impact of the shift to cleaner and renewable energy environment. And there's a lot of discussion going on right now about transition energy, what's the future of natural gas. These also open up opportunities for all of the businesses. And then the third is, relates to the -- all of this together is the Upstream business. As Ewout talked about earlier, the Upstream business has been -- really had been decreasing over the last few years. And it seems as if in this current environment and with all of the investments that have been made that, that business is now going to be seeing a bottom and starting to grow again. So, we think that net-net, all of the businesses together position us very well to be able to address all of the needs and the opportunities in the future of the energy and commodities businesses.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great. Thank you. And then a quick question. Just -- you talked about targeted merit increases and increased retention. What has retention been since the acquisition closed a couple of months ago? Just the overall level of people that are -- you really want to retain to really drive this business forward. On the fringes, is it a little bit more challenging? Are you happy with the way that you're retaining the people? It really is key for the deal. So, I wanted to just hear how you're doing 2 months in.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thank you for that. And 2 months in, we are thrilled with the results. Our people are excited. They're motivated. One of the key indicators we look at is people changing their LinkedIn profile to say S&P Global, which is very high. We find that the people have been motivated by the vision, the purpose and the values of S&P Global as we’ve come together. And it's too early. It's just really 1 month in, 2 months in for us to give you any trends. But all of the informal indicators are very strong that we've been able to bring the team together that's very motivated and people want to ensure that we have a successful future.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Shlomo. Well, let me finish and thank everyone for joining the call. And I want to elaborate on the question that Shlomo just asked, which is about how things are going. We are thrilled that we were able to close this quarter and be able to have that merger come together after 15 months. All of the teams have come together so well as you've heard us discuss during this call, the ability to find opportunities from what we are hearing from our customers to bring our organization together at every single level, including our commercial teams that are out there looking for ways to sell and to innovate and bring new products to the market. In addition, we think that we are off to a great start on integration and the ability to bring the two teams together in a way that not only do we create value through cost synergies, but they were also positioning ourselves for growth for the future. The more we get to know about IHS Markit and S&P Global together, the more we know that we validated that this was the right thing to do, that the two companies together are stronger than either would have been alone. And finally, when it comes to what Shlomo just asked about our people, we are very excited to see the way that our people have come together with a strong executive committee that’s developed a set of visions and purposes and values that across the company, we are all talking about, we are committed to. And we think that we are off to a fantastic start, and we appreciate all of the questions today and all the support from the analysts as well as our shareholders and very importantly, our people. So again, thank you very much for the call today.\nOperator: That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available now for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about 2 hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&P Global's website for 1 year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for 1 month. On behalf of S&P Global, we thank you for participating and wish you a good day.",

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. I want to start by emphasizing the successful execution we saw this quarter. With five of our six divisions posting pro forma revenue growth, it's already clear that we are more resilient, both operationally and financially as a combined company. With our larger scale and more diversified revenue streams, we're more insulated to volatility in the debt issuance market. As such, we were able to grow pro forma revenue and adjusted EPS year-over-year even during a period of sharp decreases in issuance. Doug highlighted the headline financial results. I will take a moment to cover a few other items. But as a reminder, when we discuss financial results from operations and cash flows, we're discussing those results on an adjusted pro forma basis, as if S&P Global and IHS Markit were combined for the entirety of all periods presented, unless explicitly called out as GAAP. Adjusted results also exclude the contribution from divested businesses in all periods. We have also made minor refinements to the recast pro forma financials for all four quarters of 2021, which can be found in the amended 8-K filed today. Adjusted corporate and allocated expenses declined from a year ago, caused by a combination of reduced incentive and fringe costs, as well as the release of certain benefits accruals. Our net interest expense increased 5% as we increase gross debt partially offset the lower average rates due to refinancings. The decrease in adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to tax deductions related to stock-based compensation and merger related optimization of capital and liquidity structure. As we introduced last year, we'll continue to disclose these three categories of non-GAAP adjustments to provide insights into the type of expenses that we are incurring related to the merger and the synergies we have discussed. Transaction costs in the quarter were $281 million. These are costs related to completing the merger. They include legal fees, investment banking fees and filing fees. Integration cost in the quarter were $58 million. These are costs to operationalize the integration. They include consulting, infrastructure, and retention cost. Costs to achieve synergies amounted to $88 million in the quarter. These are costs needed to enable expense and revenue synergies. They include lease termination, severance, contract exit fees, and investments related to product development, marketing and distribution enhancements. During the first quarter, the non-GAAP operating adjustments collectively totaled to $504 million, including a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of businesses and a $200 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation in addition to the merger related items I mentioned. Given the growth in expenses this quarter, we wanted to provide some insight into the drivers, many of which are transitional. Importantly, we expect expense growth to moderate as we progress through the year, even excluding the impact of cost synergies. In the first quarter, we recognized $8 million in additional T&E expenses as we saw a limited resumption of travel relative to the last 2 years. We've also saw a $10 million increase in advertising expense associated with our Mobility division. Investments in growth initiatives contributed to $28 million of the increase. We are specifically disclosing the increase from what we're calling a step-up impact in the quarter. This relates to increases in expenses that we view as a re-establishment of baseline cost. The return of in-person events included several major conferences in the first quarter as Doug mentioned. Together, these live events added more than $20 million of incremental expense relative to last year when these events were still virtual. Step-up costs also incorporate a comprehensive process to align compensation practices across our employee base. One of these changes is to harmonize the timing of annual merit increases to March from April. The pull-forward of that merit increase costs one month of impact in the first quarter that did not occur in the year ago periods. We also recognized $15 million in additional expense related to the ongoing cloud transition. Free cash flow excluding certain items was $701 million in the first 3 months of 2022. Note that this is meant to reflect the estimated free cash flow of the combined company as if the merger were closed on January 1, 2022. We will provide some additional color on the drivers of our cash balance and our gross debt in the next few slides. Now turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with ample liquidity. As of the end of the first quarter, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.4 billion and debt of $11.4 billion. Our adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITA at the end of the first quarter was 2.57x. As you can see, our cash balance declined sequentially to $4.4 billion. The single largest drive in the reduction was a $7 billion in cash paid to fund the first tranche of our 2022 $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program. We also received net proceeds from divestitures of $2.6 billion and net proceeds of $2.3 billion from the issuance of debt. Now to gross debt. We issued $5.5 billion of new debt in the first quarter, $3.5 billion of which has been allocated to refinancing existing debt. After the quarter closed, we also made a final debt redemption payment of $600 million, which brought our adjusted gross debt leverage down to 2.47x. Now, I'd like to provide an update on our synergy progress. In the first quarter, we have achieved $23 million in cost synergies, and our current annualized run rate is $135 million. While we are already seeing significant progress in pipeline and customer conversations, with only 1 month as a combined company, revenue synergies are negligible. The cumulative integration and cost to achieve synergies through the end of the first quarter is $365 million. Now let's turn to the division results and begin with Market Intelligence. Market Intelligence delivered revenue growth of 7% with growth across all product lines. Expenses increased 8% primarily due to factors I mentioned earlier. Investments in technology, especially cloud transition cost and continued investment in strategic initiatives like ESG. Segment operating profit increased 5% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 29%. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 30%. You can see on the slide our operating profit from the OSTTRA joint venture that complements the operations of our Market Intelligence division. The JV contributed $26 million in adjusted operating profit to the company because the JV is a 50% owned joint venture, operating independent of the company, we do not include the financial results of OSTTRA in the Market Intelligence division. Looking across Market Intelligence, there was solid growth in each category, and on a pro forma basis, Desktop revenue grew 7%, Data & Advisory solutions revenue grew 12%, Enterprise Solutions revenue grew 2%, and Credit & Risk Solutions revenue grew 8%. As Doug discussed at length, ratings faced a challenging issuance environment in the first quarter with revenue declining 15% year-over-year. Expenses increased 7% primarily due to compensation expense and information service cost partially offset by lower occupancy cost. This resulted in a 25% decrease in segment operating profit and 820 basis points decrease in segment operating profit margin. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased approximately 105 basis points to 62%. Non-transaction revenue increased 7% primarily due to growth in fees associated with surveillance and growth in CRISIL revenue. Transaction revenue decreased 31% on the soft issuance already discussed. This slide depicts Ratings revenue by its end markets. The largest contributors to the decrease in Ratings revenue were the 21% decrease in corporates and the 12% decrease in structured finance, driven predominantly by structured credit. In addition, financial services decreased 9%, governments decreased 11% and the CRISIL and other category increased 12%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 14%. Return of in-person conferences, most notably CERAWeek and World Petrochemical Conference drove 70% year-over-year growth in Advisory & Transactional Services revenue. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, revenue growth would have been 8% year-over-year. Global Trading Services had a great quarter, increasing 17%, mainly due to strong fuel oil and iron ore volumes. As Doug noted earlier, GTS revenue often picks up when commodity prices become more volatile, which we certainly witnessed in the first quarter. Expenses increased 18% primarily due to cost associated with the return of in-person conferences and headcount and compensation expense. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, expenses would have increased 10% year-over-year. Segment operating profit increased 8% and the segment operating profit margin decreased 210 basis points to 43%. The trailing 12-month adjusted segment operating profit margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 43%. In addition to the exceptional quarter in Advisory & Transactional Services, we saw strong demand driving growth in price assessments and energy and resources, data and insights. Growth was partially offset by a modest decrease in Upstream data and insights. Though we note positive signs of inflection in the Upstream business, but for the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, Upstream would have had its second consecutive quarter of positive ACV growth, which is a leading indicator for revenue. We also saw a dramatic improvement in retention in the Upstream business as retention rates improved by more than 10 full percentage points over the last 12-month. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in Planning Solutions and Used Car offerings. Expenses grew 11% on increased advertising expense in the quarter and headcount growth in 2021, as the business restores capacity to better align with strong growth over the past 18 months. This resulted in an 8% growth in adjusted operating profit and 80 basis points of margin contraction year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased approximately 400 basis points to 39%. Dealer revenue increased to 12% year-over-year benefiting from successful prior period promotions and from retention rates that remain above pre-COVID levels. Growth in manufacturing was 3% year-over-year related to the well-publicized supply chain challenges faced by automotive OEMs. Financials and other increased 12%, driven primarily by strength in our insurance underwriting products. S&P Dow Jones Indices delivered strong revenue growth of 14% year-over-year, primarily due to gains in AUM linked to our indices. During the quarter, expenses increased 9%, largely due to strategic investments, increased compensation and IT costs. Segment operating profit increased 16% and the segment operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 69.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin increased approximately 10 basis points to 68%. Every category increased revenue this quarter. Asset linked fees increased 15%, primarily from AUM driven gains in ETFs, mutual funds and insurance. Exchange traded derivative revenue increased 22% on the increased trading volumes. Data and customs subscriptions increased 4%. Over the past year, ETF net inflows were $286 billion and market appreciation totaled $244 billion. This resulted in quarter ending ETF AUM of $2.9 trillion, which is 22% higher compared to 1 year ago. Our ETF revenue is based on average AUM, which increased 24% year-over-year. Sequentially versus the end of the fourth quarter, ETF net inflows associated with our indices totaled $68 billion and market depreciation totaled $123 billion. Within our Engineering Solutions division we saw 7% revenue growth, driven primarily by growth in non-subscription offerings, most notably the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code, or BPVC, which was last released in August of 2021. Investment in growth initiatives and an increase in royalty expense led to a 5% increase in adjusted expenses This resulted in segment operating profit growth of 17% and 160 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. On a trailing 12-month basis, the adjusted segment operating profit margin contracted approximately 115 basis points to 20%. Subscription revenue in Engineering Solutions increased 3% year-over-year, while non-subscription revenue increased 60% over the same period. Now moving to our guidance. This slide depicts our new GAAP guidance, and this slide depicts our updated 2022 adjusted pro forma guidance. For revenue, we now expect a low single-digit increase year-over-year, reflecting the issuance environment, partially offset by the strength we are seeing in our non-Ratings businesses. We now expect corporate unallocated expense between $85 million and $95 million, approximately $30 million lower than our previous guidance on lower forecast incentive compensation and professional fees. Interest expense is expected in the range of $360 million to $370 million, down $10 million from prior guidance. This is due to a slightly lower average cost of debt than we initially expected. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $165 million and free cash flow, excluding certain items in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. There is no change to our expectations for deal-related amortization, operating profit margin expansion or tax rate. This slide illustrates our guidance by division. For Ratings, we now expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits and for margins to be in the low to mid-60s. This compares to previous guidance calling for low single-digit revenue growth and margins in the mid-60s. Our outlook for other segments is unchanged from previous guidance. Overall, we are incredibly encouraged by the team's ability to execute so well even in the current macro environment. We are focused on the enormous long-term opportunity ahead of us as a combined company, and we are more confident than ever in our ability to execute against that opportunity. Our differentiated data, insights, analytics and services help our customers to thrive and accelerate progress. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Good morning, George. Indeed, as Doug said, we are expecting still the second quarter to see some impact with respect to our quarterly expectations, but then to see some improvement in the second half of this year and particularly also because the comps will get easier during the second half of this year. I also would like to point out, of course, the benefits we have of the broader company we are at this point in time because five of our -- the six divisions are performing in line or better than expectations. We will see during the course of this year coming in the benefits from our cost synergies, the benefits from our buyback program and so on. So that should help drive the earnings per share growth in a very strong way during the rest of the year. Hence, that we're still guiding to double-digit EPS growth for the full year. So definitely, those elements will help to strengthen the performance of the company during the course of 2022. Yes, let me give you a quick overview for each of the divisions and happy to go deeper in some of the next questions. But for example, Market Intelligence, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity. The first conversations we are having with customers are really showing the benefit of the combined company. And we saw actually the subscription revenue going up in a very strong way, actually growing more in the double-digit space. Commodity Insights, very strong commercial momentum. The main issue with respect to the Russian revenue impact will be in Commodity Insights, but we expect to be able to offset a significant part of that based on the very strong commercial momentum we are seeing and also very excited about what we can offer our customers on a combined basis. Mobility, clearly some positive trends as well as we have pointed out, particularly because we see higher retention of our customers. The Index business, a strong AUM growth. Keep in mind, we are looking at this year-over-year. And of course, we started at much lower AUM levels at the beginning of 2021, and then also the derivative activity and volumes are much higher. And then you also saw Engineering Solutions growing in a healthy way during the quarter. So overall, we think that our businesses are very well-positioned, five of the six and that the issues with respect to the debt issuance environment are very isolated within the Ratings division itself. And also keep in mind that we have a significant component in Ratings with respect to non-transaction revenue. So that is clearly also an element of stability and offset for the overall transactional revenue. Yes, we are always looking, Manav, at the actual asset levels. And then we are assuming with respect to the growth and market appreciation, a very modest development for the remainder of the year. But keep in mind that this is a business where we have the natural offset, the partial hedge because if the asset levels will come down, we see the derivative trading activity going up and the other way around. And as you have seen this quarter, actually, the Index business has performed very well based on those kind of dynamics. So, if you look at it historically, the Index business actually has been growing revenues for many, many years in a row in very volatile market circumstances, very different circumstances over the years. And that is exactly due to the dynamics of the business and the business model that we have the different revenue streams in the Index business. Good morning, Ton. You're right. There are many different elements that go in the mix with respect to our margin expectation. But let me first reemphasize our margin expectations. So, what we are guiding to is still 130 basis points margin expansion during 2022. And the reason is we will see some natural growth in our businesses. We, of course, have our business as usual expense growth based on the activities of the business. We, of course, have some impact of the overall compensation environment. We have done some targeted increases in certain job groups. We have raised the merit in certain jurisdictions, a bit higher than we have done in previous years. But then at the same time, we also have several management actions that we are taking. Definitely, in the current environment, we're, of course, very careful from an expense perspective. So, we will see benefits from some of those management actions. We also have the benefit of some of our variable expenses that will come down during the course of this year. And then if you layer on top of that the cost synergies that will be very meaningful and significant, we are actually very pleased that in an environment -- macro environment where we are today, that we, as a company, still can improve our margins, increase our margins in a very significant way. Yes. Toni, with respect to our own effort, 6.5% to 8% revenue growth for '22 and '23 combined, we have no reason to back away from that at this point in time. But obviously, we will continue to monitor that very closely. And the reason is that, as we mentioned, five of our six divisions are performing in line or better than expected. So, the main question is when is the issuance environment coming back. And we have been in that movie many times before. If you look back for the last decade, there's maybe three situations where the issuance environment was negative, and there were impacts on the Ratings revenue. But what we usually have seen then is after one or a few quarters, that came back in a very strong way. So, it is really the matter of the uncertainty about the timing when that is coming back. So, for that reason, we have no reason at this moment to back away from our revenue expectations for '22 and '23 combined. Thanks, Toni. Yes. Thank you, Ashish. I think it's important first to point out that we are in these results only 1-month in as a combined company. So, in that context that we are already being able to report $123 million of cost synergies on an annualized basis, we think actually that's already a very strong indicator. With respect to the absolute number and the phasing of our cost synergies, nothing has changed compared to our information that we provided on March 1 during the merger call. But what is important to point out is that we made good progress. We are very comfortable and confident that we can hit those numbers. And you recall that we said that we will be able to achieve about $600 million of cost synergies in total and that we expect something like 35% to 40% in 2022, so realized in this year. And as I said, we are very confident that we are on track to hit those numbers. Alex, yes, let me give you a bit of the breakdown and explanation what is happening exactly in recurring variable. You're right. If you look at MI as a whole, approximately 83% is subscription-based, 5% is non-subscription. And then you have that category in between that is subscription variable at approximately 12%. There you see a bit more impact from market fluctuations, capital market fluctuations because that's the business that has some of those capital markets platforms, some of the origination platforms, some of the equity platforms. And that is being impacted by some of the general M&A and capital market activity and issuance environment that we are seeing, both in fixed income and equity in the markets. And yes, that is a market and a business where you see a bit of that impact. But overall, you see that the Market Intelligence, nevertheless, was growing in a very strong way. And when we see more stability in the markets over time, when we see the M&A environment coming back, we would also expect to see the subscription variable component growing faster again. So that's the underlying dynamic that is happening in the MI business. Thanks, Alex. So, if you look at non-transaction, there is a bit of a mix of elements that go into that bucket. What we see is particularly strength in annual fees. So, for example, that is surveillance, and of course, with more bonds and loans outstanding after the very strong issuance environment over the last 2 years, we see some benefit from that. Also, frequent issuer fees are going in that category. So that is also very stable. And at the same time, we see also the CRISIL performance that goes in non-transaction being very strong. So CRISIL is growing very rapidly, both on the domestic Indian Ratings business as well as in the global research, risk and benchmarking business. Where we see in the non-transaction bucket the revenue are not moving up, it's mostly Rating Evaluation Services, less M&A activity. So that is impacting Rating Evaluation Service and also new issuer credit ratings. Given the current environment, we also see less activity there. Nevertheless, of course, 7% is a nice growth for non-transaction. We would probably see that slowing down that growth a little bit for the remainder of the year, but I would expect it still to be in a positive territory. Yes, first on the portfolio, we are very committed on driving growth and success of each of our businesses at this point in time. We see multiple opportunities, as we mentioned during the prepared remarks, of value creation across the enterprise. There's a lot of cross links we are seeing with respect to revenue synergies. And I think it's really exciting to see what we can do altogether. Having said that, you know us and our management style and philosophy will always be very disciplined portfolio managers. And we will always determine ultimately over time if we are the best owners of certain assets. But at this moment, really our focus on driving the economic value generation of the portfolio of businesses we have at S&P Global. And maybe one quick addition on cloud. There is a bit of a bubble [ph] cost, mostly in Market Intelligence because we are still in the transition there in that particular segment from on-prem to the cloud. So, we would expect over time to see that expense growth to go away. So, it's more transitional in terms of the expense impact on the Market Intelligence segment. With respect to the buyback question, Owen, we expect that the current $7 billion ASR program will be completed at the beginning of August. And then we are ready to enter into the next phase of our buyback program to complete the full $12 billion at the end of 2022. Thanks, Owen. I think if you look at that, Craig, we always start with what is the added value we deliver for our customers. What is -- what will contribute in terms of usage, what kind of data sets are these, proprietary data sets, hard-to-achieve data sets, how are we embedded in workflows and processes? That is the starting point. And then we look at the overall value we generate for the enterprise and think about what is appropriate in terms of pricing and price increases for such a contract going forward. So, we don't just look at that simply by a percentage. We always look at first, what do we deliver to the customers and then reason back to what is appropriate in terms of the economic level of the fee that we will charge to the customer. Yes, that is a bit speculative, Craig, as you understand. So, I have to be careful answer that question in a too specific way. But you know our management philosophy and approach. We always will be looking to raise the bar to find new opportunities, to leave no stone unturned. We will be looking across the whole company about what we can do better, more efficient, where we can integrate, where we have opportunities to automate, where we can use AI and Kensho across the board. So that is what we are planning to do. I think you know that the biggest areas of integration will be in Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and in Corporate. So, if we will find upside ultimately in synergies, most likely it's in those areas. But again, we will be continuing to look for opportunities across the board. Thanks, Craig. And one quick addition to Doug's answer. Although you're right, Jeff, that the direct cost synergies in Ratings will be relatively small, Ratings will be a beneficiary of cost synergies in the Corporate segment that is being allocated to all divisions. And because Ratings has a very large base in revenues and employees based on those allocation keys, Ratings will be, in the end, also significant beneficiary from the corporate cost synergies that we will accomplish. It's based on management's best estimates, our own internal forecasting models, which is the midpoint, the best estimate point that the Ratings Research Group has put out in terms of the issuance outlook. So that is that minus 5% level. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. Faiza, first of all, welcome to the call, and we are very happy that you're part of the analyst group now covering us as a company. So first, on Commodity Insights in terms of the expectation in terms of revenue growth for the year, we have said mid single digits. And then in terms of margins, mid to high 40s. And nothing has changed there compared to what we said to you a few months ago. And what you see is maybe first, I should speak about the impact of the Russian situation and the fact that we have suspended our commercial activities with Russian customers. Overall, not material for the company as a whole, but the largest impact is in Commodity Insights. But as I said at the answer of a previous question, we are very pleased to see the commercial momentum in the Commodity Insights business, and we expect that they are able to make up a significant part of that during the course of this year. So that's clearly a positive. You're right that revenues looked a bit high during the quarter 14%. But take into account that we had that CERAWeek event that had a significant impact on revenues during the first quarter. If you take CERAWeek out, revenue increase was approximately 8% during the quarter. So still strong, but definitely at a different level. Final commentary is we are really excited to see what is happening in that business because you could say there is, in fact, really a benefit of two trends at the same time. Traditional energy doing well. Of course, with the current commodity prices, you see that producers are in a healthy situation. And then there is so much focus at the same time on energy transition that we will have a benefit of helping our customers on both angles, and that's clearly driving some of the underlying growth in this division. And therefore, we are overall very, very optimistic and positive about the outlook for Commodity Insights. Well, we are not giving any particular guidance on a downside scenario in a quantitative way. So, I would like to be careful to answer your question in too much specifics. I think the overall perspective that we have on the Ratings business is that at some point, we will see the issuance environment coming back. We have seen this in many times in the past. At some point, this will improve. And we really think that we should lower the level of anxiety around all of this because there is uncertainty around timing. But ultimately, we have always said there could be one or a few quarters where Ratings revenue will be under pressure. But if you are having a mid- to long-term perspective of the company, nothing has changed with respect to outstanding debt. Nothing has changed with respect to overall trends and correlations with GDP and other growth drivers. So, the secular trends in this business are still there. Maybe short-term, there could be some fluctuations. But if the perspective is more mid to long-term, I think nothing is different with respect to the overall activity of the markets and also the economics of the business, both the top line growth and the margin expectations for the Ratings business. Faiza."

            "name": "Doug Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Welcome to today's first quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by highlighting the historic event that occurred in the first quarter of 2022. We completed our merger with IHS Markit. And I'm incredibly excited to be joining you for our first quarterly earnings call as a combined company. The promise of the merger has already begun to manifest itself in our culture and our financial performance. Beginning with a few financial highlights. We reported strong financial results with adjusted pro forma revenue increasing 2% and adjusted pro forma diluted EPS increasing $0.01 year-over-year despite one of the most challenging issuance environments in recent history. We saw positive revenue growth in five of our six divisions, including double-digit growth in three of them. Adjusted pro forma expenses increased 8% as we continue to invest in events, people and technology. Though much of this expense growth is non-recurring as we'll discuss later on. We're updating our guidance to reflect the increased uncertainty caused by the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape. And Ewout will walk through these details in a moment. I'd also like to share a few highlights from the first quarter. As I mentioned, we completed the merger with IHS Markit, had a number of exciting achievements. We announced a $12 billion accelerated share repurchase or ASR and launched the first tranche of $7 billion dollars in March with the remainder to be executed by the end of the year. We took advantage of this still historically low interest rate environment to optimize our capital structure and lower our average cost of debt. And we had strong attendance at some of the industry's most important conferences, including CERAWeek, World Petrochemical Conference and TPM22. While we've only been together for 2 months, we're already starting to see validation of our investment thesis, and the results of our comprehensive planning are paying off. We've begun leveraging technology like Kensho across the broader organization to automate processes to increase efficiencies. We've begun development of several new products and features across the divisions. We're integrating our divisional commercial teams, and we've already closed synergy deals in multiple divisions. I want to take a moment to touch on culture and leadership. We brought our combined leadership team together in person for the first time in March. We were thrilled to see so many of our colleagues brainstorming, planning, working and functioning as if they had already been together for years. We saw the free exchange of ideas, strong proposals for new growth engines, and clear alignment on our strategy, purpose and values. We also heard a unified voice among our leadership in support of our people first initiatives and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. We came away energized and full of confidence that we'll be able to take the absolute best not only from each company, but from each person in the organization and create something exceptional with S&P Global. I have never been more inspired by our people, and I'm more excited than ever to work with them to drive sustainable, profitable growth. When we announced the merger in November 2020, we noted that we needed regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions. We received final regulatory approval on February 25, 2022, and officially closed the merger 3 days later on February 28. We immediately went to work optimizing the capital structure issuing $5.5 billion in new debt, most of which was used to refinance existing debt at lower rates. We completed that refinancing in April 2022. In order to secure regulatory approval for the merger, we will require to divest a number of businesses. The table on this slide lays out the details of those divestitures. As we have shared with you before, the aggregate revenue from all of the businesses being divested is approximately $425 million. And the margins for each of these businesses are higher than the margins for each of the divisions they were in. We're confident that we negotiated well on behalf of our shareholders in these transactions, evidenced by approximately 9.5x revenue multiple paid by the acquirers of these businesses in aggregate. Net after tax proceeds will total $2.85 billion. Now to recap, the financial results for the first quarter. Revenue increased 2% to $3.1 billion. Our adjusted operating profit decreased 6% to $1.4 billion. Our adjusted pro forma operating profit margin decreased approximately 340 basis points to 45% as both profits and margin were negatively impacted by the decrease in ratings transaction revenue and expense growth I mentioned earlier. As you know, we measure and track adjusted segment operating profit margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which decreased 60 basis points to 47%. In addition to our strong overall revenue performance and continued expense management, we launched a $7 billion ASR and began optimizing our capital structure. Combined with tax effects of merger related synergies and prudent investment, we increased adjusted pro forma diluted EPS year-over-year. Looking across the six divisions, I'm encouraged by the fact that even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, we were able to deliver strong revenue across five of our six divisions, including double-digit growth in Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices. In line with the expectations we laid out on our call in March, we did see a year-over-year decrease in ratings driven by an exceptionally soft issuance environment. During the first quarter, global bond issuance decreased 12%. This understates the impact to our business, however, as high yield issuance declined far more dramatically. In the U.S., issuance in aggregate decreased 25%. Its investment grade decreased 19%, high yield decreased 75%, public finance decreased 15%, structured finance increased 9% due to large increases in mortgage-backed securities offset by declines in structured credit. Bank loan ratings declined 35% year-over-year. European issuance decreased 14% as investment grade decreased 11%, high yield decreased 54% and structured finance increased 27% due to increases in RMBS and covered bonds, partially offset by declines in ABS, CMBS and structured credit. In Asia, issuance was flat. The next two slides look at the difference we saw in the quarter between investment grade issuance, and the issuance of high yield and leveraged loans. This slide shows an investment grade issuances resilient relative to other categories, decreasing only 5% year-over-year. This slide depicts the combination of high yield issuance in leveraged loan volume. This quarter we saw a decrease of over 50% from the incredible levels in the year ago period. High yield was particularly impacted by the uncertainty in the market, with issuance decreasing 68% year-over-year. While difficult to pinpoint exact causes, issuance in the first quarter was impacted both by the pull-forward we witnessed and discussed last year as well as the intentional delay we're hearing from customers, as many issuers wait for clear signs of stability before re-entering the market. Now turning to some of the factors that made this quarter successful for S&P Global. We saw significant increases in engagement and usage of our products and our content this quarter. The metrics on this slide are clear evidence that in periods of increased uncertainty, whether that's in the macroeconomic picture, market volatility or geopolitical tensions, our customers turn to us. They turn to us for the insights, data and tools that they need to make well informed business and investment decisions. It's also important to remember that S&P Global's stronger more diverse product portfolio allows areas of the business to thrive in times of elevated volatility and uncertainty. Within the S&P Dow Jones indices business, we saw more than 20% growth in revenue from our exchange-traded derivatives, whose volumes are directly correlated with market volatility. In the commodities markets, our global trading services business within Commodity Insights grew 17% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we held a number of Premier conferences attracting thousands of leaders from multiple industries. Several of these conferences returned to being in-person events for the first time in 3 years. One of these was CERAWeek. For some S&P Global Investors CERAWeek may be unfamiliar. CERAWeek is the world's leading event for the energy industry taking place in the first quarter each year and hosted in Houston, Texas. We were thrilled to welcome attendees back in-person. And it's clear that all of the factors impacting the energy industry right now, industry and government leaders wanted to be there. We had record attendance with over 5,200 delegates, 900 speakers and 50 senior government officials. With the combined resources, S&P Global Platts and IHS Markit, we're confident that CERAWeek will continue to grow and set itself apart as the must attend event for energy industry leaders. We also hosted the annual World Petrochemical Conference and the TPM Conference in the first quarter. Both conferences aimed to help industry leaders navigate some of the most pressing challenges facing our global economy. WPC convened this year to discuss how the chemical industry can help facilitate and thrive in a world progressing towards more sustainable operations, including net zero emissions targets. Our conferences bring people together to drive innovation and growth in different industries. But they also demonstrate the strength of S&P Global as a source and a destination for global leadership. We're thrilled with the progress we've made as we celebrate the first anniversary of Sustainable1. ESG revenue growth accelerate on both reported and organic basis in the first quarter, growing 57% year-over-year to reach nearly $50 million. We continue to introduce new ESG-related products and product enhancements at a rapid pace. In the first quarter, we saw the launch of 17 ESG ETFs based on our indices, and we ended the first quarter with AUM in ESG ETFs growing 28% to surpass $33 billion. Our Indices and Commodity Insights teams collaborated to launch the S&P GSCI Electric Vehicle Metals Index, and we continue to enhance ESG scores made available through our Capital IQ pro platform. One of the greatest advantages we have in ESG is the robust set of data that comes to us through the active participation of covered companies. Our 2021 corporate sustainability assessment saw a 64% increase in the number of companies working with us directly to ensure the datasets behind our ESG scores are robust, accurate and comprehensive. Our coverage of more than 11,000 companies includes approximately 2,300, which provide datasets and disclosure directly to CSA. Our commitment to active partnership with covered companies ensures our ESG scores are informed by the best data available. Now turning to our outlook. We have updated our bond issuance forecast for the year to reflect a decrease in the first quarter, as well as to better reflect the ongoing impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We now expect global issuance to decline approximately 5% year-over-year within a range of down 14% to flat in 2022. We expect corporates to see a 12% decrease in issuance partially offset by a 2% increase in financial services issuance. We expect U.S public finance and structured finance to each soften by 7%, and international public finance to shrink by about 1.5%. As we evaluate the remainder of the year, we wanted to discuss some of the assumptions that underpin our guidance. Let me start with our response to the tragic events taking place in Ukraine, and the impact on our business. As we've shared with you previously, combined revenue from Russia and Belarus is less than 1% of our total revenue. We have suspended commercial operations in Russia and Belarus including all customer contracts. We've suspended ratings of Russian entities and removed stocks and bonds listed or domiciled in Russia from our indices. While the direct financial impact on our business is not material, we acknowledged the indirect impact on the issuance environment and market volatility. We also wanted to illustrate some of the changes in the macroeconomic environment and inform our financial outlook for the company. In addition to lower debt issuance, we now expect slightly lower global GDP growth. Inflation is also likely to have a greater impact on our business and the economy as a whole relative to our expectations earlier this year. We're seeing some upward pressure on compensation expense that we expect to continue throughout the rest of the year. Commodities prices remain elevated relative to our early expectations as well. To be clear, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all metrics that inform our outlook, but rather to help investors understand the changes in some of the assumptions we make about the global economy when formulating guidance. Before handing it over to Ewout. I'd like to reiterate how pleased we are with the execution success we've seen in a challenging quarter. Our ability to drive positive growth in both revenue and adjusted pro forma earnings per share in a quarter like this would have been much more challenging before a merger with IHS Markit. The strength, stability and scale of our businesses gives us great confidence to invest for future growth and be optimistic about the years ahead. We remain committed to our strategic organic investments, as illustrated on this slide. And we remain confident these investments will power significant future growth and profitability for the company. With that I'll turn it over to Ewout to walk through our results and guidance. Ewout? Thanks for that question. This is Doug. Let me start with that. Well, knowing that issuance is going to be one of the key questions that we're going to be talking about, let me just review a little bit what we saw during the quarter and then some of the expectations for the rest of the year. As you know, it was a very weak quarter for issuance. We saw that the total global issuance was down 9% excluding bank loan ratings and 12% including bank loan ratings. We saw, as an example, U.S. bonds were down 22%; U.S. corporates were down almost 50%; and high yield globally was down 68%, and the U.S. was down 75%. So, with that backdrop, as you see, we've looked towards the rest of the year. We expect that issuance during the second quarter will be recovering, but not necessarily to the full extent that it would have been compared to last year. And the second half of the year, the comparables are not quite as difficult as they were earlier in the year, and we do believe that there will be a rebound in issuance given the situation and current positioning in the market. But let me hand it over to Ewout, who will provide some more color. Thanks, George. Yes. Well, first of all, let me share with you a little bit more about what our outlook is for the full year and what some of the sensitivities are in that forecast. As you know, we are expecting that the overall issuance of bonds will be down 5% for 2022. But if you look at what the components are in the corporates, we already saw very weak issuance in the first quarter. And so we've forecasted to be a 12% decline for the full year with a downside of up to 25%. And it could recover and have a 5% -- down 5% full year. We do see strength in financial services. They continue to outpace the issuance last year. We expect it for the full year will be up 2%. But again, with the current environment, that could drop to up to 5% down. Structured finance and U.S. public finance could be down at 7% this year. That's what our current forecast is, and they could also see downside up to 12%. And then there's other factors such as international public finance that as well would be down 2%. But as you know, we are very close to the markets. We watch what's happening. Our forecast is based on many, many different factors. We look at what is the current situation of maturing bonds in the market whether it's on people's balance sheets. As you know, there was very little -- hardly any issuance at all of either loans, high-yield loans or high-yield bonds during the first quarter. There's a pipeline out there that still wants to go to the markets. We also know that there is a set of M&A transactions which have not been completed. There's $1 trillion of private equity capital on the sideline that still has not been deployed. So, we look at all of these factors and weigh them together to come up with our estimate for the year of 5% down. So, this isn't just one single factor that goes into it. We are looking across many, many different factors. And as Ewout just said, we also expect that through the year, there will be recovery in issuance as we keep going deeper into the year. Thanks, Manav. Let me start with that. We've been thrilled with the response we've been getting from our customers as we started the merger and working together. We've been able to get all of our teams merged within the divisions commercial team. So, they're out listening to customers. Ewout and I have been out listening to customers and hearing what they talk about. They're talking a lot about ESG, about energy transition, about some of the key thesis of this deal where we began with. In addition, they're interested in data and AI and machine learning, how they can link their data with ours.  And we've seen that our commercial organizations have already been out in the market. We have strong pipelines of cross-sell within all the divisions. We also have a set of products that we'll be looking at over time. As you know, the merger will be very powerful for us, but the main synergies coming from the revenue side are built towards the back end. But we are already seeing very, very strong relationships with customers, very good dialogue and with all of the different areas that were the core thesis of the deal itself. Thanks, Ashish. Yes. So, thank you for that. As you pointed out, we had really two different approaches. At Market Intelligence at S&P Global, we generally had more of an approach that was an enterprise model. It gave us an opportunity for customers to have all of the users having access to the products and services, where financial services comes in with an approach where some of their products are priced more on a per user basis or a volume basis. There are some of the products within the new Market Intelligence, which came from IHS Markit that are going to be priced differently because they're installed software, which for us is an exciting new area, also some of the enterprise services that are provided as well. So, some of those are not going to necessarily fit within the product merger. But there are a lot of opportunities that we've seen of moving data, which is within the IHS Markit, things like bond pricing, reference pricing, moving that into the Desktop. In addition, there's data that we have for even something that we've had as long as Compustat, where some of that data can be moved into the products and services that are software solutions. So, the commercial teams have been brought together. There's been immediate cross-training so that every single person from both of the two companies understand the products of each other. We've also seen opportunities for the traditional cross-sell customers that don't have products on one side or the other that we started servicing. And as I mentioned, some of the biggest themes in ESG. We have the new scores, which we have 11,000 scores, which we've taken and put them into the Desktop. We can put those into many other areas. So, we see ESG as a theme, data as a theme. There's a lot of interest in credit risk. Private markets is another area. So, it's only been 1 month for this quarter since we closed. It's been 2 months since we closed, but the enthusiasm, the momentum is excellent. Well, first of all, thank you for the question and drilling down a little bit more, there's really two key factors. First of all, if you looked at the high-yield issuance in February then into March and into April, it has been quite weak. There's times when we've gone an entire week and even longer without even one issuer coming to market. Given the external environment, that's also had a change. If you go back to the beginning of March, the last time we spoke, there had -- the invasion of Ukraine had just started. We hadn't seen yet the major impact on the markets of volatility of the energy markets and commodity markets. And we also, at the time, didn't have any clear guidance yet from the Fed what they were going to be doing on interest rates. So, if I take a step back and look at very specific dynamics in the high-yield market itself, when will that be coming back and what are our expectations. And then second, the overall macroeconomic geopolitical environment and then more specifically in the U.S., we are just starting to get a window into what will be the programs that the Fed is going to institute to try to combat inflation and the timing of some of their interest rate increases. Yes. Take this as an estimate for global issuance. This is what our team looks at. It includes all markets and all types of issuance. It's the exact same base that we use when we talk about what the overall issuance has been quarter-by-quarter. Yes, rated issuance would be -- if you look at -- if you could adjust a little bit for Asia, where the fees are not quite the same and there's issuance in China still a different kind of a market, but that's the forecast that we use. It's the basis we use for the guidance that we provided. Yes. When we look at Europe, there's a couple of different factors. First of all, on the Rating side, it was similar to the rest of the world. The issuance levels were down. We saw that in Europe itself that for the quarter, the corporate issuance is down about 25%. Financial services was down 13%. That compares to in the U.S., corporates are down almost 50%. Financial services were down less in the U.S., 5% versus the 13% in Europe. But in addition, Europe did have some strong structured finance issuance. But overall, Europe continues to be a market that we're quite interested in because we see the transformation from a banking market to a capital market. There's also very strong growth in ESG. Europe is one of the sectors and one of the regions of the world that's really setting the fastest pace on ESG. We see a lot of interest there for the different ESG funds we've launched. We've seen fastest growth for S&P 500 ESG and Dow Jones Sustainable Indices that have been launched. Europe is the pace setter there. And we also know that in Europe, there's been a slower uptake of inflation. Right now, inflation is not quite as high as it is in the U.S. The ECB has not moved as fast when they are looking at increasing the core rates. So right now, the negative side of Europe is clearly that you've got the Ukraine invasion and that horrific war that's going on there. And we will have to see what kind of impact that has on Europe. Europe is also impacted potentially by the energy markets. But net-net, our European businesses have been on the same pace as the rest that we've seen in the U.S. But there are a few downsides, but we also see a lot of upside as the market doesn't have the same inflation impacts as well as the opportunities for the capital markets to play a much larger role. Thanks, Tom (sic) [Hans]. Thanks, Owen Lau. Well, first of all, in this environment, the combination of Platts and IHS, the energy natural resources business is providing the knowledge and the resources that the markets look to in a volatile environment like this. Clearly, there's a combination of volatility in the energy markets, both with gas and in oil. You see the commodities related to agriculture also going -- undergoing a lot of volatility. And we have a combination of the benchmarks, which are embedded in people's contracts, in the research and the analytics. We have advisory services. We also have the energy transition that people are looking to. We have a combination of new products and services that we're coming together with IHS Markit in carbon markets, in battery metals, in things that are the transition energy economy. So, we think that the two together really bring a powerful voice that people are looking to. And let me just end with something we talked about on the earnings -- on the prepared transcript, which was related to CERAWeek. CERAWeek is the premier conference for the energy industry. And this year, there are over 5,000 participants. And it was a very, very lively dialogue, including government officials talking about what's the future of commodities. And we are really at the center of that dialogue and think that it's one of the best times for us and one of the most exciting things about the combination. Let me start with the question about cloud. And one of the -- another one of the exciting things about the transformation with the merger is that we have an opportunity to have scale in all of our negotiations and discussions with our providers when it comes to cloud and our digital transformation. Both S&P Global and IHS Markit, we are far advanced on cloud transformation. We are able to bring those two programs together and get scale. In addition, we have really interesting opportunities in data and data sciences that you'll be hearing much more about in the future. But I will let Ewout answer the other part of your question. Well, first of all, clearly, Ratings has different levers they can pull. If we need to, we could move costs. When it comes to compensation, we could slow down hiring, we could slow down investments. But at the same time, as Ewout mentioned earlier, there are times where there's variability in the issuance environment where you've seen big drops. We've always mentioned that you could see a quarter or two quarters with very weak issuance. So we also want to make sure that we don't cut too quickly, too fast. We think that the markets are complex. There is growing. People want to see a variety of opinions. We're also investing in ESG across the Ratings team. We have a specialized unit within the Ratings business that is doing sustainability analytics. We're seeing high growth there. We want to make sure that all of our analysts are ready to provide any type of support for those markets. So clearly, there's a lot of levers we can pull, and we will already do some of those. But at the same time, we want to make sure that we keep investing in that business because it's so critical to our overall franchise. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. There's a couple of opportunities there. One of them is that the overall mobility industry itself, the automotive industry is going through a lot of change. This is a time when dealers, OEMs as well as suppliers to the OEMs are looking for more and more information about the supply chain, about the supply chain disruption. They want to understand more about what's happening at the dealer level, who's walking in the cars, who's walking into the dealership. In addition, there's been a lot of changes in the financing environment. As you know, the dealers as well as the OEMs have been using a lot of information in the last few years with different types of rebates with low interest rate loans, low interest rate leases. And so, the market is really going through a lot of changes in addition to electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. And with all of that, there is a value in having this data and analytics that come from the Mobility division embedded in people's workflow. And we just see that there's a high need for it right now in this disruptive environment and a lot of change going on. So, this is an area that we're pleased to see that this kind of stickiness, especially in this kind of an environment. Yes. Well, first of all, you're right that there's a different kind of mix and different sort of revenue profile. This last quarter, we did have many of the issuers that were out in the market, which were the frequent issuers that have a different pricing profile than those which are more transactional. So, we do look carefully at the mix. The more high yield, sometimes there's higher volumes, higher pricing there as opposed to some of the frequent issuers. So, it's something to watch, but there's no necessary -- no specific guideline, but mix is important when you look at the transaction revenues. Yes. The conferences are clearly a critical part of our brand building and relationship building. As you know, across all of our businesses, we think about our relationships as long-term professional relationships that we manage in a way that we always want to bring the best products and best services. And our conferences serve as a way to convene thought leadership. They allow us to convene the leaders across industries. And that always gives us opportunities to improve our ACV, improve our relationships, improve our access to clients. So, it's not -- you can't find necessarily a direct relationship. But there's definitely an indirect relationship over time that allows us to build our customer revenues and ensure that we are really relevant to the markets. Thanks, Simon. Yes. I think there's three factors I would like to mention. One of them you talked about, which is the war and the very specific environment right now with the volatility of energy prices as other commodity prices, including metals and agriculture. This is creating a lot of demand for knowledge, for thought leadership, for opening up stronger relationships. And the second, I would say, really relates to energy transition, which is a longer-term view that companies and governments are very interested in what will be the long-term impact of the shift to cleaner and renewable energy environment. And there's a lot of discussion going on right now about transition energy, what's the future of natural gas. These also open up opportunities for all of the businesses. And then the third is, relates to the -- all of this together is the Upstream business. As Ewout talked about earlier, the Upstream business has been -- really had been decreasing over the last few years. And it seems as if in this current environment and with all of the investments that have been made that, that business is now going to be seeing a bottom and starting to grow again. So, we think that net-net, all of the businesses together position us very well to be able to address all of the needs and the opportunities in the future of the energy and commodities businesses. Yes. Thank you for that. And 2 months in, we are thrilled with the results. Our people are excited. They're motivated. One of the key indicators we look at is people changing their LinkedIn profile to say S&P Global, which is very high. We find that the people have been motivated by the vision, the purpose and the values of S&P Global as we've come together. And it's too early. It's just really 1 month in, 2 months in for us to give you any trends. But all of the informal indicators are very strong that we've been able to bring the team together that's very motivated and people want to ensure that we have a successful future. Thanks, Shlomo. Well, let me finish and thank everyone for joining the call. And I want to elaborate on the question that Shlomo just asked, which is about how things are going. We are thrilled that we were able to close this quarter and be able to have that merger come together after 15 months. All of the teams have come together so well as you've heard us discuss during this call, the ability to find opportunities from what we are hearing from our customers to bring our organization together at every single level, including our commercial teams that are out there looking for ways to sell and to innovate and bring new products to the market. In addition, we think that we are off to a great start on integration and the ability to bring the two teams together in a way that not only do we create value through cost synergies, but they were also positioning ourselves for growth for the future. The more we get to know about IHS Markit and S&P Global together, the more we know that we validated that this was the right thing to do, that the two companies together are stronger than either would have been alone. And finally, when it comes to what Shlomo just asked about our people, we are very excited to see the way that our people have come together with a strong executive committee that's developed a set of visions and purposes and values that across the company, we are all talking about, we are committed to. And we think that we are off to a fantastic start, and we appreciate all of the questions today and all the support from the analysts as well as our shareholders and very importantly, our people. So again, thank you very much for the call today."

Our results in 2023 serve as a testament to strong execution and S&P Global's unique position at the center of the global markets. Excluding Engineering Solutions which was divested in the second quarter of last year revenue increased 8% year-over-year. We expanded adjusted operating margins by almost 300 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter to finish the year with approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion and we surpassed our $600 million target for cost synergies by $19 million. We delivered adjusted EPS growth of 13% to come into the high end of our guidance range as we continue to benefit from strong revenue growth, disciplined expense management and a commitment to strong capital returns. On the topic of capital returns, 2023 marked the 50th consecutive year that S&P Global has increased its cash dividend and we've already announced the Board approval to make 2024 the 51st. In 2023 we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, representing more than 100% of our adjusted free cash flow. In addition to strong financial performance, we created a formal artificial intelligence leadership team in 2023, which we'll discuss in more detail shortly. We also delivered double-digit growth and significant innovation in key strategic investment areas. Private market solutions and sustainability and energy transition both delivered double-digit growth in 2023 and we're well positioned to continue growing in these important areas in 2024. Our Vitality Index which we target to remain at or above 10% of company revenue actually exceeded 11% in 2023 and also increased at a double-digit rate. In 2023, we delivered key wins in each of the five strategic pillars we introduced at the end of 2022. We look forward to accelerating that success in 2024 and continuing our track record of creating value for our customers and our shareholders. We know that our success depends on creating value for our customers and we delivered for them in 2023. We improved customer retention rates in several of our divisions last year while continuing to introduce new products and features more quickly and more frequently. Through deep engagement with customers around the world, tens of thousands of customer touch points, we saw continued adoption of enterprise contracts in Market Intelligence and acceleration of enterprise agreements in Commodity Insights. We know that certain customer verticals, particularly Financial Services and regional base had unique challenges in 2023. While we discussed longer sales cycles through 2023, we were able to keep our sales pipeline moving and continue to demonstrate value for our customers even in challenging times. As we look to 2024, we continue to see macroeconomic market and geopolitical challenges. Our customers need unique and differentiated data sets and key insights for the markets they serve, which means our role as a trusted and strategic partner is more important than ever. Now nearly two years after the merger, we've put the work of operational integration behind us. And we have fully turned to the exciting work of growth, innovation and execution. We remain committed to balancing margin expansion with strategic initiatives and long-term growth. We will also look for ways to optimize our portfolio of products and services. With the merger integration behind us, we plan to continue reviewing and optimizing our portfolio of assets to meet our customers' needs either through tuck-in acquisitions or potentially further divestitures as you've seen us do historically. Turning to the 2023 issuance environment. We saw strong growth in billed issuance in 2023, particularly in the second half. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see issuers returning to the market, with billed issuance growth driven primarily by strength in bank loans, structured finance and high yield. This contributed to a successful rebound for the full year 2023, with billed issuance increasing 8%. Turning to Vitality. We're pleased to see the continued outperformance in our index to close out 2023. As we shared with you when we introduced this metric a little over a year ago, our goal is to make sure at least 10% of our revenue comes from new or enhanced products each year. As products mature, they'll naturally age out of the Vitality Index, even if they continue to grow rapidly. But we remain committed to that 10% target, as a steady stream of innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. We view the Vitality Index as a direct measure of the value our customers are realizing from the improvements we're making in our products and services each year. With 18% growth in revenue from Vitality products in 2023, we ended the year with more than 11% of our total revenue coming from these new offerings. This is an incredible achievement by our product development and commercial teams, as they not only build great products and features in 2023, but also make sure our customers were aware and equipped to benefit from the innovation we are bringing to the table. Across divisions, we've seen new products in 2023 that demonstrate our commitment to powering global markets in a world of rapidly evolving technology. First, in another compelling example of our cross-divisional development between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we launched our Power Evaluator tool. It's already received great feedback from power utility market participants. Additionally, in Commodity Insights, we combined the most powerful features of two leading commodity platforms, Platts Dimensions Pro and IHS Connect to create Platts Connect, which we believe is the market's most holistic source of data insights and tools custom-built for commodity market participants. In Market Intelligence, we also significantly enhanced Capital IQ Pro. June saw the release of one of the largest and most important updates in years. And we're thrilled with the preliminary release of our new generative AI solution ChatIQ to a set of pilot customers in December. We're excited for more customers to get access to these proprietary tools as 2024 progresses. We also launched powerful new tools with our new supplier risk indicator and Entity Insights offerings. In Ratings, we continue to deliver assessments and insights to help market participants evaluate different assets. And we leveraged our expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to launch the first stablecoin stability assessment in late 2023. 2023 saw the launch of several new indices as well, including the S&P B3 corporate bond index in Brazil, multiple cross-asset indices and new sector, factor and thematic indices that we believe will contribute to strong growth in the years to come. As we mentioned last quarter, we want to provide an update on our AI strategy. We've elevated the focus on artificial intelligence to make sure we have executive leadership, governance and sponsorship at the enterprise level. In late 2023, we announced internally that our former Chief Information Officer, Swamy Kocherlakota would take on the new role as Chief Digital Solutions Officer, including executive sponsorship of AI and Kensho. Bhavesh Dayalji, CEO of Kensho has expanded his role to now lead cross-divisional AI initiatives as our first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer. These changes to our leadership structure around technology and especially around AI are the next logical steps in the commitment to AI that began with our initial investment in Kensho nearly seven years ago. As part of this strategy, we've developed an AI accelerator to fast-track high-priority AI initiatives and build common capabilities that can be deployed and used by teams across the enterprise. There are four important ways that we expect our AI to impact our performance. First, through the development of new products and services; second, leveraging Kensho to accelerate and automate manual processes and data operations; third, amplifying the productivity of our internal experts, freeing up more capacity for higher order work; and fourth, embedding AI functionality in existing products to increase customer value and improve user experience. We're committed to keeping you informed about these initiatives. So we've launched a new AI page on our public website, spglobal.ai, which includes important research, our key thought leadership and insights into our developments. At S&P Global, we have a strategic vision of the importance of AI to our industry and the world going forward as we believe that AI will quickly become embedded in everything we do. And we have a framework to deliver the best capabilities in as many products as we can and by extension into the hands of as many customers as we can as fast as we can. Fortunately S&P Global starts with some of the most powerful proprietary data sets in the world sourced from all five divisions. Our proprietary data layer is a key differentiator that we believe sets us apart. As we've outlined for you in the past we remain committed to sound governance, protecting this proprietary data and preventing third parties for monetizing or commercializing our data independently. A challenge that even data-rich companies will face is that much of this data isn't ready to be ingested or used by large language models. The data requires traditional machine learning preprocessing, things like data cleaning, data transformation, data reduction and data integration, but it also requires tokenization and tagging, which can be very resource-intensive. This is the Kensho layer. The proprietary tools developed over the last several years by the teams at Kensho automate much of the preprocessing work for both structured data like financial reports, but also unstructured data like the transcript from this very earnings call. Tools like Scribe, NERD, Link, Extract and Classify do much of this heavy lifting and allow our proprietary data to be leveraged more easily and update it more quickly and frequently. This leads to the third element of our framework; the open ecosystem. As we've shared with you before we aren't dependent on any individual technology partner. Having so much AI expertise in-house, means that we can leverage infrastructure and compute platforms from multiple hyperscale cloud providers, third-party LLMs, our own proprietary LLMs and a wide array of other vendors without having to lock ourselves in or cede economics to one ecosystem or another. Ultimately, the goal is to have generative and traditional AI capabilities embedded everywhere that makes sense. We'll track our progress through improving customer win rates, retention rates, price and ultimately growth. It should also show up in our own workflows to improve productivity and efficiency, improving our unit economics and our operating margins over time. We're excited about the significant progress we've made in 2023 and even more excited about what this company will accomplish in 2024 and beyond. Our innovation also extends to the efforts we make to develop our people and improve our communities. In 2023, we held an internal event called Accelerate Progress Live to reinforce our commitment to our teams around the world and highlight our purpose and values as a global employer of choice. We provide dedicated time for our people to pursue volunteer opportunities. We saw an 89% increase in the number of S&P Global people who took advantage of these programs in 2023. And as more of our people return to our offices around the world our global people resource groups saw a nearly 50% increase in engagement. We also demonstrated our commitment to continuously improve our reporting and transparency around our sustainability and related initiatives. In 2023, we published our 12th Annual Impact Report and our fifth Annual TCFD Report. We also published our first-ever Diversity Equity and Inclusion Report, taking much of the information that we've been reporting for years enhancing our disclosures, and making that information more accessible in a dedicated report. We're very pleased that our efforts have been recognized by many external organizations in the last year. S&P Global has iconic global brands and is well known as a desirable destination for highly skilled professionals around the world. We look forward to building upon that hard-won reputation in 2024. Turning to our financial results. Ewout will walk through the fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment, but the headline numbers tell a strong story for 2023. We're pleased to see accelerating growth and margin expansion in almost every division in 2023. The 2023 results and the 2024 guidance, we're introducing today give us confidence in our trajectory towards the growth and margin targets we introduced at our 2022 Investor Day. As we approach the two-year anniversary of the merger, we can definitively say it has been a success. In the last two years, not only have we brought together two world-class organizations but we've delivered through a challenging period against our aspirational and ambitious targets. We integrated major software systems in record time and consolidated our offices around the world. We're able to close many of our data centers due in part to a transformational partnership with AWS. We've maintained a disciplined approach to managing our product portfolio. And we demonstrated this commitment through the divestiture of Engineering Solutions and the aftersales business in our Mobility division and also through the decommissioning of a number of low-margin or slower-growth products. Lastly, since the merger closed we've returned $17.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We initially set a target of $480 million in cost synergies then raised that target to $600 million and have now exceeded that higher target by $19 million. We're ahead of schedule on our revenue synergies to date and we'll continue to report our progress there. Lastly, we told you when the merger closed that we believed it would be accretive to adjusted EPS by 2023 and I'm pleased to confirm that we have delivered. Both our internal analysis and independent external analysis indicate that in 2023 we delivered higher adjusted EPS than we likely would have generated with S&P Global as a standalone company. I'm thrilled to be able to call the merger a success and to move forward to powering global markets as one company. Now, I'll turn to Ewout to review the financial results. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. We closed the year with strong fourth quarter performance overall as we saw growth across all five of our divisions. Adjusted earnings per share increased 23% year-over-year. Reported revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter, but excluding the impact of the Engineering Solutions divestiture, and the small tuck-ins done earlier this year revenue growth was 11%. We also expanded adjusted margins by nearly 300 basis points and reduced our fully diluted share count by 3%. Moving to our strategic investment areas. I'm pleased to report, we saw growth across all categories. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 17% to $84 million in the quarter driven by strong demand for our energy transition products and benchmark offerings. Sustainability and energy transition's full year revenue grew 24% to approximately $301 million. As we introduce more products and continue to innovate in the space we remain committed to this important growth driver for the business. Moving to Private market solutions. We saw revenue increase by 18% year-over-year to $113 million driven by strong growth in Ratings private market revenue as improved market conditions increased bank loan issuance, private credit estimates and MI's software solutions. As we progress towards our goal of $600 million of private market solutions revenue by 2026, I'm pleased to report full year revenue grew 10% to $430 million for 2023. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization was $380 million in the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase compared to the prior year. Importantly, Vitality revenue represented 12% of our total revenue in the quarter again surpassing our index target of at least 10%. Now turning to synergies. As Doug mentioned earlier, we have completed our cost synergy program associated with the merger and outperformed our stated targets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized $156 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the year was $619 million exceeding our goal of $600 million. For the full year, we recognized $581 million in cost savings from synergies. We had been targeting 85% of total cost synergies realized in 2023 and I'm pleased to see that we not only achieved that target but that we surpassed it by more than $70 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well, with $40 million in synergies achieved in the fourth quarter and an annualized run rate of $152 million exiting the year. Now turning to expenses. Our total expenses grew approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by increases in our core and investment growth areas and compensation expenses, which were partially offset by benefits associated with the Engineering Solutions divestiture and cost synergies. On core and investment growth, we continue to make the necessary investments in our strategic initiatives, which includes hiring the right people for key roles and investing in new and existing avenues of growth for our businesses. Within compensation there are two factors I would like to call out. First, our salary expenses remained elevated due to hiring activity and inflationary pressures throughout 2023. Second, our benefit costs were higher due to finalization of benefits realignment of IHS Markit employees in the fourth quarter. As we go through the divisions you will see these factors impacting expenses and margins this quarter, particularly in Market Intelligence and Mobility. This drove slightly higher expense growth than we were expecting but total adjusted expenses still grew only 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter while revenue increased 7%. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 9%, driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop accelerated to 7% growth in the fourth quarter as continued product innovation, introduction of new content sets and improvements to speed and performance supported strong subscription growth. Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions grew 8% and 10% respectively. Both benefited from double-digit growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions grew 10% in the fourth quarter supported by strong new sales and price realization. While renewal rates remain strong overall for MI, we did see slightly elevated cancellations in the fourth quarter, as customers particularly in the financial services vertical continue to see some budgetary constraints. Combined with the modest softness in non-recurring revenue, this resulted in total revenue for MI slightly below our expectations though we continue to see accelerating growth for the division in the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 4% year-over-year, primarily due to higher compensation expense an increase in royalties and data costs, partially offset by cost synergies. Operating profit increased 18% and the operating margin increased 280 basis points to 34.2%. For full year 2023 margins improved by 120 basis points to 33%. The margin results are below our guidance range and are a result of a combination of an admittedly strong topline falling short of our expectations and expenses being slightly higher due to the reasons I mentioned. Now, turning to Ratings. In the fourth quarter we saw refinancing activity drive issuance as improving market conditions reduced borrowing costs and macroeconomic indicators gave issuers comfort coming to the market even in December, which is historically a very quiet month for debt issuance. Revenue increased 19% year-over-year exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high-yield issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 10% primarily due to an increase in annual and program fees and growth at CRISIL. Adjusted expenses increased 6% driven by higher compensation, which includes hiring associated with growth initiatives at CRISIL and higher incentives due to financial performance. This resulted in a 32% increase in operating profit and an impressive 540 basis point increase in operating margin to 53.4%. For the full year 2023 margins increased by 60 basis points to 56.5%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 10% following a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Upstream Data & Insights revenue grew by approximately 3% year-over-year benefiting from strong demand for software product offerings as well as significant improvement in retention rates. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 12% and 13% respectively. Growth was driven by continued strength in our benchmark data and insights products. Both business lines continue to see robust subscription sales driven by strong commercial momentum and enhanced value being delivered to customers. Advisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 8% driven by strong trading volumes across all sectors in Global Trading Services and strength in energy transition-related product offerings. These market-driven volumes helped GTS deliver its strongest quarter of 2023. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by higher compensation and continued investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost synergies. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 10% and operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 44.4%. There are a few factors I would like to call out that contributed to CI's very modest margin contraction in the fourth quarter. In addition to the compensation drivers I mentioned earlier, we saw an increase in performance-related compensation due to the topline outperformance. We remain very confident in the growth opportunities for Commodity Insights and also wanted to make sure we continue to adequately invest to capture those opportunities. Trailing 12-month margin, which we believe is the best way to assess the performance of our divisions increased by 180 basis points to 46.1% in 2023. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 9% year-over-year. The dealer segment marked its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while manufacturing and financials and other continued to deliver solid results. Dealer revenue increased 14% year-over-year driven by the continued benefit of price realization within the last year and new store growth particularly in CARFAX for Life as well as the addition of Market Scan. Manufacturing grew 2% year-over-year, driven by planning solutions and marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 5% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases. Adjusted expenses increased 10% driven primarily by higher compensation due to the benefits alignment already mentioned and also due in part to higher commissions related to revenue outperformance in our OEM and dealer businesses. We also incurred some inorganic expense growth on the Market Scan acquisition. In aggregate these drivers resulted in an 8% increase in adjusted operating profit and 30 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For full year 2023, margins contracted 20 basis points to 38.8%. Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 5% primarily due to strong growth in exchange-traded derivatives revenue and new business activities within Data & Custom Subscriptions. Revenue associated with asset-linked fees were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. This was driven by higher ETF AUM, which benefits from both market appreciation and net inflows leading to higher ETF fees and declines in OTC products. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 22% primarily driven by strong volumes in SPX and fixed products and strong price realization. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 4% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower outside services and incentive expenses. Operating profit in Indices increased 11% and the operating margin increased 390 basis points to 66.1%. For the full year 2023, margins expanded 50 basis points to 68.9%. As we reflect on 2023 as a whole, I'm incredibly proud about the many things we're able to accomplish. We returned more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders. We also continue to make the right investments in our strategy, allocating approximately $140 million to the enterprise initiatives that we have discussed with you. And we are encouraged by the fact that approximately 10% of the company's revenue growth came from those initiatives in 2023. On an inorganic basis, we executed a disciplined M&A strategy with tactical acquisitions immediately adding value to the enterprise. The optimization of our capital and liquidity structure completed earlier in the year provided $750 million of capital. Due to the prudent and strategic application of rate swaps we're able to execute that debt issuance in a rising rate environment, while avoiding an increase in our average cost of capital. With a team that can deliver impressive accomplishments like these in 2023, I'm confident this will continue under the leadership of the future CFO of S&P Global. Now, I'll turn it back to Doug to cover the 2024 outlook.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Ewout. We're updating our outlook to reflect our economists' view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024. While this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list, these are some of the key factors we'll be tracking this year. We're currently expecting a soft landing scenario with a base case assumption that we avoid a global recession. So we expect geopolitical uncertainty to persist. We also expect energy transition and higher interest rates to remain factors. For the equity markets, we expect the secular tailwind that flows from active to passive management to continue. Though changes to market volatility can impact our ETD business and Indices and fluctuations in asset prices will have a lagged, but potentially meaningful impact on our asset-linked fees revenue, early signs in 2024 indicate market optimism with the market currently pricing in multiple rate cuts in 2024. The timing of these potential cuts is unpredictable, but we expect the issuance environment to be stronger in the first half of the year than the back half. We expect continued focus on energy transition in the commodity markets with volatility in the evolving regulatory landscape having the potential to impact our results this year. Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 2.8%, US inflation of 2.4% at an average price for Brent crude of $83 per barrel. We're also forecasting billed issuance growth in the range of 3% to 7% in 2024, with stronger growth expected in the first half. While we've included a market issuance forecast in the past, we will only report on billed issuance going forward, when discussing our outlook for our financial performance, as it historically has been a better indicator of our revenue growth and aligns with our monthly disclosures. Turning to our most recent refinancing study. When we compare these refinancing walls to last year's study, we see that current year maturities, meaning 2024 maturities now compared to 2023 maturities measured at this time last year are more than 10% higher than they were at this point last year. The maturities expected over the next two and three-year periods are more than 12% higher. While we can't be certain how the higher rate environment will impact these maturities or issuers' likelihood to delever, we're confident that this puts us in a strong position to achieve the Ratings revenue targets we're outlining today for 2024. Now, turning to our initial guidance for 2024. This slide illustrates our initial guidance for GAAP results. For our adjusted guidance, we're expecting revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 7.5%, driven by strong growth in all five divisions. We expect organic revenue growth excluding the impact of 2023 divestitures in the range of 7% to 9%. We expect to deliver at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024. This will require us to maintain discipline around expenses and productivity, while ensuring that we are making the necessary investments to drive growth and innovation in vital strategic areas like generative AI, sustainability, energy transition and private markets. We expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.75 to $14, which represents double-digit growth at the midpoint. It's important to note that our expected adjusted tax rate is nearly two percentage points higher in 2024 than in 2023. If our tax rate were to remain unchanged from 2023, we would expect adjusted EPS growth approximately two to three percentage points higher, consistent with the low to mid-teens growth rate we pointed to for 2025, 2026 at our Investor Day. As you saw in our supplemental materials earlier this morning, we also expect adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items of approximately $4.4 billion. We expect growth in adjusted free cash flow to be driven primarily by strong growth in revenue and profitability though free cash flow growth will be tempered somewhat by the timing of working capital items and the full year impact of the $750 million debt offering completed in the third quarter of 2023. With the geopolitical, macroeconomic and market risk and opportunities, we've discussed on this call we expect that the financial outlook we've provided today likely has more upside risk than downside. And you can count on our focus determination and discipline over the coming year. Our outlook for 2024 calls for further acceleration in revenue growth compared to 2023, and continued margin expansion even though we will no longer have the benefit of the vast majority of our cost synergy actions going forward. Our financial outlook for 2024 illustrates our continued progress toward the targets we outlined at our Investor Day just over a year ago and we remain committed to those targets. Moving to our division outlook. For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7.5% with expected growth to be slightly higher in the back half than in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%, as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives while maintaining rigorous discipline around expenses. For Ratings, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% driven by billed issuance growth of 3% to 7%. We expect revenue growth rates to be stronger in the first half of the year than the second half as comparisons are easier in the first half. We expect some level of pull forward given the uncertainty around the timing of any potential rate actions by central banks. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. For Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9.5% and adjusted operating margins of 46.5% to 47.5%. For Mobility, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10% and adjusted operating margins of 39% to 40%. Lastly for S&P Dow Jones Indices we expect revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9% and adjusted operating margins in the range of 68.5% to 69.5%. As you saw in the press release earlier this morning, our Board has authorized the repurchase of shares totaling up to $2.4 billion, which we expect to execute throughout the year. And with that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1 to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\nMark Grant : Thank you Doug. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to start with a big picture question on Ratings take advantage of Martina on the call. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the drivers behind the Ratings top line outlook. Doug mentioned 3% to 7% billed issuance growth but give us a bit more color around transaction versus non-transaction growth and the various components whether it's corporate structured. You mentioned greater private assessment. So just a bit more color around what's underlying the revenue outlook. Thank you.\nMartina Cheung: Hi. Thanks very much for the question. So as Doug mentioned in his remarks, we do expect a stronger first half of this year, 2024 compared to the back half of the year. And I'll break it down a little bit. First on the transaction revenue and our billed issuance estimate in the 3% to 7%. We're expecting to see continued refinancing activity that we saw build up in the back half of last year with high yield and bank loans and we saw that consistent in January. So we would expect to see that continue throughout the first half of this year. We would also expect to see some investment grade, although not as robust as last year. And part of that is just because some of the investment-grade issuers tapped the market last year. Another potential factor there is the fact that we would see some investment-grade issuers being able to wait until the rates come down. Now some of the factors driving first half versus the second half, I would say anecdotally we're hearing that issuers are looking to come to market to take advantage of strong investor appetite to lock in rates once they're higher and before the rates come down and ahead of potential volatility in the back half of the year. On transaction revenue we would actually expect to see stronger frequent issuer program issuance this year than we saw last year. You won't see that in our billed issuance estimate for example. And we would also expect to see continued strong performance in our surveillance book across CRISIL, our royalty and other products such as RES or Ratings Evaluation Service. Overall, though as Doug said, we do expect stronger first half compared to second half. All of these factors that we take into consideration including pace and timing of rate cuts volatility, et cetera these are all baked into our overall outlook. It is early in the year and we will definitely seek to become more precise as we go throughout the year but that's I think a good summary of where we're at.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on the revenue synergies. You said I think it was $152 million annualized exiting the year. I think that's a number higher than what we would have thought of. I was just hoping you could give us some color on where – what kind of areas those are coming from what you've kind of baked into 2024 also perhaps?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Manav. This is Doug. Well we're really excited about what we've been able to achieve with the merger. And you've heard us talk about the power of the merger, the capital return that we had, the accretion to EPS, the cost synergies which we now have delivered $619 million. And going forward we're going to keep talking about the revenue synergies. When we look at the revenue synergies, they started off traditionally with cross-sell, cross-sell within divisions. This is where we were selling Commodity Insights products from the Platts customers to the IHS Markit customers and vice versa. Same in the Market Intelligence business where we're selling financial services products to corporate customers for Market Intelligence. But now we're starting to deliver the new products as well. And a combination of both of these has allowed us to be ahead of the schedule. We're very excited about the new products coming out. Let me give you one example from the Commodity Insights division something called Platts Connect. Platts Connect is a product that took the platform of Platts Dimensions Pro and took the IHS Markit Connect platform. We put them together. We now have a very unique single holistic platform for prices, for research, for forecasting. But let me hand it over to Adam, since he's on the call and he can give us some more color for Market Intelligence.\nAdam Kansler: Great. Thanks, Doug. The revenue synergy is obviously one of the most exciting parts of the combination of businesses. As Doug mentioned, the early successes have been in going to our customers, with combined product capabilities that strengthen what we were already providing to those customers. We've seen outsized performance there, even against our own expectations. What's really exciting as we get now into the years, where we've landed those early merger synergies is the launch of new products. Doug mentioned a few. Over the course of 2023, we launched seven new products just within Market Intelligence. We have 14 new products set to come to market across 2024. These will increasingly become part of what we're offering out to customers, whether it's just putting our bond pricing in together with our credit analytics capability looking at our economics and country risk data across our Desktop, incorporating sustainability data into our private markets portfolio management capabilities. These are all exciting areas that will continue to add to the growth of the business. You'll also see us announce some increasing generative AI capabilities across broader data sets of the combined businesses. I'm sure we'll talk a little bit more about that later on the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Greg on for Toni. Thanks for taking our question. Adam, just want to go back to you talk about Market Intelligence 6% to 7.5% revenue growth guide similar to last year. Is -- a selling environment has that improved at all? Or is that still a bit of a headwind? And then on the capital markets piece of the business I think some of the Ipreo assets seeing some increased activity to start the year. So is there upside from that? Or are you still a little bit cautious? Thanks.\nAdam Kansler: Okay. Thank you for the call. We're very optimistic about continued growth in the business. And you've seen that progression from 2022 to 2023 and you see our guidance for 2024. Our end markets have had a pretty challenged period through 2022 and 2023 right? You've seen 30-plus percent declines in M&A activity 34% decline in private equity investment activity. But even through that period we've been able to deliver the solutions that our customers want. I think that will continue into 2024. We do see some early activity in capital markets, but I think the way the full year will play out is yet to be seen. For us going into the first quarter, we see more challenging comps. So we'll see a little bit slower start to year than we'll see towards the back half of the year. I am cautiously optimistic that as markets stabilize that presents opportunity for us. But we want to be careful, because our largest customer sets continue to be under pressure. You see that in the news every day. As we go into the beginning part of this year, we want to see how that ultimately plays out, but we feel pretty good about the guidance range we've put out.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. Great.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Tom on for Andrew. I wanted to ask about ChatIQ. You mentioned you started piloting that in December. I was wondering what kind of customer feedback you're getting so far? And what kind of benefits you can expect? Can it help increase pricing on the Cap IQ platform or some other benefits you're seeing there? Thank you.\nAdam Kansler: Tom, thanks for the question. We're very excited about the early responses on ChatIQ. That's a tool that lets our customers get into our Desktop and get back actionable insights lets them actually click through directly down to the source documents on what's one of the most robust data sets available to financial markets and corporate participants in the world. ChatIQ, very exciting. We are out with a few pilot customers. We'll start to release that out more broadly to our customer set over the course of 2024. But it's also not the only thing that we're doing with generative AI. You may have seen a press release in the last couple of days. We've actually launched now widely available to customers the ability to use generative AI to search in the S&P Global Marketplace, which is the place where you can go and look at all the data sets available across all of S&P Global. We're using generative AI to allow people to query into those data sets to get broader understanding of what's actually available through our company. We're pretty excited about that and early responses have been positive. You'll also see releases from us during the year things we're calling RegGPT, some other tools around our ratings related data that we deliver through Market Intelligence to allow our customers to probe into that data and get quick responses that help increase the speed within their own workflows. You'll continue to see this across the course of 2024. We're very focused on making sure we release things that are actually useful to our customers enhance the value proposition of what we're delivering to them and ultimately embed our solutions more deeply into their workflows.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlex Hess: This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I was hoping you guys could walk us through a little bit of the incremental margin outlook embedded in your guide, especially for Market Intelligence Commodity Insights, and maybe Mobility, just helpful to know sort of in those higher subscription businesses what the puts and takes are on expenses and how we should see that flowing through to operating income? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks Alex. This is Doug. Let me start by saying that we always start our year with looking at how we're going to be able to grow our margins. We always build a budget that begins with top line growth. And we want to make sure that we can build our business through investment for innovation, but also continue to deliver margin expansion. So if you asked about each of the divisions and each of the divisions has different characteristics for how we're moving forward. We have technology and productivity plans in place. But let me start with a couple of the divisions and then hand it over to Adam. So within the Commodity Insights division, we're looking at as you saw 8.8% growth to 9.5% growth with a margin expansion in the 46.5 to 47.5 range. We have growth in that area in particular in energy transition products. We see high demand coming for new products that relate to carbon to carbon intensity to carbon markets to different types of metals, which are going to be important for the energy transition. So we see a lot of growth in the area coming from energy transition on top of what are the regular markets there. We do have some investments taking place in the Commodity Insights division both for some regional expansion, as well as some new products. When it comes to Mobility, we're making some investments in some new products in Mobility, so that we will be able to grow our top line. As you see we have an 8.5% to 10% revenue guide as a 39% to 40% margin guide. But we always operate all of our businesses beginning with top line with discipline to deliver growth. Just to mention before I hand it over to Adam as you know we've delivered 1,200 basis points of margin expansion over the last 10 years. So it's something that's in our DNA. But let me hand it over to Adam.\nAdam Kansler: Sure. Just commenting briefly on margins within Market Intelligence. We do expect to continue to see expansion as we go into 2024. It's important for us to keep balancing the need for continued efficiency, looking for where we can operate more effectively and continue to drive margin expansion. We expect to do that on course to the levels that we laid out in the 2022 Investor Day, but also balancing that with making the right investments to drive the increased top line growth that we also expect to deliver as we get towards those target dates that we laid out in the Investor Day as well.\nMark Grant: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may proceed.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hey good morning everyone. Just I guess continuing that last point, Adam that you made. When I look at the revenue targets that you laid out at the Investor Day across the company, I think you're making good progress everywhere. But in Market Intelligence, I think it appears that if it's a steady path with the most behind. So, maybe just coming back to the comments you made earlier in terms of the environment, is it the environment that needs to improve? Is it the revenue synergies that need to click more? Or what needs to happen to get to that seven to nine in 2025. Yes and what are the biggest factors that get you there? Thanks. And what's your confidence level, sorry.\nAdam Kansler: Thanks, Alex. Confidence level, high. We set those targets for 2025, 2026. I think we're well on track to get there. Even in this current year, while coming in behind our goal, we're still right near the very bottom of that 7% to 9% growth range, right? We delivered a 6.9-or-so percent year. You've seen in our guidance like we'll continue to push towards that. You identified actually a couple of the important factors. That synergy growth will continue to build. And we always said, we start to see the real impact of that in years three through five and that's the period that we're just starting to enter. So, you will see that continue to be a factor. The second biggest factor is, we've gone through in 2022 and 2023, one of the toughest macro environments that we've seen, particularly for our customers over the last certainly five to 10 years. So, as that macro environment improves, conditions for that customer that improves for us. It also sets us up to continue to accelerate towards those growth levels. Even through that challenging period, as I mentioned, we're delivering actually pretty close to that range and on a pretty straight line path into it and pretty high confidence that we'll get there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus or drill down further on the Index business. There was a mention of declines in OTC products. I was wondering, if you could provide some color on that front. And then as we get into 2024, I was wondering if you could provide some color on what are your assumptions around AUM growth. And then fees which were a headwind this year, how should we think about those potentially becoming a tailwind in '24? Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Ashish, this is Ewout. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to answer a question during my last call. Coming back to your point about OTC, obviously, if you look at AUM fees in the fourth quarter, you say, hey that's strange, why is it flat where markets are up so much? And we see two underlying dynamics that go in opposite direction. So, as we have always said in AUM fees, there's many things that go there into the mix. There is mutual funds there's OTCs and others. Actually if we zoom in on ETFs, it's up about 8% in terms of fees. And that is helped by market depreciation as well as very strong inflows that we have seen into the ETF area but offset by OTC volumes that were down period-over-period. OTC volumes can always be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. So, I wouldn't read too much into it. This can really change again the following quarter. So, overall, I would say this is a normal trend that we are seeing here. With respect to the assumption for 2024, first of all, the assumption is that AUM is up at mid-single-digit level. The ETD volumes low single-digit increase, and then the subscription growth at a double-digit level for the Index business for 2024. Those are the assumptions. Thank you, Ashish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Thank you. Good morning guys. Just moving back to the Ratings segment and I'm thinking about the results and guidance. You're sort of looking at that Slide 32 and seeing the decline in expected maturities for 2024. I was just wondering if you guys saw any pull-forward activity into the fourth quarter given the decline in rates and tightening spreads that we saw and how that may have informed your outlook for 2024 here? Thanks.\nMartina Cheung: Hey Scott thanks for the question. We did see some pull forward more for 2024, a little bit of 2025 into 2023 not just in Q4 I would say. I mean I think the sort of the repricing and other refinancing activity starting to pick up momentum in the back half overall and we've certainly seen that continue into this year. But I would maybe take a step back and perhaps sort of characterize how we build our outlook for the year. So, absolutely refinancing is very important. And as Doug mentioned in his remarks, the refinancing wall continues to grow nicely which is a very healthy indicator for us. But we also look at a number of other factors, including the overall macro picture whether it's GDP growth pace and timing of interest rate cuts. We also look at opportunistic issuance. We know that's been historically very hard to predict and that's become even more difficult in the last two years. And candidly M&A, we don't have historic or heroic assumptions around M&A. As Adam mentioned earlier, it was down quite a bit. last year. And while we're hearing a little bit of positive market sentiment, we need to see how that plays out throughout the course of the year. We also look at investor appetite fund flows and how that could impact issuance across different asset classes. So, for example as I mentioned earlier, we would expect to see higher frequent issuer issuance this year than we did last year. And then we keep an eye on this throughout the course of the year, a lot of contacts with investors. I think we did -- we increased our investor meeting frequency quite a bit last year so we're between the 25,000 30,000 range of meetings with investors. So, a lot of work goes into building up the bond up. It's not just the refinancing piece of it, although of course, that's a good long-term indicator for us. And then just to kind of recap or draw a line under it. As Doug said, we would expect slightly faster first half than second half. And as we go throughout the year, we can come back to you with greater precision.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nJeff Silber : Thanks so much. In your prepared remarks, I think you had said you're constantly reviewing and optimizing your portfolio. Can we just kind of step back maybe you can tell us what you're looking for whether it's in tuck-in acquisitions or maybe more importantly potential divestitures? Would it be possible to see a large divestiture in the future? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson : Thank you Jeff. As you know we always apply a discipline to looking at our portfolio, looking at top line growth, looking at the margin expansion, also looking at how it fits across the portfolio. During the year last year, we didn't make a lot of noise about it but we did shut down some very small products. We shut down 8,000 indices that were subpar subside across the businesses within Commodity Insights Market Intelligence or some small products that we moved on. We also had a couple of small divestitures. But when you ask the question to us, we're constantly looking at the portfolio trying to understand what fits best. We have different themes. You've heard us talk about the key themes private market, sustainability, supply chain, analytics, risk and credit. These are the sorts of areas that we're always looking to expand our presence to make sure we have the best capabilities possible to meet the needs of our clients. But within looking at the needs of clients we look at the shareholders. We look at how we're going to put this portfolio together with the best way to leverage our technology. We will always apply the discipline as well to how we're going to look at the portfolio in the future.\nJeff Silber : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to better understand your guidance for Ratings revenue growth in 2024. Do you expect billed debt issuance growth of 3% to 7%, but Ratings revenue growth of only 6% to 8% in 2024, which would reflect little to no pricing benefit or mix headwinds. Can you help bridge the gap there?\nMartina Cheung : Hi, George. Thanks for the question. So, maybe I could start with transaction versus nontransaction and how we think about both of those. And as you know transaction is a somewhat lower proportion of our revenues compared to let's say pre-pandemic. On the transaction front and specific to billed issuance, as I said, in my last response, we look at a variety of factors. Refinancing is a critical one. I covered that in my last response, as well as the key macro drivers when rate cuts could start for example what the exit rate on those looks like this year the potential challenge in predicting opportunistic issuance. And there we really do not have heroic assumptions around opportunistic issuance for this year. So we're being cautious on that. And then I would say as, I mentioned as well that we would expect to see more frequent issuer issuance this year, which wouldn't show up in our billed issuance estimate of 3% to 7%. So I think with all of that you have to take into consideration the potential wide range of outcomes, whether it's rates, whether it's almost half the world's population voting and elections and potential for greater volatility in the back half of the year. So that informs both the overall outlook of 3% to 7% billed issuance, but also the timing that Doug has mentioned, which is a stronger first half versus second half. On the transaction side, we see strong performance across all key areas there. So that would include our surveillance book. It would include the res portions of the book for example CRISIL, as well as the royalty payment that we get from Market Intelligence. So maybe again I would just reiterate strong first half and tapering off in the back half. And then as Doug mentioned, it is early in the year. There is potential for upside in the range and we would look to get more precise on this as we go throughout the year.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. You may proceed.\nCraig Huber: Yes, hi. Good morning. Maybe just talk a little bit further about your guidance for the year about where potentially you could be conservative in your mind whether it be on the cost side of things? Or are you baking in too much assumption for cost there or on the top line? What segments potentially coming ahead of your outlook at this stage of the game? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Craig. As you saw when we put together our information, we put in our slides what are the key factors that we look at. And when you take a step back, we know that GDP growth is always the number one driver. It's the highest correlated factor to our long-term revenue growth. We've looked over the years to see what are those factors that drive it the most. We see some potential slowdown in the economy in the US and EU. We're planning for what we call we're planning against what we call a soft landing which means that there could be some sort of slowdown in the economy. As you heard we've seen some slowness and a little bit of longer sales cycles in certain segments. But that's – those are some of the downside factors. What would happen with the geopolitical factors, how long will it take before central banks begin to cut rates, we've taken those into account as we built our guidance with some conservatism. So if we saw a much quicker return to lower interest rates, if we saw much quicker a geopolitical environment that was more stable, these are the kinds of things that create some upside for the company. We also look at segment by segment. We know that the automotive segment is going through a lot of change. We know that the energy transition which is changing the commodity cycle. So we've taken into account all of these different factors as we've looked at the – overall at the guidance. So to your upside risk – upside opportunities we think that it could come if interest rates move down lower faster, if the interest rates if the economies grow faster than we think, et cetera. But these are all the factors we take into account across the divisions, as we're setting up our guidance for 2024. Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJohn Mazzoni: Thank you, good morning. Could you just help us understand how you're thinking about the longer-term generative AI monetization specifically around cross-platforming as well as potential kind of upsell and cross-sell from kind of new products?\nDoug Peterson: Great. Thank you for that. And when we think about technology when we think about AI we start with the framework that we showed you in our prepared remarks today which has the foundation of very strong proprietary data. We think that this is going to be one of the most important factors for AI becoming successful at any company no matter where they are. And we think that this gives us a running start in addition to what we've already been developing with Kensho over the last five years. But turning that into earnings and turning that into growth is something that we're starting to build. We think that the AI opportunities we have, Adam talked earlier about ChatIQ is an example of something that gives customers the opportunity to dig much, much deeper into our data. We think that it's going to create stickiness. We're starting with metrics that look at for example, our Net Promoter Scores. We're looking at retention. We're looking at how people -- how -- what kind of feedback we get from calls from customers that are calling in to see how we're doing. We also believe that right now we're going to be able to continue to meet our guidance that we gave you for our -- in our Investor Day in 2022. We'll be able to continue along that track. And then we'll be able to come out with much more precise guidance for the impact of AI across our portfolio in the future. But we see this as something that's going to be a game changer for all of our businesses. It's going to be embedded in everything we do. And we're just now learning how we're going to measure those impacts. But let me hand it over to Adam because he's very close to a couple of the end market opportunities that we have right now.\nAdam Kansler: Great. Thanks Doug and thank you for the question. As Doug mentioned, we do think generative AI has a transformative potential across almost all of our products. Remember we are one of the largest data providers in the world. And the one thing we have is a highly trusted, highly developed accurate set of data across our businesses whether that's in Market Intelligence or the other divisions of our business. We're also deeply embedded in the workflows of our customers. The combination of those two and when you really understand the power behind generative AI to unlock the potential in massive data sets that may correlate to each other, may have unique insights and the ability to process through that in a very rapid time frame. For us thinking about portfolio monitoring workflows, research and insights, credit assessments, risk assessment, looking across broad sets of data for insights and what's developing in various sectors or regions or how it could impact the portfolio. Those are all opportunities for us for making the data sets and workflows that we already provide today to our customers all the more powerful. When we look at the opportunity set in front of us and even just our product launch sheet for 2024, we're pretty encouraged that we're well-positioned to take advantage of the technology, increase the penetration we have with our customers and expand the kinds of services and insights we're able to give them efficiently. That also increases the efficiency of their own internal workflows, which obviously comes with significant value. We'll see how that all materializes and how we're able to monetize that. But we do think it's a tailwind for us.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Ewout when you described some of the costs that were higher than expected things like the heritage IHS Markit employee benefit cost, it wasn't clear to me was there a true-up that was specific to Q4? Or was there a greater than expected step up in the expense baseline that's happening now? And then on 2024 tax rate, what drives the step up? And is the new rate like a good steady state rate for the portfolio? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yeah. Thanks Jeff. So let me explain what is benefits realignment. So benefits realignment is that we brought as of January 1, 2023, all of our employees across the world to the same benefits package, because we think it is fair that we should treat everyone the same in every country around the world. So think about the medical plans, think about the retirement plans. We have made estimates about the expenses for 2023. And for the first three quarters, the expenses came in exactly in line with our expectations, but they exceeded the expectations in the fourth quarter. And benefits costs are always not 100% certain because just to give an example, the medical costs in the US were self-insured. So they can be higher if we have higher medical claims or the matching for 401(k) contributions can be higher. So we're seeing this more as a onetime step-up cost and that should be in our baseline going forward from 2024 onwards. Your second part of your question about the tax rate, we saw in 2023 a bit of a benefit in the tax rate in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And then we are seeing some upward pressure in the tax rate in 2024. So to expand on that on the third quarter of 2023, we had some favorable new guidance with respect to the utilization of foreign tax credits. And then in the fourth quarter, we had the conclusion of certain state tax audits that led to some reserve releases. So it brought the effective tax rate a little bit down in 2023 compared to a normalized level. And what we're seeing in 2024 the implementation of Pillar 2 global minimum tax in several jurisdictions as well as the UK statutory tax rate is going up. So 2024 is I think the right level to think about this. Where tax rate will go from a longer-term perspective is really hard to say because it really depends on government finances and where that will go around the world in the future. Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. You may proceed.\nRussell Quelch: Yeah. Thanks for having me on the call. Sorry to go back to this but on the Ratings business and your macro forecast are implying I think is the soft landing conducive for rate cuts. And as I understand that the maturity walls built throughout the year, I appreciate some of that could be pulled forward into the front end. But I'm still struggling to square this sort of front-end loaded observation when you discuss revenues relative to your macro guidance. So maybe you could explain that again, please? And also, what you're assuming for the non-transaction revenue growth in 2024. Sorry if I missed that. Thanks.\nMartina Cheung: Thanks much Russell for the question. Just a quick one on the non-transaction. We don't separate out our guidance between transaction and non-transaction. But as I said, we do expect robust performance in our non-transaction part of the book this year. The picture is a little counterintuitive in fact for the timing piece because you would in fact expect given our kind of predictions of three rate cuts for example by the Feds starting in the middle of the year, this year that you might see a more even result with issuance throughout the year. What we're actually hearing from the market is a little bit different. So for bank loans and high yield for example, we're seeing and hearing a couple of things. Number one issuers have accepted the higher for longer. But more importantly number two there's a good really good strong investor appetite for these asset classes. And pricing is much more constructive this year for example than it was same time last year. So these issuers are coming to market. There's a high volume of repricing into that. So for example the bank loan January volumes for re-pricing was actually around if not a little bit higher than the full year 2023 repricing that we saw in bank loans. And then on investment grade some of that -- we see that tapered a little bit this year compared to last year. The reason for that is that there were so many issuers that came to market last year but also those that are sitting waiting for rate cuts can afford to actually absorb what they're sitting on today whether it's using commercial paper or otherwise to wait for some of those rate cuts to play out. Hopefully, that answers your question. As I said, it's early. We're in the first half of February and this is our base case. There's a pretty wide range of possibilities here and we'll look to get much more precise as we go throughout the year.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Russell.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.\nAdam Parrington: Hi. This is Adam on for Shlomo. Can you discuss the level of incentive compensation in the quarter and what is implied in 2024 versus 2023? And how much does this impact the margin guidance for 2024 as well? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes we brought up incentive compensation accruals in the fourth quarter. And that was driven by the strong top line performance from both the Ratings and Commodity Insights. So, for the total year 2023, our cash bonus incentive accruals are now ending up at a level above 100%. What we always do, when we do planning is to reset cash bonus incentives back to 100% from a planning perspective for the next year. So, for 2024, in the plan is embedded a 100% payout of our cash bonuses.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Heather Balsky. You talked about elevated cancellations in Market Intelligence. Could you give us some details on what type and maybe size of customers you're seeing cancel? And what kind of discussions you've had so far this year?\nAdam Kansler: Hi Heather, it's Adam. Thank you for the question. So through the fourth quarter in particular, the places where we saw cancellations were actually in our smallest customers, right, customers under relatively low threshold. Our larger customers while under pressure due to a range of macro reasons, those are places where we have opportunity in a vendor consolidation initiative, where those customers are looking to consolidate the number of vendors they work with given the scale and scope of relationship that they have with S&P Global that often presents opportunity for us. And accordingly, we saw much stronger renewal rates in that group of customers than we did amongst our smallest customers. I think the other places where we see pressure is discretionary spend, where customers have a decision, whether to undertake a consulting project or a new initiative. Those are places where customers have been a little bit more hesitant into the fourth quarter. And we're hopeful that will continue to stabilize as we get into 2024.\nMark Grant: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our final question from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nOwen Lau: Hey, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. I just want to go back to AI. And I think AI it's great and there are lots of potential, but it looks like whether clients will actually pay extra for it, it's still uncertain. I'm just wondering, what makes you confident that you can develop a killer app that people will use it and pay for it. Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Owen. Well, we take a view that AI is going to be embedded in everything we do. And we don't think there's going to be a killer app. It would be great if there were. That's not our plan. Our plan is to look at AI to see how it can improve our productivity, how we can use it with our developers, our data management, data linking, et cetera, up into how we're going to improve our products and build products and link them over time. As you heard from Adam, we've got a few very exciting products that are already being tested in the market. We've launched one recently and then we've got some more coming. We also have the capabilities of Kensho which are available on the Marketplace. So we don't think of it as a killer app. We think of it as continuous improvement. And we think that if you look at it over time, it's going to be something that's going to change the way we work and the way that our people work. So, we're really excited about it. We're also excited that we have such a strong internal team that we're one of the first companies who was able to name a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer, somebody who has the experience of Kensho of being the CEO there with the expertise. We have an open model in terms of the ecosystem we're going to be working with. So we're not looking for a killer application, but we're looking to see every single way we can use it and how it's going to improve the way we serve our customers as well to manage the business. So thank you Owen. Let me make a couple of closing remarks. And first of all, I want to thank all of you as usual for being on the call and for your excellent questions. And it was great to have Adam and Martina on the call today. And I'm really excited about everything that we're able to deliver in 2023. We delivered what we think is the promise of the merger. As you know we've paid back over $17.5 billion of capital over the last two years since the merger. We've been delivering innovation. We delivered on our synergies. So we're excited about taking that energy and all of the incredible work that our people have done, and turning that now into growth into the future. I also want to thank our people as always for their incredible work. It's what made 2023 what it is and it's what makes me very confident about the foundation we have for going forward, and especially our leadership team who is focused on growth innovation and execution. This is our last earnings call with Ewout. He's been with us for seven years of remarkable service and I want to thank him. He's helped shape our financial strategy. I know that everybody is very pleased with our margin, and as well as our capital return and that's something that Ewout's been instrumental in. He's helped us lead with our accelerated growth with our innovation and he's had a tremendous impact. He partnered with us on all of the major strategic transactions. He's been the sponsor of Kensho for the last five years, which we now talked about many times on this call the importance that brings to the company as well as one of the initial architects as well as executors of the IHS Markit merger. So he's done a fantastic job building a world-class finance organization. As we previously announced our current Chief Accounting Officer, Chris Craig will be named as the interim CFO on Monday. And he has done a fantastic job here for the last 13 years. And he's going to continue to evaluate the businesses. And as we look both internally and externally for candidates for the permanent role, and I look forward to working with Chris in his role. But again thank you Ewout. We wish you the best in your new role and continued success in your career. And please keep making the world a better place with your leadership with UNICEF. So, again, thank you everyone for joining the call. Great questions and we're very excited about the future. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&P Global's website for one year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month. On behalf of S&P Global, we thank you for participating and wish you a good day.",

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Doug. The revenue synergy is obviously one of the most exciting parts of the combination of businesses. As Doug mentioned, the early successes have been in going to our customers, with combined product capabilities that strengthen what we were already providing to those customers. We've seen outsized performance there, even against our own expectations. What's really exciting as we get now into the years, where we've landed those early merger synergies is the launch of new products. Doug mentioned a few. Over the course of 2023, we launched seven new products just within Market Intelligence. We have 14 new products set to come to market across 2024. These will increasingly become part of what we're offering out to customers, whether it's just putting our bond pricing in together with our credit analytics capability looking at our economics and country risk data across our Desktop, incorporating sustainability data into our private markets portfolio management capabilities. These are all exciting areas that will continue to add to the growth of the business. You'll also see us announce some increasing generative AI capabilities across broader data sets of the combined businesses. I'm sure we'll talk a little bit more about that later on the call. Okay. Thank you for the call. We're very optimistic about continued growth in the business. And you've seen that progression from 2022 to 2023 and you see our guidance for 2024. Our end markets have had a pretty challenged period through 2022 and 2023 right? You've seen 30-plus percent declines in M&A activity 34% decline in private equity investment activity. But even through that period we've been able to deliver the solutions that our customers want. I think that will continue into 2024. We do see some early activity in capital markets, but I think the way the full year will play out is yet to be seen. For us going into the first quarter, we see more challenging comps. So we'll see a little bit slower start to year than we'll see towards the back half of the year. I am cautiously optimistic that as markets stabilize that presents opportunity for us. But we want to be careful, because our largest customer sets continue to be under pressure. You see that in the news every day. As we go into the beginning part of this year, we want to see how that ultimately plays out, but we feel pretty good about the guidance range we've put out. Tom, thanks for the question. We're very excited about the early responses on ChatIQ. That's a tool that lets our customers get into our Desktop and get back actionable insights lets them actually click through directly down to the source documents on what's one of the most robust data sets available to financial markets and corporate participants in the world. ChatIQ, very exciting. We are out with a few pilot customers. We'll start to release that out more broadly to our customer set over the course of 2024. But it's also not the only thing that we're doing with generative AI. You may have seen a press release in the last couple of days. We've actually launched now widely available to customers the ability to use generative AI to search in the S&P Global Marketplace, which is the place where you can go and look at all the data sets available across all of S&P Global. We're using generative AI to allow people to query into those data sets to get broader understanding of what's actually available through our company. We're pretty excited about that and early responses have been positive. You'll also see releases from us during the year things we're calling RegGPT, some other tools around our ratings related data that we deliver through Market Intelligence to allow our customers to probe into that data and get quick responses that help increase the speed within their own workflows. You'll continue to see this across the course of 2024. We're very focused on making sure we release things that are actually useful to our customers enhance the value proposition of what we're delivering to them and ultimately embed our solutions more deeply into their workflows. Sure. Just commenting briefly on margins within Market Intelligence. We do expect to continue to see expansion as we go into 2024. It's important for us to keep balancing the need for continued efficiency, looking for where we can operate more effectively and continue to drive margin expansion. We expect to do that on course to the levels that we laid out in the 2022 Investor Day, but also balancing that with making the right investments to drive the increased top line growth that we also expect to deliver as we get towards those target dates that we laid out in the Investor Day as well. Thanks, Alex. Confidence level, high. We set those targets for 2025, 2026. I think we're well on track to get there. Even in this current year, while coming in behind our goal, we're still right near the very bottom of that 7% to 9% growth range, right? We delivered a 6.9-or-so percent year. You've seen in our guidance like we'll continue to push towards that. You identified actually a couple of the important factors. That synergy growth will continue to build. And we always said, we start to see the real impact of that in years three through five and that's the period that we're just starting to enter. So, you will see that continue to be a factor. The second biggest factor is, we've gone through in 2022 and 2023, one of the toughest macro environments that we've seen, particularly for our customers over the last certainly five to 10 years. So, as that macro environment improves, conditions for that customer that improves for us. It also sets us up to continue to accelerate towards those growth levels. Even through that challenging period, as I mentioned, we're delivering actually pretty close to that range and on a pretty straight line path into it and pretty high confidence that we'll get there. Great. Thanks Doug and thank you for the question. As Doug mentioned, we do think generative AI has a transformative potential across almost all of our products. Remember we are one of the largest data providers in the world. And the one thing we have is a highly trusted, highly developed accurate set of data across our businesses whether that's in Market Intelligence or the other divisions of our business. We're also deeply embedded in the workflows of our customers. The combination of those two and when you really understand the power behind generative AI to unlock the potential in massive data sets that may correlate to each other, may have unique insights and the ability to process through that in a very rapid time frame. For us thinking about portfolio monitoring workflows, research and insights, credit assessments, risk assessment, looking across broad sets of data for insights and what's developing in various sectors or regions or how it could impact the portfolio. Those are all opportunities for us for making the data sets and workflows that we already provide today to our customers all the more powerful. When we look at the opportunity set in front of us and even just our product launch sheet for 2024, we're pretty encouraged that we're well-positioned to take advantage of the technology, increase the penetration we have with our customers and expand the kinds of services and insights we're able to give them efficiently. That also increases the efficiency of their own internal workflows, which obviously comes with significant value. We'll see how that all materializes and how we're able to monetize that. But we do think it's a tailwind for us. Hi Heather, it's Adam. Thank you for the question. So through the fourth quarter in particular, the places where we saw cancellations were actually in our smallest customers, right, customers under relatively low threshold. Our larger customers while under pressure due to a range of macro reasons, those are places where we have opportunity in a vendor consolidation initiative, where those customers are looking to consolidate the number of vendors they work with given the scale and scope of relationship that they have with S&P Global that often presents opportunity for us. And accordingly, we saw much stronger renewal rates in that group of customers than we did amongst our smallest customers. I think the other places where we see pressure is discretionary spend, where customers have a decision, whether to undertake a consulting project or a new initiative. Those are places where customers have been a little bit more hesitant into the fourth quarter. And we're hopeful that will continue to stabilize as we get into 2024."

            "name": "Martina Cheung",
            "content": "Hi. Thanks very much for the question. So as Doug mentioned in his remarks, we do expect a stronger first half of this year, 2024 compared to the back half of the year. And I'll break it down a little bit. First on the transaction revenue and our billed issuance estimate in the 3% to 7%. We're expecting to see continued refinancing activity that we saw build up in the back half of last year with high yield and bank loans and we saw that consistent in January. So we would expect to see that continue throughout the first half of this year. We would also expect to see some investment grade, although not as robust as last year. And part of that is just because some of the investment-grade issuers tapped the market last year. Another potential factor there is the fact that we would see some investment-grade issuers being able to wait until the rates come down. Now some of the factors driving first half versus the second half, I would say anecdotally we're hearing that issuers are looking to come to market to take advantage of strong investor appetite to lock in rates once they're higher and before the rates come down and ahead of potential volatility in the back half of the year. On transaction revenue we would actually expect to see stronger frequent issuer program issuance this year than we saw last year. You won't see that in our billed issuance estimate for example. And we would also expect to see continued strong performance in our surveillance book across CRISIL, our royalty and other products such as RES or Ratings Evaluation Service. Overall, though as Doug said, we do expect stronger first half compared to second half. All of these factors that we take into consideration including pace and timing of rate cuts volatility, et cetera these are all baked into our overall outlook. It is early in the year and we will definitely seek to become more precise as we go throughout the year but that's I think a good summary of where we're at. Hey Scott thanks for the question. We did see some pull forward more for 2024, a little bit of 2025 into 2023 not just in Q4 I would say. I mean I think the sort of the repricing and other refinancing activity starting to pick up momentum in the back half overall and we've certainly seen that continue into this year. But I would maybe take a step back and perhaps sort of characterize how we build our outlook for the year. So, absolutely refinancing is very important. And as Doug mentioned in his remarks, the refinancing wall continues to grow nicely which is a very healthy indicator for us. But we also look at a number of other factors, including the overall macro picture whether it's GDP growth pace and timing of interest rate cuts. We also look at opportunistic issuance. We know that's been historically very hard to predict and that's become even more difficult in the last two years. And candidly M&A, we don't have historic or heroic assumptions around M&A. As Adam mentioned earlier, it was down quite a bit. last year. And while we're hearing a little bit of positive market sentiment, we need to see how that plays out throughout the course of the year. We also look at investor appetite fund flows and how that could impact issuance across different asset classes. So, for example as I mentioned earlier, we would expect to see higher frequent issuer issuance this year than we did last year. And then we keep an eye on this throughout the course of the year, a lot of contacts with investors. I think we did -- we increased our investor meeting frequency quite a bit last year so we're between the 25,000 30,000 range of meetings with investors. So, a lot of work goes into building up the bond up. It's not just the refinancing piece of it, although of course, that's a good long-term indicator for us. And then just to kind of recap or draw a line under it. As Doug said, we would expect slightly faster first half than second half. And as we go throughout the year, we can come back to you with greater precision. Hi, George. Thanks for the question. So, maybe I could start with transaction versus nontransaction and how we think about both of those. And as you know transaction is a somewhat lower proportion of our revenues compared to let's say pre-pandemic. On the transaction front and specific to billed issuance, as I said, in my last response, we look at a variety of factors. Refinancing is a critical one. I covered that in my last response, as well as the key macro drivers when rate cuts could start for example what the exit rate on those looks like this year the potential challenge in predicting opportunistic issuance. And there we really do not have heroic assumptions around opportunistic issuance for this year. So we're being cautious on that. And then I would say as, I mentioned as well that we would expect to see more frequent issuer issuance this year, which wouldn't show up in our billed issuance estimate of 3% to 7%. So I think with all of that you have to take into consideration the potential wide range of outcomes, whether it's rates, whether it's almost half the world's population voting and elections and potential for greater volatility in the back half of the year. So that informs both the overall outlook of 3% to 7% billed issuance, but also the timing that Doug has mentioned, which is a stronger first half versus second half. On the transaction side, we see strong performance across all key areas there. So that would include our surveillance book. It would include the res portions of the book for example CRISIL, as well as the royalty payment that we get from Market Intelligence. So maybe again I would just reiterate strong first half and tapering off in the back half. And then as Doug mentioned, it is early in the year. There is potential for upside in the range and we would look to get more precise on this as we go throughout the year. Thanks much Russell for the question. Just a quick one on the non-transaction. We don't separate out our guidance between transaction and non-transaction. But as I said, we do expect robust performance in our non-transaction part of the book this year. The picture is a little counterintuitive in fact for the timing piece because you would in fact expect given our kind of predictions of three rate cuts for example by the Feds starting in the middle of the year, this year that you might see a more even result with issuance throughout the year. What we're actually hearing from the market is a little bit different. So for bank loans and high yield for example, we're seeing and hearing a couple of things. Number one issuers have accepted the higher for longer. But more importantly number two there's a good really good strong investor appetite for these asset classes. And pricing is much more constructive this year for example than it was same time last year. So these issuers are coming to market. There's a high volume of repricing into that. So for example the bank loan January volumes for re-pricing was actually around if not a little bit higher than the full year 2023 repricing that we saw in bank loans. And then on investment grade some of that -- we see that tapered a little bit this year compared to last year. The reason for that is that there were so many issuers that came to market last year but also those that are sitting waiting for rate cuts can afford to actually absorb what they're sitting on today whether it's using commercial paper or otherwise to wait for some of those rate cuts to play out. Hopefully, that answers your question. As I said, it's early. We're in the first half of February and this is our base case. There's a pretty wide range of possibilities here and we'll look to get much more precise as we go throughout the year."

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. We closed the year with strong fourth quarter performance overall as we saw growth across all five of our divisions. Adjusted earnings per share increased 23% year-over-year. Reported revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter, but excluding the impact of the Engineering Solutions divestiture, and the small tuck-ins done earlier this year revenue growth was 11%. We also expanded adjusted margins by nearly 300 basis points and reduced our fully diluted share count by 3%. Moving to our strategic investment areas. I'm pleased to report, we saw growth across all categories. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 17% to $84 million in the quarter driven by strong demand for our energy transition products and benchmark offerings. Sustainability and energy transition's full year revenue grew 24% to approximately $301 million. As we introduce more products and continue to innovate in the space we remain committed to this important growth driver for the business. Moving to Private market solutions. We saw revenue increase by 18% year-over-year to $113 million driven by strong growth in Ratings private market revenue as improved market conditions increased bank loan issuance, private credit estimates and MI's software solutions. As we progress towards our goal of $600 million of private market solutions revenue by 2026, I'm pleased to report full year revenue grew 10% to $430 million for 2023. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization was $380 million in the fourth quarter, representing a 19% increase compared to the prior year. Importantly, Vitality revenue represented 12% of our total revenue in the quarter again surpassing our index target of at least 10%. Now turning to synergies. As Doug mentioned earlier, we have completed our cost synergy program associated with the merger and outperformed our stated targets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized $156 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the year was $619 million exceeding our goal of $600 million. For the full year, we recognized $581 million in cost savings from synergies. We had been targeting 85% of total cost synergies realized in 2023 and I'm pleased to see that we not only achieved that target but that we surpassed it by more than $70 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well, with $40 million in synergies achieved in the fourth quarter and an annualized run rate of $152 million exiting the year. Now turning to expenses. Our total expenses grew approximately 2% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by increases in our core and investment growth areas and compensation expenses, which were partially offset by benefits associated with the Engineering Solutions divestiture and cost synergies. On core and investment growth, we continue to make the necessary investments in our strategic initiatives, which includes hiring the right people for key roles and investing in new and existing avenues of growth for our businesses. Within compensation there are two factors I would like to call out. First, our salary expenses remained elevated due to hiring activity and inflationary pressures throughout 2023. Second, our benefit costs were higher due to finalization of benefits realignment of IHS Markit employees in the fourth quarter. As we go through the divisions you will see these factors impacting expenses and margins this quarter, particularly in Market Intelligence and Mobility. This drove slightly higher expense growth than we were expecting but total adjusted expenses still grew only 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter while revenue increased 7%. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 9%, driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop accelerated to 7% growth in the fourth quarter as continued product innovation, introduction of new content sets and improvements to speed and performance supported strong subscription growth. Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions grew 8% and 10% respectively. Both benefited from double-digit growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions grew 10% in the fourth quarter supported by strong new sales and price realization. While renewal rates remain strong overall for MI, we did see slightly elevated cancellations in the fourth quarter, as customers particularly in the financial services vertical continue to see some budgetary constraints. Combined with the modest softness in non-recurring revenue, this resulted in total revenue for MI slightly below our expectations though we continue to see accelerating growth for the division in the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 4% year-over-year, primarily due to higher compensation expense an increase in royalties and data costs, partially offset by cost synergies. Operating profit increased 18% and the operating margin increased 280 basis points to 34.2%. For full year 2023 margins improved by 120 basis points to 33%. The margin results are below our guidance range and are a result of a combination of an admittedly strong topline falling short of our expectations and expenses being slightly higher due to the reasons I mentioned. Now, turning to Ratings. In the fourth quarter we saw refinancing activity drive issuance as improving market conditions reduced borrowing costs and macroeconomic indicators gave issuers comfort coming to the market even in December, which is historically a very quiet month for debt issuance. Revenue increased 19% year-over-year exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew 35% in the fourth quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high-yield issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 10% primarily due to an increase in annual and program fees and growth at CRISIL. Adjusted expenses increased 6% driven by higher compensation, which includes hiring associated with growth initiatives at CRISIL and higher incentives due to financial performance. This resulted in a 32% increase in operating profit and an impressive 540 basis point increase in operating margin to 53.4%. For the full year 2023 margins increased by 60 basis points to 56.5%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 10% following a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Upstream Data & Insights revenue grew by approximately 3% year-over-year benefiting from strong demand for software product offerings as well as significant improvement in retention rates. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 12% and 13% respectively. Growth was driven by continued strength in our benchmark data and insights products. Both business lines continue to see robust subscription sales driven by strong commercial momentum and enhanced value being delivered to customers. Advisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 8% driven by strong trading volumes across all sectors in Global Trading Services and strength in energy transition-related product offerings. These market-driven volumes helped GTS deliver its strongest quarter of 2023. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by higher compensation and continued investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost synergies. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 10% and operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 44.4%. There are a few factors I would like to call out that contributed to CI's very modest margin contraction in the fourth quarter. In addition to the compensation drivers I mentioned earlier, we saw an increase in performance-related compensation due to the topline outperformance. We remain very confident in the growth opportunities for Commodity Insights and also wanted to make sure we continue to adequately invest to capture those opportunities. Trailing 12-month margin, which we believe is the best way to assess the performance of our divisions increased by 180 basis points to 46.1% in 2023. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 9% year-over-year. The dealer segment marked its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, while manufacturing and financials and other continued to deliver solid results. Dealer revenue increased 14% year-over-year driven by the continued benefit of price realization within the last year and new store growth particularly in CARFAX for Life as well as the addition of Market Scan. Manufacturing grew 2% year-over-year, driven by planning solutions and marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 5% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases. Adjusted expenses increased 10% driven primarily by higher compensation due to the benefits alignment already mentioned and also due in part to higher commissions related to revenue outperformance in our OEM and dealer businesses. We also incurred some inorganic expense growth on the Market Scan acquisition. In aggregate these drivers resulted in an 8% increase in adjusted operating profit and 30 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For full year 2023, margins contracted 20 basis points to 38.8%. Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 5% primarily due to strong growth in exchange-traded derivatives revenue and new business activities within Data & Custom Subscriptions. Revenue associated with asset-linked fees were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. This was driven by higher ETF AUM, which benefits from both market appreciation and net inflows leading to higher ETF fees and declines in OTC products. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 22% primarily driven by strong volumes in SPX and fixed products and strong price realization. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 4% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower outside services and incentive expenses. Operating profit in Indices increased 11% and the operating margin increased 390 basis points to 66.1%. For the full year 2023, margins expanded 50 basis points to 68.9%. As we reflect on 2023 as a whole, I'm incredibly proud about the many things we're able to accomplish. We returned more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders. We also continue to make the right investments in our strategy, allocating approximately $140 million to the enterprise initiatives that we have discussed with you. And we are encouraged by the fact that approximately 10% of the company's revenue growth came from those initiatives in 2023. On an inorganic basis, we executed a disciplined M&A strategy with tactical acquisitions immediately adding value to the enterprise. The optimization of our capital and liquidity structure completed earlier in the year provided $750 million of capital. Due to the prudent and strategic application of rate swaps we're able to execute that debt issuance in a rising rate environment, while avoiding an increase in our average cost of capital. With a team that can deliver impressive accomplishments like these in 2023, I'm confident this will continue under the leadership of the future CFO of S&P Global. Now, I'll turn it back to Doug to cover the 2024 outlook. Good morning, Ashish, this is Ewout. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to answer a question during my last call. Coming back to your point about OTC, obviously, if you look at AUM fees in the fourth quarter, you say, hey that's strange, why is it flat where markets are up so much? And we see two underlying dynamics that go in opposite direction. So, as we have always said in AUM fees, there's many things that go there into the mix. There is mutual funds there's OTCs and others. Actually if we zoom in on ETFs, it's up about 8% in terms of fees. And that is helped by market depreciation as well as very strong inflows that we have seen into the ETF area but offset by OTC volumes that were down period-over-period. OTC volumes can always be a bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. So, I wouldn't read too much into it. This can really change again the following quarter. So, overall, I would say this is a normal trend that we are seeing here. With respect to the assumption for 2024, first of all, the assumption is that AUM is up at mid-single-digit level. The ETD volumes low single-digit increase, and then the subscription growth at a double-digit level for the Index business for 2024. Those are the assumptions. Thank you, Ashish. Yeah. Thanks Jeff. So let me explain what is benefits realignment. So benefits realignment is that we brought as of January 1, 2023, all of our employees across the world to the same benefits package, because we think it is fair that we should treat everyone the same in every country around the world. So think about the medical plans, think about the retirement plans. We have made estimates about the expenses for 2023. And for the first three quarters, the expenses came in exactly in line with our expectations, but they exceeded the expectations in the fourth quarter. And benefits costs are always not 100% certain because just to give an example, the medical costs in the US were self-insured. So they can be higher if we have higher medical claims or the matching for 401(k) contributions can be higher. So we're seeing this more as a onetime step-up cost and that should be in our baseline going forward from 2024 onwards. Your second part of your question about the tax rate, we saw in 2023 a bit of a benefit in the tax rate in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And then we are seeing some upward pressure in the tax rate in 2024. So to expand on that on the third quarter of 2023, we had some favorable new guidance with respect to the utilization of foreign tax credits. And then in the fourth quarter, we had the conclusion of certain state tax audits that led to some reserve releases. So it brought the effective tax rate a little bit down in 2023 compared to a normalized level. And what we're seeing in 2024 the implementation of Pillar 2 global minimum tax in several jurisdictions as well as the UK statutory tax rate is going up. So 2024 is I think the right level to think about this. Where tax rate will go from a longer-term perspective is really hard to say because it really depends on government finances and where that will go around the world in the future. Thank you, Jeff. Yes we brought up incentive compensation accruals in the fourth quarter. And that was driven by the strong top line performance from both the Ratings and Commodity Insights. So, for the total year 2023, our cash bonus incentive accruals are now ending up at a level above 100%. What we always do, when we do planning is to reset cash bonus incentives back to 100% from a planning perspective for the next year. So, for 2024, in the plan is embedded a 100% payout of our cash bonuses."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. 2023 was an exciting year for S&P Global a year of innovation and growth. Our results in 2023 serve as a testament to strong execution and S&P Global's unique position at the center of the global markets. Excluding Engineering Solutions which was divested in the second quarter of last year revenue increased 8% year-over-year. We expanded adjusted operating margins by almost 300 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter to finish the year with approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion and we surpassed our $600 million target for cost synergies by $19 million. We delivered adjusted EPS growth of 13% to come into the high end of our guidance range as we continue to benefit from strong revenue growth, disciplined expense management and a commitment to strong capital returns. On the topic of capital returns, 2023 marked the 50th consecutive year that S&P Global has increased its cash dividend and we've already announced the Board approval to make 2024 the 51st. In 2023 we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, representing more than 100% of our adjusted free cash flow. In addition to strong financial performance, we created a formal artificial intelligence leadership team in 2023, which we'll discuss in more detail shortly. We also delivered double-digit growth and significant innovation in key strategic investment areas. Private market solutions and sustainability and energy transition both delivered double-digit growth in 2023 and we're well positioned to continue growing in these important areas in 2024. Our Vitality Index which we target to remain at or above 10% of company revenue actually exceeded 11% in 2023 and also increased at a double-digit rate. In 2023, we delivered key wins in each of the five strategic pillars we introduced at the end of 2022. We look forward to accelerating that success in 2024 and continuing our track record of creating value for our customers and our shareholders. We know that our success depends on creating value for our customers and we delivered for them in 2023. We improved customer retention rates in several of our divisions last year while continuing to introduce new products and features more quickly and more frequently. Through deep engagement with customers around the world, tens of thousands of customer touch points, we saw continued adoption of enterprise contracts in Market Intelligence and acceleration of enterprise agreements in Commodity Insights. We know that certain customer verticals, particularly Financial Services and regional base had unique challenges in 2023. While we discussed longer sales cycles through 2023, we were able to keep our sales pipeline moving and continue to demonstrate value for our customers even in challenging times. As we look to 2024, we continue to see macroeconomic market and geopolitical challenges. Our customers need unique and differentiated data sets and key insights for the markets they serve, which means our role as a trusted and strategic partner is more important than ever. Now nearly two years after the merger, we've put the work of operational integration behind us. And we have fully turned to the exciting work of growth, innovation and execution. We remain committed to balancing margin expansion with strategic initiatives and long-term growth. We will also look for ways to optimize our portfolio of products and services. With the merger integration behind us, we plan to continue reviewing and optimizing our portfolio of assets to meet our customers' needs either through tuck-in acquisitions or potentially further divestitures as you've seen us do historically. Turning to the 2023 issuance environment. We saw strong growth in billed issuance in 2023, particularly in the second half. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see issuers returning to the market, with billed issuance growth driven primarily by strength in bank loans, structured finance and high yield. This contributed to a successful rebound for the full year 2023, with billed issuance increasing 8%. Turning to Vitality. We're pleased to see the continued outperformance in our index to close out 2023. As we shared with you when we introduced this metric a little over a year ago, our goal is to make sure at least 10% of our revenue comes from new or enhanced products each year. As products mature, they'll naturally age out of the Vitality Index, even if they continue to grow rapidly. But we remain committed to that 10% target, as a steady stream of innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. We view the Vitality Index as a direct measure of the value our customers are realizing from the improvements we're making in our products and services each year. With 18% growth in revenue from Vitality products in 2023, we ended the year with more than 11% of our total revenue coming from these new offerings. This is an incredible achievement by our product development and commercial teams, as they not only build great products and features in 2023, but also make sure our customers were aware and equipped to benefit from the innovation we are bringing to the table. Across divisions, we've seen new products in 2023 that demonstrate our commitment to powering global markets in a world of rapidly evolving technology. First, in another compelling example of our cross-divisional development between Market Intelligence and Commodity Insights, we launched our Power Evaluator tool. It's already received great feedback from power utility market participants. Additionally, in Commodity Insights, we combined the most powerful features of two leading commodity platforms, Platts Dimensions Pro and IHS Connect to create Platts Connect, which we believe is the market's most holistic source of data insights and tools custom-built for commodity market participants. In Market Intelligence, we also significantly enhanced Capital IQ Pro. June saw the release of one of the largest and most important updates in years. And we're thrilled with the preliminary release of our new generative AI solution ChatIQ to a set of pilot customers in December. We're excited for more customers to get access to these proprietary tools as 2024 progresses. We also launched powerful new tools with our new supplier risk indicator and Entity Insights offerings. In Ratings, we continue to deliver assessments and insights to help market participants evaluate different assets. And we leveraged our expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to launch the first stablecoin stability assessment in late 2023. 2023 saw the launch of several new indices as well, including the S&P B3 corporate bond index in Brazil, multiple cross-asset indices and new sector, factor and thematic indices that we believe will contribute to strong growth in the years to come. As we mentioned last quarter, we want to provide an update on our AI strategy. We've elevated the focus on artificial intelligence to make sure we have executive leadership, governance and sponsorship at the enterprise level. In late 2023, we announced internally that our former Chief Information Officer, Swamy Kocherlakota would take on the new role as Chief Digital Solutions Officer, including executive sponsorship of AI and Kensho. Bhavesh Dayalji, CEO of Kensho has expanded his role to now lead cross-divisional AI initiatives as our first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer. These changes to our leadership structure around technology and especially around AI are the next logical steps in the commitment to AI that began with our initial investment in Kensho nearly seven years ago. As part of this strategy, we've developed an AI accelerator to fast-track high-priority AI initiatives and build common capabilities that can be deployed and used by teams across the enterprise. There are four important ways that we expect our AI to impact our performance. First, through the development of new products and services; second, leveraging Kensho to accelerate and automate manual processes and data operations; third, amplifying the productivity of our internal experts, freeing up more capacity for higher order work; and fourth, embedding AI functionality in existing products to increase customer value and improve user experience. We're committed to keeping you informed about these initiatives. So we've launched a new AI page on our public website, spglobal.ai, which includes important research, our key thought leadership and insights into our developments. At S&P Global, we have a strategic vision of the importance of AI to our industry and the world going forward as we believe that AI will quickly become embedded in everything we do. And we have a framework to deliver the best capabilities in as many products as we can and by extension into the hands of as many customers as we can as fast as we can. Fortunately S&P Global starts with some of the most powerful proprietary data sets in the world sourced from all five divisions. Our proprietary data layer is a key differentiator that we believe sets us apart. As we've outlined for you in the past we remain committed to sound governance, protecting this proprietary data and preventing third parties for monetizing or commercializing our data independently. A challenge that even data-rich companies will face is that much of this data isn't ready to be ingested or used by large language models. The data requires traditional machine learning preprocessing, things like data cleaning, data transformation, data reduction and data integration, but it also requires tokenization and tagging, which can be very resource-intensive. This is the Kensho layer. The proprietary tools developed over the last several years by the teams at Kensho automate much of the preprocessing work for both structured data like financial reports, but also unstructured data like the transcript from this very earnings call. Tools like Scribe, NERD, Link, Extract and Classify do much of this heavy lifting and allow our proprietary data to be leveraged more easily and update it more quickly and frequently. This leads to the third element of our framework; the open ecosystem. As we've shared with you before we aren't dependent on any individual technology partner. Having so much AI expertise in-house, means that we can leverage infrastructure and compute platforms from multiple hyperscale cloud providers, third-party LLMs, our own proprietary LLMs and a wide array of other vendors without having to lock ourselves in or cede economics to one ecosystem or another. Ultimately, the goal is to have generative and traditional AI capabilities embedded everywhere that makes sense. We'll track our progress through improving customer win rates, retention rates, price and ultimately growth. It should also show up in our own workflows to improve productivity and efficiency, improving our unit economics and our operating margins over time. We're excited about the significant progress we've made in 2023 and even more excited about what this company will accomplish in 2024 and beyond. Our innovation also extends to the efforts we make to develop our people and improve our communities. In 2023, we held an internal event called Accelerate Progress Live to reinforce our commitment to our teams around the world and highlight our purpose and values as a global employer of choice. We provide dedicated time for our people to pursue volunteer opportunities. We saw an 89% increase in the number of S&P Global people who took advantage of these programs in 2023. And as more of our people return to our offices around the world our global people resource groups saw a nearly 50% increase in engagement. We also demonstrated our commitment to continuously improve our reporting and transparency around our sustainability and related initiatives. In 2023, we published our 12th Annual Impact Report and our fifth Annual TCFD Report. We also published our first-ever Diversity Equity and Inclusion Report, taking much of the information that we've been reporting for years enhancing our disclosures, and making that information more accessible in a dedicated report. We're very pleased that our efforts have been recognized by many external organizations in the last year. S&P Global has iconic global brands and is well known as a desirable destination for highly skilled professionals around the world. We look forward to building upon that hard-won reputation in 2024. Turning to our financial results. Ewout will walk through the fourth quarter results in more detail in a moment, but the headline numbers tell a strong story for 2023. We're pleased to see accelerating growth and margin expansion in almost every division in 2023. The 2023 results and the 2024 guidance, we're introducing today give us confidence in our trajectory towards the growth and margin targets we introduced at our 2022 Investor Day. As we approach the two-year anniversary of the merger, we can definitively say it has been a success. In the last two years, not only have we brought together two world-class organizations but we've delivered through a challenging period against our aspirational and ambitious targets. We integrated major software systems in record time and consolidated our offices around the world. We're able to close many of our data centers due in part to a transformational partnership with AWS. We've maintained a disciplined approach to managing our product portfolio. And we demonstrated this commitment through the divestiture of Engineering Solutions and the aftersales business in our Mobility division and also through the decommissioning of a number of low-margin or slower-growth products. Lastly, since the merger closed we've returned $17.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We initially set a target of $480 million in cost synergies then raised that target to $600 million and have now exceeded that higher target by $19 million. We're ahead of schedule on our revenue synergies to date and we'll continue to report our progress there. Lastly, we told you when the merger closed that we believed it would be accretive to adjusted EPS by 2023 and I'm pleased to confirm that we have delivered. Both our internal analysis and independent external analysis indicate that in 2023 we delivered higher adjusted EPS than we likely would have generated with S&P Global as a standalone company. I'm thrilled to be able to call the merger a success and to move forward to powering global markets as one company. Now, I'll turn to Ewout to review the financial results. Ewout? Thank you, Ewout. We're updating our outlook to reflect our economists' view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024. While this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list, these are some of the key factors we'll be tracking this year. We're currently expecting a soft landing scenario with a base case assumption that we avoid a global recession. So we expect geopolitical uncertainty to persist. We also expect energy transition and higher interest rates to remain factors. For the equity markets, we expect the secular tailwind that flows from active to passive management to continue. Though changes to market volatility can impact our ETD business and Indices and fluctuations in asset prices will have a lagged, but potentially meaningful impact on our asset-linked fees revenue, early signs in 2024 indicate market optimism with the market currently pricing in multiple rate cuts in 2024. The timing of these potential cuts is unpredictable, but we expect the issuance environment to be stronger in the first half of the year than the back half. We expect continued focus on energy transition in the commodity markets with volatility in the evolving regulatory landscape having the potential to impact our results this year. Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 2.8%, US inflation of 2.4% at an average price for Brent crude of $83 per barrel. We're also forecasting billed issuance growth in the range of 3% to 7% in 2024, with stronger growth expected in the first half. While we've included a market issuance forecast in the past, we will only report on billed issuance going forward, when discussing our outlook for our financial performance, as it historically has been a better indicator of our revenue growth and aligns with our monthly disclosures. Turning to our most recent refinancing study. When we compare these refinancing walls to last year's study, we see that current year maturities, meaning 2024 maturities now compared to 2023 maturities measured at this time last year are more than 10% higher than they were at this point last year. The maturities expected over the next two and three-year periods are more than 12% higher. While we can't be certain how the higher rate environment will impact these maturities or issuers' likelihood to delever, we're confident that this puts us in a strong position to achieve the Ratings revenue targets we're outlining today for 2024. Now, turning to our initial guidance for 2024. This slide illustrates our initial guidance for GAAP results. For our adjusted guidance, we're expecting revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 7.5%, driven by strong growth in all five divisions. We expect organic revenue growth excluding the impact of 2023 divestitures in the range of 7% to 9%. We expect to deliver at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in 2024. This will require us to maintain discipline around expenses and productivity, while ensuring that we are making the necessary investments to drive growth and innovation in vital strategic areas like generative AI, sustainability, energy transition and private markets. We expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.75 to $14, which represents double-digit growth at the midpoint. It's important to note that our expected adjusted tax rate is nearly two percentage points higher in 2024 than in 2023. If our tax rate were to remain unchanged from 2023, we would expect adjusted EPS growth approximately two to three percentage points higher, consistent with the low to mid-teens growth rate we pointed to for 2025, 2026 at our Investor Day. As you saw in our supplemental materials earlier this morning, we also expect adjusted free cash flow excluding certain items of approximately $4.4 billion. We expect growth in adjusted free cash flow to be driven primarily by strong growth in revenue and profitability though free cash flow growth will be tempered somewhat by the timing of working capital items and the full year impact of the $750 million debt offering completed in the third quarter of 2023. With the geopolitical, macroeconomic and market risk and opportunities, we've discussed on this call we expect that the financial outlook we've provided today likely has more upside risk than downside. And you can count on our focus determination and discipline over the coming year. Our outlook for 2024 calls for further acceleration in revenue growth compared to 2023, and continued margin expansion even though we will no longer have the benefit of the vast majority of our cost synergy actions going forward. Our financial outlook for 2024 illustrates our continued progress toward the targets we outlined at our Investor Day just over a year ago and we remain committed to those targets. Moving to our division outlook. For Market Intelligence, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7.5% with expected growth to be slightly higher in the back half than in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%, as we continue to invest in key growth initiatives while maintaining rigorous discipline around expenses. For Ratings, we expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% driven by billed issuance growth of 3% to 7%. We expect revenue growth rates to be stronger in the first half of the year than the second half as comparisons are easier in the first half. We expect some level of pull forward given the uncertainty around the timing of any potential rate actions by central banks. We expect adjusted operating margins in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. For Commodity Insights, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9.5% and adjusted operating margins of 46.5% to 47.5%. For Mobility, we expect revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10% and adjusted operating margins of 39% to 40%. Lastly for S&P Dow Jones Indices we expect revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9% and adjusted operating margins in the range of 68.5% to 69.5%. As you saw in the press release earlier this morning, our Board has authorized the repurchase of shares totaling up to $2.4 billion, which we expect to execute throughout the year. And with that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1 to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Thank you, Manav. This is Doug. Well we're really excited about what we've been able to achieve with the merger. And you've heard us talk about the power of the merger, the capital return that we had, the accretion to EPS, the cost synergies which we now have delivered $619 million. And going forward we're going to keep talking about the revenue synergies. When we look at the revenue synergies, they started off traditionally with cross-sell, cross-sell within divisions. This is where we were selling Commodity Insights products from the Platts customers to the IHS Markit customers and vice versa. Same in the Market Intelligence business where we're selling financial services products to corporate customers for Market Intelligence. But now we're starting to deliver the new products as well. And a combination of both of these has allowed us to be ahead of the schedule. We're very excited about the new products coming out. Let me give you one example from the Commodity Insights division something called Platts Connect. Platts Connect is a product that took the platform of Platts Dimensions Pro and took the IHS Markit Connect platform. We put them together. We now have a very unique single holistic platform for prices, for research, for forecasting. But let me hand it over to Adam, since he's on the call and he can give us some more color for Market Intelligence. Thanks, Tom. Thanks Alex. This is Doug. Let me start by saying that we always start our year with looking at how we're going to be able to grow our margins. We always build a budget that begins with top line growth. And we want to make sure that we can build our business through investment for innovation, but also continue to deliver margin expansion. So if you asked about each of the divisions and each of the divisions has different characteristics for how we're moving forward. We have technology and productivity plans in place. But let me start with a couple of the divisions and then hand it over to Adam. So within the Commodity Insights division, we're looking at as you saw 8.8% growth to 9.5% growth with a margin expansion in the 46.5 to 47.5 range. We have growth in that area in particular in energy transition products. We see high demand coming for new products that relate to carbon to carbon intensity to carbon markets to different types of metals, which are going to be important for the energy transition. So we see a lot of growth in the area coming from energy transition on top of what are the regular markets there. We do have some investments taking place in the Commodity Insights division both for some regional expansion, as well as some new products. When it comes to Mobility, we're making some investments in some new products in Mobility, so that we will be able to grow our top line. As you see we have an 8.5% to 10% revenue guide as a 39% to 40% margin guide. But we always operate all of our businesses beginning with top line with discipline to deliver growth. Just to mention before I hand it over to Adam as you know we've delivered 1,200 basis points of margin expansion over the last 10 years. So it's something that's in our DNA. But let me hand it over to Adam. Thank you Scott. Thank you Jeff. As you know we always apply a discipline to looking at our portfolio, looking at top line growth, looking at the margin expansion, also looking at how it fits across the portfolio. During the year last year, we didn't make a lot of noise about it but we did shut down some very small products. We shut down 8,000 indices that were subpar subside across the businesses within Commodity Insights Market Intelligence or some small products that we moved on. We also had a couple of small divestitures. But when you ask the question to us, we're constantly looking at the portfolio trying to understand what fits best. We have different themes. You've heard us talk about the key themes private market, sustainability, supply chain, analytics, risk and credit. These are the sorts of areas that we're always looking to expand our presence to make sure we have the best capabilities possible to meet the needs of our clients. But within looking at the needs of clients we look at the shareholders. We look at how we're going to put this portfolio together with the best way to leverage our technology. We will always apply the discipline as well to how we're going to look at the portfolio in the future. Thank you, George. Thanks, Craig. As you saw when we put together our information, we put in our slides what are the key factors that we look at. And when you take a step back, we know that GDP growth is always the number one driver. It's the highest correlated factor to our long-term revenue growth. We've looked over the years to see what are those factors that drive it the most. We see some potential slowdown in the economy in the US and EU. We're planning for what we call we're planning against what we call a soft landing which means that there could be some sort of slowdown in the economy. As you heard we've seen some slowness and a little bit of longer sales cycles in certain segments. But that's – those are some of the downside factors. What would happen with the geopolitical factors, how long will it take before central banks begin to cut rates, we've taken those into account as we built our guidance with some conservatism. So if we saw a much quicker return to lower interest rates, if we saw much quicker a geopolitical environment that was more stable, these are the kinds of things that create some upside for the company. We also look at segment by segment. We know that the automotive segment is going through a lot of change. We know that the energy transition which is changing the commodity cycle. So we've taken into account all of these different factors as we've looked at the – overall at the guidance. So to your upside risk – upside opportunities we think that it could come if interest rates move down lower faster, if the interest rates if the economies grow faster than we think, et cetera. But these are all the factors we take into account across the divisions, as we're setting up our guidance for 2024. Thanks, Craig. Great. Thank you for that. And when we think about technology when we think about AI we start with the framework that we showed you in our prepared remarks today which has the foundation of very strong proprietary data. We think that this is going to be one of the most important factors for AI becoming successful at any company no matter where they are. And we think that this gives us a running start in addition to what we've already been developing with Kensho over the last five years. But turning that into earnings and turning that into growth is something that we're starting to build. We think that the AI opportunities we have, Adam talked earlier about ChatIQ is an example of something that gives customers the opportunity to dig much, much deeper into our data. We think that it's going to create stickiness. We're starting with metrics that look at for example, our Net Promoter Scores. We're looking at retention. We're looking at how people -- how -- what kind of feedback we get from calls from customers that are calling in to see how we're doing. We also believe that right now we're going to be able to continue to meet our guidance that we gave you for our -- in our Investor Day in 2022. We'll be able to continue along that track. And then we'll be able to come out with much more precise guidance for the impact of AI across our portfolio in the future. But we see this as something that's going to be a game changer for all of our businesses. It's going to be embedded in everything we do. And we're just now learning how we're going to measure those impacts. But let me hand it over to Adam because he's very close to a couple of the end market opportunities that we have right now. Thank you, John. Thank you, Owen. Well, we take a view that AI is going to be embedded in everything we do. And we don't think there's going to be a killer app. It would be great if there were. That's not our plan. Our plan is to look at AI to see how it can improve our productivity, how we can use it with our developers, our data management, data linking, et cetera, up into how we're going to improve our products and build products and link them over time. As you heard from Adam, we've got a few very exciting products that are already being tested in the market. We've launched one recently and then we've got some more coming. We also have the capabilities of Kensho which are available on the Marketplace. So we don't think of it as a killer app. We think of it as continuous improvement. And we think that if you look at it over time, it's going to be something that's going to change the way we work and the way that our people work. So, we're really excited about it. We're also excited that we have such a strong internal team that we're one of the first companies who was able to name a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer, somebody who has the experience of Kensho of being the CEO there with the expertise. We have an open model in terms of the ecosystem we're going to be working with. So we're not looking for a killer application, but we're looking to see every single way we can use it and how it's going to improve the way we serve our customers as well to manage the business. So thank you Owen. Let me make a couple of closing remarks. And first of all, I want to thank all of you as usual for being on the call and for your excellent questions. And it was great to have Adam and Martina on the call today. And I'm really excited about everything that we're able to deliver in 2023. We delivered what we think is the promise of the merger. As you know we've paid back over $17.5 billion of capital over the last two years since the merger. We've been delivering innovation. We delivered on our synergies. So we're excited about taking that energy and all of the incredible work that our people have done, and turning that now into growth into the future. I also want to thank our people as always for their incredible work. It's what made 2023 what it is and it's what makes me very confident about the foundation we have for going forward, and especially our leadership team who is focused on growth innovation and execution. This is our last earnings call with Ewout. He's been with us for seven years of remarkable service and I want to thank him. He's helped shape our financial strategy. I know that everybody is very pleased with our margin, and as well as our capital return and that's something that Ewout's been instrumental in. He's helped us lead with our accelerated growth with our innovation and he's had a tremendous impact. He partnered with us on all of the major strategic transactions. He's been the sponsor of Kensho for the last five years, which we now talked about many times on this call the importance that brings to the company as well as one of the initial architects as well as executors of the IHS Markit merger. So he's done a fantastic job building a world-class finance organization. As we previously announced our current Chief Accounting Officer, Chris Craig will be named as the interim CFO on Monday. And he has done a fantastic job here for the last 13 years. And he's going to continue to evaluate the businesses. And as we look both internally and externally for candidates for the permanent role, and I look forward to working with Chris in his role. But again thank you Ewout. We wish you the best in your new role and continued success in your career. And please keep making the world a better place with your leadership with UNICEF. So, again, thank you everyone for joining the call. Great questions and we're very excited about the future. Thank you very much."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased to report 11% revenue growth in the third quarter, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions. We saw acceleration in revenue growth in every division this quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we took decisive action to protect margins in the second and third quarters last year. And while lapping that impact contributed to our expense growth this quarter, we're pleased to see margins expand approximately 100 basis points despite that headwind. Adjusted EPS increased 10% year-over-year, and we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by approximately $0.10 at the midpoint to reflect the better-than-expected results through the third quarter. Strong financial results like these come as a result of continued innovation and execution, and we're excited about the rapid pace of product launches coming from S&P Global this quarter. We'll be discussing a few of them on the call, but I encourage you to look through the releases available in our online press center to get a better sense of the sheer volume of new products and features we've introduced this quarter. We've seen acceleration in each of the strategic growth areas we've been reporting since our Investor Day. We also saw our Vitality Index reached 12% of total revenue in the quarter as new products continue to generate value for both customers and shareholders. We also made progress on our AI initiatives, which I'll touch on briefly today, but we plan to provide a more holistic update on our progress next quarter. We continue to align our goals and operations against the 5 strategic pillars we introduced at Investor Day. I'm thrilled with what our team was able to deliver for our customers this quarter. As we lean into our customer conversations and continue to provide innovative solutions to the problems that most need solving, our customers are increasingly viewing S&P Global as a trusted strategic partner. In the third quarter, sales cycles were consistent with the longer cycle we've seen in the last few quarters, though we're encouraged that these conversations with customers are often leading to larger deals. In times of market volatility, uncertainty or change, the global markets has learned to count on S&P Global for differentiated data, powerful workflow tools, important insights and unrivaled benchmarks. We're seeing confirmation of our strategic emphasis on private markets as well as sustainability and energy transition as revenue growth accelerated meaningfully in both those areas this quarter. As we continue to engage with customers, we hear clear indications of long-term optimism despite the near-term uncertainty and volatility in the markets. Our conversations with financial institutions, corporates and others generally revolve around interest rates in the short term with everyone interested in identifying peak interest rates. Large maturity walls along with other factors contribute to our optimism about the multiyear growth trajectory for S&P Global. Related to Ratings, global billed issuance saw a very strong third quarter with 21% growth year-over-year. With credit spreads tightening through the third quarter, issuers were more comfortable coming to the market, though refinancing activity continues to drive the majority of issuance. We also saw better-than-expected activity in bank loans particularly around amend and extend transactions, which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter, though perhaps not to the same extent. We also saw our relative position CLOs improve again in the third quarter, marking a continuation of the trend we've seen all year. Vitality revenue is another area of accelerating growth for S&P Global this quarter. Our Vitality revenue metric consists of revenue derived from new or enhanced products. These innovative products contributed 12% of revenue in the third quarter and grew a combined 22% year-over-year, a significant acceleration from the 14% growth last quarter. You'll notice that the largest contributors to our Vitality revenue are unchanged from last quarter. While products can and will move out of the Vitality Index over time as they mature, it's encouraging to see growth from these products remain steady and resilient. We're also encouraged by the early signs of growth and traction among many of the smaller products that will likely scale to be the top contributors in the coming quarters and years, including the trends we see in private markets for more transparency in valuation and benchmark products. I'd like to turn to some of those new product launches now. We're seeing strong cross-divisional collaboration driving new ideas with much of that innovation now turning to generally available products. In the third quarter, we introduced multiple data sets from our Mobility division to our Market Intelligence Marketplace, making crucial vehicle forecast and registration data available via both Xpressfeed and Snowflake. We also launched a new single unified platform that marks the product integration of both Platts and IHS Connect. The new platform is called Platts Connect and allows customers access to a comprehensive range of products, benchmarks, data and insights from one easy-to-use interface on desktop and mobile. These 2 products, Mobility and Marketplace and Platts Connect, also highlight 2 of our early opportunities to integrate new AI capabilities. In the coming months and quarters, we'll be introducing intelligent search and other AI-powered functionality that we're currently developing and testing within Marketplace and Platts Connect. We'll have more details on that as we get closer to launching those new features. We also introduced Entity Insights in the third quarter, which brings data from Sustainable1 to our network and regulatory solutions to power KYC third-party risk management and vendor management within a single workflow tool, leveraging data for 27 million global entities. I also want to provide an update on our development of ChatIQ. As we've shared with you, ChatIQ is a generative AI product developed jointly between Kensho and our Market Intelligence team. During the third quarter, we had a new beta release that we continue to test internally, but this is a step function improvement over our last internal release. Given our strategic focus, I wanted to provide a bit more detail on the acceleration of our sustainability and energy transition products as we expected in the third quarter. Customer needs have evolved away from ESG scores and moved towards climate and energy transition. We believe we are uniquely visioned to win in this market. When we talk to customers, we hear clear trends. Customers don't just need a set of opaque scores. They're building internal sustainability frameworks, and they need high-quality raw data. With Trucost, we have what we believe to be the most robust and comprehensive climate data set in the world. We also offer detailed sustainability data on 17,000 companies, including approximately 3,500 that provide robust granular data through our corporate sustainability assessment survey. Companies are seeking to operationalize the risk management around climate, and we have the largest set of real asset level data available with emissions data and climate hazards mapped to 1.6 million physical assets. We also hear consistently from customers that they need help with energy transition, including developing and executing a viable energy transition strategy. We have solutions that cater to customers in different industries, including our automotive value chain carbon accounting solution and the power evaluator solution for energy transition strategies within the crucial power utility sector. We see this customer need across all industries. So this quarter, we also launched the Sustainability Starter Pack. This is a comprehensive solution to help companies start from scratch or from wherever they may be as they develop sustainability strategies. We help them assess materiality, measure greenhouse gas emissions and develop the reports necessary to comply with disclosure requirements and stakeholder demands. Customers need help generating things like a TCFD report and measuring things like greenhouse gas emissions. They need help benchmarking their own progress against peers, and they need help managing the transition to renewable energy sources. We're confident that S&P Global is unparalleled in its ability to provide both the breadth and the depth of offerings necessary to adequately cover all these areas. We're continually increasing the data that we make available through Xpressfeed, and we're pleased to be adding data sets around net zero commitments and biodiversity before year-end. Clearly, we're meeting customers at their point of need, and that's showing up in our results. Trucost revenue growth accelerated to 55% year-over-year. Energy transition continues to grow nearly 40%. And our total sustainability and energy transition revenue growth accelerated to 36% year-over-year in the third quarter. While we're very encouraged by these results, we will not rest on our laurels. We remain committed to accelerating product leadership in this vital area and look forward to many new exciting products to come in future quarters and years. Of course, our commitment to innovation and customer value also powers our ability to generate value for our shareholders. This is an incredible quarter of accelerating growth. We also continue to demonstrate discipline around expenses as margin expansion in the third quarter helped keep trailing 12-month margins relatively flat year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins improved sequentially from the second quarter, and we expect margins for the full year to expand more than 100 basis points based on the midpoint of our guidance as Ewout will explain in more detail. The economic factors facing the company are largely unchanged as we look to the final few months of 2023. Secular trends continue to serve as strong tailwinds for the company, while cyclical trends can impact different parts of the business in different ways. Despite increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape around things like sustainability and continued uncertainty around the timing of the capital markets recovery, S&P Global remains committed to delivering value in all market conditions. Turning to the conditions of the debt markets. We're tightening the range of our expectations for billed issuance as we now expect growth of 5% to 7% compared to our prior expectations of 4% to 8%. As we've discussed previously, we introduced the billed issuance reporting metric this year as well as a full year forecast to provide context for the issuance assumptions embedded in our Ratings revenue guidance. Billed issuance remains the issuance metric most tightly correlated with our transaction revenue in Ratings. Our latest forecast from the Ratings Research Group now calls for positive market issuance growth for the full year, up from last quarter's expectation for a full year decline. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance with divergence this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign in international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen to go through more details around our financial results and outlook. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. This was an exciting quarter for S&P Global as we saw growth accelerate across all 5 of our divisions, and revenue and margins both outperformed our internal expectations. Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% year-over-year. While reported revenue grew 8%, this actually understates the accomplishments of the team during the third quarter because excluding Engineering Solutions and the small tuck-ins done earlier this year, revenue growth was an impressive 11%. We also expanded adjusted margins by 100 basis points and reduced our fully diluted share count by 4% year-over-year. As you saw in the press release earlier this morning, we plan to continue share count reduction with the launch of an incremental $1.3 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the coming weeks. Revenue in the quarter was driven by growth across all divisions, led by outperformance in our Ratings division, which benefited from elevated issuance activity in the high-yield and bank loan markets. While the environment remains unpredictable for the debt markets, we saw stronger issuance volume throughout the third quarter than we expected, particularly in September. Adjusted expenses were up 6% year-over-year, while the adjusted operating income increased 10%. Acceleration is further demonstrated by our strategic growth initiatives. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 36% to $78 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand in climate and physical risk products and our energy transition products. As Doug highlighted earlier, we're fulfilling our customer needs for raw data and reporting capabilities around sustainability and energy transition, and this is evident by the third quarter growth. This acceleration reconfirms our continued optimism around the long-term potential of this important part of our growth. Moving to Private Market Solutions. We saw revenue increase by 18% year-over-year to $109 million, driven by strong growth in Market Intelligence private market software solutions, including iLEVEL and a return to strong growth in Ratings private market revenue as bond issuance and private credit estimate activity both improved in the quarter. We're also encouraged by the demand we're seeing in our private market valuation and benchmark offerings. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, was $369 million in the third quarter, representing a 22% increase compared to prior year. Importantly, Vitality revenue represented 12% of our total revenue in the quarter, making it the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our Vitality Index score. Now turning to synergies. In the third quarter of 2023, we recognized $149 million of expense savings due to cost synergies, and our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $588 million. We expect to complete our cost synergy program by year-end with a run rate of approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $25 million in synergies achieved in the third quarter and an annualized run rate of $112 million. Turning to expense growth. We are pleased to see that our efforts to optimize our portfolio and deliver cost synergies offset most of the year-over-year expense growth in the third quarter. Our total expenses increased less than 6% year-over-year, though we continue to see some inflationary pressure on compensation expense. Due to the decisive expense actions we took last year, the reset of incentive compensation this year continues to contribute meaningfully to expense growth, though we do not expect any further headwinds from this going forward. We are confident that we continue to strike the appropriate balance between disciplined expense management and investing in our business as evidenced by the volume of new products coming to the market this year and our expectation to deliver more than 100 basis points of adjusted margin expansion for the full year at the midpoint of our guidance range. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 8%, driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop grew 5% in the third quarter, driven by strong subscription growth as ACV growth continued to outpace revenue growth, partially offset by modest softness in onetime sales. Renewal rates continue to remain strong in the mid- to high 90s range. Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions each grew by 9% in the quarter, benefiting from double-digit growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions continues to see strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products as well as continued double-digit growth in credit analytics. Adjusted expenses increased 9% year-over-year, primarily due to compensation expense. Operating profit increased 6%, and the operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 33.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins improved 140 basis points. As we progress through the fourth quarter, we expect continued acceleration in revenue growth as we move into the most favorable comparison quarter for the year. Furthermore, we see the business continuing to benefit from the launch of new products and monetization of cross-sell referrals as part of the division's overall revenue synergy program. As a result, we are tightening our full year guidance for revenue growth by 100 basis points to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% while reaffirming our full year margin outlook. Now turning to Ratings. In the third quarter, we saw continued improvements in issuance activity, particularly due to refinancing in the bank loan and high-yield markets. Revenue increased 20% year-over-year, well above our internal expectations. However, growth was helped by a $19 million cumulative catch-up for customers' self-reported commercial paper issuance in nontransaction revenue, which primarily benefited structured finance. Excluding this impact, Ratings would have grown approximately 17% in the third quarter. Transaction revenue grew 34% in the third quarter, driven primarily by growth in bank loan and high-yield issuance. Nontransaction revenue increased 13%, primarily due to an increase in annual fees, which includes the catch-up revenue I mentioned previously as well as growth in Ratings Evaluation Service activity and at CRISIL. Excluding the impact of the catch-up revenue, nontransaction revenue would have grown approximately 8%. Adjusted expenses increased 18%, primarily due to the write-down of incentive compensation expense in the year-ago period. This resulted in a 22% increase in operating profit and a 70 basis points increase in operating margin to 56.6%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins are still impacted by the relatively low margins in the fourth quarter of last year. As Doug mentioned, we're tightening our billed issuance growth assumption for 2023 to 5% to 7%. This reflects the outperformance we saw in the third quarter, but also reflects our slightly lower expectation for investment-grade issuance in the fourth quarter relative to our prior forecast. While we expect continued growth in nontransaction, we still see headwinds in issuer credit ratings revenue as fewer new issuers come to the market. As a result, we are increasing Ratings revenue guidance range by 100 basis points, now expecting growth of 6% to 8% for the full year and reiterating our margin guidance. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 11% following a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Upstream data and insights increased approximately 2% year-over-year, benefiting from better-than-expected demand for both content and software as well as slightly improved retention rates. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 12% and 10%, respectively. Growth was driven by continued strength in our benchmark data and insights products. We also continue to see strong commercial momentum in our subscription offerings for both business lines. Advisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 33%, driven by strong trading volumes across all sectors in Global Trading Services and strong performance in advisory revenue in the quarter. The business line continues to benefit from market-driven volumes, but we're also seeing positive results in key areas of strategic investment, including energy transition. Adjusted expenses increased 6%. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 17%, and the operating margin improved 260 basis points to 48.4%. Trailing 12-month margins improved 240 basis points. We continue to see Commodity Insights benefit from strong secular trends around energy transition and sustainability and demand for benchmarks, data and insights. Following this quarter's strong performance, we are raising the low end and tightening Commodity Insights overall revenue guidance range, now expecting growth of 8.5% to 9.5% for the full year. There's no change to our margin guidance. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year. The team continues to execute well with the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the dealer segment and continued growth in new business in the manufacturing and financials and other segments. Dealer revenue increased 30% year-over-year, driven by the continued benefit of price realization within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life and used car subscription products as well as the addition of Market Scan. Manufacturing grew 4% year-over-year, driven by elevated recall activity and continued strength in marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 9% as the business line continues to see healthy underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment similar to last quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, driven primarily by increased incentive compensation expense, but also due to the inorganic contribution to expenses from the Market Scan acquisition. This resulted in a 10% increase in adjusted operating profit and 20 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 100 basis points. We expect continued strong growth in used car subscription products as we progress through the fourth quarter. We also expect Mobility to continue to benefit from dealerships and OEMs increasing their incentive spend on new vehicles as affordability is hampered by rising rates. As a result, we are narrowing our guidance for revenue growth to a range of 9% to 10% for the full year. There is no change to our margin guidance. Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 6%, primarily due to gains in exchange-traded derivative volumes and asset-linked fees. We're very pleased to see asset-linked fees return to positive revenue growth in the third quarter. Revenues were up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher ETF AUM, which benefits from both market depreciation and net inflows but was partially offset by mix shift into lower-priced products, continuing the pattern from last quarter. Exchange-traded derivative volume increased 18%, primarily driven by an approximately 20% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 2% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses increased 9% year-over-year, with the majority of the increase driven by the write-down of incentive compensation in the year-ago period. Operating profit in Indices increased 5%, and the operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 69.4%. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 80 basis points. There's no change to our revenue outlook for Indices. However, as a result of the continued cost discipline and outperformance year-to-date, we're increasing our margin guidance for the division to a range of 68% to 69% for the full year. Now let's move to the latest views from our economists, who are forecasting global GDP growth of 3.1% in 2023. While outlooks vary somewhat by region, our economists are forecasting a period of subdued global growth fueled by higher-for-longer rates with a soft landing base case assumption as we move through the first half of next year. We continue to expect inflation to remain above the target rates of central banks and energy commodity prices such as crude oil to remain above the historical averages as well. For the full year, we assume Brent crude will average approximately $84 per barrel, slightly higher than our last estimate as we expect Brent grew to average $88 in the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our guidance. This slide represents our GAAP guidance for headline metrics. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the results through the third quarter as well as our most recent views on the macroeconomic environment and market conditions. We're narrowing our expectations for total revenue growth to a range of 4.5% to 5.5% for the full year to reflect the changes discussed earlier on our divisional revenue outlook. Furthermore, we are maintaining our operating profit margin guidance of 45.5% to 46.5% with the expectation that we will achieve full year margins close to the midpoint of the range. We have provided the granular guidance on corporate and allocated expense, deal-related amortization, interest expense and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site. This includes a 50 basis point reduction in our adjusted effective tax rate to a range of 20.5% to 21.5%. As a result of this quarter's strong performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're increasing and tightening our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $12.50 to $12.60. The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously. In conclusion, our business has demonstrated exceptional growth across divisions this quarter, while we continue to manage expenses prudently. Furthermore, I'm pleased with the progress being made across our cost synergy initiatives and growth across revenue synergies as we see more and more new products coming to the market that would have been impossible without the merger. The teams have done a truly excellent job executing on our key strategic initiatives while still driving profitable growth across all divisions this quarter, and we look forward to delivering a strong finish to 2023. And with that, I would like to invite Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. And we'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Really strong billed issuance momentum in September of 35%. There was a comment around IGB potentially weak in the fourth quarter. But just wondering if you can comment on the strength that you saw in high-yield and bank loans in the third quarter for the rest of the year? And also, if you can talk about any initial color on the refi wall and share pipeline for '24.\nMartina Cheung: Thanks very much for the question. It's Martina here. Yes, very pleased with Q3 overall. As you have seen, our billed issuance was up 21% and a very, very strong September. In high yields, we were very pleased to see it was about 150% growth in issuance overall year-over-year in the quarter, and high yields year-to-date is up about 50% rated issuance in the market. We see strong refi activity there in Q3 and looking to see more of that as we go forward, certainly into next year. It's -- Q3 marked, I think, a notable point in terms of issuers willing to come back and tap the market for high yields. And then on bank loans, as we said before, we didn't have heroic assumptions on bank loan volumes for this year. Overall, while we saw an increase in Q3 year-over-year, we're still down year-over-year, year-to-date in bank loan issuance. There, we saw a lot of refinancing. Interestingly, a very strong trend this year that we saw in Q3 and are monitoring closely going forward is a lot of amend to extend activity -- or amend and extend activity rather in the bank loan space. And that's been a boost in that area from an issuance standpoint. For '24, obviously, we're not commenting yet for '24. We'll certainly give more on that in February. But the factors that we're watching closely, refinancing walls are very healthy. Our last midyear report on refinancing showed the 5-year total's up about 11%. And between now and '26, we see about $8 trillion in refinancing. So that's something that we watch closely, and that's a very robust growth in that area. But we also are looking at usual factors, the macroeconomic factors, certainly heightened geopolitical uncertainty. M&A has not been great this year. As we've seen, it's been down by quite a bit this year. So we're looking to see that come back in next year as well. And just the other point that I would make on -- as we're looking ahead in the next several quarters is that CP balances or commercial paper balances are quite high. So that could lead to some issuance if we see corporates transitioning from CP to fixed income. And we've commented in the past that we continue to see corporate cash balances at pre-pandemic levels, which we think will continue to boost the need for issuance as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: I just wanted to focus on the MI margins, if I could. I mean, I understand trailing 12 months, it's up. But just the low 30s, how should we think about that going forward? And I would think that the synergies, the combination that there should be a lot of upside there, but perhaps just a lower relative growth and maybe it's an investment area. But just any thoughts on cost control and margin improvement there going forward would be helpful.\nEwout Steenbergen: A couple of comments on this. First, if we look back at last year, we took very decisive actions in terms of pulling back expenses when the market turns more south in the second and the third quarter in several areas, among which also incentive compensation. So we have some difficult comps for this year. Having said that, number two, point number two, we acknowledge that MI can do better with margins. And we're seeing several opportunities to expand margins as we have also guidance for the full year and implicitly for the fourth quarter. So that brings me to my third point is that we expect margins actually to improve significantly beginning with the next quarter due to the easier compare but also due to several management actions that we are putting in place, including tight management of headcount and other expenses, while we still continue to invest in growth and other strategic initiatives.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: This one's for Martina. Your billed issuance was markedly ahead of our industry data during the quarter. And so I was hoping you could discuss if you've seen any notable share gains in particular Ratings categories this year? And just any color around share gains.\nMartina Cheung: Thanks, Toni, for the question. I give a couple of comments on this. Certainly, we would look at the differences between market issuance and billed issuance. And I think Doug and Ewout cover that routinely in terms of how to assess our performance specifically. For us, the billed issuance data in Q3 was strong for a number of reasons. Firstly, it's a bit of a mix question. So high yield, more bank loans, less frequent issuer compared year-over-year, which is just a function of when the high-yield and leverage loan issuers tap the market. I would also say we're extremely pleased with the progress and momentum that we have in a number of asset classes. When we talked to you last year at Investor Day, we said we were making investments in structured finance. We were making investments in infrastructure. We had acquired Shades of Green and making investment in SPO. And we've seen really robust performance in all of those areas, which we had tagged and very, very pleased to see those results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Ewout, I wanted to follow up on your comments around expenses. Can you help us think through expenses in the fourth quarter? And more importantly, as we look ahead to 2024, some of the -- now that you're at the end of the road in terms of synergies, how should we think about expenses in 2024 just generally across the business?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, of course. First of all, I would like to comment that if we think about expenses, we have a very volatile comp in 2022. So it has moved around a lot in the quarters last year due to the good reason that we put back very hard, and we're very on top of expense management when we had the difficult markets last year. This year, actually, our trends are far more stable. So year-over-year, there is a lot of noise, but I think this year actually from a pattern perspective looks much better. I think if you look at corrected expenses actually and if you take out Engineering Solutions, we are having expense growth that is below revenue growth. So we're seeing nice healthy margin expense -- margin expansion if you correct for those same items, particularly for Engineering Solutions. We're very happy to see how expenses and margins have developed in Commodity Insights. You have seen some very nice margin expansion there as well as if we think about incentive compensation swing year-over-year, if you would correct for that, actually we're looking at quite modest expense growth in Ratings, Mobility and Indices as well. For the full year, we are expecting for this full year 2023 expense growth in the low single-digit level. So implicitly, if you then would look at the fourth quarter, expenses should be down in a low single-digit level in order to get to that overall guidance range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Just coming back to the Market Intelligence discussion from earlier. It's a question that I've asked a couple of times since you've done this deal. But part of our thesis on the IHS Markit acquisition was that, that's a business on the market financial side that had been cobbled together by a lot of acquisitions over many, many, many years. And I think we're kind of hoping that you get in there with your S&P Global viewpoint and say like what businesses make sense or do not and maybe make this a leaner and meaner machine. So just wondering to what degree that's an effort that you guys are focused on right now? And maybe anything that you've seen where you echo that, that there may be some things to do and the business could still look a little bit different in the future or if you're very happy with the business portfolio today?\nDoug Peterson: Alex, this is Doug, and thank you for the question. And let me just take a step back to -- for 1 second to a higher level about the integration and the merger overall. We're thrilled with the progress, and you've seen that today with some of the new product launches that we described, which are bringing together information, data research from across the portfolio. And within Market Intelligence, we have the same kind of integration going on. As you know, we always looked at the integration of the integration. We realized that IHS Markit had done a lot of acquisitions. They've grown a lot of products. And one of the opportunities is to continue to consolidate those and put those together. And we see a lot of progress there. This is something you should hold us to and watch us how we're going to continue to bring together the areas. As you know, within Market Intelligence, we've got a lot of opportunities to attack new markets. As an example, corporates, financial services at IHS Markit truly was focused on financial services. A lot of their products are very attractive to corporates. We're finding a lot of opportunities as you'll hear us talk about and you know related to sustainability and private markets. So we look at this opportunity to continue to consolidate the businesses internally, which is going to bring upside from an expense point of view. And we're also going to be investing for growth, especially in areas like sustainability, private markets and then expanding areas like our reference pricing, which can be used in so many different ways. But your thesis is right. We're going to continue to consolidate, and we will also look very carefully at the overall portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Ewout, it's Andrew. Could you just tell us how M&A revenues in dollars contributed to MI, Mobility, Ratings and overall in the third quarter?\nEwout Steenbergen: Of course, Andrew, and I had expected you to ask about organic constant currency revenue. So let me first give that number. That was 10.4% for the quarter. Specifically for Market Intelligence, 7; for Ratings, 18.5; Mobility 8.2; Commodities, 10.9; and Indices, 5.8. In terms of adjustments with respect to acquisitions, there was $3.8 million of correction for Market Intelligence, given the acquisitions we have done there. And for Mobility, $5.6 million. And then there was a correction for Engineering Solutions from last year of $96 million. So if you combine that with the FX impact, which you can find in the supplemental deck, you would come to that organic constant currency growth of 10.4. And as you and I are very much in agreement, that is a very healthy basis to look at the real performance of the divisions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: So your Investor Day was a little less than a year ago, and I'm just curious, can you just compare how you felt about some of the businesses then compared to how you feel about them now? Anything better or worse compared to that time period?\nDoug Peterson: Jeff, this is Doug. Well, let me take a step back again. And if you recall, we had our Investor Day. It was 1 year ago almost. It's on December 1, 2022. At that time, we laid out our new vision Powering Global Markets and the 5 pillars that we use to manage the business as well as allocate capital. At that time, we put in place longer-term '25, '26 targets for revenue growth and for margins. We're well on track for all of those. And we also laid out at the time some really interesting and for us, ambitious targets for new products and new services. And we also feel really confident about what we're seeing. We feel like we targeted and have identified the most important secular trends and market trends and that we're growing in that direction. There's excellent reception for that. So 1 year in, almost 1 year into those targets, we're very confident about achieving them, and we're really excited about our prospects.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Just one for Martina. I would love to hear just your thoughts a little bit more on some of the performance in Ratings in the context of the private credit market. And then maybe also some of your thoughts on where you think the private credit market is heading relative to public debt markets and how the company can further play in that space.\nMartina Cheung: Scott, thanks so much for the question. Just reflecting the prior question as well when we did the IR Day, I said that 2 points. One is that the private markets were not going away in the sense that they were going to continue to grow. And the second is that we saw that as an opportunity. And both things have played out as expected this year. We're very pleased with our overall performance from a Ratings standpoint in the private markets. It comes in the form of a couple of areas, so increased demand for fund ratings. There's been a real healthy pipeline, lot of dialogue with the sponsors and fund managers. We've also seen quite a bit of demand on the structured credit front, which we had highlighted as a key trend that we thought we would see, and that has certainly played out this year. And as we see the overall AUM and allocation to the asset class increase, we're very well positioned. We're out in the market with credit estimates, portfolio assessments, et cetera, with our Ratings team and then having really, really great dialogue with the market participants. So very pleased from a Ratings standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: A lot of really good color on new product development. Vitality Index is ticking higher. Growth there is good. I'm just curious and I don't know if this is one that you can quantify, but just how much of that is a result of investments in product development on the gen AI side? Or is that something that can create kind of a new leg of accelerated growth as you continue to kind of harvest your investments there?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Andrew. And we are very happy that you are recognizing the level of innovation, the level of entrepreneurship, the level [Audio Gap] company. We're very happy and pleased around that. If you think about the background of this, this is coming from, first of all, the merger. The merger gives us a lot of benefit in combining products, features, data sets, platform, capabilities. And that is really driving a part of it. Second part of it is really the investments we're making, strategic growth initiatives. And we're really pleased with what we're seeing in sustainability, energy transition, private markets and several other areas that fall out of that but are also very entrepreneurial. You see growth in areas in Indices like thematics, factor-based. We launched something that is called more the credit fix. We have car listings in Mobility and many other areas. So generally, investments in growth initiatives are really starting to pay off. And that is ultimately then also showing up in the Vitality Index, which is something that is maybe unique as a metric. And we're, as far as we know, the only company in our industry publishing this, but it is a clear indication of innovation that we would like to publish. With respect to AI and gen AI, it's powering many of the products that we are having, but it is more embedded. I wouldn't say the new really gen AI features that it is really in the number so far because most of those products are still under development. And we will get back to you once we are really at a production-grade level kind of offering that we can bring to our customers. So I think it's a little bit too early for the impact of gen AI, but more to come on that over the next few quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: You narrowed the guidance for revenue growth in Market Intelligence with the midpoint unchanged at 7%. Does that suggest stabilizing trends in your sustainability and energy transition business? And how are broader client budget and spending trends in the segment performing?\nEwout Steenbergen: Generally, George, this is coming from multiple drivers within Market Intelligence, not only from sustainability and energy transition. So first of all, the core business is strong. We see healthy growth. We see a good sales momentum. We see that the ACV book is really growing a little bit faster than actually the revenue we are reporting, for example, in Desktop. And as you know, ACV is an early indicator of future revenues. So we're really, really pleased by that. Also, the revenue synergies are becoming more meaningful at this moment. So that really helps to contribute growth. The capital markets volumes are stabilizing. We don't see a lot of pickup of M&A yet. But last year, it was really a headwind, and that headwind is going away. And then also the comps become more easy, for example, from an FX perspective. And then you're right, sustainability and several other factors drive here the growth as well. So we are actually really positive about the outlook for Market Intelligence growth in the fourth quarter and implicitly what you're seeing in our guidance range is that we would expect further acceleration of the growth of the top line of Market Intelligence in the next quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.\nCraig Huber: Yes. Could you just update us, please, on where you're sitting at right now for the synergies for IHS, both the cost and the revenue synergy, what that run rate is now at year-end and where you aspire to be versus your original expectations?\nEwout Steenbergen: If you think about the cost synergies, we have raised those twice over the last period, as you know. So the $600 million is the target that we're aiming for. We're almost done. We are effectively done. There are a few more projects that will be finalized at year-end. That is just purely timing of some of those projects, and then we will be able to declare that we hit the $600 million. And then we won't talk about cost synergies anymore from that point onwards because cost synergies are also related to operational integration. And we are more or less running the company now as a fully combined company. We're not talking about one part versus the other part anymore. So it's good to close off cost synergies and really think about the company as one company going forward. That doesn't mean that we will stop with efficiency and productivity programs. Obviously, we have a track record to always look for new opportunities, and we will get back to you at that point in time with new updates. From a revenue synergy perspective, we actually like the progress that we have made during the third quarter. It's quite a big step to $112 million of run rate. We're getting now close to 1/3 of the overall target. We have always said that is a 5-year trajectory to get to $350 million, more a focus in the first part on cross-sell. Most of what you see now reported as revenue synergies is coming from cross-sell. But we have these new products that are being launched, and those new products will help with the next phase of revenue synergy delivery. So we feel we're right on track. We're really on the right path to deliver on the $350 million. So we feel very good about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nSeth Weber: I just wanted to ask about the reacceleration in the sustainability and energy transition business. Last quarter, you talked about some uncertainty with the regulatory landscape and political climate, et cetera. I mean, can you just frame -- the numbers seem to be back on track here. Has anything really changed? Or is it just more adoption of new products or customers just getting more used to the new normal? Or maybe just any perspective on that?\nMartina Cheung: Seth, it's Martina. I can take that question. Yes, very pleased with the Q3 results. We saw about 55% growth in Trucost and about 37% in CI. But the growth was actually across all divisions. So we saw inflows into the core climate and sustainability indices, for example, in S&P Dow Jones and really strong demand for the Mobility energy transition products as well as the FPOs in Ratings. So really great progress and momentum across the board. Look, I think the key thing here and we've been saying this for quite some time, firstly, the long-term drivers and the needs in this business have not changed, notwithstanding some of the, call it, the minor slowdowns that we may have seen in the past year for various different reasons. Customers, corporations still need to look at operational risk in their supply chains. They still need to report against their net zero transition plans. If they're exposed in any way to Europe, they have to report against some pretty complicated regulations there, for example. We still have banks who are looking at finance emissions and looking to deploy capital into sustainability. And we have asset owners and asset managers who are obviously either looking for alpha or looking to allocate to the asset class. And so fundamentals haven't changed. We believe we have the best, most comprehensive and deep offerings in this area across all of our businesses. Commodity Insights is a leader in energy transition analytics and advisory, for example. But one of the other things that I would say is -- and this is just what's so exciting to me around sustainability with the merger, we are launching products now bringing together some of the most unique and fantastic IP across the division. So the real asset data that we have launched brings together data from Mobility, Commodity Insights, Market Intelligence and Sustainable1. And it's going to be a real powerhouse in that area going forward as we see more and more needs for much more specific emissions transition, biodiversity and nature data at the real asset level. So that's just one example. Super excited going forward and very pleased with Q3. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Could you please add more color on the strength in private market and also iLEVEL? Where is the demand coming from? I mean, did you take shares from your competitor or your product can automate a process and replace in wholesale?\nDoug Peterson: Owen, this is Doug. Let me take that. Let me start by taking a step back and talking about what we're seeing is this really interesting and very rapid transformation of the private markets. If you go back 25, 30 years ago, private markets was just private equity. It was LBOs. It's private equity. But over the last 25 years and it's accelerating the last 3 or 4 is many, many different asset classes, many different strategies on the asset side. And on the investor side, you also see a whole diversification of the types of investors that have gone into private markets and private credit, which started obviously with pension funds and insurance companies, endowments and add to that now private wealth individuals even. So you see a completely different need for data and analytics across those areas. And as an example, this -- a lot of this is brand-new volume. It's not necessarily you're taking market share from anybody. You're finding new applications to bring to the market to provide the information both to the GPs and the LPs, but also to now even investors at a different level, the private market investors and individual investors. So we see that the kinds of tools that we're bringing, for instance, the iLEVEL software, which you mentioned, this provides a data service. It provides transparency to the market. It gives you more frequent information about the portfolio than you might see from what was coming directly from the GPs themselves. We also have products which we believe are going to be applied in the future from our DVA area, which includes information about pricing. It brings a whole new level of transparency and timeliness to being able to provide pricing and information about the portfolios. We know that investors, especially from some of those sophisticated institutional investors, they want to look across their portfolios and have mark-to-market, look at concentrations. They want to look at limits. They want to manage their portfolios in a way that they need much more granular data in the area. So we think this is going to be one of our most interesting highest growth areas. And so you asked where it's coming from. It's new demand. It's new opportunities, and it's ways we can bring together multiple products in our portfolio to meet the needs and the solutions of both sides of the equation, the investors and the asset managers. Thanks for the question, Owen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\nRussell Quelch: I wanted to focus on the Indices business, please. We've seen some interesting new product launches from you in the last quarter. And I'm wondering if you can give us some more detail on the pipe of new products in this area, mainly kind of what areas should we expect you to the focused growth? Are we thinking climate indices, derivatives, fixed income or where you've had some good product launches in the last quarter, but what more is there to come? I was also hoping you could explain how mix impacts revenue growth in this business, particularly in respect to asset class, please?\nDoug Peterson: Russell, let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ewout to talk a little bit about the expenses and what we're seeing on the financial side. But right now, there's also a lot of changes going on in the asset management industry. I just talked about what's happening with the private market side. But at the same time, industries like traditional asset management, we see the shift from active to passive, and what that plays to is one of our strengths. And you asked about the type of products which are coming out. Our [one set] is related to sustainability. There's a whole type of new interest going on. And maybe a few years ago, that was more of ESG. Now it's tending more towards climate and energy transition. We see it with, for instance, our own across divisional index, which is related to battery metals. We also see a lot of interest in the climate -- Paris Accord climate transition indices. So there's a whole set of indices that we've been launching, in particular for European investors and with European asset managers related to climate. We also see a set of indices which are across or multi-asset class industries, which allows us to take advantage of what we have from S&P Global from our Index business, traditional S&P 500 and other equity indices. You bring that along with the credit and fixed income indices that came with IHS Markit, that's a whole new asset class for us is to be able to provide a multi-asset class with the credit aspect to it, credit volatility. There's another set of products which are related to exchange-traded derivatives. They're not direct indices, but there's a lot more interest in risk management and hedging and trading strategies. And with our core foundation and our relationships with CBOE and CME, we're able to develop a whole new set of ETDs. And we've seen strong growth in that area as well. So across the board, it's climate. It's multi-asset class. It's factors. It's a whole set of different types of indices on the fixed income side. And then it's also exchange-traded derivatives and new approaches to products, which we've already been developing there. But let me hand it over to Ewout to give a little bit more color on the numbers.\nEwout Steenbergen: Russell, specifically your question about mix and mix shift, we are very pleased to see that the AUM fees are up again this quarter and that the AUM levels and the AUM fees are again correlated in the same direction. But a couple of more detailed comments I want to make there is first, as we have said many times, please keep in mind that if you look at AUM fees, there are also other categories going into the mix. It's not only ETFs. There's also mutual funds. There are insurance funds. There are OTC volumes, and all of them grew a little bit less than the average AUM levels of ETFs. So that is one part why you will see always a little bit of a discrepancy between AUM levels for ETFs and the fees. Secondly, the trends that we talked to you about last quarter of the mix shift is continuing. What we are seeing is that the market is a bit risk off that there is a move from more specialty ETFs to more flagship ETFs. Our flagship ETFs are taking in a lot of flows, very positive flows we had this quarter. But those funds are more lower level of basis point fees. We think this is a current market trend situation that will refer us again at some point in time when the market will be more risk on and there's more interest in the specialty ETFs. But this is a mix shift trend that we're still seeing continuing also in the third quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolas. Your line is open.\nAdam Parrington: This is Adam Parrington for Shlomo. September issuance trends were strong. Do you see that as a start of an improving trend or more indicative of companies rushing to get financing ahead of further rate increases, given the sharp rate movements we saw in September?\nMartina Cheung: Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, look, September was higher than we expected for sure. And we do believe that some of that was essentially pulled forward from Q4. Having said that, I think there's a number of additional factors here that are important to think about Q4 and onwards. And some of those are some that I had referenced earlier. Do we, for example -- will we see some issuers actually pull forward from '24 in Q4 of this year, something we're tracking. And as I mentioned earlier, we're also looking at the amend and extend activity in the bank loan space, which was very strong in Q3 as well as some of the refinancing in bank loans as well. So a lot of factors. The sort of net new factor there, of course, as well is the geopolitical overhang that we have to continue to watch. So overall, we take a prudent look for Q4 and the usual factors that we watch going into next year, we have a handle on all of those as well. One other point that I would just add, and this is something that I think is important since it's a good indicator longer term is the flow of funds into fixed income funds. Q3, for example, into high yield and leveraged loan funds was a net positive. So that's a good thing, good indicator. Through the first half of the year, we saw the inflows back into fixed income funds overall against the huge net outflow from last year. So these are things that we have to continue to watch go into Q4 and into next year. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: There was a comment about an improving relative position in CLOs. Martina, how much of that was just about retaining capacity through -- in headcount through a challenging market versus what else are you doing? And are there any kind of like IHS synergy benefits? And then just quickly, Ewout, if you can address what drove the lower tax rate? And if there's any sort of like structural carryforward benefit from whatever is driving it beyond '23?\nMartina Cheung: Jeff, thanks so much for the question. Actually, we saw an improvement across a number of the sub-asset classes in structured finance overall. And we're just, frankly, very, very pleased. Certainly, a lot of this is related to additional investments in capacity. And what I have been saying and will continue to say it's not just about capacity. It's about the strength and the expertise and the talent. And that is really incredibly important in these asset classes. The overall asset class is also experiencing some growth in part driven by the private credit issuers. And we've made sure that we have been on the street talking to everybody we need to talk to, making sure that all of the issuers are aware of the talent and the capacity that we have and we continue to remain highly relevant in this space. I would say just very pleased with the execution from the team so far this year in this area.\nEwout Steenbergen: And just to the second part of your question, our effective tax rate is lower in the quarter, primarily due to some new guidance came out during this quarter with respect to the way how to apply foreign tax credits would help impact our medium-term outlook with respect to the tax rate.\nOperator: We will now take our final question from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your may ask your question.\nHeather Balsky: I actually wanted to ask a question about the Commodity Insights business. And if you can just talk about the drivers that you expect to, I guess, help you maintain your current level of growth? And just help put in perspective how much commodity prices do or do not impact the growth in that business.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Heather. This is Doug. Well, first of all, when we look at this industry, it's being driven by incredible amount of transformation. We talked earlier in a different context about energy transition. And you take what are the traditional oil, gas commodity products, which we have a very strong position in both from price benchmarks as well as news research and analytics. And we announced that we have just launched this Platts Connect, which is a platform where we take the 2 services from what had been Platts and would have been ENR from IHS Markit and put them together in a single platform. That means that we can continue to serve all of the traditional markets in a way with a very high-quality platform with -- it's easy to use, it's easy to search on. We'll be enhancing it with AI tools over time. And so that's just the beginning of where we already see the traditional markets growing. And we're able to serve them better and faster in ways that are much more compelling all the time. And that into that, that there's a mix of new commodities, new energy sources. There's areas like the metals, which are used for energy transition, that we already have a position in that we're getting stronger all the time. And then you have the energy transition products related to things like carbon intensity, carbon markets, how we look at the transportation related to that, the infrastructure that's related to that. And then on top of that, there's an incredible amount of synergies across all of S&P Global with S1, for example, with new data sets, which are being added to the Marketplace and Market Intelligence, new data sets, which can be added to Cap IQ Pro. So we look at this as a business that is in the right place at a time when the markets need transparency. They need comparability. They need high-quality data, and they need it delivered in a way that's easy for them to use. And they can build it into their workflow. So we're really, really very pleased with our progress, and this is a business that we're going to continue to invest in. So thank you very much, Heather. And let me just give a couple of closing remarks. I want to, first of all, thank everyone for joining the call today and your excellent questions, as always. I'm really proud, as you can hear, about the progress we've made with the merger with IHS Markit and all of the integration that's taking place. And now we're able to talk more and more about the revenue side and the product launches. And you saw them this quarter with Platts Connect and into the insights, and there's a lot more to come. And this is combining the best across both businesses to create the new S&P Global. I also want to thank Martina for providing her perspective today, and thank you for joining us. And as always, I want to thank our people for a great quarter. Their excitement and passion continue to inspire me personally and want to thank all of them for what they do. So again, thank you for joining the call today, and have a great day. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes this morning's call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Martina Cheung",
            "content": "Thanks very much for the question. It's Martina here. Yes, very pleased with Q3 overall. As you have seen, our billed issuance was up 21% and a very, very strong September. In high yields, we were very pleased to see it was about 150% growth in issuance overall year-over-year in the quarter, and high yields year-to-date is up about 50% rated issuance in the market. We see strong refi activity there in Q3 and looking to see more of that as we go forward, certainly into next year. It's -- Q3 marked, I think, a notable point in terms of issuers willing to come back and tap the market for high yields. And then on bank loans, as we said before, we didn't have heroic assumptions on bank loan volumes for this year. Overall, while we saw an increase in Q3 year-over-year, we're still down year-over-year, year-to-date in bank loan issuance. There, we saw a lot of refinancing. Interestingly, a very strong trend this year that we saw in Q3 and are monitoring closely going forward is a lot of amend to extend activity -- or amend and extend activity rather in the bank loan space. And that's been a boost in that area from an issuance standpoint. For '24, obviously, we're not commenting yet for '24. We'll certainly give more on that in February. But the factors that we're watching closely, refinancing walls are very healthy. Our last midyear report on refinancing showed the 5-year total's up about 11%. And between now and '26, we see about $8 trillion in refinancing. So that's something that we watch closely, and that's a very robust growth in that area. But we also are looking at usual factors, the macroeconomic factors, certainly heightened geopolitical uncertainty. M&A has not been great this year. As we've seen, it's been down by quite a bit this year. So we're looking to see that come back in next year as well. And just the other point that I would make on -- as we're looking ahead in the next several quarters is that CP balances or commercial paper balances are quite high. So that could lead to some issuance if we see corporates transitioning from CP to fixed income. And we've commented in the past that we continue to see corporate cash balances at pre-pandemic levels, which we think will continue to boost the need for issuance as well. Thanks, Toni, for the question. I give a couple of comments on this. Certainly, we would look at the differences between market issuance and billed issuance. And I think Doug and Ewout cover that routinely in terms of how to assess our performance specifically. For us, the billed issuance data in Q3 was strong for a number of reasons. Firstly, it's a bit of a mix question. So high yield, more bank loans, less frequent issuer compared year-over-year, which is just a function of when the high-yield and leverage loan issuers tap the market. I would also say we're extremely pleased with the progress and momentum that we have in a number of asset classes. When we talked to you last year at Investor Day, we said we were making investments in structured finance. We were making investments in infrastructure. We had acquired Shades of Green and making investment in SPO. And we've seen really robust performance in all of those areas, which we had tagged and very, very pleased to see those results. Scott, thanks so much for the question. Just reflecting the prior question as well when we did the IR Day, I said that 2 points. One is that the private markets were not going away in the sense that they were going to continue to grow. And the second is that we saw that as an opportunity. And both things have played out as expected this year. We're very pleased with our overall performance from a Ratings standpoint in the private markets. It comes in the form of a couple of areas, so increased demand for fund ratings. There's been a real healthy pipeline, lot of dialogue with the sponsors and fund managers. We've also seen quite a bit of demand on the structured credit front, which we had highlighted as a key trend that we thought we would see, and that has certainly played out this year. And as we see the overall AUM and allocation to the asset class increase, we're very well positioned. We're out in the market with credit estimates, portfolio assessments, et cetera, with our Ratings team and then having really, really great dialogue with the market participants. So very pleased from a Ratings standpoint. Seth, it's Martina. I can take that question. Yes, very pleased with the Q3 results. We saw about 55% growth in Trucost and about 37% in CI. But the growth was actually across all divisions. So we saw inflows into the core climate and sustainability indices, for example, in S&P Dow Jones and really strong demand for the Mobility energy transition products as well as the FPOs in Ratings. So really great progress and momentum across the board. Look, I think the key thing here and we've been saying this for quite some time, firstly, the long-term drivers and the needs in this business have not changed, notwithstanding some of the, call it, the minor slowdowns that we may have seen in the past year for various different reasons. Customers, corporations still need to look at operational risk in their supply chains. They still need to report against their net zero transition plans. If they're exposed in any way to Europe, they have to report against some pretty complicated regulations there, for example. We still have banks who are looking at finance emissions and looking to deploy capital into sustainability. And we have asset owners and asset managers who are obviously either looking for alpha or looking to allocate to the asset class. And so fundamentals haven't changed. We believe we have the best, most comprehensive and deep offerings in this area across all of our businesses. Commodity Insights is a leader in energy transition analytics and advisory, for example. But one of the other things that I would say is -- and this is just what's so exciting to me around sustainability with the merger, we are launching products now bringing together some of the most unique and fantastic IP across the division. So the real asset data that we have launched brings together data from Mobility, Commodity Insights, Market Intelligence and Sustainable1. And it's going to be a real powerhouse in that area going forward as we see more and more needs for much more specific emissions transition, biodiversity and nature data at the real asset level. So that's just one example. Super excited going forward and very pleased with Q3. Thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, look, September was higher than we expected for sure. And we do believe that some of that was essentially pulled forward from Q4. Having said that, I think there's a number of additional factors here that are important to think about Q4 and onwards. And some of those are some that I had referenced earlier. Do we, for example -- will we see some issuers actually pull forward from '24 in Q4 of this year, something we're tracking. And as I mentioned earlier, we're also looking at the amend and extend activity in the bank loan space, which was very strong in Q3 as well as some of the refinancing in bank loans as well. So a lot of factors. The sort of net new factor there, of course, as well is the geopolitical overhang that we have to continue to watch. So overall, we take a prudent look for Q4 and the usual factors that we watch going into next year, we have a handle on all of those as well. One other point that I would just add, and this is something that I think is important since it's a good indicator longer term is the flow of funds into fixed income funds. Q3, for example, into high yield and leveraged loan funds was a net positive. So that's a good thing, good indicator. Through the first half of the year, we saw the inflows back into fixed income funds overall against the huge net outflow from last year. So these are things that we have to continue to watch go into Q4 and into next year. Thanks for the question. Jeff, thanks so much for the question. Actually, we saw an improvement across a number of the sub-asset classes in structured finance overall. And we're just, frankly, very, very pleased. Certainly, a lot of this is related to additional investments in capacity. And what I have been saying and will continue to say it's not just about capacity. It's about the strength and the expertise and the talent. And that is really incredibly important in these asset classes. The overall asset class is also experiencing some growth in part driven by the private credit issuers. And we've made sure that we have been on the street talking to everybody we need to talk to, making sure that all of the issuers are aware of the talent and the capacity that we have and we continue to remain highly relevant in this space. I would say just very pleased with the execution from the team so far this year in this area."

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. This was an exciting quarter for S&P Global as we saw growth accelerate across all 5 of our divisions, and revenue and margins both outperformed our internal expectations. Adjusted earnings per share increased 10% year-over-year. While reported revenue grew 8%, this actually understates the accomplishments of the team during the third quarter because excluding Engineering Solutions and the small tuck-ins done earlier this year, revenue growth was an impressive 11%. We also expanded adjusted margins by 100 basis points and reduced our fully diluted share count by 4% year-over-year. As you saw in the press release earlier this morning, we plan to continue share count reduction with the launch of an incremental $1.3 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the coming weeks. Revenue in the quarter was driven by growth across all divisions, led by outperformance in our Ratings division, which benefited from elevated issuance activity in the high-yield and bank loan markets. While the environment remains unpredictable for the debt markets, we saw stronger issuance volume throughout the third quarter than we expected, particularly in September. Adjusted expenses were up 6% year-over-year, while the adjusted operating income increased 10%. Acceleration is further demonstrated by our strategic growth initiatives. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 36% to $78 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand in climate and physical risk products and our energy transition products. As Doug highlighted earlier, we're fulfilling our customer needs for raw data and reporting capabilities around sustainability and energy transition, and this is evident by the third quarter growth. This acceleration reconfirms our continued optimism around the long-term potential of this important part of our growth. Moving to Private Market Solutions. We saw revenue increase by 18% year-over-year to $109 million, driven by strong growth in Market Intelligence private market software solutions, including iLEVEL and a return to strong growth in Ratings private market revenue as bond issuance and private credit estimate activity both improved in the quarter. We're also encouraged by the demand we're seeing in our private market valuation and benchmark offerings. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, was $369 million in the third quarter, representing a 22% increase compared to prior year. Importantly, Vitality revenue represented 12% of our total revenue in the quarter, making it the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our Vitality Index score. Now turning to synergies. In the third quarter of 2023, we recognized $149 million of expense savings due to cost synergies, and our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $588 million. We expect to complete our cost synergy program by year-end with a run rate of approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $25 million in synergies achieved in the third quarter and an annualized run rate of $112 million. Turning to expense growth. We are pleased to see that our efforts to optimize our portfolio and deliver cost synergies offset most of the year-over-year expense growth in the third quarter. Our total expenses increased less than 6% year-over-year, though we continue to see some inflationary pressure on compensation expense. Due to the decisive expense actions we took last year, the reset of incentive compensation this year continues to contribute meaningfully to expense growth, though we do not expect any further headwinds from this going forward. We are confident that we continue to strike the appropriate balance between disciplined expense management and investing in our business as evidenced by the volume of new products coming to the market this year and our expectation to deliver more than 100 basis points of adjusted margin expansion for the full year at the midpoint of our guidance range. Now let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 8%, driven by strong growth in Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions. Desktop grew 5% in the third quarter, driven by strong subscription growth as ACV growth continued to outpace revenue growth, partially offset by modest softness in onetime sales. Renewal rates continue to remain strong in the mid- to high 90s range. Data & Advisory Solutions and Enterprise Solutions each grew by 9% in the quarter, benefiting from double-digit growth in subscription-based offerings. Credit & Risk Solutions continues to see strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products as well as continued double-digit growth in credit analytics. Adjusted expenses increased 9% year-over-year, primarily due to compensation expense. Operating profit increased 6%, and the operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 33.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins improved 140 basis points. As we progress through the fourth quarter, we expect continued acceleration in revenue growth as we move into the most favorable comparison quarter for the year. Furthermore, we see the business continuing to benefit from the launch of new products and monetization of cross-sell referrals as part of the division's overall revenue synergy program. As a result, we are tightening our full year guidance for revenue growth by 100 basis points to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% while reaffirming our full year margin outlook. Now turning to Ratings. In the third quarter, we saw continued improvements in issuance activity, particularly due to refinancing in the bank loan and high-yield markets. Revenue increased 20% year-over-year, well above our internal expectations. However, growth was helped by a $19 million cumulative catch-up for customers' self-reported commercial paper issuance in nontransaction revenue, which primarily benefited structured finance. Excluding this impact, Ratings would have grown approximately 17% in the third quarter. Transaction revenue grew 34% in the third quarter, driven primarily by growth in bank loan and high-yield issuance. Nontransaction revenue increased 13%, primarily due to an increase in annual fees, which includes the catch-up revenue I mentioned previously as well as growth in Ratings Evaluation Service activity and at CRISIL. Excluding the impact of the catch-up revenue, nontransaction revenue would have grown approximately 8%. Adjusted expenses increased 18%, primarily due to the write-down of incentive compensation expense in the year-ago period. This resulted in a 22% increase in operating profit and a 70 basis points increase in operating margin to 56.6%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins are still impacted by the relatively low margins in the fourth quarter of last year. As Doug mentioned, we're tightening our billed issuance growth assumption for 2023 to 5% to 7%. This reflects the outperformance we saw in the third quarter, but also reflects our slightly lower expectation for investment-grade issuance in the fourth quarter relative to our prior forecast. While we expect continued growth in nontransaction, we still see headwinds in issuer credit ratings revenue as fewer new issuers come to the market. As a result, we are increasing Ratings revenue guidance range by 100 basis points, now expecting growth of 6% to 8% for the full year and reiterating our margin guidance. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 11% following a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Upstream data and insights increased approximately 2% year-over-year, benefiting from better-than-expected demand for both content and software as well as slightly improved retention rates. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 12% and 10%, respectively. Growth was driven by continued strength in our benchmark data and insights products. We also continue to see strong commercial momentum in our subscription offerings for both business lines. Advisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 33%, driven by strong trading volumes across all sectors in Global Trading Services and strong performance in advisory revenue in the quarter. The business line continues to benefit from market-driven volumes, but we're also seeing positive results in key areas of strategic investment, including energy transition. Adjusted expenses increased 6%. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 17%, and the operating margin improved 260 basis points to 48.4%. Trailing 12-month margins improved 240 basis points. We continue to see Commodity Insights benefit from strong secular trends around energy transition and sustainability and demand for benchmarks, data and insights. Following this quarter's strong performance, we are raising the low end and tightening Commodity Insights overall revenue guidance range, now expecting growth of 8.5% to 9.5% for the full year. There's no change to our margin guidance. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year. The team continues to execute well with the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the dealer segment and continued growth in new business in the manufacturing and financials and other segments. Dealer revenue increased 30% year-over-year, driven by the continued benefit of price realization within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life and used car subscription products as well as the addition of Market Scan. Manufacturing grew 4% year-over-year, driven by elevated recall activity and continued strength in marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 9% as the business line continues to see healthy underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment similar to last quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, driven primarily by increased incentive compensation expense, but also due to the inorganic contribution to expenses from the Market Scan acquisition. This resulted in a 10% increase in adjusted operating profit and 20 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 100 basis points. We expect continued strong growth in used car subscription products as we progress through the fourth quarter. We also expect Mobility to continue to benefit from dealerships and OEMs increasing their incentive spend on new vehicles as affordability is hampered by rising rates. As a result, we are narrowing our guidance for revenue growth to a range of 9% to 10% for the full year. There is no change to our margin guidance. Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 6%, primarily due to gains in exchange-traded derivative volumes and asset-linked fees. We're very pleased to see asset-linked fees return to positive revenue growth in the third quarter. Revenues were up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher ETF AUM, which benefits from both market depreciation and net inflows but was partially offset by mix shift into lower-priced products, continuing the pattern from last quarter. Exchange-traded derivative volume increased 18%, primarily driven by an approximately 20% increase in S&P 500 Index options volume. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 2% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses increased 9% year-over-year, with the majority of the increase driven by the write-down of incentive compensation in the year-ago period. Operating profit in Indices increased 5%, and the operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 69.4%. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 80 basis points. There's no change to our revenue outlook for Indices. However, as a result of the continued cost discipline and outperformance year-to-date, we're increasing our margin guidance for the division to a range of 68% to 69% for the full year. Now let's move to the latest views from our economists, who are forecasting global GDP growth of 3.1% in 2023. While outlooks vary somewhat by region, our economists are forecasting a period of subdued global growth fueled by higher-for-longer rates with a soft landing base case assumption as we move through the first half of next year. We continue to expect inflation to remain above the target rates of central banks and energy commodity prices such as crude oil to remain above the historical averages as well. For the full year, we assume Brent crude will average approximately $84 per barrel, slightly higher than our last estimate as we expect Brent grew to average $88 in the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our guidance. This slide represents our GAAP guidance for headline metrics. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the results through the third quarter as well as our most recent views on the macroeconomic environment and market conditions. We're narrowing our expectations for total revenue growth to a range of 4.5% to 5.5% for the full year to reflect the changes discussed earlier on our divisional revenue outlook. Furthermore, we are maintaining our operating profit margin guidance of 45.5% to 46.5% with the expectation that we will achieve full year margins close to the midpoint of the range. We have provided the granular guidance on corporate and allocated expense, deal-related amortization, interest expense and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site. This includes a 50 basis point reduction in our adjusted effective tax rate to a range of 20.5% to 21.5%. As a result of this quarter's strong performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're increasing and tightening our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $12.50 to $12.60. The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously. In conclusion, our business has demonstrated exceptional growth across divisions this quarter, while we continue to manage expenses prudently. Furthermore, I'm pleased with the progress being made across our cost synergy initiatives and growth across revenue synergies as we see more and more new products coming to the market that would have been impossible without the merger. The teams have done a truly excellent job executing on our key strategic initiatives while still driving profitable growth across all divisions this quarter, and we look forward to delivering a strong finish to 2023. And with that, I would like to invite Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. And we'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. A couple of comments on this. First, if we look back at last year, we took very decisive actions in terms of pulling back expenses when the market turns more south in the second and the third quarter in several areas, among which also incentive compensation. So we have some difficult comps for this year. Having said that, number two, point number two, we acknowledge that MI can do better with margins. And we're seeing several opportunities to expand margins as we have also guidance for the full year and implicitly for the fourth quarter. So that brings me to my third point is that we expect margins actually to improve significantly beginning with the next quarter due to the easier compare but also due to several management actions that we are putting in place, including tight management of headcount and other expenses, while we still continue to invest in growth and other strategic initiatives. Yes, of course. First of all, I would like to comment that if we think about expenses, we have a very volatile comp in 2022. So it has moved around a lot in the quarters last year due to the good reason that we put back very hard, and we're very on top of expense management when we had the difficult markets last year. This year, actually, our trends are far more stable. So year-over-year, there is a lot of noise, but I think this year actually from a pattern perspective looks much better. I think if you look at corrected expenses actually and if you take out Engineering Solutions, we are having expense growth that is below revenue growth. So we're seeing nice healthy margin expense -- margin expansion if you correct for those same items, particularly for Engineering Solutions. We're very happy to see how expenses and margins have developed in Commodity Insights. You have seen some very nice margin expansion there as well as if we think about incentive compensation swing year-over-year, if you would correct for that, actually we're looking at quite modest expense growth in Ratings, Mobility and Indices as well. For the full year, we are expecting for this full year 2023 expense growth in the low single-digit level. So implicitly, if you then would look at the fourth quarter, expenses should be down in a low single-digit level in order to get to that overall guidance range. Of course, Andrew, and I had expected you to ask about organic constant currency revenue. So let me first give that number. That was 10.4% for the quarter. Specifically for Market Intelligence, 7; for Ratings, 18.5; Mobility 8.2; Commodities, 10.9; and Indices, 5.8. In terms of adjustments with respect to acquisitions, there was $3.8 million of correction for Market Intelligence, given the acquisitions we have done there. And for Mobility, $5.6 million. And then there was a correction for Engineering Solutions from last year of $96 million. So if you combine that with the FX impact, which you can find in the supplemental deck, you would come to that organic constant currency growth of 10.4. And as you and I are very much in agreement, that is a very healthy basis to look at the real performance of the divisions. Thank you, Andrew. And we are very happy that you are recognizing the level of innovation, the level of entrepreneurship, the level [Audio Gap] company. We're very happy and pleased around that. If you think about the background of this, this is coming from, first of all, the merger. The merger gives us a lot of benefit in combining products, features, data sets, platform, capabilities. And that is really driving a part of it. Second part of it is really the investments we're making, strategic growth initiatives. And we're really pleased with what we're seeing in sustainability, energy transition, private markets and several other areas that fall out of that but are also very entrepreneurial. You see growth in areas in Indices like thematics, factor-based. We launched something that is called more the credit fix. We have car listings in Mobility and many other areas. So generally, investments in growth initiatives are really starting to pay off. And that is ultimately then also showing up in the Vitality Index, which is something that is maybe unique as a metric. And we're, as far as we know, the only company in our industry publishing this, but it is a clear indication of innovation that we would like to publish. With respect to AI and gen AI, it's powering many of the products that we are having, but it is more embedded. I wouldn't say the new really gen AI features that it is really in the number so far because most of those products are still under development. And we will get back to you once we are really at a production-grade level kind of offering that we can bring to our customers. So I think it's a little bit too early for the impact of gen AI, but more to come on that over the next few quarters. Generally, George, this is coming from multiple drivers within Market Intelligence, not only from sustainability and energy transition. So first of all, the core business is strong. We see healthy growth. We see a good sales momentum. We see that the ACV book is really growing a little bit faster than actually the revenue we are reporting, for example, in Desktop. And as you know, ACV is an early indicator of future revenues. So we're really, really pleased by that. Also, the revenue synergies are becoming more meaningful at this moment. So that really helps to contribute growth. The capital markets volumes are stabilizing. We don't see a lot of pickup of M&A yet. But last year, it was really a headwind, and that headwind is going away. And then also the comps become more easy, for example, from an FX perspective. And then you're right, sustainability and several other factors drive here the growth as well. So we are actually really positive about the outlook for Market Intelligence growth in the fourth quarter and implicitly what you're seeing in our guidance range is that we would expect further acceleration of the growth of the top line of Market Intelligence in the next quarter. If you think about the cost synergies, we have raised those twice over the last period, as you know. So the $600 million is the target that we're aiming for. We're almost done. We are effectively done. There are a few more projects that will be finalized at year-end. That is just purely timing of some of those projects, and then we will be able to declare that we hit the $600 million. And then we won't talk about cost synergies anymore from that point onwards because cost synergies are also related to operational integration. And we are more or less running the company now as a fully combined company. We're not talking about one part versus the other part anymore. So it's good to close off cost synergies and really think about the company as one company going forward. That doesn't mean that we will stop with efficiency and productivity programs. Obviously, we have a track record to always look for new opportunities, and we will get back to you at that point in time with new updates. From a revenue synergy perspective, we actually like the progress that we have made during the third quarter. It's quite a big step to $112 million of run rate. We're getting now close to 1/3 of the overall target. We have always said that is a 5-year trajectory to get to $350 million, more a focus in the first part on cross-sell. Most of what you see now reported as revenue synergies is coming from cross-sell. But we have these new products that are being launched, and those new products will help with the next phase of revenue synergy delivery. So we feel we're right on track. We're really on the right path to deliver on the $350 million. So we feel very good about it. Russell, specifically your question about mix and mix shift, we are very pleased to see that the AUM fees are up again this quarter and that the AUM levels and the AUM fees are again correlated in the same direction. But a couple of more detailed comments I want to make there is first, as we have said many times, please keep in mind that if you look at AUM fees, there are also other categories going into the mix. It's not only ETFs. There's also mutual funds. There are insurance funds. There are OTC volumes, and all of them grew a little bit less than the average AUM levels of ETFs. So that is one part why you will see always a little bit of a discrepancy between AUM levels for ETFs and the fees. Secondly, the trends that we talked to you about last quarter of the mix shift is continuing. What we are seeing is that the market is a bit risk off that there is a move from more specialty ETFs to more flagship ETFs. Our flagship ETFs are taking in a lot of flows, very positive flows we had this quarter. But those funds are more lower level of basis point fees. We think this is a current market trend situation that will refer us again at some point in time when the market will be more risk on and there's more interest in the specialty ETFs. But this is a mix shift trend that we're still seeing continuing also in the third quarter. And just to the second part of your question, our effective tax rate is lower in the quarter, primarily due to some new guidance came out during this quarter with respect to the way how to apply foreign tax credits would help impact our medium-term outlook with respect to the tax rate."

            "name": "Doug Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased to report 11% revenue growth in the third quarter, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions. We saw acceleration in revenue growth in every division this quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we took decisive action to protect margins in the second and third quarters last year. And while lapping that impact contributed to our expense growth this quarter, we're pleased to see margins expand approximately 100 basis points despite that headwind. Adjusted EPS increased 10% year-over-year, and we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by approximately $0.10 at the midpoint to reflect the better-than-expected results through the third quarter. Strong financial results like these come as a result of continued innovation and execution, and we're excited about the rapid pace of product launches coming from S&P Global this quarter. We'll be discussing a few of them on the call, but I encourage you to look through the releases available in our online press center to get a better sense of the sheer volume of new products and features we've introduced this quarter. We've seen acceleration in each of the strategic growth areas we've been reporting since our Investor Day. We also saw our Vitality Index reached 12% of total revenue in the quarter as new products continue to generate value for both customers and shareholders. We also made progress on our AI initiatives, which I'll touch on briefly today, but we plan to provide a more holistic update on our progress next quarter. We continue to align our goals and operations against the 5 strategic pillars we introduced at Investor Day. I'm thrilled with what our team was able to deliver for our customers this quarter. As we lean into our customer conversations and continue to provide innovative solutions to the problems that most need solving, our customers are increasingly viewing S&P Global as a trusted strategic partner. In the third quarter, sales cycles were consistent with the longer cycle we've seen in the last few quarters, though we're encouraged that these conversations with customers are often leading to larger deals. In times of market volatility, uncertainty or change, the global markets has learned to count on S&P Global for differentiated data, powerful workflow tools, important insights and unrivaled benchmarks. We're seeing confirmation of our strategic emphasis on private markets as well as sustainability and energy transition as revenue growth accelerated meaningfully in both those areas this quarter. As we continue to engage with customers, we hear clear indications of long-term optimism despite the near-term uncertainty and volatility in the markets. Our conversations with financial institutions, corporates and others generally revolve around interest rates in the short term with everyone interested in identifying peak interest rates. Large maturity walls along with other factors contribute to our optimism about the multiyear growth trajectory for S&P Global. Related to Ratings, global billed issuance saw a very strong third quarter with 21% growth year-over-year. With credit spreads tightening through the third quarter, issuers were more comfortable coming to the market, though refinancing activity continues to drive the majority of issuance. We also saw better-than-expected activity in bank loans particularly around amend and extend transactions, which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter, though perhaps not to the same extent. We also saw our relative position CLOs improve again in the third quarter, marking a continuation of the trend we've seen all year. Vitality revenue is another area of accelerating growth for S&P Global this quarter. Our Vitality revenue metric consists of revenue derived from new or enhanced products. These innovative products contributed 12% of revenue in the third quarter and grew a combined 22% year-over-year, a significant acceleration from the 14% growth last quarter. You'll notice that the largest contributors to our Vitality revenue are unchanged from last quarter. While products can and will move out of the Vitality Index over time as they mature, it's encouraging to see growth from these products remain steady and resilient. We're also encouraged by the early signs of growth and traction among many of the smaller products that will likely scale to be the top contributors in the coming quarters and years, including the trends we see in private markets for more transparency in valuation and benchmark products. I'd like to turn to some of those new product launches now. We're seeing strong cross-divisional collaboration driving new ideas with much of that innovation now turning to generally available products. In the third quarter, we introduced multiple data sets from our Mobility division to our Market Intelligence Marketplace, making crucial vehicle forecast and registration data available via both Xpressfeed and Snowflake. We also launched a new single unified platform that marks the product integration of both Platts and IHS Connect. The new platform is called Platts Connect and allows customers access to a comprehensive range of products, benchmarks, data and insights from one easy-to-use interface on desktop and mobile. These 2 products, Mobility and Marketplace and Platts Connect, also highlight 2 of our early opportunities to integrate new AI capabilities. In the coming months and quarters, we'll be introducing intelligent search and other AI-powered functionality that we're currently developing and testing within Marketplace and Platts Connect. We'll have more details on that as we get closer to launching those new features. We also introduced Entity Insights in the third quarter, which brings data from Sustainable1 to our network and regulatory solutions to power KYC third-party risk management and vendor management within a single workflow tool, leveraging data for 27 million global entities. I also want to provide an update on our development of ChatIQ. As we've shared with you, ChatIQ is a generative AI product developed jointly between Kensho and our Market Intelligence team. During the third quarter, we had a new beta release that we continue to test internally, but this is a step function improvement over our last internal release. Given our strategic focus, I wanted to provide a bit more detail on the acceleration of our sustainability and energy transition products as we expected in the third quarter. Customer needs have evolved away from ESG scores and moved towards climate and energy transition. We believe we are uniquely visioned to win in this market. When we talk to customers, we hear clear trends. Customers don't just need a set of opaque scores. They're building internal sustainability frameworks, and they need high-quality raw data. With Trucost, we have what we believe to be the most robust and comprehensive climate data set in the world. We also offer detailed sustainability data on 17,000 companies, including approximately 3,500 that provide robust granular data through our corporate sustainability assessment survey. Companies are seeking to operationalize the risk management around climate, and we have the largest set of real asset level data available with emissions data and climate hazards mapped to 1.6 million physical assets. We also hear consistently from customers that they need help with energy transition, including developing and executing a viable energy transition strategy. We have solutions that cater to customers in different industries, including our automotive value chain carbon accounting solution and the power evaluator solution for energy transition strategies within the crucial power utility sector. We see this customer need across all industries. So this quarter, we also launched the Sustainability Starter Pack. This is a comprehensive solution to help companies start from scratch or from wherever they may be as they develop sustainability strategies. We help them assess materiality, measure greenhouse gas emissions and develop the reports necessary to comply with disclosure requirements and stakeholder demands. Customers need help generating things like a TCFD report and measuring things like greenhouse gas emissions. They need help benchmarking their own progress against peers, and they need help managing the transition to renewable energy sources. We're confident that S&P Global is unparalleled in its ability to provide both the breadth and the depth of offerings necessary to adequately cover all these areas. We're continually increasing the data that we make available through Xpressfeed, and we're pleased to be adding data sets around net zero commitments and biodiversity before year-end. Clearly, we're meeting customers at their point of need, and that's showing up in our results. Trucost revenue growth accelerated to 55% year-over-year. Energy transition continues to grow nearly 40%. And our total sustainability and energy transition revenue growth accelerated to 36% year-over-year in the third quarter. While we're very encouraged by these results, we will not rest on our laurels. We remain committed to accelerating product leadership in this vital area and look forward to many new exciting products to come in future quarters and years. Of course, our commitment to innovation and customer value also powers our ability to generate value for our shareholders. This is an incredible quarter of accelerating growth. We also continue to demonstrate discipline around expenses as margin expansion in the third quarter helped keep trailing 12-month margins relatively flat year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins improved sequentially from the second quarter, and we expect margins for the full year to expand more than 100 basis points based on the midpoint of our guidance as Ewout will explain in more detail. The economic factors facing the company are largely unchanged as we look to the final few months of 2023. Secular trends continue to serve as strong tailwinds for the company, while cyclical trends can impact different parts of the business in different ways. Despite increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape around things like sustainability and continued uncertainty around the timing of the capital markets recovery, S&P Global remains committed to delivering value in all market conditions. Turning to the conditions of the debt markets. We're tightening the range of our expectations for billed issuance as we now expect growth of 5% to 7% compared to our prior expectations of 4% to 8%. As we've discussed previously, we introduced the billed issuance reporting metric this year as well as a full year forecast to provide context for the issuance assumptions embedded in our Ratings revenue guidance. Billed issuance remains the issuance metric most tightly correlated with our transaction revenue in Ratings. Our latest forecast from the Ratings Research Group now calls for positive market issuance growth for the full year, up from last quarter's expectation for a full year decline. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance with divergence this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign in international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen to go through more details around our financial results and outlook. Ewout? Alex, this is Doug, and thank you for the question. And let me just take a step back to -- for 1 second to a higher level about the integration and the merger overall. We're thrilled with the progress, and you've seen that today with some of the new product launches that we described, which are bringing together information, data research from across the portfolio. And within Market Intelligence, we have the same kind of integration going on. As you know, we always looked at the integration of the integration. We realized that IHS Markit had done a lot of acquisitions. They've grown a lot of products. And one of the opportunities is to continue to consolidate those and put those together. And we see a lot of progress there. This is something you should hold us to and watch us how we're going to continue to bring together the areas. As you know, within Market Intelligence, we've got a lot of opportunities to attack new markets. As an example, corporates, financial services at IHS Markit truly was focused on financial services. A lot of their products are very attractive to corporates. We're finding a lot of opportunities as you'll hear us talk about and you know related to sustainability and private markets. So we look at this opportunity to continue to consolidate the businesses internally, which is going to bring upside from an expense point of view. And we're also going to be investing for growth, especially in areas like sustainability, private markets and then expanding areas like our reference pricing, which can be used in so many different ways. But your thesis is right. We're going to continue to consolidate, and we will also look very carefully at the overall portfolio. Jeff, this is Doug. Well, let me take a step back again. And if you recall, we had our Investor Day. It was 1 year ago almost. It's on December 1, 2022. At that time, we laid out our new vision Powering Global Markets and the 5 pillars that we use to manage the business as well as allocate capital. At that time, we put in place longer-term '25, '26 targets for revenue growth and for margins. We're well on track for all of those. And we also laid out at the time some really interesting and for us, ambitious targets for new products and new services. And we also feel really confident about what we're seeing. We feel like we targeted and have identified the most important secular trends and market trends and that we're growing in that direction. There's excellent reception for that. So 1 year in, almost 1 year into those targets, we're very confident about achieving them, and we're really excited about our prospects. Owen, this is Doug. Let me take that. Let me start by taking a step back and talking about what we're seeing is this really interesting and very rapid transformation of the private markets. If you go back 25, 30 years ago, private markets was just private equity. It was LBOs. It's private equity. But over the last 25 years and it's accelerating the last 3 or 4 is many, many different asset classes, many different strategies on the asset side. And on the investor side, you also see a whole diversification of the types of investors that have gone into private markets and private credit, which started obviously with pension funds and insurance companies, endowments and add to that now private wealth individuals even. So you see a completely different need for data and analytics across those areas. And as an example, this -- a lot of this is brand-new volume. It's not necessarily you're taking market share from anybody. You're finding new applications to bring to the market to provide the information both to the GPs and the LPs, but also to now even investors at a different level, the private market investors and individual investors. So we see that the kinds of tools that we're bringing, for instance, the iLEVEL software, which you mentioned, this provides a data service. It provides transparency to the market. It gives you more frequent information about the portfolio than you might see from what was coming directly from the GPs themselves. We also have products which we believe are going to be applied in the future from our DVA area, which includes information about pricing. It brings a whole new level of transparency and timeliness to being able to provide pricing and information about the portfolios. We know that investors, especially from some of those sophisticated institutional investors, they want to look across their portfolios and have mark-to-market, look at concentrations. They want to look at limits. They want to manage their portfolios in a way that they need much more granular data in the area. So we think this is going to be one of our most interesting highest growth areas. And so you asked where it's coming from. It's new demand. It's new opportunities, and it's ways we can bring together multiple products in our portfolio to meet the needs and the solutions of both sides of the equation, the investors and the asset managers. Thanks for the question, Owen. Russell, let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Ewout to talk a little bit about the expenses and what we're seeing on the financial side. But right now, there's also a lot of changes going on in the asset management industry. I just talked about what's happening with the private market side. But at the same time, industries like traditional asset management, we see the shift from active to passive, and what that plays to is one of our strengths. And you asked about the type of products which are coming out. Our [one set] is related to sustainability. There's a whole type of new interest going on. And maybe a few years ago, that was more of ESG. Now it's tending more towards climate and energy transition. We see it with, for instance, our own across divisional index, which is related to battery metals. We also see a lot of interest in the climate -- Paris Accord climate transition indices. So there's a whole set of indices that we've been launching, in particular for European investors and with European asset managers related to climate. We also see a set of indices which are across or multi-asset class industries, which allows us to take advantage of what we have from S&P Global from our Index business, traditional S&P 500 and other equity indices. You bring that along with the credit and fixed income indices that came with IHS Markit, that's a whole new asset class for us is to be able to provide a multi-asset class with the credit aspect to it, credit volatility. There's another set of products which are related to exchange-traded derivatives. They're not direct indices, but there's a lot more interest in risk management and hedging and trading strategies. And with our core foundation and our relationships with CBOE and CME, we're able to develop a whole new set of ETDs. And we've seen strong growth in that area as well. So across the board, it's climate. It's multi-asset class. It's factors. It's a whole set of different types of indices on the fixed income side. And then it's also exchange-traded derivatives and new approaches to products, which we've already been developing there. But let me hand it over to Ewout to give a little bit more color on the numbers. Thanks, Heather. This is Doug. Well, first of all, when we look at this industry, it's being driven by incredible amount of transformation. We talked earlier in a different context about energy transition. And you take what are the traditional oil, gas commodity products, which we have a very strong position in both from price benchmarks as well as news research and analytics. And we announced that we have just launched this Platts Connect, which is a platform where we take the 2 services from what had been Platts and would have been ENR from IHS Markit and put them together in a single platform. That means that we can continue to serve all of the traditional markets in a way with a very high-quality platform with -- it's easy to use, it's easy to search on. We'll be enhancing it with AI tools over time. And so that's just the beginning of where we already see the traditional markets growing. And we're able to serve them better and faster in ways that are much more compelling all the time. And that into that, that there's a mix of new commodities, new energy sources. There's areas like the metals, which are used for energy transition, that we already have a position in that we're getting stronger all the time. And then you have the energy transition products related to things like carbon intensity, carbon markets, how we look at the transportation related to that, the infrastructure that's related to that. And then on top of that, there's an incredible amount of synergies across all of S&P Global with S1, for example, with new data sets, which are being added to the Marketplace and Market Intelligence, new data sets, which can be added to Cap IQ Pro. So we look at this as a business that is in the right place at a time when the markets need transparency. They need comparability. They need high-quality data, and they need it delivered in a way that's easy for them to use. And they can build it into their workflow. So we're really, really very pleased with our progress, and this is a business that we're going to continue to invest in. So thank you very much, Heather. And let me just give a couple of closing remarks. I want to, first of all, thank everyone for joining the call today and your excellent questions, as always. I'm really proud, as you can hear, about the progress we've made with the merger with IHS Markit and all of the integration that's taking place. And now we're able to talk more and more about the revenue side and the product launches. And you saw them this quarter with Platts Connect and into the insights, and there's a lot more to come. And this is combining the best across both businesses to create the new S&P Global. I also want to thank Martina for providing her perspective today, and thank you for joining us. And as always, I want to thank our people for a great quarter. Their excitement and passion continue to inspire me personally and want to thank all of them for what they do. So again, thank you for joining the call today, and have a great day. Thank you very much."

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our media relations team whose contact information can be found in the release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to the non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased to report 7% revenue growth in the second quarter, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods. We saw acceleration in revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices, while growth remained in the high single digits for both Commodity Insights and Mobility. As you will recall, we took decisive action to protect margins beginning in the second quarter of last year and lapping those actions led to a modest contraction in adjusted operating margins year-over-year. Our continued focus on delivering profitable growth and prudently managing our capital allocation combined to drive double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share this quarter. We expect positive revenue growth in all divisions for the remainder of year, as well as continued double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In addition to strong financial results, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy with an emphasis on innovation. We continue to drive rapid advancement in our AI initiatives. We'll talk more about the guiding principles behind our AI strategy in a moment, but we already have a number of internal initiatives and pilot programs. Additionally, in May, we launched a conversational AI assistant called ChatIQ on Capital IQ Pro Labs for internal testing. We'll have more to say about ChatIQ as we get closer to a formal launch to external customers, but it's the first example of how Kensho will deploy LLM-based technology across S&P Global. We're also very excited about some of the developments in our conversations with the largest participants in the private markets. We have an active and incredibly productive dialogue with private equity and private credit customers. We're currently exploring many ways that we can work together to apply our expertise in ratings, analytics and pricing across the credit markets. We'll have more specifics to share here as well as this dialogue develops into commercial opportunities. We're seeing some early, but encouraging signs of stabilization in the macro environment, which leads to a modest improvement to the macro outlook, helping inform our financial guidance. Lastly, illustrating our commitment to disciplined stewardship of the business, we completed the divestiture of Engineering Solutions in the second quarter. We continue to align our goals and operations against the five strategic pillars we introduced at Investor Day. First, I want to provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. We've mentioned over the last couple of quarters that we've seen some lengthening of the sales cycle, which we believe was driven by customer sensitivity around spending. Our cross-sell efforts are also creating larger contracts, which take longer to close. While sales cycles remain a bit longer than normal, we've started to see some stabilization and customer conversations have been very constructive. We continue to see high customer retention rates and contract expansions, evidenced by the 8% growth in subscription revenue across our five divisions. The value of our largest and most well-known products, those key brands and benchmarks that the markets rely on is being recognized by our customers in a challenging and sometimes confusing macro environment. Customers are also emphasizing many of the same strategic priorities that we are namely private markets, climate, energy transition and AI. This is evidenced in the 40% growth in energy transition revenue we saw in our Commodity Insights division in the second quarter. As customers navigate a market with higher interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and rapidly evolving technology, we hear they trust S&P Global and they want to do more with us. We've worked hard to build that trust, and we're as confident as we've ever been in the long-term growth of the company.  Related to Ratings, global billed issuance returned to positive growth, increasing 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. We began to see some signs of stabilizing interest rates among central banks. While we did see some likely event driven issuance in the second quarter ahead of the debt ceiling events in the United States, we're also seeing more economists, including our own, expecting only one or two more rate hikes from major central banks over the remainder of 2023. Overall, issuance saw a higher proportion of refinancing activity with issuers tracking market conditions closely. We expect those pockets of issuance to become more frequent as the market adjusts to the new normal of higher for longer. We're pleased with the strength we saw in corporate issuance with both high yield and investment grade issuance increasing notably year-over-year, though the high yield growth is coming off of a very low comparison. This strength is offset somewhat by a softer environment for bank loans and structured finance. Importantly, rating withdrawals, which are a measure of churn in ratings, are down this year. That illustrates the strength of the S&P brand and the increasing value of a rating in an uncertain credit environment. Next, I'd like to focus on our strategic priority to grow and innovate. The June release of updates and enhancements of Capital IQ Pro was one of the largest and most significant in years. We completely reinvented RatingsDirect on Capital IQ Pro and launched loan pricing and analytics as well. Customers have already shown an incredibly positive reaction to the enhancements on Capital IQ Pro. And these new features have contributed to key competitive displacements and enhanced our competitive positioning. In Commodity Insights, we also launched the first offering of base shipping rates incorporating alternative fuel pricing. This is significant as we expect the maritime sector's use of alternative fuels including liquid natural gas to grow significantly in the coming years. Our Sustainable1 team launched a new nature and biodiversity risk data set, assessing nature related impacts and dependencies across the company's operations. This assessment can be applied across the asset, company and portfolio level, which gives our corporate and investor customers a greater ability to quantify both dependency and impact on location specific ecosystems. As we introduced last quarter, our Vitality revenue metric consists revenue derived from our new or substantially enhanced products. We're pleased that in the second quarter, Vitality revenue held steady at 11% of total revenue. I'm both pleased and impressed that the top four contributors to our Vitality revenue in the quarter came from four different divisions, clearly demonstrating that our commitment to innovation and growth spans the entire organization. Turning now to a topic that I know is on everyone's mind, artificial intelligence. I wanted to provide some color on S&P Global's key advantages and the guiding principles that will govern our use and the implementation of AI, both internally and within our products. We're thrilled with the progress that our teams have made building, testing and implementing tools in various use cases across the organization. While Kensho gives us an incredible advantage in this arena, it isn't our only one. The datasets we have, large, proprietary and truly differentiated, create a remarkable advantage for S&P Global as well. Our trusted brands also allow us to have conversations with industry partners, technology infrastructure providers and customers with credibility. We, through our brands, are known and trusted, and we know that trust will play a huge role in the success of any AI based products that come to market in the coming years. As we more fully embrace the technological advances of our era, we need to make sure we do so with prudence and discipline. Particularly given the investment necessary to develop AI driven tools, we want to take each step with a keen focus on creating customer value rather than simply creating tools because the technology exists. We will allocate the necessary capital to these new projects based on our confidence in the strategic and financial impact on the company. While Kensho is deeply engaged in AI research within S&P Global, we want to make sure we aren't dogmatic in our approach. We'll leverage leading technology regardless of whether it was developed at Kensho, developed elsewhere within the divisions or come via a vendor or a partner. Lastly, we want to continue our practice of aggressively defending and protecting our intellectual property and data. We have safeguards and restrictions embedded in our contracts that ensure third parties and customers cannot independently monetize or build commercial products with our data without our consent and our economic participation. We're committed to transparency with our shareholders, and we'll provide regular updates on our new product launches as they take place. We'll move fast. And we'll also make the necessary investments in time and resources to ensure success. Shifting now to how we lead and inspire. During the second quarter, we further demonstrated our commitment to transparency and accountability through the publication of our Annual Sustainability Impact Report and TCFD Report. We also published for the first time our annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, highlighting our commitment to building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive company and world. We're honored that so many respected organizations have recognized the efforts that we have made to build a company that always pursues excellence. As you can see on this slide, we received recognition not just for our efforts in sustainability and equality, but also in our governance and board oversight and our civic contributions. I've never been more proud to be part of S&P Global. Of course, disciplined leadership means delivering on our ongoing operational and financial outcomes. We are pleased with the strong execution across all divisions this quarter. We saw positive revenue growth in all of our divisions in the second quarter, including accelerating revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices. While our trailing 12-month margins have contracted 90 basis points year-over-year, we expect that trend to improve as we progress through this year and lap the issuance headwinds we saw through most of last year. With half of the year behind us, we still see many of the same macroeconomic factors impacting our business through the remainder of the year. While we no longer expect a technical recession globally, we do expect headwinds to persist from an economic slowdown, primarily in financial services end markets. We expect to continue to benefit from secular trends, though near term volatility can impact different parts of the business in different ways. While these market expectations are mostly unchanged from the first half, we wanted to reiterate our confidence in the multi-year financial targets we put out for divisions and for the consolidated company at Investor Day. As you know, our Ratings financial results and guidance are closely tied to billed issuance. And for 2023, we now expect issuance to be up approximately 4% to 8% for the full year, up one point from our prior expectation. Our latest Ratings research group forecast calls for a decline in global market issuance, though also slightly improved from last quarter. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance with divergence this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance. We have completed our July 2023 global refinancing study. And you can see one of the reasons for our for our optimism Ratings business over the next several years. There is over $8 trillion of debt rated by S&P Global maturing through 2026 and nearly $13 trillion maturing through 2028. This, in addition to assumed improvements in the macro environment over the next few years, gives us great confidence in our ability to drive profitable multiyear growth in Ratings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased with the financial performance of the business in second quarter. The clear indicator is that the secular tailwinds continue to drive growth across our largest products, though some minor headwinds impact smaller parts of the business. Adjusted earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of 4% revenue growth and a 6% reduction in fully diluted share count, partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of operating margin compression. Excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods, but including approximately $10 million from this year's tuck-in acquisitions, revenue growth would have been 7%. Revenue in the quarter was driven by growth across all remaining divisions, including Ratings, which saw a pickup in issuance activity the quarter. While the debt markets remain a challenging environment for issuers, this is the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement. As Doug mentioned, we also saw acceleration in revenue growth across Market Intelligence and Indices with continued impressive growth in Commodity Insights and Mobility. We will walk through the divisions in more detail a moment. Adjusted expenses were up 6% year-over-year, which we'll also discuss in more detail.  Turning to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustainability and energy transition revenue increased 17% to $70 million in the quarter, driven by climate and physical risk products and CI's energy transition products. We continue to see a shift in customer appetite away from buying pure ESG scores and towards more purchases of raw data, which we believe will benefit S&P Global in the long run. We consistently hear from customers that our Trucost data set is higher quality than the data from many competitors. And the breadth of our offerings across the commodity markets and ESG Indices will contribute to strong growth for multiple years. That said, we are seeing some signs of adverse market sentiment, particularly from large financial institutions in the United States that are impacting our revenue growth in the short-term as others in the space have also called out. We believe these headwinds are temporary, while the growth drivers are secular. Even though sustainability and energy transition revenue currently represents only a low single digit percent of our total revenue, it is an important strategic driver of long-term growth. We will continue to make the necessary investments in people, data, product development and partnerships to drive long-term growth.  Given the uncertainty around the regulatory landscape and the political climate, particularly in the U.S., we can no longer confidently reiterate the previous 2026 target of $800 million in sustainability and energy transition. We'll continue to report this metric on a quarterly basis. And we will assess the potential for long-term revenue contribution from these important products as the market continues to evolve.  Private market solutions revenue increased 5% to $106 million, driven by strong growth in Market Intelligence products for private markets, offset by declines in Ratings private markets revenue. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, of $343 million in the second quarter, representing a 14% increase compared to prior year. Now turning to synergies. In the second quarter of 2023, we recognized $144 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $574 million and we continue to expect our year-end run rate to be approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $17 million in synergies achieved in the second quarter and an annualized run rate of $68 million. Turning to expense growth. Total adjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year as we are beginning to lap the proactive expense management actions taken last year. We saw a $23 million favorable impact from FX in the quarter, and the divestiture of Engineering Solutions was favorable by $50 million. We also generated incremental cost synergies that lowered expense growth by approximately $80 million relative to last year. As you will recall, we lowered accruals for incentive compensation in the second quarter of last year. This was done to reflect the headwinds we were facing, predominantly in our Ratings business. Incentive compensation resets each year, so we're seeing the natural increase in those expenses beginning this quarter. Incentive compensation and commissions were the largest single contributor to expense growth in the second quarter. The year-over-year impact of incentive compensation will be a similar driver of expense growth in the third quarter, though we expect expense growth to moderate meaningfully in the fourth quarter as the comparison becomes more favorable. The year-over-year impact of the reset of incentive compensation was a key driver of expense growth in each of our divisions, and we expect to see the same quarterly phasing in our division margin results in the third quarter and fourth quarter as well. Lastly, we continue to invest to drive long-term growth, and that was reflected this quarter. Core investment growth represents the investments we are making in strategic initiatives, people, cloud as well the incremental investments we are making to fund our AI development at Kensho and within the divisions. Most importantly, we continue to expect approximately 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year. Now, let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 6% driven by strong growth in data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions. Desktop grew 4% in the second quarter driven by strong subscription growth as ACV growth outpaced revenue in the quarter, though this was offset by some modest softness in non-recurring sales. Renewal rates remained strong in the mid to high 90s. Data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions both benefited from solid growth in subscription based offerings. Credit and risk solutions continues to see strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products, as well as double-digit growth in credit analytics. Adjusted expenses increased 7% year-over-year due to the drivers previously discussed. Operating profit increased 4%, and the operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 32.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins improved to 220 basis points. As we mentioned last quarter, we know the comparisons will get easier as we progress through the year. And we continue to expect improvements in those products within Enterprise Solutions that depend on capital markets activity. We also expect revenue synergies to begin positively impacting results in the back half of the year. Last quarter, we signaled that we may come in at the low end of our previous guidance range. We're not trying to signal deterioration since April, though we do see modestly elevated risk to the back half. Given the heightened uncertainty, particularly within sustainability and energy transition, we're taking the formal step at this point to modestly lower the guidance by 50 basis points on revenue and operating margin. Now turning to Ratings. In the second quarter, we saw a spike in issuance activity, particularly in May, which from a seasonality perspective is a very important month for debt markets. Revenue increased 7% year-over-year. This marks the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement in transaction revenue, and we saw investment grade and high yield activity pick up. Non-transaction revenue increased 4% primarily due to annual fees and growth in CRISIL, though non-transaction growth was tempered by continued declines in ICR revenue.  Adjusted expenses increased 12%. This resulted in a 4% increase in operating profit and a 180 basis point decrease in operating margin to 57.7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins are still impacted by last year's revenue declines.  We raised our billed issuance assumption for 2023 and expect issuance to increase in the range of 4% to 8%, reflecting the stronger issuance trends in the first half. Our outlook for transaction revenue for the full year has improved somewhat, though some of this is offset by non-transaction revenue due to greater weakness in ICR than we initially anticipated. The net result is a one point increase in our Ratings revenue guidance range and we now expect Ratings revenue growth of 5% to 7%. While we expect expense growth to moderate as progress through the year, we are reiterating our margin guidance. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 8% driven by double-digit growth in both price assessments and energy and resources data and insights. Growth was tempered somewhat by declines in the upstream business. Upstream data and insights declined approximately 2% year-over-year. While subscription ACV growth is positive, we have deprioritized one-time sales in upstream as we focus on higher quality recurring revenue products. As such, we are lowering our expectations modestly for upstream for the full year and now expect that business line to be flat to down slightly for the full year compared to our previous expectation for low single digit growth. Price assessments and energy and resources data and insights grew 12% and 11%, respectively compared to prior year driven by strong performance in crude oil and fuels and refining products and strong commercial momentum in subscription products across both business lines. Advisory and transaction revenue also grew 12% driven by strength in global trading services and strong performance in conference revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 5%. Operating profit for CI increased 12%, and operating margin improved 160 basis points to 45.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have improved 220 basis points. We see stronger trends for our benchmarks, data and insights, and we enjoy a position of trust in the commodity markets. We continue to expect strong subscription growth through the second half, and there is no change to our outlook for revenue or margins. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year driven by continued new business growth in CARFAX, the contribution from Market Scan within the Dealer segment and strong underwriting volumes in the financials and other business lines. Dealer revenue increased 12% year-over-year driven by the continued benefit of price increases within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for life and used car subscription products. Manufacturing grew 5% year-over-year driven by elevated recall activity and continued strength in marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 9% as the business line continues to see healthy underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment similar to last quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 13% due primarily to the drivers I discussed previously, but also due to the inorganic contribution to expenses from the Market Scan acquisition. This resulted in a 5% increase in adjusted operating profit and 160 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 60 basis points. As we noted last quarter, we expect the Market Scan acquisition to contribute approximately 150 basis points of revenue growth in the full year, though we expect it to be modestly dilutive to adjusted margins in 2023. And our guidance for Mobility for the full year is unchanged. Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 3%, primarily due to strong growth in exchange rated derivatives volume and data subscriptions, partially offset by a modest decline in asset-linked fees. Asset-linked fees were down 1% year-over-year primarily driven by mix shift into lower priced index ETF products, partially offset by market depreciation and modest year-over-year net inflows. Importantly, this decline was due to mix shift, not due to price concessions or renegotiated contracts. Exchange rated derivatives revenue increased 17% on increased trading volumes across all key contracts. Data and custom subscriptions increased 3% year-over-year driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses increased 15% year-over-year due to reasons previously discussed. Operating profit in Indices decreased 2%, and the operating margin decreased 330 basis points from last year's high watermark to 68.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 30 basis points. As reflected in today's results, we've seen market depreciation, the mix of AUM is playing an increasingly important role in asset-linked fees revenue. And net inflows remain somewhat unpredictable in the near term. All of this is reflected in our new higher guidance range.  As we mentioned last quarter, our continued investments to drive long-term growth as well as the timing of expense recognition will impact the quarterly phasing of our margins. We expect relatively high expense growth in Indices in the third quarter as well before expense growth moderates in the fourth quarter. This will ultimately allow us to deliver margins within the new higher guidance range of 67.5% to 68.5%. Now, let's move to the latest views from our economists who are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.9% in 2023. We're no longer calling for a global recession, though we do expect lower-than-normal economic activity through the remainder of year. We continue to expect inflation above the target rates of central banks and energy prices like crude oil to remain above historical averages as well.  As we consider how all of this will ultimately impact our financial performance in 2023, let's turn to our guidance. This slide represents our GAAP guidance for headline metrics. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the results through the first half as well as our most recent views on the macroeconomic environment and market conditions. Our full year guidance is largely unchanged on a consolidated basis as outperformance in Ratings and Indices is offset by slightly lower expectations for Market Intelligence as we've begun to signal last quarter. We have provided the granular guidance on corporate unallocated expense, deal related amortization, interest expense and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site.  The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously.  In conclusion, we're pleased with the results from the second quarter, particularly with the return to strong double-digit growth in both Ratings transaction revenue and our adjusted diluted EPS. With multiple variables at play in the markets, we're encouraged by the fact that the tailwinds tend to impact the largest parts of our business, while the headwinds are impacting relatively small contributors to our financial results. It takes tremendous effort from many talented people to deliver results like these. And I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their relentless drive to power global markets. We're looking forward to delivering a strong second half of the year.  And with that, I would like to invite Edouard Tavernier, President of S&P Global Mobility, to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\nA - Mark Grant: Thank you, Ewout. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. In the prepared remarks, there was a reference to lengthening of the sales cycle. I was wondering if you could provide any incremental color where you were explicitly you're seeing it, in which particular division or it's been across the board. Thanks.\nDouglas Peterson: Ashish, this is Doug. Can you please repeat the question? You talked about sales cycle for all divisions or for a specific product? I'm sorry, I didn't pick up your question.\nAshish Sabadra: Sorry about that, Doug. Yeah. I was just wondering if you could provide more color on where you're seeing that lengthening of the sales cycle. Has it been focused on a particular division, or has that been across the board? Thanks.\nDouglas Peterson: Got it. Thank you. Well, first of all, we've seen that in the last quarter and going forward that people are thinking very cautiously about expense management, especially in the financial services sector. This is an area where people have been looking at how they're going to be managing their own expenses. They're looking at the environment, which we described as quite difficult, given the inflation, given the interest rate environment. There's not a lot of deal flow. So, this is where we're mainly seeing slowdown in some of the sales cycle, although this stabilized in the second quarter. It actually -- we started seeing in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year and now we're seeing it in the second quarter, but it did stabilize.  As you recall, we also have some cases where it's taking us longer to renegotiate with our customers because we're bringing them more value. We're bringing together multiple products. So, sometimes consolidating products and consolidating contracts takes a little bit more. But let me hand it over to Edouard since he's on the call as well tell us a little bit about what he's seeing in the Mobility sector in the same sense.\nEdouard Tavernier: Thank you, Doug. And hi, Ashish. So, in the Mobility sector, we're seeing trends similar to what Doug has described. In the sense that in the first couple of quarters of the year, we did see a slight softening of retention rates and a slight lengthening of sales cycle. And what that pertains to is the normalization of the sector after a couple of years of really, really elevated kind of retention rates. So, at this point, we feel the situation has normalized. They stabilized. Our retention rates remain very, very strong by historical standards, slightly less elevated than the past couple of years and business -- kind of new business momentum is now stabilized. Thank you.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks Ashish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky, Bank of America. Your line is open. \nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was curious, on the call you talked about the near-term challenges in climate and sustainability, and some of the pressure you're seeing. And you talked about -- essentially, you pulled your long-term target. But also earlier in the call, you reiterated your view on mid-term growth for your businesses. I am curious given the pressure you're seeing in the sustainability area, kind of what do you see offsetting that, that gives you confidence in your targets.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Heather. This is Ewout. Welcome first of all, to the call. So, just to be very clear about sustainability and energy transition. We're not backing away from the $800 million target. We are currently backing away from the timing around that, because we're not 100% certain anymore that we can hit that by 2026. Why? Because we are still continuing to see very positive trends with respect to the longer term secular trends around ESG. We think that all of those -- underlying drivers are still there. But in the short-term, we are impacted by some uncertainties, uncertainties about the regulatory landscape, the political climate, mostly in U.S. We're seeing some on the buy side firms reconsidering what they want to do around sustainability. But we see continued actually pocket of strength in our business. Think about our climate activities, think about ESG raw data, energy transition, all of these products continue to grow very well.  I also would like to point out that we expect a reacceleration of our sustainability and energy transition revenues growth in the second half of this year. So, growth will come back in the second half of this year. And we're still very positive and optimistic about the outlook for the medium and long-term.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks Heather.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nSeth Weber: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the Ratings, the operating margin in the Ratings business, which came down with revenue going up. I know you addressed some of the kind of short-term expense headwinds there. But can you just talk a little bit more about your confidence for margins to get -- to ramp higher through the back half of the year in Ratings business specifically? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yeah. Good morning, Seth. First of all, I think this is exactly in line with our expectations, the margin development in Ratings. And let me explain why that's the case. The same what we said for the company as a whole, we are seeing now also this quarter for Ratings with respect to the expense reset of incentive compensation compared to last year. Last year, in the second quarter, we saw a large change in the accrual for incentive compensation across the board, but also in Ratings, both for the short-term and the long-term incentive compensation accruals. And we are resetting that for this year based on the strong performance of the company and the strong performance of the Ratings business as well. So, we are overall very positive about the medium and long-term perspective and outlook. If you look at where we are from a trailing 12-month perspective for margin for Ratings, we're at 55.2. We're guiding this year to 56 to 57. And then as you know, we have our IR targets for 2025 and 2026, 58 to 60. So, you will continue to see strong margin improvement of Ratings over the next few periods.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks Seth, and welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Hi. Good morning. I just want to focus on the Market Intelligence revenue. I guess, you lowered by 50 basis points. Did I hear you right by saying most of that was because of the -- I guess, the sustainability trends you talked about? And I was just curious like, Doug, you mentioned the weakness mainly in financial services end market. I'm guessing that's most exposed here in Market Intelligence. In spite of all the vendor consolidation and those kinds of things that pick up in this period, are there any, I guess, trends, or what's your strategy to be a winner in that area?\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Manav. You're absolutely right. Where we are with the business at this moment is exactly the same place where we thought the business would be when we had our last call in April. The business is performing in line with expectations. And the only reason why we are making the change with respect to the guidance range has to do with the short-term uncertainty around sustainability and energy transition. So, to give you a little bit more color around it. If you look at some of the key drivers of Market Intelligence, ACV growth is good. Closing rates are good. Retention rates are good. User growth is good. We see a lot of new product launches bringing to the -- being brought market by Market Intelligence. So, overall, we believe the business is in a very good shape. At the end of the day, we are very excited about the potential of Market Intelligence, particularly combining the two companies together in that segment and the potential it will have with respect to commercial growth, and we fully expect to hit our Investor Day targets for Market Intelligence.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks Manav.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to go back to the sustainability revenue streams. You mentioned seeing the shift from scores to data. I wanted to understand better if that has pricing implications. And also, is it harder to build a moat when it's the data not either ratings or scores that are being demanded by customers?  And then maybe I know Trucost is very high quality. Maybe you could talk about how it’s proprietary and other data brands within ESG where you have an advantage. Thanks.\nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Toni. Let me just take a step back one second and talk about what we're hearing in the market. I've been traveling this year. And I've been in every continent -- I've been except for Africa and Australia. But I've been around the world. I've been traveling a lot. And in every single conversation I have, we talk about sustainability, climate, ESG, energy transition. This is on everyone's mind. And depending on where you are in the world, it's either moving faster, maybe a little bit slower in the U.S. than it had been before. But there's also a shift going on in the way that regulators and investors think about their accountability to deliver their own views on climate change and on energy transition. The investors and regulators no longer want whoever is managing their money or who they're regulating to just make a decision based blindly on a score. They want them to have their own opinion based on their own analysis and building models from the bottom up. So, when you think about that shift taking place in the market, you then -- we bring the kind of data which has time series on it. We've had information that goes back 15, 20, 30 years. Trucost last quarter grew 38%. Our climate service, which is something that people are using for modeling climate change and physical risk, that grew 78%. So, we're seeing that some of these -- I call them, proprietary data or modeling services that we have are really in high growth and high demand. As you know, we also built a climate credit analytics model with Oliver Wyman. That grew over 50% in the second quarter. And so, we see across the globe that people are starting to make decisions themselves and they can no longer rely on just one single data input. They need to have the data.  So, I think that we have a great head start by having bought Trucost seven years ago. We had the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability products, which started over 20 years ago. And let me hand it over to Edouard, who can give a little bit of color also for the automotive and mobility sector.\nEdouard Tavernier: Hi, Toni. A couple of good examples actually of what Doug was talking about in Mobility, and opportunities we're able to unlock now as part of S&P Global in partnership with S1. As Doug mentioned, Climanomics, we launched in June e-version [ph] of Climanomics, which assesses physical risk for the automotive sector, where we were able to feed all our supply chain data on the automotive sector within Climanomics platform. That's one example.  The bigger one, actually, is we are now building a carbon accounting data set for the Mobility sector. And as you know, in automotive, the key question mark is Scope 3 emissions pertaining to vehicles on the road and the upstream supply chain of the battery. In this space, we have a unique opportunity with our proprietary data to become the sort of record of carbon accounting data for the automotive industry. So, a couple of examples here about how raw data itself combined with our S1 expertise can really create some unique and defensible products.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks Toni.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You maintained your outlook for Commodity Insights revenue growth for the full year. Can you talk about the sensitivity of Commodity Insights revenue to a pullback in oil prices? What are the puts and takes in the various parts of the business?\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks George. Well, as we've talked about over many years, the sensitivity to the price of oil in the Commodity Insights business is actually not very important to get to really low oil prices, like below the 60s into the 50s and 40s. And similarly, the same thing happens. It needs to get well over $100 before it starts creating sensitivity to the market or the industry. What we're actually seeing is a lot of interest and a lot of growth outside of what would be oil and gas. As you know, we have a large sustainability set of products and climate change products, energy transition within Commodity Insights. We also see a lot of interest and lot of growth in what we've done in terms of combining the product sets from the old Platts business with the E&R from IHS Markit. This is where you're taking prices and benchmarks and adding in forecasting research and analytics. So, we see a lot of interest in what we're doing. Our customers are asking for more. And we're layering on top of that artificial intelligence tools, tools, analytical better vision, better charting capabilities, ability to use our platforms more simply. We've taken multiple products and combined them into one or two solutions. So, across the board, we're seeing that our clients need more. They need to understand more about what's happening in the energy market. So, the sensitivity to the price of oil really doesn't kick-in until the oil price drops a lot or gets really, really expensive. Thanks George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Index business and a couple of questions there. First, I wanted to get sense of what you're assuming in terms of your AUM and how you're thinking about ETD revenues in the back half of the year. I think you had previously talked about a pretty significant decline. So, curious if that's still the case. And then just last question around that is, you talked about a mix impact on the fees associated with the AUM related revenues. Give us a bit more perspective on what's going there. Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Absolutely, Faiza. And let me combine all three of your questions in one answer. So, first of all, the business is seeing very healthy flows. We have seen very strong U.S. equity flows at $53 billion. We have also seen very solid fixed income flows for the quarter. That was at $6.5 billion. So, we think the business is seeing really the positive impact from overall positive sentiments around the markets we have seen over the last couple of weeks and months. So, that's first.  Then with respect to the outlook for the remainder of the year in terms of our assumptions, we have assumed no further market depreciation from the June 30 level onwards. And we have also -- looking at the ETD volumes, we have assumed that volumes for ETDs remain at a positive place, but coming down slightly from where we were in the first half of this year.  I also would like to point out that if you look at where we ended the quarter from an overall AUM perspective, we're about 19% up compared to the point where we were at the end of the second quarter of last year. So, certainly, the starting point for the second half of this year is very strong.  If you look at mix, yeah, there is always going to be some kind of a mix in flows to certain products versus other products. We have seen that in the past as well. That will normally normalize over time. So, we think this is more short-term noise due to that flow seasonality. But from a medium and long-term perspective, we believe that there is still a correlation between AUM levels as a key driver of overall AUM fees growth for the business. So, in other words, if you combine all of these trends together, we're very happy that we could raise the guidance for the Index business for the second time in a row and we're very optimistic about the outlook for the remaining of the year for the Index business.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks Faiza.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to come back to the Market Intelligence guidance. I think you made this comment, and hopefully, I'm not misquoting here that you're lowering the guide officially, but not trying to signal anything. I'm not sure what that really means. So, maybe you can flesh it out a little bit. You talked to the low end last quarter, 6.5. Now, you're lowering the range, but you're still leaving it very wide. So, theoretically, the mid-point is actually higher than what you said before. So, maybe just help us kind of like say what has changed, if anything, and then maybe just flesh out the margin of the guide as well. Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Happy to clarify that, Alex. So, what I've said before is we think the business in all the aspects is performing in line with expectations what we had a quarter ago. So, we don't see any deterioration in any of the underlying business lines within Market Intelligence. And it is actually exactly where we thought it would be at this point in time and also with respect to the book of business, the ACV growth, retention levels, sales cycles and so on, we see exactly what we would expect to see at this moment. But as we have highlighted during the call, there is uncertainty about sustainability and energy transition, particularly ESG scores is a part of the revenue stream for the Market Intelligence business. And we are a bit prudent here deliberately in order to change the guidance here. We're not pointing to any point in this guidance range. We're just lowering the guidance at this point in time. But as we have said, we are actually really positive and optimistic about the outlook of Market Intelligence. We see a lot of positive trends underneath the business and I've mentioned those before. But let me just give another couple of examples of that. The combination of the capabilities is working. So, we're seeing a lot of new products that is in development with respect to combining Market Intelligence and financial services of IHS Markit. We see increased value realization with customers and actually a slight pickup in pricing in the business. We should also benefit from trends of consolidation of data vendors and we are one of the beneficiaries of that. So, many positive things that are positive trends for Market Intelligence. We're just really prudent, and that's the main reason around the sustainability revenues in the near-term.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. I'm sorry to keep honing in on Market Intelligence, but I wanted to focus on margins. I know you slightly lowered the adjusted operating margin guidance, but it still implies a pretty steep ramp in the second half of the year. Are there any timing issues, or cost cuts that are impacting this? And if not, how do you expect to see that margin acceleration in the back half? \nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. Thank you so much for that question. You're absolutely right that we see quite some seasonality in margins in Market Intelligence, but by the way, also in several of our other segments during this year. And that has to do with the reason that I mentioned before around incentive compensation where we saw a large pullback in incentive compensation in the second and third quarter of last year. So, that is what we are going to lap this year. But then in the end, in the fourth quarter, we have much easier comps. And just to give you a data point for the company as a whole, that would mean that we are expecting from an expense perspective that expenses for the company as a whole for this year will still end up in low single digit growth territory for the company as a whole. So, you would expect there for that reason that the fourth quarter margins are going to be really strong. And the expense growth in the fourth quarter is going to be really low in order to achieve those outcomes.  So, also, let me give you another data point in terms of margin expansion for the company as a whole. We still expect 60 to 160 basis points margin expansion for the company as a whole. And for Market Intelligence, you're also looking at quite a significant increase in margins over the next two quarters from a trailing 12-month level now of 32.4 to a range of 33.5 to 34.5 for the whole year of 2023. So, yeah, third quarter, still a little bit depressed by the expense seasonality, but fourth quarter very strong margins and expenses really low. That's the overall trend that you should expect for Market Intelligence and the other divisions.\nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Tom [indiscernible] for Andrew Nicholas. I wanted to ask a question around AI, and I was curious about what your strategy is for allocating potential resources to assist in developing AI capabilities across the segments. Given S&P's extensive portfolio, it seems like resources could be stretched in there. So, I was wondering if you guys take more like a holistic approach where there is universal capability across the segments developing AI, or if there are specific segments where you are focusing AI development. Thank you.\nDouglas Peterson: Andrew, let me start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Ewout. I want to go back to a period six and seven years ago when we first made our investment in Kensho and around the -- and we started thinking about what the future was going to look like. And we actually see that future playing right now. We felt that in five years from then, which is now -- and 10 years from then, which is five years from now, that people like us would be making decisions assisted by artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. And in the last year or so, it's become apparent that there's another leg to that stool. It's not just artificial intelligence and machine learning. It's also generative AI. We've been embracing that across the company. Kensho has developed an expertise in different types of generative AI models. They are a go-to source in the company for learning about what we can do and what are the different models we could be applying.  As you saw in our prepared remarks, we have a governance approach around AI, which is to ensure that we're always thinking about our customers. We have a hybrid methodology of philosophy about using multiple types of models and sources whether that's internally driven from Kensho or the divisions or externally from open sources from partnerships. When you look at the needs for developing AI solutions, you end up actually having to stack multiple models on top of each other. And you require really careful management of your data, so that you can protect it as well as ensure that it will be then used and displayed in the right way. And then the third part of our governance is to ensure that we're all protecting our data. This is one of the first things we did when we started seeing generative AI models. We took a step back to make sure that we could protect our data and our IP. But let me hand it over to Ewout and then over to Edouard talk a little bit more about some of the things we're seeing in the company.\nEwout Steenbergen: Tom, one of the things that I'm really excited about is that on the one hand, we have Kensho, which is a relatively small group, but really an innovation accelerator within the company. And then we have all of our colleagues around the world, because we have so many data scientists, technology engineers, data experts, experts in a lot of specific areas and fields around the company. And you have to bring all of those together in order to get the acceleration with the opportunities that generative AI and large language models are bringing for us as a company. So, Kensho is focusing on a couple of areas that will have the biggest impact for the company as a whole. This could be use cases that we are developing. But also think about collecting the data and structuring the data in token sets that are the best readable for large language models. And that's actually, from a technical perspective, a really important challenge.  But the good thing is Kensho has been doing that kind of work already for the last five years. We have experience we're working with AI for the last five years. We know how to prioritize this for the last five years. We know how to track the economic benefits and we have been doing that for the last five years. So, we have a lot of experience around dealing with this, and we're not trying to invent this for the first time at this moment. But then on the other hand, we also have the crowdsourcing. So, we have a lot of colleagues that are contributing to these kind of initiatives to collect data for large language models and many other initiatives we are experimenting across the board. So, let me hand it over to Edouard, because there's also a lot of great experimentation and development going on in Mobility.\nEdouard Tavernier: Thank you, Ewout. Thank you, Doug. And just to add to what you said, I want to bring up one example of how we're thinking about innovating at scale with a new technology like generative AI. And as Doug said, our experience in earlier forms of AI and our cloud investment over the past two years, I think, puts us in good stead to harness this new technology, but I think we have to recognize there's a step change here.  And so, as we think about how do we enable our organization, one of the big strengths of our strategy is to upskill people and make sure we familiarize them with this technology. Earlier in July, within Mobility, we actually launched internal solution called autopilot, which is all about bringing the tool to hundreds of our colleagues within the Mobility division. And we've already seen dozens of use cases developed over the past two or three weeks and we learn every day from this particular solution. We learn not just about large language models, but we learn about data curation, we learn about what kind of UI do we need to develop, what kind of business governance do we need around it. And that's a great example of one of the ways in which as an organization, we're learning and we're harnessing this new technology. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.\nCraig Huber: Good morning. Thank you. I'd like to hear more about your outlook for Ratings for the for the debt issuance year, please, if you can just kind of go into investment grade, high yield bank loans. And I particularly like to hear about if you're overly concerned of what's going on in the commercial real estate market, not so much what the impact is on the CMBS market. But if things continue to get worse there, do you think there could be some negative domino effects in the whole banking sector, financial sector out there. Thank you.\nDouglas Peterson: Okay. Thanks Craig. Let me give you some color just on the issuance market generally and then dig into a couple of questions you asked. Overall, as you know, in the last quarter, the issuance was strong. It was up 8% billed issuance, including bank loans. Our bank loans is actually quite weak during the quarter. But the -- we saw, on the other hand, a lot of volatility and a lot of lumpiness in that issuance. There were some characteristics of markets like corporates in the U.S. was up 80%. Overall investment grade globally was up was up 20%. It in the U.S. Overall, it was up 19%, et cetera. And then overall, high yield was up 90% during the quarter. But on the other hand, structured credit CLOs were down 46% in Europe, 42% in the U.S. So, there's a lot of lumpiness in markets, and that has to do with uncertainty as to ratings, what's happening with interest rates, what's happening with inflation, yield, et cetera, spread. So, there's a lot of market instability still out there. We saw yesterday the U.S. fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points. This morning, the ECB raised interest rates by 25 basis points. So, the markets are looking for some stability of rates and spreads growth rates, et cetera.  Now with that backdrop, let me give you what are a couple of the forecast that we have for the rest of the year. We've increased our range for billed issuance for the rest of the year from a range of 4% to 8%. The previous was 3% to 7% at the last quarter, and the quarter before that is actually 2% to 6%. So, we've seen it improving throughout the year, what we expect for the rest of the year. And if you look at the -- what we're expecting for the rest of the year, if you look at 4% to 8% and with the guidance range we just gave, it means that we're going to be growing in kind of the mid double-digit range for the rest of the year in billed issuance.  A couple of the different areas I can share with you. As you know, our Ratings research team produces forecasts and summaries of what they're going to see going forward. We use that as one of the inputs for billed issuance. It's a different methodology than the billed issuance, but I want to give you that information anyway. We see the corporates growing at about 13% for the rest of the year with a range between 5% and 20%. Financial services flat for the rest of the year, with a range that could be down as much as 5%, up 4%. Structured finance down about 13% for the year, with a range of down 18% to down 8%. And then U.S. public finance could be down about 5%, with a range down 10% or up 2%. So, these are the factors that we're using. We are expecting that once we see these factors I mentioned like inflation, interest rates, spreads, et cetera, as that starts to improve, we think we'll see a better outcome.  One last thing I want to mention is M&A. M&A has been incredibly weak. This last quarter, second quarter, it was one of the weakest levels we've seen. It was as low as the second quarter of 2020 when we saw the beginning of the pandemic when everything came to a halt. I've been speaking with a lot of banks to understand what their outlook is for M&A, because that's a big driver of levered loans of the lending market, of the high yield market, et cetera. We're seeing from the bankers that we're speaking with that they're expecting that at the end of this year and into the first quarter of next year, they're expecting that M&A will pick up again as the market conditions improve. They've told me that there's a pretty large backlog and big pipeline waiting to -- for people to start doing deals, but it's not happening as long as there's still some uncertainty in the markets. So, thanks Craig. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexander Hess: Yes. Hi. This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. Just wanted to ask about the adjusted expense maybe sort of cadence for the year. You guys spoke to incentive comp being elevated year-on-year in 2Q. Maybe what does that look like for the back half of the year? And then also, if you could maybe more qualitatively flesh out what went into core investment growth and overall compensation expense, that would be very helpful. Thanks all.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks Alex. Just generally, I would like to say expenses are under control. They are in line with expectations. And we expect the overall expense growth for the full year to be relatively modest.  So, let me give you a little bit more color around this. So, the key driver of the expense growth this quarter was a swing in the incentive compensation that we already discussed. As I mentioned, also expect that to create elevated expenses in the third quarter, and then we will see it significantly coming down in the fourth quarter. We still expect to hit our margin targets for this year. And as I said before, I think it's also may be good to point that overall we're looking at expenses in absolute dollars that are on a declining trend. So, we have now seen two quarters in a row that in absolute dollars, our expense is coming down. And actually, the third quarter, we expect sequentially further that our expenses will be down relative to the second quarter. So, very much in line with expectations.  Your question about what is going into the growth bucket? It's a couple of areas that go in the growth bucket. The first is our strategic investment spend. So that is the $150 million budget that we have for this year to invest in some of our key initiatives to drive future growth. The second is the additional spend with respect to cloud and also the additional usage of GPUs for our gen AI developments that we are buying for our cloud providers. And then the third, that is the BAU growth. So, these are costs related to BAU growth. Think, for example, about additional data that we have to purchase for product development within our divisions. So, those elements go into the growth bucket. But overall, we don't see that really as an expense. We see that as an investment in the future and future growth for our businesses.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, I have a quick follow-up to your AI strategy. One of the competitors has partnered with Microsoft. Could you please talk about the plus and minus of using an in-house AI compared to outsourcing it to a large tech firm? Why in-house AI, such as Kensho or the hybrid approach fits into S&P overall strategy? Thank you.\nDouglasPeterson: Yeah. Thank you, Owen. And this is something we thought a lot about. And as I started my last comment a few minutes ago, we've been thinking about the AI strategy for over seven years. This isn't something that we're just jumping into right now. We've had a lot of experience of how we can use AI, not only as a productivity tool, but also as a tool to drive growth and new product ideas. We've also been developing our datasets. And as you recall, at the same time when we acquired Kensho, we also came up with the Marketplace. And the Marketplace now has over 225 tiles, which have information and data, which not only can markets use in new ways, we can also use that. So, we've been on an approach to cleaning up our data, making it usable. And we feel that the need for -- as I used the word before, stacking different capabilities and solutions as models, is going to be the way that you can deliver the most valuable insights and solutions to our customers. As an example, you might need to take your data and turn it from being raw data into something that can be used by a model to learn or to be used in order to develop a new application. That data might -- the application might then need a different application on top of it, so that the customer can use it. So, it has capabilities to be able to use in spreadsheets, to be downloaded, to search on it, et cetera. So, we feel that there's a need to have multiple applications. And that's why the hybrid approach is the one that we're going to be pursuing. That doesn't mean that we're not going to work with some of the providers that you just described. We already have a really strong relationship with AWS in our cloud strategy. They are developing a really compelling AI strategy. We've been using over the past, NVIDIA chips. We were one of the first groups that ever were using them in the way they're being used now for AI. We have a really strong relationship with Microsoft. There's also open tools that are being used. We also have people developing our own LLM model. So, we think that we can use this. We think that we have a really good network of people across the company that Ewout just described that are using different types of models. So, we believe that we can have governance, we can have controls. We've had controls in place for the last five years since we've owned Kensho to manage and track everything we're doing in AI. We're going to continue to use that same discipline for everything we're doing in AI to make sure that we're also controlling where we're investing and how we're moving forward. So, it's our belief that a hybrid model is the right one for us and something that's going to create the most value for our shareholders. Thanks Owen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. \nJeffrey Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Edouard, Ewout said, I think, in the description of Mobility growth that there was new store growth for CARFAX new subscription products. That's always a little surprising to me, but good to hear given that I think of it as a more penetrated product. So, just maybe if you can give us some color there. Is this further penetration of the heritage products? Is it something in terms of innovation or new versions of the used car products that are going through an upgrade cycle? And then just any other growth drivers you want to highlight for CARFAX. I think there was a call-out of the service line opportunity on CARFAX for Life. Thank you.\nEdouard Tavernier: Thanks Jeff. So, I'll -- I can give you quite a simple answer to that question. You're right that we work with most dealerships in North America. We work with most global OEMs, and we work with most suppliers. So, in that sense, we feel quite penetrated, because we have relationships with most of the potential customers out there. But we also have a portfolio of offerings, whether it's at CARFAX, Mastermind or elsewhere. And within that portfolio, we have more mature offerings. But we have lots of fairly young offerings which have been developed over the past five or six years and which have a lot of mark-to-market penetration to go. So, if you take a look at the examples that Ewout mentioned, products like CARFAX for Life, used car listings, Mastermind or supply chain and technology are all products which have a huge amount of runway ahead of them, right? They're still younger products. They're evolving very fast. And we have a long way to go before we get to full penetration. So think of -- so if I take a step back and now think about those secular drivers, think of them as follows. We have a lot of product innovation. And from a commercial execution, we have a lot of white space with all of these offerings we've developed over the past five or six years, which are maybe 30%, 40%, 50% penetrated. And then, we have all of these secular tailwinds, which are those massive disruptions going on in the industry, which are creating demand for information. And we see we're very well positioned to capture that demand. Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn. Your line is open.\nRussell Quelch: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end there. A question on fixed income Indices, please. Given you have lots of data on corporate debt at the point of issuance and you now own an incumbent brand in the space post the IHS acquisition. And the underlying market for benchmarking fixed income is accelerating as we see sort of greater participation in that space, do you see this as a major opportunity for S&P Global? And perhaps if so, can you talk about what you're doing to invest behind that opportunity and the speed at which you think that can start delivering increased revenue growth and the degree to which it influences your 10% medium term growth ambition for Indices? Thank you.\nDouglas Peterson: Yeah. Thank you, Russell. Thanks for joining the call today. We -- if you take a step back -- and one of the key drivers of our merger with IHS Markit was to look at what we think is happening with the transformation of capital markets globally. As you know, in the U.S., the capital markets for corporate financing is somewhere north of 70% of the market, probably even higher than that. In Europe, it's probably only about 35%, maybe 40% at the most. And across Asia, it's in the 20% range. We think that, that transition of capital markets globally is going to continue. We see the United States has a very sophisticated set of institutional investors that can go across the entire stack of capital. In Europe, we're starting to see more of that. In fact, one of the signals, which is positive for a business in Europe, is the withdrawal of liquidity programs like the LTRO from the central bank, from the ECB. We're also known now with the combination of the products and services. Starting with Market Intelligence, we have the data services from DVA, which provide prices on over 13 million securities, loans, swaps, other types of fixed income products and loans. That's a really incredible set of data, which we've now added into Capital IQ Pro. And that kind of data is used by the markets. We have the ability to expand into private credit as well. The private credit asset class is right now about $1.5 trillion, of which $1 trillion is probably out in the market in place. And there's another $500 billion which is dry powder, which is going to be available as that asset class continues to grow. We have ways we can serve that. So, if I look across the entire stack of capital, but let's now look only at the debt and credit side. In the debt and credit side, we have credit ratings. We have private information, private market information. We've got pricing information about bonds and loans and swaps. We also are now covering the issuance with issuance data. We have Wall Street Office, WSO, which is supporting the underlying -- underwriting of loans, et cetera. So, we have -- we are covering products, data services, software services across the entire stack of debt and credit. And finally, also in our index business that you asked about, we also have a set of credit products, iTraxx, CDX, et cetera, that are providing information for the markets. And we can use those for Indices. And we're seeing opportunities there not only in the fixed income indices themselves, but also extending into ESG fixed income indices as well as multi-asset class indices. But let me hand it over to Ewout, who can supplement some of what I just said.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. Let me give you a couple of additional data points in addition to what Doug said. If you think about the expenses for the index business, actually this is the only division where the growth initiatives were a little bit higher than the incentive compensation we said. And that's for a good reason. Because as Doug highlighted, there are so many areas of growth initiatives in our index business. Think about fixed income data that we can sell together with the indices itself, multi-asset class, sustainability, factor based thematics, Kensho and so on and so forth. But the most important thing here is, as we have told you at our Investor Day, this is going to be a business that we are committed to deliver double-digit growth in 2025 and 2026 at a level of margins in the high 60s. So, of course, phenomenal outlook for this business, given all the growth initiatives. So, we think it's the right thing to do to invest into this business line, both in fixed income, but also many of the other categories that I just mentioned. So, thanks Russell.\nEnd of Q&A:\nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Russell. And I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and your excellent questions. And I also want to thank Edouard for joining us today. I'm so excited about the progress that we're making at S&P Global and our focus on growth and innovation, which you heard about. I'm thrilled that we're at the forefront of AI and gen AI and that we've got Kensho that's going to help lead us and bring that together. I'm also very excited that we're the center of what's happening in global markets and in particular, sustainability and energy transition. This is something that's changing every day. And we're having the most important dialogues and building the products and solutions that people need. And as always, I want to thank our people. I feel fortunate that this year, I've been able to travel again, and I've been meeting with our people in Tokyo, Dubai, London and Denver. And I'm always inspired by their passion and their commitment to S&P Global. And I'm always impressed by their great work. So, again, thank you, everyone for joining the call today. And I hope that everybody gets a chance to enjoy the rest of the summer, and have a great day. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes this morning's call.

            "name": "Douglas Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to the non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased to report 7% revenue growth in the second quarter, excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods. We saw acceleration in revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices, while growth remained in the high single digits for both Commodity Insights and Mobility. As you will recall, we took decisive action to protect margins beginning in the second quarter of last year and lapping those actions led to a modest contraction in adjusted operating margins year-over-year. Our continued focus on delivering profitable growth and prudently managing our capital allocation combined to drive double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share this quarter. We expect positive revenue growth in all divisions for the remainder of year, as well as continued double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In addition to strong financial results, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy with an emphasis on innovation. We continue to drive rapid advancement in our AI initiatives. We'll talk more about the guiding principles behind our AI strategy in a moment, but we already have a number of internal initiatives and pilot programs. Additionally, in May, we launched a conversational AI assistant called ChatIQ on Capital IQ Pro Labs for internal testing. We'll have more to say about ChatIQ as we get closer to a formal launch to external customers, but it's the first example of how Kensho will deploy LLM-based technology across S&P Global. We're also very excited about some of the developments in our conversations with the largest participants in the private markets. We have an active and incredibly productive dialogue with private equity and private credit customers. We're currently exploring many ways that we can work together to apply our expertise in ratings, analytics and pricing across the credit markets. We'll have more specifics to share here as well as this dialogue develops into commercial opportunities. We're seeing some early, but encouraging signs of stabilization in the macro environment, which leads to a modest improvement to the macro outlook, helping inform our financial guidance. Lastly, illustrating our commitment to disciplined stewardship of the business, we completed the divestiture of Engineering Solutions in the second quarter. We continue to align our goals and operations against the five strategic pillars we introduced at Investor Day. First, I want to provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing from our customers. We've mentioned over the last couple of quarters that we've seen some lengthening of the sales cycle, which we believe was driven by customer sensitivity around spending. Our cross-sell efforts are also creating larger contracts, which take longer to close. While sales cycles remain a bit longer than normal, we've started to see some stabilization and customer conversations have been very constructive. We continue to see high customer retention rates and contract expansions, evidenced by the 8% growth in subscription revenue across our five divisions. The value of our largest and most well-known products, those key brands and benchmarks that the markets rely on is being recognized by our customers in a challenging and sometimes confusing macro environment. Customers are also emphasizing many of the same strategic priorities that we are namely private markets, climate, energy transition and AI. This is evidenced in the 40% growth in energy transition revenue we saw in our Commodity Insights division in the second quarter. As customers navigate a market with higher interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty and rapidly evolving technology, we hear they trust S&P Global and they want to do more with us. We've worked hard to build that trust, and we're as confident as we've ever been in the long-term growth of the company.  Related to Ratings, global billed issuance returned to positive growth, increasing 8% year-over-year in the second quarter. We began to see some signs of stabilizing interest rates among central banks. While we did see some likely event driven issuance in the second quarter ahead of the debt ceiling events in the United States, we're also seeing more economists, including our own, expecting only one or two more rate hikes from major central banks over the remainder of 2023. Overall, issuance saw a higher proportion of refinancing activity with issuers tracking market conditions closely. We expect those pockets of issuance to become more frequent as the market adjusts to the new normal of higher for longer. We're pleased with the strength we saw in corporate issuance with both high yield and investment grade issuance increasing notably year-over-year, though the high yield growth is coming off of a very low comparison. This strength is offset somewhat by a softer environment for bank loans and structured finance. Importantly, rating withdrawals, which are a measure of churn in ratings, are down this year. That illustrates the strength of the S&P brand and the increasing value of a rating in an uncertain credit environment. Next, I'd like to focus on our strategic priority to grow and innovate. The June release of updates and enhancements of Capital IQ Pro was one of the largest and most significant in years. We completely reinvented RatingsDirect on Capital IQ Pro and launched loan pricing and analytics as well. Customers have already shown an incredibly positive reaction to the enhancements on Capital IQ Pro. And these new features have contributed to key competitive displacements and enhanced our competitive positioning. In Commodity Insights, we also launched the first offering of base shipping rates incorporating alternative fuel pricing. This is significant as we expect the maritime sector's use of alternative fuels including liquid natural gas to grow significantly in the coming years. Our Sustainable1 team launched a new nature and biodiversity risk data set, assessing nature related impacts and dependencies across the company's operations. This assessment can be applied across the asset, company and portfolio level, which gives our corporate and investor customers a greater ability to quantify both dependency and impact on location specific ecosystems. As we introduced last quarter, our Vitality revenue metric consists revenue derived from our new or substantially enhanced products. We're pleased that in the second quarter, Vitality revenue held steady at 11% of total revenue. I'm both pleased and impressed that the top four contributors to our Vitality revenue in the quarter came from four different divisions, clearly demonstrating that our commitment to innovation and growth spans the entire organization. Turning now to a topic that I know is on everyone's mind, artificial intelligence. I wanted to provide some color on S&P Global's key advantages and the guiding principles that will govern our use and the implementation of AI, both internally and within our products. We're thrilled with the progress that our teams have made building, testing and implementing tools in various use cases across the organization. While Kensho gives us an incredible advantage in this arena, it isn't our only one. The datasets we have, large, proprietary and truly differentiated, create a remarkable advantage for S&P Global as well. Our trusted brands also allow us to have conversations with industry partners, technology infrastructure providers and customers with credibility. We, through our brands, are known and trusted, and we know that trust will play a huge role in the success of any AI based products that come to market in the coming years. As we more fully embrace the technological advances of our era, we need to make sure we do so with prudence and discipline. Particularly given the investment necessary to develop AI driven tools, we want to take each step with a keen focus on creating customer value rather than simply creating tools because the technology exists. We will allocate the necessary capital to these new projects based on our confidence in the strategic and financial impact on the company. While Kensho is deeply engaged in AI research within S&P Global, we want to make sure we aren't dogmatic in our approach. We'll leverage leading technology regardless of whether it was developed at Kensho, developed elsewhere within the divisions or come via a vendor or a partner. Lastly, we want to continue our practice of aggressively defending and protecting our intellectual property and data. We have safeguards and restrictions embedded in our contracts that ensure third parties and customers cannot independently monetize or build commercial products with our data without our consent and our economic participation. We're committed to transparency with our shareholders, and we'll provide regular updates on our new product launches as they take place. We'll move fast. And we'll also make the necessary investments in time and resources to ensure success. Shifting now to how we lead and inspire. During the second quarter, we further demonstrated our commitment to transparency and accountability through the publication of our Annual Sustainability Impact Report and TCFD Report. We also published for the first time our annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, highlighting our commitment to building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive company and world. We're honored that so many respected organizations have recognized the efforts that we have made to build a company that always pursues excellence. As you can see on this slide, we received recognition not just for our efforts in sustainability and equality, but also in our governance and board oversight and our civic contributions. I've never been more proud to be part of S&P Global. Of course, disciplined leadership means delivering on our ongoing operational and financial outcomes. We are pleased with the strong execution across all divisions this quarter. We saw positive revenue growth in all of our divisions in the second quarter, including accelerating revenue growth in Market Intelligence, Ratings and Indices. While our trailing 12-month margins have contracted 90 basis points year-over-year, we expect that trend to improve as we progress through this year and lap the issuance headwinds we saw through most of last year. With half of the year behind us, we still see many of the same macroeconomic factors impacting our business through the remainder of the year. While we no longer expect a technical recession globally, we do expect headwinds to persist from an economic slowdown, primarily in financial services end markets. We expect to continue to benefit from secular trends, though near term volatility can impact different parts of the business in different ways. While these market expectations are mostly unchanged from the first half, we wanted to reiterate our confidence in the multi-year financial targets we put out for divisions and for the consolidated company at Investor Day. As you know, our Ratings financial results and guidance are closely tied to billed issuance. And for 2023, we now expect issuance to be up approximately 4% to 8% for the full year, up one point from our prior expectation. Our latest Ratings research group forecast calls for a decline in global market issuance, though also slightly improved from last quarter. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from billed issuance with divergence this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign international public finance, which don't impact billed issuance. We have completed our July 2023 global refinancing study. And you can see one of the reasons for our for our optimism Ratings business over the next several years. There is over $8 trillion of debt rated by S&P Global maturing through 2026 and nearly $13 trillion maturing through 2028. This, in addition to assumed improvements in the macro environment over the next few years, gives us great confidence in our ability to drive profitable multiyear growth in Ratings. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen, who is going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout? Ashish, this is Doug. Can you please repeat the question? You talked about sales cycle for all divisions or for a specific product? I'm sorry, I didn't pick up your question. Got it. Thank you. Well, first of all, we've seen that in the last quarter and going forward that people are thinking very cautiously about expense management, especially in the financial services sector. This is an area where people have been looking at how they're going to be managing their own expenses. They're looking at the environment, which we described as quite difficult, given the inflation, given the interest rate environment. There's not a lot of deal flow. So, this is where we're mainly seeing slowdown in some of the sales cycle, although this stabilized in the second quarter. It actually -- we started seeing in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year and now we're seeing it in the second quarter, but it did stabilize.  As you recall, we also have some cases where it's taking us longer to renegotiate with our customers because we're bringing them more value. We're bringing together multiple products. So, sometimes consolidating products and consolidating contracts takes a little bit more. But let me hand it over to Edouard since he's on the call as well tell us a little bit about what he's seeing in the Mobility sector in the same sense. Thanks Ashish. Thanks Heather. Thanks Seth, and welcome. Thanks Manav. Thank you, Toni. Let me just take a step back one second and talk about what we're hearing in the market. I've been traveling this year. And I've been in every continent -- I've been except for Africa and Australia. But I've been around the world. I've been traveling a lot. And in every single conversation I have, we talk about sustainability, climate, ESG, energy transition. This is on everyone's mind. And depending on where you are in the world, it's either moving faster, maybe a little bit slower in the U.S. than it had been before. But there's also a shift going on in the way that regulators and investors think about their accountability to deliver their own views on climate change and on energy transition. The investors and regulators no longer want whoever is managing their money or who they're regulating to just make a decision based blindly on a score. They want them to have their own opinion based on their own analysis and building models from the bottom up. So, when you think about that shift taking place in the market, you then -- we bring the kind of data which has time series on it. We've had information that goes back 15, 20, 30 years. Trucost last quarter grew 38%. Our climate service, which is something that people are using for modeling climate change and physical risk, that grew 78%. So, we're seeing that some of these -- I call them, proprietary data or modeling services that we have are really in high growth and high demand. As you know, we also built a climate credit analytics model with Oliver Wyman. That grew over 50% in the second quarter. And so, we see across the globe that people are starting to make decisions themselves and they can no longer rely on just one single data input. They need to have the data.  So, I think that we have a great head start by having bought Trucost seven years ago. We had the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability products, which started over 20 years ago. And let me hand it over to Edouard, who can give a little bit of color also for the automotive and mobility sector. Thanks Toni. Thanks George. Well, as we've talked about over many years, the sensitivity to the price of oil in the Commodity Insights business is actually not very important to get to really low oil prices, like below the 60s into the 50s and 40s. And similarly, the same thing happens. It needs to get well over $100 before it starts creating sensitivity to the market or the industry. What we're actually seeing is a lot of interest and a lot of growth outside of what would be oil and gas. As you know, we have a large sustainability set of products and climate change products, energy transition within Commodity Insights. We also see a lot of interest and lot of growth in what we've done in terms of combining the product sets from the old Platts business with the E&R from IHS Markit. This is where you're taking prices and benchmarks and adding in forecasting research and analytics. So, we see a lot of interest in what we're doing. Our customers are asking for more. And we're layering on top of that artificial intelligence tools, tools, analytical better vision, better charting capabilities, ability to use our platforms more simply. We've taken multiple products and combined them into one or two solutions. So, across the board, we're seeing that our clients need more. They need to understand more about what's happening in the energy market. So, the sensitivity to the price of oil really doesn't kick-in until the oil price drops a lot or gets really, really expensive. Thanks George. Thanks Faiza. Thanks Alex. Thank you, Jeff. Andrew, let me start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Ewout. I want to go back to a period six and seven years ago when we first made our investment in Kensho and around the -- and we started thinking about what the future was going to look like. And we actually see that future playing right now. We felt that in five years from then, which is now -- and 10 years from then, which is five years from now, that people like us would be making decisions assisted by artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. And in the last year or so, it's become apparent that there's another leg to that stool. It's not just artificial intelligence and machine learning. It's also generative AI. We've been embracing that across the company. Kensho has developed an expertise in different types of generative AI models. They are a go-to source in the company for learning about what we can do and what are the different models we could be applying.  As you saw in our prepared remarks, we have a governance approach around AI, which is to ensure that we're always thinking about our customers. We have a hybrid methodology of philosophy about using multiple types of models and sources whether that's internally driven from Kensho or the divisions or externally from open sources from partnerships. When you look at the needs for developing AI solutions, you end up actually having to stack multiple models on top of each other. And you require really careful management of your data, so that you can protect it as well as ensure that it will be then used and displayed in the right way. And then the third part of our governance is to ensure that we're all protecting our data. This is one of the first things we did when we started seeing generative AI models. We took a step back to make sure that we could protect our data and our IP. But let me hand it over to Ewout and then over to Edouard talk a little bit more about some of the things we're seeing in the company. Okay. Thanks Craig. Let me give you some color just on the issuance market generally and then dig into a couple of questions you asked. Overall, as you know, in the last quarter, the issuance was strong. It was up 8% billed issuance, including bank loans. Our bank loans is actually quite weak during the quarter. But the -- we saw, on the other hand, a lot of volatility and a lot of lumpiness in that issuance. There were some characteristics of markets like corporates in the U.S. was up 80%. Overall investment grade globally was up was up 20%. It in the U.S. Overall, it was up 19%, et cetera. And then overall, high yield was up 90% during the quarter. But on the other hand, structured credit CLOs were down 46% in Europe, 42% in the U.S. So, there's a lot of lumpiness in markets, and that has to do with uncertainty as to ratings, what's happening with interest rates, what's happening with inflation, yield, et cetera, spread. So, there's a lot of market instability still out there. We saw yesterday the U.S. fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points. This morning, the ECB raised interest rates by 25 basis points. So, the markets are looking for some stability of rates and spreads growth rates, et cetera.  Now with that backdrop, let me give you what are a couple of the forecast that we have for the rest of the year. We've increased our range for billed issuance for the rest of the year from a range of 4% to 8%. The previous was 3% to 7% at the last quarter, and the quarter before that is actually 2% to 6%. So, we've seen it improving throughout the year, what we expect for the rest of the year. And if you look at the -- what we're expecting for the rest of the year, if you look at 4% to 8% and with the guidance range we just gave, it means that we're going to be growing in kind of the mid double-digit range for the rest of the year in billed issuance.  A couple of the different areas I can share with you. As you know, our Ratings research team produces forecasts and summaries of what they're going to see going forward. We use that as one of the inputs for billed issuance. It's a different methodology than the billed issuance, but I want to give you that information anyway. We see the corporates growing at about 13% for the rest of the year with a range between 5% and 20%. Financial services flat for the rest of the year, with a range that could be down as much as 5%, up 4%. Structured finance down about 13% for the year, with a range of down 18% to down 8%. And then U.S. public finance could be down about 5%, with a range down 10% or up 2%. So, these are the factors that we're using. We are expecting that once we see these factors I mentioned like inflation, interest rates, spreads, et cetera, as that starts to improve, we think we'll see a better outcome.  One last thing I want to mention is M&A. M&A has been incredibly weak. This last quarter, second quarter, it was one of the weakest levels we've seen. It was as low as the second quarter of 2020 when we saw the beginning of the pandemic when everything came to a halt. I've been speaking with a lot of banks to understand what their outlook is for M&A, because that's a big driver of levered loans of the lending market, of the high yield market, et cetera. We're seeing from the bankers that we're speaking with that they're expecting that at the end of this year and into the first quarter of next year, they're expecting that M&A will pick up again as the market conditions improve. They've told me that there's a pretty large backlog and big pipeline waiting to -- for people to start doing deals, but it's not happening as long as there's still some uncertainty in the markets. So, thanks Craig. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Thank you, Russell. Thanks for joining the call today. We -- if you take a step back -- and one of the key drivers of our merger with IHS Markit was to look at what we think is happening with the transformation of capital markets globally. As you know, in the U.S., the capital markets for corporate financing is somewhere north of 70% of the market, probably even higher than that. In Europe, it's probably only about 35%, maybe 40% at the most. And across Asia, it's in the 20% range. We think that, that transition of capital markets globally is going to continue. We see the United States has a very sophisticated set of institutional investors that can go across the entire stack of capital. In Europe, we're starting to see more of that. In fact, one of the signals, which is positive for a business in Europe, is the withdrawal of liquidity programs like the LTRO from the central bank, from the ECB. We're also known now with the combination of the products and services. Starting with Market Intelligence, we have the data services from DVA, which provide prices on over 13 million securities, loans, swaps, other types of fixed income products and loans. That's a really incredible set of data, which we've now added into Capital IQ Pro. And that kind of data is used by the markets. We have the ability to expand into private credit as well. The private credit asset class is right now about $1.5 trillion, of which $1 trillion is probably out in the market in place. And there's another $500 billion which is dry powder, which is going to be available as that asset class continues to grow. We have ways we can serve that. So, if I look across the entire stack of capital, but let's now look only at the debt and credit side. In the debt and credit side, we have credit ratings. We have private information, private market information. We've got pricing information about bonds and loans and swaps. We also are now covering the issuance with issuance data. We have Wall Street Office, WSO, which is supporting the underlying -- underwriting of loans, et cetera. So, we have -- we are covering products, data services, software services across the entire stack of debt and credit. And finally, also in our index business that you asked about, we also have a set of credit products, iTraxx, CDX, et cetera, that are providing information for the markets. And we can use those for Indices. And we're seeing opportunities there not only in the fixed income indices themselves, but also extending into ESG fixed income indices as well as multi-asset class indices. But let me hand it over to Ewout, who can supplement some of what I just said."

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we'll be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics unless explicitly noted otherwise. We're pleased with the financial performance of the business in second quarter. The clear indicator is that the secular tailwinds continue to drive growth across our largest products, though some minor headwinds impact smaller parts of the business. Adjusted earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of 4% revenue growth and a 6% reduction in fully diluted share count, partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of operating margin compression. Excluding the impact of Engineering Solutions in all periods, but including approximately $10 million from this year's tuck-in acquisitions, revenue growth would have been 7%. Revenue in the quarter was driven by growth across all remaining divisions, including Ratings, which saw a pickup in issuance activity the quarter. While the debt markets remain a challenging environment for issuers, this is the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement. As Doug mentioned, we also saw acceleration in revenue growth across Market Intelligence and Indices with continued impressive growth in Commodity Insights and Mobility. We will walk through the divisions in more detail a moment. Adjusted expenses were up 6% year-over-year, which we'll also discuss in more detail.  Turning to our strategic growth initiatives. Sustainability and energy transition revenue increased 17% to $70 million in the quarter, driven by climate and physical risk products and CI's energy transition products. We continue to see a shift in customer appetite away from buying pure ESG scores and towards more purchases of raw data, which we believe will benefit S&P Global in the long run. We consistently hear from customers that our Trucost data set is higher quality than the data from many competitors. And the breadth of our offerings across the commodity markets and ESG Indices will contribute to strong growth for multiple years. That said, we are seeing some signs of adverse market sentiment, particularly from large financial institutions in the United States that are impacting our revenue growth in the short-term as others in the space have also called out. We believe these headwinds are temporary, while the growth drivers are secular. Even though sustainability and energy transition revenue currently represents only a low single digit percent of our total revenue, it is an important strategic driver of long-term growth. We will continue to make the necessary investments in people, data, product development and partnerships to drive long-term growth.  Given the uncertainty around the regulatory landscape and the political climate, particularly in the U.S., we can no longer confidently reiterate the previous 2026 target of $800 million in sustainability and energy transition. We'll continue to report this metric on a quarterly basis. And we will assess the potential for long-term revenue contribution from these important products as the market continues to evolve.  Private market solutions revenue increased 5% to $106 million, driven by strong growth in Market Intelligence products for private markets, offset by declines in Ratings private markets revenue. Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, of $343 million in the second quarter, representing a 14% increase compared to prior year. Now turning to synergies. In the second quarter of 2023, we recognized $144 million of expense savings due to cost synergies. And our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $574 million and we continue to expect our year-end run rate to be approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well with $17 million in synergies achieved in the second quarter and an annualized run rate of $68 million. Turning to expense growth. Total adjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year as we are beginning to lap the proactive expense management actions taken last year. We saw a $23 million favorable impact from FX in the quarter, and the divestiture of Engineering Solutions was favorable by $50 million. We also generated incremental cost synergies that lowered expense growth by approximately $80 million relative to last year. As you will recall, we lowered accruals for incentive compensation in the second quarter of last year. This was done to reflect the headwinds we were facing, predominantly in our Ratings business. Incentive compensation resets each year, so we're seeing the natural increase in those expenses beginning this quarter. Incentive compensation and commissions were the largest single contributor to expense growth in the second quarter. The year-over-year impact of incentive compensation will be a similar driver of expense growth in the third quarter, though we expect expense growth to moderate meaningfully in the fourth quarter as the comparison becomes more favorable. The year-over-year impact of the reset of incentive compensation was a key driver of expense growth in each of our divisions, and we expect to see the same quarterly phasing in our division margin results in the third quarter and fourth quarter as well. Lastly, we continue to invest to drive long-term growth, and that was reflected this quarter. Core investment growth represents the investments we are making in strategic initiatives, people, cloud as well the incremental investments we are making to fund our AI development at Kensho and within the divisions. Most importantly, we continue to expect approximately 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the full year. Now, let's turn to the division results. Market Intelligence revenue increased 6% driven by strong growth in data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions. Desktop grew 4% in the second quarter driven by strong subscription growth as ACV growth outpaced revenue in the quarter, though this was offset by some modest softness in non-recurring sales. Renewal rates remained strong in the mid to high 90s. Data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions both benefited from solid growth in subscription based offerings. Credit and risk solutions continues to see strong new sales for RatingsXpress and RatingsDirect products, as well as double-digit growth in credit analytics. Adjusted expenses increased 7% year-over-year due to the drivers previously discussed. Operating profit increased 4%, and the operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 32.3%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins improved to 220 basis points. As we mentioned last quarter, we know the comparisons will get easier as we progress through the year. And we continue to expect improvements in those products within Enterprise Solutions that depend on capital markets activity. We also expect revenue synergies to begin positively impacting results in the back half of the year. Last quarter, we signaled that we may come in at the low end of our previous guidance range. We're not trying to signal deterioration since April, though we do see modestly elevated risk to the back half. Given the heightened uncertainty, particularly within sustainability and energy transition, we're taking the formal step at this point to modestly lower the guidance by 50 basis points on revenue and operating margin. Now turning to Ratings. In the second quarter, we saw a spike in issuance activity, particularly in May, which from a seasonality perspective is a very important month for debt markets. Revenue increased 7% year-over-year. This marks the third quarter in a row of sequential improvement in transaction revenue, and we saw investment grade and high yield activity pick up. Non-transaction revenue increased 4% primarily due to annual fees and growth in CRISIL, though non-transaction growth was tempered by continued declines in ICR revenue.  Adjusted expenses increased 12%. This resulted in a 4% increase in operating profit and a 180 basis point decrease in operating margin to 57.7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins are still impacted by last year's revenue declines.  We raised our billed issuance assumption for 2023 and expect issuance to increase in the range of 4% to 8%, reflecting the stronger issuance trends in the first half. Our outlook for transaction revenue for the full year has improved somewhat, though some of this is offset by non-transaction revenue due to greater weakness in ICR than we initially anticipated. The net result is a one point increase in our Ratings revenue guidance range and we now expect Ratings revenue growth of 5% to 7%. While we expect expense growth to moderate as progress through the year, we are reiterating our margin guidance. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue growth increased 8% driven by double-digit growth in both price assessments and energy and resources data and insights. Growth was tempered somewhat by declines in the upstream business. Upstream data and insights declined approximately 2% year-over-year. While subscription ACV growth is positive, we have deprioritized one-time sales in upstream as we focus on higher quality recurring revenue products. As such, we are lowering our expectations modestly for upstream for the full year and now expect that business line to be flat to down slightly for the full year compared to our previous expectation for low single digit growth. Price assessments and energy and resources data and insights grew 12% and 11%, respectively compared to prior year driven by strong performance in crude oil and fuels and refining products and strong commercial momentum in subscription products across both business lines. Advisory and transaction revenue also grew 12% driven by strength in global trading services and strong performance in conference revenue in the quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 5%. Operating profit for CI increased 12%, and operating margin improved 160 basis points to 45.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have improved 220 basis points. We see stronger trends for our benchmarks, data and insights, and we enjoy a position of trust in the commodity markets. We continue to expect strong subscription growth through the second half, and there is no change to our outlook for revenue or margins. In our Mobility division, revenue increased 10% year-over-year driven by continued new business growth in CARFAX, the contribution from Market Scan within the Dealer segment and strong underwriting volumes in the financials and other business lines. Dealer revenue increased 12% year-over-year driven by the continued benefit of price increases within the last year and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for life and used car subscription products. Manufacturing grew 5% year-over-year driven by elevated recall activity and continued strength in marketing solutions. Financials and other increased 9% as the business line continues to see healthy underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment similar to last quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 13% due primarily to the drivers I discussed previously, but also due to the inorganic contribution to expenses from the Market Scan acquisition. This resulted in a 5% increase in adjusted operating profit and 160 basis points of operating margin contraction year-over-year. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 60 basis points. As we noted last quarter, we expect the Market Scan acquisition to contribute approximately 150 basis points of revenue growth in the full year, though we expect it to be modestly dilutive to adjusted margins in 2023. And our guidance for Mobility for the full year is unchanged. Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 3%, primarily due to strong growth in exchange rated derivatives volume and data subscriptions, partially offset by a modest decline in asset-linked fees. Asset-linked fees were down 1% year-over-year primarily driven by mix shift into lower priced index ETF products, partially offset by market depreciation and modest year-over-year net inflows. Importantly, this decline was due to mix shift, not due to price concessions or renegotiated contracts. Exchange rated derivatives revenue increased 17% on increased trading volumes across all key contracts. Data and custom subscriptions increased 3% year-over-year driven by continued strength in end-of-day contract growth. During the quarter, expenses increased 15% year-over-year due to reasons previously discussed. Operating profit in Indices decreased 2%, and the operating margin decreased 330 basis points from last year's high watermark to 68.6%. Trailing 12-month margins have contracted 30 basis points. As reflected in today's results, we've seen market depreciation, the mix of AUM is playing an increasingly important role in asset-linked fees revenue. And net inflows remain somewhat unpredictable in the near term. All of this is reflected in our new higher guidance range.  As we mentioned last quarter, our continued investments to drive long-term growth as well as the timing of expense recognition will impact the quarterly phasing of our margins. We expect relatively high expense growth in Indices in the third quarter as well before expense growth moderates in the fourth quarter. This will ultimately allow us to deliver margins within the new higher guidance range of 67.5% to 68.5%. Now, let's move to the latest views from our economists who are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.9% in 2023. We're no longer calling for a global recession, though we do expect lower-than-normal economic activity through the remainder of year. We continue to expect inflation above the target rates of central banks and energy prices like crude oil to remain above historical averages as well.  As we consider how all of this will ultimately impact our financial performance in 2023, let's turn to our guidance. This slide represents our GAAP guidance for headline metrics. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the results through the first half as well as our most recent views on the macroeconomic environment and market conditions. Our full year guidance is largely unchanged on a consolidated basis as outperformance in Ratings and Indices is offset by slightly lower expectations for Market Intelligence as we've begun to signal last quarter. We have provided the granular guidance on corporate unallocated expense, deal related amortization, interest expense and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site.  The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by division, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously.  In conclusion, we're pleased with the results from the second quarter, particularly with the return to strong double-digit growth in both Ratings transaction revenue and our adjusted diluted EPS. With multiple variables at play in the markets, we're encouraged by the fact that the tailwinds tend to impact the largest parts of our business, while the headwinds are impacting relatively small contributors to our financial results. It takes tremendous effort from many talented people to deliver results like these. And I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their relentless drive to power global markets. We're looking forward to delivering a strong second half of the year.  And with that, I would like to invite Edouard Tavernier, President of S&P Global Mobility, to join us. And I will turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Good morning, Heather. This is Ewout. Welcome first of all, to the call. So, just to be very clear about sustainability and energy transition. We're not backing away from the $800 million target. We are currently backing away from the timing around that, because we're not 100% certain anymore that we can hit that by 2026. Why? Because we are still continuing to see very positive trends with respect to the longer term secular trends around ESG. We think that all of those -- underlying drivers are still there. But in the short-term, we are impacted by some uncertainties, uncertainties about the regulatory landscape, the political climate, mostly in U.S. We're seeing some on the buy side firms reconsidering what they want to do around sustainability. But we see continued actually pocket of strength in our business. Think about our climate activities, think about ESG raw data, energy transition, all of these products continue to grow very well.  I also would like to point out that we expect a reacceleration of our sustainability and energy transition revenues growth in the second half of this year. So, growth will come back in the second half of this year. And we're still very positive and optimistic about the outlook for the medium and long-term. Yeah. Good morning, Seth. First of all, I think this is exactly in line with our expectations, the margin development in Ratings. And let me explain why that's the case. The same what we said for the company as a whole, we are seeing now also this quarter for Ratings with respect to the expense reset of incentive compensation compared to last year. Last year, in the second quarter, we saw a large change in the accrual for incentive compensation across the board, but also in Ratings, both for the short-term and the long-term incentive compensation accruals. And we are resetting that for this year based on the strong performance of the company and the strong performance of the Ratings business as well. So, we are overall very positive about the medium and long-term perspective and outlook. If you look at where we are from a trailing 12-month perspective for margin for Ratings, we're at 55.2. We're guiding this year to 56 to 57. And then as you know, we have our IR targets for 2025 and 2026, 58 to 60. So, you will continue to see strong margin improvement of Ratings over the next few periods. Good morning, Manav. You're absolutely right. Where we are with the business at this moment is exactly the same place where we thought the business would be when we had our last call in April. The business is performing in line with expectations. And the only reason why we are making the change with respect to the guidance range has to do with the short-term uncertainty around sustainability and energy transition. So, to give you a little bit more color around it. If you look at some of the key drivers of Market Intelligence, ACV growth is good. Closing rates are good. Retention rates are good. User growth is good. We see a lot of new product launches bringing to the -- being brought market by Market Intelligence. So, overall, we believe the business is in a very good shape. At the end of the day, we are very excited about the potential of Market Intelligence, particularly combining the two companies together in that segment and the potential it will have with respect to commercial growth, and we fully expect to hit our Investor Day targets for Market Intelligence. Absolutely, Faiza. And let me combine all three of your questions in one answer. So, first of all, the business is seeing very healthy flows. We have seen very strong U.S. equity flows at $53 billion. We have also seen very solid fixed income flows for the quarter. That was at $6.5 billion. So, we think the business is seeing really the positive impact from overall positive sentiments around the markets we have seen over the last couple of weeks and months. So, that's first.  Then with respect to the outlook for the remainder of the year in terms of our assumptions, we have assumed no further market depreciation from the June 30 level onwards. And we have also -- looking at the ETD volumes, we have assumed that volumes for ETDs remain at a positive place, but coming down slightly from where we were in the first half of this year.  I also would like to point out that if you look at where we ended the quarter from an overall AUM perspective, we're about 19% up compared to the point where we were at the end of the second quarter of last year. So, certainly, the starting point for the second half of this year is very strong.  If you look at mix, yeah, there is always going to be some kind of a mix in flows to certain products versus other products. We have seen that in the past as well. That will normally normalize over time. So, we think this is more short-term noise due to that flow seasonality. But from a medium and long-term perspective, we believe that there is still a correlation between AUM levels as a key driver of overall AUM fees growth for the business. So, in other words, if you combine all of these trends together, we're very happy that we could raise the guidance for the Index business for the second time in a row and we're very optimistic about the outlook for the remaining of the year for the Index business. Happy to clarify that, Alex. So, what I've said before is we think the business in all the aspects is performing in line with expectations what we had a quarter ago. So, we don't see any deterioration in any of the underlying business lines within Market Intelligence. And it is actually exactly where we thought it would be at this point in time and also with respect to the book of business, the ACV growth, retention levels, sales cycles and so on, we see exactly what we would expect to see at this moment. But as we have highlighted during the call, there is uncertainty about sustainability and energy transition, particularly ESG scores is a part of the revenue stream for the Market Intelligence business. And we are a bit prudent here deliberately in order to change the guidance here. We're not pointing to any point in this guidance range. We're just lowering the guidance at this point in time. But as we have said, we are actually really positive and optimistic about the outlook of Market Intelligence. We see a lot of positive trends underneath the business and I've mentioned those before. But let me just give another couple of examples of that. The combination of the capabilities is working. So, we're seeing a lot of new products that is in development with respect to combining Market Intelligence and financial services of IHS Markit. We see increased value realization with customers and actually a slight pickup in pricing in the business. We should also benefit from trends of consolidation of data vendors and we are one of the beneficiaries of that. So, many positive things that are positive trends for Market Intelligence. We're just really prudent, and that's the main reason around the sustainability revenues in the near-term. Yes. Thank you so much for that question. You're absolutely right that we see quite some seasonality in margins in Market Intelligence, but by the way, also in several of our other segments during this year. And that has to do with the reason that I mentioned before around incentive compensation where we saw a large pullback in incentive compensation in the second and third quarter of last year. So, that is what we are going to lap this year. But then in the end, in the fourth quarter, we have much easier comps. And just to give you a data point for the company as a whole, that would mean that we are expecting from an expense perspective that expenses for the company as a whole for this year will still end up in low single digit growth territory for the company as a whole. So, you would expect there for that reason that the fourth quarter margins are going to be really strong. And the expense growth in the fourth quarter is going to be really low in order to achieve those outcomes.  So, also, let me give you another data point in terms of margin expansion for the company as a whole. We still expect 60 to 160 basis points margin expansion for the company as a whole. And for Market Intelligence, you're also looking at quite a significant increase in margins over the next two quarters from a trailing 12-month level now of 32.4 to a range of 33.5 to 34.5 for the whole year of 2023. So, yeah, third quarter, still a little bit depressed by the expense seasonality, but fourth quarter very strong margins and expenses really low. That's the overall trend that you should expect for Market Intelligence and the other divisions. Tom, one of the things that I'm really excited about is that on the one hand, we have Kensho, which is a relatively small group, but really an innovation accelerator within the company. And then we have all of our colleagues around the world, because we have so many data scientists, technology engineers, data experts, experts in a lot of specific areas and fields around the company. And you have to bring all of those together in order to get the acceleration with the opportunities that generative AI and large language models are bringing for us as a company. So, Kensho is focusing on a couple of areas that will have the biggest impact for the company as a whole. This could be use cases that we are developing. But also think about collecting the data and structuring the data in token sets that are the best readable for large language models. And that's actually, from a technical perspective, a really important challenge.  But the good thing is Kensho has been doing that kind of work already for the last five years. We have experience we're working with AI for the last five years. We know how to prioritize this for the last five years. We know how to track the economic benefits and we have been doing that for the last five years. So, we have a lot of experience around dealing with this, and we're not trying to invent this for the first time at this moment. But then on the other hand, we also have the crowdsourcing. So, we have a lot of colleagues that are contributing to these kind of initiatives to collect data for large language models and many other initiatives we are experimenting across the board. So, let me hand it over to Edouard, because there's also a lot of great experimentation and development going on in Mobility. Thanks Alex. Just generally, I would like to say expenses are under control. They are in line with expectations. And we expect the overall expense growth for the full year to be relatively modest.  So, let me give you a little bit more color around this. So, the key driver of the expense growth this quarter was a swing in the incentive compensation that we already discussed. As I mentioned, also expect that to create elevated expenses in the third quarter, and then we will see it significantly coming down in the fourth quarter. We still expect to hit our margin targets for this year. And as I said before, I think it's also may be good to point that overall we're looking at expenses in absolute dollars that are on a declining trend. So, we have now seen two quarters in a row that in absolute dollars, our expense is coming down. And actually, the third quarter, we expect sequentially further that our expenses will be down relative to the second quarter. So, very much in line with expectations.  Your question about what is going into the growth bucket? It's a couple of areas that go in the growth bucket. The first is our strategic investment spend. So that is the $150 million budget that we have for this year to invest in some of our key initiatives to drive future growth. The second is the additional spend with respect to cloud and also the additional usage of GPUs for our gen AI developments that we are buying for our cloud providers. And then the third, that is the BAU growth. So, these are costs related to BAU growth. Think, for example, about additional data that we have to purchase for product development within our divisions. So, those elements go into the growth bucket. But overall, we don't see that really as an expense. We see that as an investment in the future and future growth for our businesses. Yes. Let me give you a couple of additional data points in addition to what Doug said. If you think about the expenses for the index business, actually this is the only division where the growth initiatives were a little bit higher than the incentive compensation we said. And that's for a good reason. Because as Doug highlighted, there are so many areas of growth initiatives in our index business. Think about fixed income data that we can sell together with the indices itself, multi-asset class, sustainability, factor based thematics, Kensho and so on and so forth. But the most important thing here is, as we have told you at our Investor Day, this is going to be a business that we are committed to deliver double-digit growth in 2025 and 2026 at a level of margins in the high 60s. So, of course, phenomenal outlook for this business, given all the growth initiatives. So, we think it's the right thing to do to invest into this business line, both in fixed income, but also many of the other categories that I just mentioned. So, thanks Russell."

            "content": "Thank you, Doug. And hi, Ashish. So, in the Mobility sector, we're seeing trends similar to what Doug has described. In the sense that in the first couple of quarters of the year, we did see a slight softening of retention rates and a slight lengthening of sales cycle. And what that pertains to is the normalization of the sector after a couple of years of really, really elevated kind of retention rates. So, at this point, we feel the situation has normalized. They stabilized. Our retention rates remain very, very strong by historical standards, slightly less elevated than the past couple of years and business -- kind of new business momentum is now stabilized. Thank you. Hi, Toni. A couple of good examples actually of what Doug was talking about in Mobility, and opportunities we're able to unlock now as part of S&P Global in partnership with S1. As Doug mentioned, Climanomics, we launched in June e-version [ph] of Climanomics, which assesses physical risk for the automotive sector, where we were able to feed all our supply chain data on the automotive sector within Climanomics platform. That's one example.  The bigger one, actually, is we are now building a carbon accounting data set for the Mobility sector. And as you know, in automotive, the key question mark is Scope 3 emissions pertaining to vehicles on the road and the upstream supply chain of the battery. In this space, we have a unique opportunity with our proprietary data to become the sort of record of carbon accounting data for the automotive industry. So, a couple of examples here about how raw data itself combined with our S1 expertise can really create some unique and defensible products. Thank you, Ewout. Thank you, Doug. And just to add to what you said, I want to bring up one example of how we're thinking about innovating at scale with a new technology like generative AI. And as Doug said, our experience in earlier forms of AI and our cloud investment over the past two years, I think, puts us in good stead to harness this new technology, but I think we have to recognize there's a step change here.  And so, as we think about how do we enable our organization, one of the big strengths of our strategy is to upskill people and make sure we familiarize them with this technology. Earlier in July, within Mobility, we actually launched internal solution called autopilot, which is all about bringing the tool to hundreds of our colleagues within the Mobility division. And we've already seen dozens of use cases developed over the past two or three weeks and we learn every day from this particular solution. We learn not just about large language models, but we learn about data curation, we learn about what kind of UI do we need to develop, what kind of business governance do we need around it. And that's a great example of one of the ways in which as an organization, we're learning and we're harnessing this new technology. Thank you. Thanks Jeff. So, I'll -- I can give you quite a simple answer to that question. You're right that we work with most dealerships in North America. We work with most global OEMs, and we work with most suppliers. So, in that sense, we feel quite penetrated, because we have relationships with most of the potential customers out there. But we also have a portfolio of offerings, whether it's at CARFAX, Mastermind or elsewhere. And within that portfolio, we have more mature offerings. But we have lots of fairly young offerings which have been developed over the past five or six years and which have a lot of mark-to-market penetration to go. So, if you take a look at the examples that Ewout mentioned, products like CARFAX for Life, used car listings, Mastermind or supply chain and technology are all products which have a huge amount of runway ahead of them, right? They're still younger products. They're evolving very fast. And we have a long way to go before we get to full penetration. So think of -- so if I take a step back and now think about those secular drivers, think of them as follows. We have a lot of product innovation. And from a commercial execution, we have a lot of white space with all of these offerings we've developed over the past five or six years, which are maybe 30%, 40%, 50% penetrated. And then, we have all of these secular tailwinds, which are those massive disruptions going on in the industry, which are creating demand for information. And we see we're very well positioned to capture that demand. Thank you, Jeff."

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our media relations team whose contact information can be found in the press release. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to the non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP.  We're pleased to report 3% revenue growth in the first quarter compared to pro forma results in the year ago period. We continue to generate substantial synergies and manage our other expenses with discipline, as demonstrated by the 1% growth in total adjusted expenses in the first quarter. Our focus on top line growth and expense management resulted in an expansion more than 100 basis points in the adjusted margin and a 9% year-over-year growth in adjusted EPS.  In addition to our strong financial results, we also made progress on many of the strategic initiatives we laid out for you at Investor Day. We continue to prioritize innovation in our technology budgets, and reached important milestones in our cloud migration. We also hosted a record-breaking CERAWeek in the first quarter, and we also expanded our lead in AI with Kensho releasing two more commercially available products built on our proprietary AI and machine learning platforms. We'll discuss these important highlights in more detail in a moment. One of the key messages from our Investor Day last December was the introduction of the five pillars that drive our strategy of powering global markets. Beginning this quarter, we’ll be discussing our results using that same framework. We use these pillars as a lens to inform our decisions on capital allocation and organic investment that impact our people, our customers and the communities in which we live and work. First, I want to start with our customers. Delivering value to our customers drives every decision we make at S&P Global. We constantly hear from our customers that they're focused on the same things we are. During the first quarter in almost every customer conversation I had, we discussed energy transition and sustainability, as well as our products that serve private markets. We continue to see evidence of the value we create for our customers.  We saw strong and stable retention rates in the first quarter, with year-over-year improvements in commodity insights and several products and other divisions. As expected and previously discussed, retention rates and mobility have declined modestly, as automotive inventory levels and volumes start to normalize.  We also saw some modest lengthening of the sales cycle in certain parts of the business in the first quarter, as some enterprise customers, particularly in financial services, are understandably focused on margin protection and managing their own expenses. This is a continuation of what we saw on the back half of last year.  As I've met with customers over the last few months, including large automotive OEMs, retail companies, asset managers, banks and others, the recurring theme is that they want to do more with us. There's a large opportunity to raise awareness of the breadth of our product offerings, and customers have been consistently impressed by the products we've introduced to them. That should ultimately improve customer value and our results.  We also look to create quality of life improvements in those customer relationships, and our CI teams have done an excellent job of helping customers migrate to enterprise contracts. That migration reduces contract complexity for our customers, and enhances the overall customer experience in a meaningful way.  Turning to our ratings customers. During the first quarter, global build issuance in aggregate decreased 7% year-over-year. While we saw strong sequential improvement from issuance levels last quarter, the uncertainty in the banking sector that emerged in March muted the impact to build issuance for the whole quarter. Refinancing activity was strong in the first quarter, particularly in high yield and bank loans, though opportunistic issuance remained muted.  We're pleased that build issuance for investment grade increased in the first quarter, though this was largely due to a few very large deals. We're also pleased with the strength we saw in CLOs in the first quarter. The decision we made last year to preserve capacity and maintain the strength of our analytical organization is already proving to be the right call, as our growth in CLOs was particularly strong. Next, I'd like to focus on our strategic priority to grow and innovate. So far this year, we've launched several new products. An example of our product synergies, teams from Platts and IHS Markit worked together to integrate the Platts forward curve into our real-time analytics platform energy studio impact. We preview this innovation at our Investor Day, which provides clients with the most comprehensive and valuable data and insights in the industry while strengthening our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation.  So far this year, we've also introduced new price assessments for black mass in Europe and Asia, and for R-PET in India to improve transparency in pricing of battery raw materials and recycled plastics. We remain focused and disciplined in our M&A, completing the acquisitions of TruSight and ChartIQ within market intelligence and market scan within mobility. These tuck-in acquisitions strengthen our current offerings that we expect even this type of M&A activity to be rare for the rest of the year.  As discussed at Investor Day, we're introducing our vitality revenue metric which consists of revenue derived from new or substantially enhanced products. We're pleased that in the first quarter, vitality revenue constituted 11% of total revenue, consistent with our goal of maintaining a vitality index at or above 10%. Much of this growth will be enabled by enhancements to our own data and technology capabilities.  As we optimize our technology spend to accelerate the pace of innovation, we're thrilled with the progress made in the first quarter. As we disclosed in February, we announced a strategic partnership with Amazon AWS to collaborate in product development and joint go-to-market initiatives. That partnership allows us to further transition workloads to the cloud and decommission our own data centers, three of which we closed just in the first quarter.  Cross organization teams also worked diligently to complete two software systems integrations to ensure that the combined company is operating on unified platforms in the most efficient way possible. Initiatives like these allow us to put more resources behind revenue-generating innovation as well, like the AI-powered products that Kensho has been developing for five years. There is excitement in the field of artificial intelligence, and we're extending our leadership and focusing on innovation that will benefit our customers and increase the value of our products. With the commercial launch of two new products in the first quarter, there are five Kensho branded AI-powered products commercially available today on the S&P Global marketplace. We're very excited about the developments in this field, and we'll discuss our own launches in more detail in the coming months.  Shifting now to how we lead and inspire our people, customers and communities. In the first quarter, we launched the ninth iteration of our people-first initiative, and made investments to expand resources for continuous learning, leadership development, and upskilling through our Central Tech programs. These investments in our people help us attract, retain and develop incredibly talented people, which ultimately lead to better financial results for our shareholders too.  We also continue to lead and inspire the industries we serve as we power global markets. In the first quarter, we published the inaugural Look Forward Report, which outlines the expectations of our economists, analysts, researchers and data experts. This report is a product of our research council at S&P Global, which was formed last year to help us look beyond the near term, and explore the trends that will shape our collective future.  Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, we hosted CERAWeek in Houston, Texas in March. This conference brought together over 8,000 leaders in the energy industry, who participated in over 650 events to help tackle global issues like energy security, energy transition and sustainability, as well as how to navigate the turbulent times in the commodity markets today.  Now looking across the company, we're pleased with the strong execution of all our divisions this quarter. While we continue to see the impact of the issuance environment, our ratings division, we're also seeing signs of revenue stabilization as we begin to lap the challenging issuance conditions that began during the first quarter last year.  We saw positive revenue growth in all of our other divisions in the first quarter, and continued to balance expense managed with strategic organic investment to make sure we're well positioned to accelerate our revenue growth over the next few years. Expenses can of course be seasonal. So we look at the margins on a trailing 12-month basis, and we expect these figures to improve as we progress through the year. As we look through the remainder of the year, I'd like to touch on some of the factors influencing our company's performance. We continue to expect a mild recession this year, though the timing is more likely a few months later, relative to our initial expectations. We also expect to see volatility in various markets, including equities, credit and commodities. We see no change to the secular trends shaping the future opportunities for us, like the shift from active to passive asset management and energy transition.  While these market expectations are mostly unchanged from February, we wanted to highlight the potential impact in the banking market. As we're all aware, the events around regional banks in the U.S. and a major Swiss bank added uncertainty to the markets in March. We do not have material direct exposure to the impacted regional banks, and we do not expect the events in that end market to materially increase the risk to our financial guidance in 2023, or to the medium term targets we laid out in Investor Day.  We do see slightly elevated risk of default rates impacting the broader credit markets, particularly in high yield, which will also inform our updated issuance outlook. Our ratings financial results and guidance are closely tied to build issuance. And for 2023, we now expect build issuance to be up approximately 3% to 7% for the full year.  Our latest ratings research group forecast calls for a decline in global market issuance. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from build issuance, as we've described in recent quarters, with much of the delta this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign and international public finance, which don't impact build issuance.  And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen who's going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout?\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for our 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP.  For the first quarter of 2023, adjusted earnings per share increased 9% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of 3% revenue growth, 100 basis points of operating margin expansion and an 8% reduction in the fully diluted share count. This is an excellent example of strong execution and prudent capital management combining to create long-term shareholder value, and we're pleased with the start to 2023.  Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by growth in market intelligence and strong performance in commodity insights and mobility. This was offset by a lower issuance environment compared to the first quarter of last year, though issuance improved sequentially from the fourth quarter. We'll walk through the deficients in more detail in a moment. Adjusted expenses were up only 1% year-over-year, driven by cost synergies and other operational efficiencies. Adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-over-year, as margins expanded to 46.2%. I'm pleased to report a sustainability and energy transition revenue increase of 27% to $69 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand in sustainability products in MI's climate and physical risk products and CI's energy transition products.  Private market solutions revenue remained at the $100 million level, as growth in products from market intelligence were offset by declines in ratings due to the timing of private market issuance. We still expect growth in private markets this year to be in line with the targets laid out at Investor Day.  Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, was $326 million in the first quarter, representing a 17% increase compared to prior year. Synergies are a key contributor to expense savings and margin expansion this quarter.  In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized $131 million of expense savings due to cost synergies and our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $552 million. And we continue to expect our year-end run rate to be approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well, with $17 million in synergies achieved in the first quarter, and an annualized run rate of $52 million.  Turning to strategic capital allocation, we remain committed to discipline capital management, including investing for long-term growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. We executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR in the first quarter, and we plan to launch a new $1 billion ASR in the coming weeks, leveraging the proceeds of the engineering solutions divestiture and cash on hand.  We have been able to take advantage of market dislocations over the last year to repurchase shares at attractive prices, which allows us to reduce our fully diluted share count by 8% over that time period. Since the close of the merger last year, we have been able to repurchase more than 31% of the shares issued to complete the merger with IHS Markit. We continue to invest in organic growth as well and remain on track to invest $150 million in our 2023 strategic projects. Now let's turn to the deficient results. Market intelligence revenue increased 5% driven by strong growth in data and advisory solutions and credit and risk solutions and favorable commercial conditions overall. That's improved 3.5% in the first quarter, driven in part by strong demand for new content and capabilities supported by the merger, though growth was tempered somewhat by a continuation of the modest softness in financial services that we called out last quarter.  Renewal rates remain strong in the mid to high 90s. Data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions both benefited from solid growth and subscription-based offerings. Credit and risk solutions benefitted from strong new sales for ratings express and ratings direct products. Adjusted expenses were roughly flat year-over-year, as increases in compensation expense, cloud spent and T&E were offset by cost synergies and lower occupancy costs. Operating profit increased 16% and operating margin increased 300 basis points to 32%. Looking at the remainder of 2023, we know the comparisons will get easier as we progress through the year and we continue to expect improvements in those products within enterprise solutions that depend on capital markets activity. We also expect revenue synergies to begin positively impacting results in the back half of the year.  We continue to recognize significant cost synergies as well and remain confident in our ability to deliver accelerating growth and full year margin expansion in market intelligence. While we are not changing the formal guidance ranges for revenue or adjusted operating margin, we do see increased uncertainty in the markets and within the banking sector specifically. As such, we may come in closer to the low end of these ranges.  Now turning to ratings, despite being down year-over-year, we're encouraged by the improvement we have seen in the issuance environment relative to last quarter. Revenue decreased 5% year-over-year. However, this is the second quarter in a row of sequential improvement in transaction revenue, as investment grade and high yield showed pockets of strength in the quarter, particularly in January and February.  Non-transaction revenue declined 4% and 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to declines in initial issuer credit rating and rating evaluation surface, partially offset by growth in CRISIL. Adjusted expenses decreased 3%, driven by lower occupancy costs and outside surfaces expenses partially offset by higher compensation expense. This resulted in a 6% decrease in operating profit and an 80 basis points decrease in operating margin to 58.3%.  We raised our built issuance assumption for 2023, and expect issuance to increase in the range of 3% to 7%, reflecting the stronger issuance trend in the first quarter. We expect to see an improvement in full year transaction revenues compared to our initial expectations, though we expect the upside to be offset by slightly lower contribution from non-transaction due to ICR and RES headwinds. And now turning to commodity insights, revenue growth accelerated to 9% despite a very high comparison last year. Excluding the impact of the CERAWeek conference, revenue growth for commodity insights would have been approximately 6% year-over-year. Growth was partially offset by the loss of revenue related to Russia, which contributed $11 million in the first quarter of 2022.  Advisory and transactional services increased 28% in the quarter, primarily due to CERAWeek official record attendance coupled with strong sponsorship sales. Upstream data and insights declined approximately 1% year-over-year, and subscription growth was offset by reduced one-time sales relative to last year. As we noted last quarter, we continue to expect low single digit revenue growth in upstream for the full year.  Price assessments and energy resources data and insights both grew 8% compared to prior year, driven by strong performance in crude oil products and continued commercial momentum. Adjusted expenses increased 3% primarily due to higher event costs driven by conferences, T&E and compensation, partially offset by realization of cost synergies and lower consulting spent. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, expense growth would have been only 1%.  Operating profit for CI increased a very strong 17% and operating margin improved 310 basis points to 46.1%. We expect commodity insights to continue to benefit from strong demand in price assessments and other subscription offerings, as well as the continuation of secular trends around energy transition and sustainability.  As we saw from the incredible growth at CERAWeek, there remains a remarkable opportunity to further our leadership in the energy sector and in commodities more broadly. And we will continue to invest to capture that opportunity and drive multiyear profitable growth.  In our mobility deficient, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by continued new business growth in CARFAX, strong recall activity and growth within planning solutions products. The Market Scan acquisition contributed approximately 1 point of revenue growth in the quarter and is recognized in the dealer category.  Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by price increases and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life and used car subscription products. Manufacturing grew 11% year-over-year, driven by our planning products and recall activity. Financials and other also increased 11% as the business line continues to benefit from strong underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment.  Adjusted expenses increased 8% due to year-over-year increases in headcount, investment in software, and additional cloud usage, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. This resulted in a 14% increase in adjusted operating profit and 130 basis points operating margin expansion year-over-year. As we expected, we've seen expense growth rates moderate from fourth quarter, and we continue to expect margin expansion this year. We expect the Market Scan acquisition to contribute approximately 150 basis points of revenue growth in the full year, though we expect it to be modestly diluted to adjusted margins in 2023. All of this is reflected in our updated guidance.  Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, revenue increased 1%, primarily due to strong growth in exchange-traded derivative volumes, offset by declines in asset-linked fees. Asset-linked fees were down 6%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs, which decreased 4% from the year ago period as price depreciation more than offset slightly positive year-over-year net inflows. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue increased 30% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including an approximately 59% increase in S&P 500 index options volume. Data and custom subscriptions was flat on the quarter, though excluding the impact of some minor reclassification of revenue, as outlined on the slide, growth would have been 5% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for end of day and real-time data feats.  During the quarter, expenses decreased 7% year-over-year, driven by realization of cost synergies, lower bad debt expense and timing of discretionary spend, which was partially offset by continued strategic investments. Operating profit in indices increased 4% and operating margin improved 250 basis points to 71.8%.  As reflected in today's results, indices will continue to face headwinds in asset-linked fees as the year-over-year depreciation in underlying asset prices impacts to deficient on a lagged basis. Exchange-traded derivative revenue was well above our earlier expectations, though these volumes can be volatile and difficult to predict. We continue to invest to achieve the 2025 and 2026 target for 10% plus growth in indices. And we expect those investments as well as the timing of certain expenses to drive margins for the full year back within the guidance range.  In engineering solutions, we saw 2% revenue growth and 4% adjusted expense growth. As noted in our materials, we now expect to close the divestiture of engineering solutions next week. We're updating our guidance to reflect the accelerated timeline relative to our initial expectation for a June 30 close.  I've had the pleasure of overseeing the engineering solutions division since the merger closed, and I would like to thank them for the incredible dedication and professionalism the teams have consistently demonstrated. We're confident that there will be a strong addition to KKR and wish them all the best.  Now let's move to the latest views from our economists who are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.7% in 2023. While GDP growth is expected to be positive, our guidance still assumes a mild recession in the middle of the year and a modest recovery as we exit 2023. We continue to expect inflation above the target rates of central banks and energy prices like crude oil to remain above the historical averages as well. This creates favorable commercial conditions for many of our businesses, though it also contributes to volatility in the issuance environment, as we have been discussing over the last year.  As we consider how all of this will ultimately impact our financial performance in 2023, let's turn to our guidance. Now that we have some certainty around the timing of the engineering solutions divestiture, we can introduce initial GAAP guidance. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the first quarter results as well as the updated view on the macroeconomic environment, issuance trends, equity valuations and other key drivers, as previously outlined. Our full year guidance now assumes that strong revenue performance in the first quarter is offset by a lower revenue contribution from engineering solutions due to the accelerated timing of the divestiture. The only change to our consolidated full year adjusted guidance is in adjusted free cash flow, which has been reduced by approximately $100 million primarily driven up by updated assumptions around cash taxes related to the R&D tax credit.  We have provided granular guidance on corporate unallocated expense, due related amortization, interest income and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site, though these are unchanged from prior guidance. The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by deficient, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously.  In conclusion, despite the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we've had a solid start to 2023 and remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year. Before we open up for Q&A, I want to reiterate how excited we are as a management team when we consider the incredible opportunities we have to drive growth and innovation and the secular trends that continue to benefit our business, from key investment areas like energy transition and private markets through the inspiring breakthroughs that our Kensho team has driven in artificial intelligence and large language models.  It's a privilege to discuss the many ways we plan to create long-term shareholder value in the coming years. It's also a privilege to share this stage with leaders like Saugata Saha, President of Commodity Insights; and Dan Draper, CEO of S&P Dow Jones Indices, both of whom we would like to invite to join us for Q&A.  And with that, we'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Good morning. Doug, upfront you mentioned retention rates and mobility were declining modestly. I was just hoping you could provide a little bit more color there, perhaps with some numbers. But is that a trend you're seeing across your segments just given the uncertain macros out there?\nDoug Peterson: Good morning. Thank you, Manav, for joining the call. The mobility question you have relates to some of the changes that are happening at a structural level in the mobility and transportation business. If you recall the last couple of years, we saw all of the used cars became a very large sales aspect for the dealers and the automotive manufacturers. The OEMs were struggling to actually meet demand. So we're seeing a shift away from used cars to new cars. And we actually expect that there's going to be a lot of growth in the sales of automotive products around the globe this year. And where we're seeing some of the slowdown in subscription relates to dealers, as dealers don't have necessarily the same margin, they might be changing some of their approach to how they're working with the sales force they have. So we're seeing that that's one of the areas where we see some disruption in some retention rates that have started to drop. Other than that across the board and the rest of the company, we do not see any changes whatsoever to retention rates.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you. And Ewout, just on the ratings guidance, apologies if I missed this. I think you said more transactional revenue but offset by two items. I was just hoping you could elaborate what those offsets were?\nEwout Steenbergen: Sure, Manav. Good morning. If you look at the dimensions with respect to market issuance and built issuance, actually we're seeing exactly the opposite of the pattern of 2022. So there are two large categories in market issuance that are down more that are not included in built issuance. So this is unrated debt, as well as frequent issuer. So frequent issuers, we don't have in build issuance because as you know they're on the fixed fee construction up to a certain level of volume. So therefore, we expect build issuance to be significantly higher than market issuance for the full year 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the individual segment guidance. You raised the guidance for commodity insights, mobility and indices. I understand MI is more towards the lower end. But even on the ratings front, it looks like the build issuance guidance was raised by almost 1 point. Earlier was 2 to 6, now it's 3 to 7. But you reiterated the full year guidance, so I was just wondering within the full year guidance, do you have increased confidence on the range? Any color on that front will be helpful. Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you. Good morning, Ashish. We are overall really confident around the outlook for the full year. We are very pleased, of course, with the results in the first quarter, and then also the confidence around what we are going to achieve for the full year. And you see that reflected in the overall guidance that as you have noted is unchanged. But you have to realize that we're taking out two months of engineering solutions revenues and earnings. So you could say implicitly, we've slightly raised our full year guidance. And then by deficient, as you were asking for, the changes are due to the following. If you look at commodity insights, that is driven really by the outperformance of revenue growth in the first quarter. If you look at mobility, strong growth in the first quarter, but also the acquisition of Market Scan is helping there from a revenue perspective. And indices as well, what we're seeing there is also a very strong first quarter, and that is therefore also reflected in the full year revenue growth outlook. In terms of ratings, there is a shift that we have told you, a little bit higher transactional revenue, but a little bit lower non-transactional revenue. So net-net is still the same. But there is a shift in those two underlying categories. And then with respect to margins, mobility has been tuned down a bit. That is the dilutive effect of the acquisition. But on the flipside, for the indices business, we see that the margins are actually up, given the strong performance in the first quarter again. With respect to market intelligence, we have said that we come in more at the lower end of the ranges, both for revenues and margins. And that has to do with the macro environment, a bit of the uncertainty, the fact that we expect some of the capital markets products, more to come back later in the year, because now we assume the recession is somewhere mid of this year, as well as some of the impacts of the banking crisis, although we think that impact will be really minimal for market intelligence.\nAshish Sabadra: That was very helpful color. And maybe as a follow up, if I can follow up on the mobility front. Manufacturing in particular was very strong. Overall growth in mobility was very strong, but manufacturing historically which has been more in the 3% to 4% range was up 11% this quarter. So I was wondering has anything changed there structurally, which is driving significantly stronger growth in that segment? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. Thank you, Ashish. What's driving growth in that segment, if you recall over the last couple of years, there was -- the supply chains had been disrupted. There were no access to different types of chips, which are used in the automotive sector, including even things like key fobs. And you also saw a lot of disruption demand from the market as people were looking for cars, but they couldn't get them. So we're seeing that manufacturing is up. In fact, our total vehicle sales globally, we're seeing very strong sales coming up in the U.S., over about 7.5% growth in China, about 6% growth in Asia, including Japan and South Korea, about 6.5% growth and in Europe about 7.5% growth. So across the board, we see a lot of growth in production as well as coming from a very, very depressed base. But at the same time, it puts some pressure because the demand is starting to decrease as well, given the inflation, given interest rates are going up. So we see that right now, there's a lot of demand for information from our mobility team, because we provide the forecasting, we provide the information about the changes going on in the industry, as well as the day-to-day dynamics. But we're shifting the dynamics from what had been a supply constrained market to a richer approach to more supply in the market and shifts in customer demand that all of this benefits our mobility business because they provide the data and analytics that dealers and OEMs and suppliers need to make decisions.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks, Doug. That was very helpful color, and congrats on such a strong momentum in the business. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: George Tong with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on the rating side of the business. The revenues there declined mid-single digits year-over-year, and that came in much better than your main competitor, which saw an 11% decline. What are some of the factors that you believe drove this outperformance in delta in the quarter? And can these factors persist over the remainder of this year?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, George. Well, first of all, this was a very lumpy quarter when you look at the issuance. It started out quite strong of issuance. Investment grade had started off strong, but through the quarter in the U.S. it declined 14%, in Europe it increased 3%. A high yield increase in the U.S. 20% but it decreased in Europe 2% and structured finance in the U.S. decreased 48%. And in Europe, it increased 7%. So this was an incredibly lumpy quarter for us. But we've been very adamant about having our sales people and our commercial people out in the markets. We keep our finger to the pulse of what's happening across the markets. We've been involved in supplying information for the structured credit, an area in particular CLOs. We've been strong in the CLO market in the last quarter. We see going forward we think that for the rest of the year that it's going to be mostly refinancing that's going to drive what we see is the issuance. If you take a step back and last quarter, we issued a slide which we show once a year, which is the pipeline of refinancing, which is on the balance sheet of companies, financial institutions and other organizations over the next 5 to 10 years. And you can see there was a lot of financing that took place over the last 10 years with typically five, seven, sometimes up to 10-year maturity. That's starting to mature now. And we're starting to see some of that pull forward. And the question is, what are the right conditions for people to come back to the market? And that's something we're watching very closely, because there is a very, very large pipeline of refinancing that's going to be coming over the next three to five years, and we're going to watch that carefully including what's going to be coming this year.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then wanted to ask about your synergy realization. You realized run rate synergies on the cost side of a little over 550 million, and then 50 million plus on the revenue side. Can you dive into where you're seeing most traction with revenue and cost synergy realization, and how you expect the progression to continue over the course of this year?\nEwout Steenbergen: Of course, George. Thank you so much, and good morning. We are, of course, very pleased with the progress we're making with synergies. This is really a statement of execution of the whole team, of the whole company and the speed of the implementation of all of our programs is really impressive from my perspective. So we are at 550 million run rate cost synergies at this moment. These are cost synergies we're doing in all the categories that we have outlined before. There's of course organizational and duplication of roles that we're taking care of. Then there's real estate consolidation, vendor consolidation, and several other categories. This is all linked to integration. So we like to get the integration behind us as quickly as possible, and that we can fully operate as a combined company going forward. And we're very close to that point now. And that is expressed by the progress we have made with cost synergies, and getting really now not too far away anymore from the 600 million cost synergy mark. And so this is all across the company. With respect to revenue synergies, we see very nice progress in the divisions. The largest growth there we see in market intelligence and commodity insights, but contributions by all of the divisions. We have always said from the beginning that revenue synergies will take more time. At this moment, the focus is mostly on cross sell. And then later this year and the next few years, we will shift to new product development. But obviously the lead time to develop new products into the system, enhancement for that will take a bit longer. But both on cost and revenue synergies we're very pleased where we are at this moment.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, George.\nGeorge Tong: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to talk about ESG first. Thanks for the quarterly disclosure. We have seen some slowdown in new sales from a competitor of yours talking about the political and regulatory landscape. Have you also noticed any change in investor behavior in ESG, particularly in the new sales, any areas that are slower versus more resilient, because I know it's sort of a topic that spans your whole business. So maybe there are some areas that are doing fine and resilient versus others that maybe you are noticing a new sales change? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Toni. I'm going to start and then hand it over to Ewout. If you take a step back and you think about something like the ESG sustainability, climate markets, they go back the last five, six, seven years. And if you look at our company, we have products that go back 50, 65, 100 years. And the experience of a market like this, it's really changing rapidly. And fortunately, because of our Sustainable 1 organization and the way that we've been investing in sustainability products, energy transition climate, ESG across our entire company and coordinating it through S1, we're seeing strength across pretty much the entire portfolio. And in particular, we're seeing a shift away from ESG to climate in the U.S. and around the rest of the globe. One of the things that I always say is that the train has left the station on this. This is an area that's going to be growing very quickly. It's high demand, it's coming from corporates, it's coming from governments, from regulators, from financial institutions, every part of the financial institution area. And we have products from Trucost, our ESG data suite. We've got bond referencing prices, physical risk, we're in the middle of what I'd say is one of the most important dialogues taking place with regulators around the globe about disclosure. But let me hand it over to Ewout to talk a little bit more about the numbers.\nEwout Steenbergen: Toni, when we look at the first quarter revenues for sustainability and energy transition, we actually think that this is really strong for the company. And we are still confident that for the full year outlook, the growth will be in line with our medium-term expectations. And the reason for that is, as Doug outlined, that we have very diverse revenue streams underneath sustainability and energy transition, and all of our decisions contribute to the progress and to the growth. So think about, for example, in mobility what is happening, the huge transformation of the industry around electrification, move to EVs and what that means for the OEMs with respect to thinking about supply chains and new manufacturing and where they sourced the batteries, what is happening in the commodity space with energy transition, what is happening with new price assessments around hydrogen and carbon and biofuels and recycled plastics, what is happening in the rating space with second party opinions? And then Doug already mentioned climate, really there's so much focus now about climate; climate analytics, climate credit analytics, climate data. Just to give you one data point, Trucost actually grew more than 50% in the quarter. So overall, if we added up, I think we have very strong revenue streams. And therefore we are confident about our future growth in this industry and this particular growth area.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. And hoping you could on another topic just give us an update on how you're utilizing AI or any of your other advancements in technology, whether it be through Kensho or other areas as well?\nEwout Steenbergen: Toni, the way how we look at it is, we really believe we're ahead of the game here. We did the acquisition of Kensho five years ago when just very few people were thinking about artificial intelligence. We have already embedded a lot of Kensho's products and tools within our businesses over the last few years. And our intention is really to stay ahead and to really make sure that we continue to implement this and be one of the winners in this market. We told you this morning we have not five Kensho products that are in the market, that's just for external customers. But internally, there are many more products. And actually the efficiency opportunities that Kensho has created for the deficients is very large. Maybe if I may expand on this in one particular area. If we think about large language models and generative AI, actually three areas are really critical. It is compute, which is really expensive. Then there are the algorithms which are more open source and generic. And then it is about training data. And training data is really differentiating. And if you have really good training data, you can improve the algorithms and you can drive down the compute cost. We have at S&P Global the largest training data set for financial markets, plus the best team of Kensho that we already outlined. So we have no need to export our data to someone else models or generic large language models. We can do this in-house. And you may expect that we will have more announcements around this later this year.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Toni.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hi. Hello, everyone. Just wanted to come back to the market intelligence commentary and the outlook there. Clearly, you sound a little bit more cautious. Although, Doug, I think initially you said it should be fine. But I think Ewout's comments are clearly pointing towards the low end. So I guess the question is, what specifically is it that makes this thing a lower end? Is it just an expectation of a slowdown, or is it actually something that you're already seeing in new sales? We're just curious about if this is more an expectation or something you're already seeing in the pipeline I guess, because obviously the uncertain environment? Then specifically, you mentioned the Swiss bank merger, which obviously is something I'm paying attention to as well. Just wondering, you said it wouldn't have an impact, but is it a question about maybe this year not an impact because it may take some time? Or is it just the exposures are very small, just maybe you can dimensionalize it a little bit since it is the first time we've had something like this in like 15 years?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, Alex, good morning. This is Ewout. I will start and then hand it over to Doug. Generally, we are confident about the outlook of market intelligence for the remainder of the year due to a couple of reasons. The first is growth of the subscription book of business, we see some healthy growth. Then we have good revenue synergies that will come in over the next period of time. We're expecting a capital markets recovery at the end of the year. So that should help enterprise solutions. And then also the comps will become easier and FX headwinds will become easier during the course of this year. So those are the elements that will help us to remain confident with the outlook. With respect to the specifics of the banking impact, we think this is overall manageable and not material for market intelligence. And the reason for that is the following. Market intelligence actually has a very diverse customer base. Only 10% of the customer revenue is coming from commercial banks, and these are global commercial banks, so not specifically U.S. or Europe. So that's actually a relatively low percentage. And then we have multiyear subscription contracts with those customers. We have tuned it down in the guidance range to the lower end of the range given the uncertainty, given the fact that we are still expecting a shallow and short recession in the mid of this year, and we want to be cautious. But overall, that's why we still believe we should be able to come in within the range for market intelligence for the full year.\nDoug Peterson: Alex, what I wanted to add is that I've been on the road almost nonstop this year and seeing clients. And it's been incredible the kind of feedback we're getting about the value that the market intelligence team is bringing with the data that's getting built into different platforms. And what Ewout just highlighted that market intelligence customer base is very diversified. We don't just have a financial institution. Client base within financial institutions, we're not just focused on only one single segment. So I've had really interesting conversations with corporates about the data that we have in market intelligence, what we can provide in investor relations coordinator, which is used by different traders, by supply chain. We have a new product which is a supply chain console that corporates are finding incredibly useful for them to understand what would be their needs for managing shipping, supply chain risk, et cetera. So I'm really encouraged by what we're seeing. The client dialogue is what I wanted to highlight.\nAlex Kramm: All right, thanks for that. And then just a very quick one on the rating side, and I asked your primary competitor this also, but maybe have a different view, which is really what's going to happen with lending by regional banks, right? I know they're more focused on middle markets. And that's not really where you play. But if we make the assumptions that these companies are going to be more constrained because of regulation or capital requirements, is there an opportunity for you or are you thinking about an opportunity that could lead to more disintermediation that you actually have a role as that remaining lending in the U.S. may more go to capital markets? Or is it just too small for you and it will go to other channels like private credit, for example?\nDoug Peterson: Yes, thanks for that, Alex. Well, first of all, we have much, much lower exposure to that sector than some of the other competitors in our space. We do watch it very closely, because it does help with some of the -- understanding some of the credit dynamics in the country overall. We do see in the U.S. that there could be some slowdown in credit. And that's one of the reasons that we've been cautious about our own economic forecast for the rest of the year. You heard as Ewout said that we expect that there would be a mild recession or a mild slowdown as we see a dip in the second or third quarter. And we think part of that could be caused by the slowdown in credit. But overall, we have very low exposure to this area. And it's likely that some of the areas that we see that the credit will get picked up by the private markets or securitization, and some of those we might actually benefit from some of the activity on those.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. Thank you very much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.\nCraig Huber: Great, thank you. Can you touch on, if you would, your outlook for bank loan issuance this year and high yield issuance just given the huge uncertainties on the macro side please?\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Craig. Well, let me give you a broader sense of issuance and just reconcile a little bit what we talked about earlier on the call. As you know, we have our credit research team issues a report on what they see is the full forecast for the year. And right now they're expecting that the range across all of the different areas would be down about 3.5%. And then we've said that we think what the range of build issuance will be up about 3% to 7%. We don't break it out between what would be leveraged loans and high yield. Those are part of that. But in the first quarter, high yield issuance was up about 6% of build issuance and bank loans was down about 33%. In many cases, those are substitutes for each other. Sometimes you can see somebody says, well, am I going to issue a floating rate or a fixed rate, what are the market conditions or I'm going to go to the private markets, which had been quite quick, they're fast, but they also have in some cases, higher spreads on them, as well as maybe more covenants. But we think that there's going to be a very dynamic market. Overall, I think you should focus on the 3% to 7% build issuance up and look at the different components of where we see that's happening. Just as an FYI, in our credit research teams forecast, they see that corporates will be up about 8.5% for the year. So think of that as kind of an anchor. And also remember what I said earlier to one of the earlier questions about the amount of refinancing that it's already taking place. Maybe the last point I'd make is that we see that in this market with these conditions with some uncertainty about rates and inflation, et cetera, issuance is very, very opportunistic. You can see a flood of issuance over a week or two weeks. And then sometimes the markets are pulling back. For instance, the last couple of weeks have been very encouraging. But we said the same thing about the first two months of the year. So we watch this closely. We're forecasting, but go back to what the long-term issue is. M&A is going to come back, rates will eventually stabilize, conditions will be positive for people to invest and grow. We have these massive programs in the U.S. that are just starting to get launched for an infrastructure build, for the CHIPS Act, for the IRA, the capital that's going to be going into energy transition, all of that is going to attract investment. It's going to attract M&A. It's going attract debt investment. This isn't just going to be done using capital from the government. There's going to be public/private partnership, public/private capital going into these areas, and I just see a huge amount of capital that's going to be deployed here. We're going to see the same thing in Europe, same thing in Asia. So I just believe that this energy transition, what we're going to see with the CHIPS Act, et cetera, is going to create a lot of investment globally. And we should be benefiting from all of that over the long run.\nCraig Huber: Thanks for that. My other question please, mobility obviously had a very strong start to the year with solid outlook for the rest of the year. Can you just touch upon the businesses within that division that you think will help drive it for the rest of the year, and any significant changes from the trend you've saw in the first quarter do you think might go better or worse as the year goes on? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Good morning, Craig. We're actually really looking positively for all the underlying revenue drivers within mobility. First, when you look at dealers, you see a little bit two effects going in opposite directions, as Doug explained earlier. So maybe their margins are coming down a bit, inventory levels are going up. So therefore retention is a little bit lower. But on the flipside is that there is more demand for sales and marketing products, because they need to be more proactively reaching out to potential customers in the future. So that is actually driving the growth in the dealership. Moreover, I think CARFAX is super entrepreneurial, really innovative, launching a lot of new products. And that is helping with the growth there as well. Manufacturing, the same thing. Also, there they are exposed to more needs to really reach out to customers through our marketing and sales products. So that is going to be helpful there as well. Plus all the changes that are happening with the transformation to EVs and our planning products, they are helping our OEM customers. And then our data is flowing to insurance companies, to banks and other loan entities that need the data for the pricing of their products. So we expect that to continue to grow as well at healthy levels during the course of this year. So overall, I would say positive momentum for mobility and I have no reason to believe that that would not continue in the future.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Silber: Thanks so much. I know it's late, I'll just ask one. Nobody's asked about the pricing environment. And I know it varies by the different segments you’re in, but if you can just give us some general comments in terms of the ability to pass through pricing, we'd appreciate it?\nEwout Steenbergen: Absolutely, Jeff. So the way we look at this is most of our products are must-have products for our customers. We are deeply embedded in their workflows, in their day-to-day activities. Therefore, we add a lot of value to our customers. And that should give us an opportunity to pass on any cost price increases as a result of the inflationary environment in terms of pricing and fees. But obviously, we're doing that in a very responsible way. We're doing that in a very balanced way that will come in gradually over time at the moment of contract renewals. But overall, we think that is reasonable to pass on cost price increases to customers, and therefore we still expect to expand margins in this current environment. I'm looking at maybe one of my colleagues, Dan or Saugata, if you would like to give any particular color for your businesses.\nDan Draper: Yes, sure. Jeff, it's Dan. Thank you very much for the question. Look, to echo Ewout's comments that we align pricing with the value we create for our customers. And if you look at something specifically for indices, this massive secular growth trends switch from active to passive management, that's something that we want to be aligned with our clients and ensure that again we're representing the value and really working closely. And I think if you look at the outcome that we estimate over the last 26 years from our three core indices, the S&P 500, 400 and 600 that we saved investors over $400 billion in management fees. So that's benefiting directly savers, retirees, people saving for college education, things like that. So I think pricing is a strategic tool that we look through and really use again to align growth and interests with clients.\nJeffrey Silber: All right. Thanks so much for the color.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So going back to Kensho, Doug and Ewout, you mentioned five products are commercially available. Could you please talk about the early traction there and your expectation about these products? Who are your major clients? Would that be banks, or you can expand to other vertical? And also, please remind us the revenue model, mainly subscription-based model? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thanks, Owen. I will give you a more broader perspective and then hand it over to Saugata for some specific Kensho implementations in commodity insights. So overall, Kensho for the last few years has been very much focused on product development, speed to market, new product design, new design of delivery, customer experience within S&P Global, but slowly is now also turning more externally, again, because many of those products that have been developed are also attractive for external customers. Overall, if you look at the value that is generated, it's both value internally and externally. In terms of external customers, we have now more than 50 external customers in areas like asset managers, large banks, hedge funds, and corporates. And this is all the products that we have highlighted before; Link, Nerd, Scribe, Extract and Classify, so many good products. But let me hand it over to Saugata to give you more details about commodity insights.\nSaugata Saha: Thanks, Ewout. And Owen, thanks for the question. I described the work that we do with Kensho and more broadly the concept of AI across commodity insights is a foundational piece of everything that we are doing that's future looking and growth driving. So Kensho, for example, built a tool that we use in our what we call the price assessment process, specifically the market on closed process, wherein we kind of at the end of the day pull together everything we've heard during the closing out of the trading markets to understand what the outlook for price. And Kensho build a tool that compressed the workflow time by about 70%. That frees up time for our researchers, for our price reporters to do other productive thing for our customers, and also helps us get information out to the market faster. In addition, AI is a broader theme. We do a lot of work. And I draw your attention to some of the newer products like Energy Studio Impact, which is essentially 6 million North America wells, of which for about 1 million wells we do real-time live forecasts. And you can imagine that something like that involves more than 1 trillion rows of data, and computing that without leveraging AI and machine learning models, and we have about 4,200 of them in that one product alone would be nearly impossible. And that's just one example where we are using -- just I would say two examples where we are using Kensho and machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts more broadly to develop and demonstrate additional customer value.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. And then on indices on the expense, I think it was lower than our expectation, but the margin was higher. Was it mainly driven by lower comp because your revenue line gets lower? And also, could you please give us an update on your key maybe market and also your investment or expense assumption for the rest of this year on indices? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Yes, hi, Owen. Thanks, again, for the question. I think in terms of the performance, as Ewout had mentioned, we had the difficult comps, but also the asset prices and our asset-linked, if you think back, you kind of build that in arrears [indiscernible] quarter was coming off of the market highs at the end of 2021, so comparing that. And also there was some seasonality in products like the S&P 500. You do see the liquidity benefits of that product. I really think inflows late in the year and that can come out in early through the year on that. Where we saw the outperformance was in exchange-traded derivatives. Obviously, we've seen a very fast increase in nominal interest rates. And that's really caused some dislocation in the way that risk premium across asset classes, and so that's obviously increased volatility. So we're so well positioned in this ecosystem we built. What we discussed back in the Investor Day in December, being able to align and provide price discovery, liquidity and crucially for the exchange-traded derivative market being able to manage risks. And so what we're seeing is a combination of secular growth trends there, extended trading hours, shorting down to intraday or even single day types of access to derivative products, but there’s also cyclicality. We do know that over time, volatility will particularly normalize, potentially mean will revert to some degree. So in terms of our outlook, we want to make sure that we manage that appropriately. So if you think about the margin, just kind of looking for the rest of the year, we do like exchange-traded derivatives. They do have a higher gross margin than our asset-linked, but we do expect that mix to change. We do expect, hopefully, the flows to change that. So it's going to be reflected in the revenue mix we have. Also we had some one-time expenses that were non-recurring. And we also had some lapping incentive comp expense reductions last year. But what we really want to do ultimately is to reinvest back into the business. And I think that reflects, again, the way we're thinking about the margin for the rest of the year, and really leaning into again the secular growth trends we have.\nOwen Lau: Okay, sounds great. Thanks a lot.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Owen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, Ewout, I know this is a small item, but it would help our model. Could you just give us what the total acquired, that's the M&A revenues were in the first quarter? I definitely heard you call out the 1 point of M&A revenues and mobility from Market Scan. But as you know, there's been some other kind of tuck-ins already completed. And if you could also on the same basis with the acquisitions already completed, could you give us of what the M&A revenue assumption is for the '23 guide?\nEwout Steenbergen: Andrew, we said that for Market Scan, during the quarter, the impact is around 1 point. So it's around $3 million to $4 million. It's overall immaterial for the company as a whole as you understand. The other two sides in ChartIQ really are immaterial for market intelligence. So from a modeling perspective, I wouldn't put any number into your model. But then I would like to point out that the revenues and the earnings were loose in our models. And our plan for the full year by divesting engineering solutions two months earlier is actually net-net going to reduce the overall impact on our plans. So the net of divestiture of engineering solutions and in requisitions is actually a negative, hence my comments earlier during this call that implicitly we're raising the guidance for the full year by holding the range to same for the company as a whole.\nAndrew Steinerman: Right. But you do account for all of the M&A, right?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, that's correct.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes, thanks. Doug, Ewout, good to hear from you. But I'll try to continue to incorporate some of those other voices. Within indices, maybe if you could talk about, I guess, like your vitality or what new products are really resonating or you think have the highest potential?\nDan Draper: Yes. Hi, Jeff. Thanks for the question. In terms of the vitality, we think of that sustainability was a theme. I think Doug and Ewout both kind of emphasized, that's a huge opportunity for us, particularly as we expand to other regions in Europe, Asia, that's always top of mind for us. I'd also say factors schematics [ph], and specifically if you think about the need for income globally. So for us having the leading dividend, equity dividend franchise, our aristocrats, we're seeing a lot of demand there. If you think about in developed markets ageing populations, the need for retirement income, but hey, now there's inflation. So all of a sudden, I need to protect capital and standards of living. So that's where the combination of using, say, our S&P 500 equity franchise to supplement fixed income, that's clearly a big synergy from the IHS Markit, and specifically our IBOX franchise. So what we're seeing now is combining like around the world kind of that dividend franchise we have with credit, and being able to offer now multi-asset solutions. And particularly markets like Japan, one of our largest asset management clients, just launched the first multi-asset ETF in that marketplace. So again, really bringing synergy and capabilities, but I think income leading into that, also in sustainability looking to combine really the partnership within S&P Global. Even Saugata’s business in commodity insights, we've been able to use unique proprietary data sets around the electric vehicles. I think Ewout had mentioned, we came out in partnership again with commodity insights with our GSCI franchise to come out with an electric vehicles metal index. Again, other data sets were Trucost and sustainability. So I think this is really -- as we go back to that 2025, 2026 outlook we gave in Investor Day, this is really looking through increasingly these proprietary data sets, being part of S&P Global to really look at some of these mega trends around the world. \nJeffrey Meuler: Thank you. And then on commodity insights, there was a comment about an opportunity to further sector leadership. Maybe just a high level comment, like how was CERAWeek different with IHS here being part of S&P now? And then should we look to the event as a meaningful cross-selling catalyst if you just talk about the pipeline build coming out of the event? Thank you.\nSaugata Saha: Jeff, thanks for the question. So just as a reminder, so CERAWeek is a marquee energy event that we hold and it's increasingly broadly more than energy event that you hold in Houston in March every year. It is the premier -- as you point out, it is the premier venue for thought leadership for commodities and everything future looking for the commodities business. This year, we had over 8,000 attendees there, a lot of C-suite executives, important policymakers across the world. And I'd say, if you think about CERAWeek, we obviously want to grow the franchise in a meaningful way that is accretive to the overall business and the business plan that we have laid out. We do get a lot of -- it's not a venue where we sell. It's not designed to be a venue where we sell, but it is a venue where we showcase our thought leadership, showcase our talent, and showcase all of the great work that we are doing and kind of driving answers to some of the most complicated questions out there. And the four teams that came out this year, which also helps us shape the research that we do, because we have this audience where we connect with the community that we have built where we connect with them and that helps us guide research that we want to do, products that we want to do. And I'd say the four things that we took away that's going to help us shape our own strategy; number one is energy transition is here to stay. It's not going away. Number two, energy transition is complicated because customers are trying to balance energy transition, energy security and energy affordability. Third, I’d say customers are upbeat. They are looking for solutions to complex problems, which only data and analytics of the thought that we can provide can help them solve. And the fourth I'd say, we walked away with targeted opportunities that we want to work on and build opportunities to serve clients. So I'd say in summary, Jeff, it's less about the cross-sell opportunity, but more about the sense of community we’ve built, the direct revenues that we generate, and of course what we showcase and what we walk away from the conference in terms of the knowledge that we build and how to shape our business. And the last thing I would add that, of course, CERAWeek is our marquee event, but we also have other leading events like the World Petrochemicals Conference. There's nothing else like this sort for the petrochemicals business, or the London Energy Forum or the newly acquired Fujairah Conference, which we call FUJCON, all of them in combination with especially the merger helps us interact with customers in a way that would not otherwise be possible.\nJeffrey Meuler: Got it. Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn. Your line is open.\nRussell Quelch: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for having me on. Following on from the previous question actually [indiscernible] I haven't seen any new products in the fixed income benchmark index space from S&P yet post the acquisition of IHS. I did hear Dan's comments earlier, but can you be more specific about the time to market for new fixed income index products that are bridging the brand and S&P's rich data set on the corporate side particularly? Do you have sort of aspirations to challenge Bloomberg [ph] in that market? Any sort of further comments you can give there? And I guess the question being how much does new product growth drives the 10% medium-term target in the index business, please?\nDoug Peterson: Yes, hi, Russell. Thanks for the question. No, we actually have hit I think probably one of the most notable products in Europe was our Paris-Aligned & Climate Transition launch in fixed income. And so that aligns already what we've done in equities. So that was something we got to market. And there's now demand, we call it, the PACT Indices to do those in other parts of the world and other kind of regional exposures, whether it be emerging markets, global, what have you. So that was a really important product and index that we got to market. As I mentioned as well, multi-asset is really, really important for us too. So to align, again, the IBOX range, for example, investment grade, high yield, but to put that more intentionally alongside our leading equity franchises. So being able to do that on a channel basis, particularly areas like insurance. If you think about the annuity space, being able to go specifically there where multi-asset demand, it's also a channel historically that's had a lot of active management. So this bigger trend of shifting from active to passive, we are a leader in that space, but it's early days. Can we expand kind of our first mover advantage to again bring the IBOX capabilities? And again, we've already launched products I mentioned in Japan on multi-asset. We have development now moving forward really across the globe. But I'd say insurance is interesting. Retirement, I mentioned as well, another area that in some areas historically have been very actively oriented, again, combining fixed income with equity is where we want to be able to move forward. And it's a competitive place.\nEwout Steenbergen: And then looking at one part, and that is with respect to the last part of the question around the total contribution of new products to the top line growth of the company, we said at Investor Day, as you might recall, about 80 basis points of contribution to overall growth for the company from the new initiatives. And obviously, our focus is to continue to see that developing further in the future. Therefore, vitality is such an important metric for us, because it is an indicator of a healthy innovation within S&P Global. But I just would like to point out that products will rotate off from the vitality index after three to five years, because at some point, they are not a new product anymore, and they will become business as usual. But the last piece of information I want to give in terms of the health of innovation around vitality is we have seen double digit vitality levels within our businesses this quarter from market intelligence, from mobility, from commodity insights, and from indices. So very positive all across the board.\nRussell Quelch: Thanks. So maybe just as a follow up, I heard all the comments around investment and synergies, particularly Dan's comments around investments. So just wondering if you can speak to the seasonality you expect in the cost line in 2023. Is that likely to be the same as historical average or slightly different to previous years? Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Russell, there's two kinds of investments in new initiatives. There is investments in our strategic programs, our strategic investment program of $150 million. You should assume that that comes in gradually over time, so no particular seasonality. And then we're making investments, what we called cost to achieve, which are related to revenue synergies and realization of revenue synergies. Those will come in also over time, but those are pulled out from a performance perspective. So those you won't see in the actual performance results, the normal cap results that we're reporting now and in the future.\nRussell Quelch: Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Russell.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Your line is open.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, Doug. Hi, Ewout. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question really about the competitive environment, and just your comments about your lengthening sales cycles and the stresses that are facing the financial services customers? I was wondering are you seeing any sort of competitive response or would you expect to see any responses on pricing from the industry overall? And how would you expect to fare in, if that were to happen?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Simon. This is Doug. Well, first of all, as you know, we've always been in a competitive environment and we also respect our competitors very, very much. This is an environment where, for us, it's up to bringing the most relevant, the newest, the fastest, the highest quality information, being responsive, as you've heard us talk about Kensho, artificial intelligence, machine learning, all of these types of things allow us to bring information and data and analytics and benchmarks to our customers even faster. So it's a very competitive environment. This also puts us on the -- keeps us on our toes. It makes us better because we have to always respond to the demands of the markets, as well as ensuring that we're faster and ahead of all of our competitors.\nSimon Clinch: Okay, thanks. And just as a follow up then, when we think about the revenue synergies and revenue synergies target, I was just wondering in terms of -- should we expect there to be any sort of cyclical puts or takes to those targets over time? Like if we were to endure a prolonged downturn, does that impact I guess the timing of the recognition of those revenue synergies and maybe just some flavor around that would be useful? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, we have said revenue synergies, Simon, are coming in over a period of three to five years, about 45% cross sell, which is more the first two years and then 55% coming from new products, which is more year three to five. So you should see this actually -- see that ramping up over the next period during the course of this year, and we saw actually quite a nice jump from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we're now at that 52 million run rate level. But you see that going up in quite a nice way over the next couple of quarters. But obviously, revenue synergies take more time to accomplish compared to cost synergies.\nSimon Clinch: Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Simon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Maybe taking a high level view of just this year and your expectations embedded in your guidance, I think you called out that it does call for a bit of a improvement or somewhat of a macro recovery in the back half. Just trying to think of the levers or opportunities you have to pull, say maybe the macro ends up being a bit weaker. Can you talk about some of those levers as well as some of the counter cyclicality of your business in the various segments that would be helpful? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. Thanks, Stephanie. Our expectation now in terms of assumptions for the year is the following. Obviously, strong performance in the first quarter, as you have seen, then more a short and shallow recession in second quarter, third quarter. Obviously, we're still very careful what to expect for the year that there's not some unexpected volatility happening in the markets. So we're actually running a very tight ship, very careful from expenses and investments, headcounts very careful. But then we are ready to invest, because the most important is that we are investing in future growth. And hopefully, we'll see somewhere at the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter really markets coming back in a very strong way. And we're ready to take advantage of that. In terms of downturn levers that we have, it's the usual list that we have always been outlining, and you know that we're on top of our game. And we will pull those levers, if needed. But already today, as you have seen, the cost controls are really very strong and the cost growth is really low. Certainly also if you take into account of that last year, we had actually flat expenses, and now only really minimal expense growth in the first quarter. But the downturn levers are the usual one around variable spend, discretionary spend, hiring, investment spend in other areas. So we're ready to take action, if that's needed. But hopefully, we are more in a position that we can invest in future growth, because that's the real fun part, and the part how we really can deliver shareholder value from a medium and long-term perspective.\nStephanie Moore: Great, thank you so much. Appreciate the color.\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Stephanie. I'd like to make a quick closing remark. And I want to thank everybody for being on the call today and your excellent questions. I also want to thank Dan and Saugata for joining us in the room. Great answers. It's nice to have you here. And we're also very pleased with how our year has started. As you recall, in December, we had an Investor Day where we launched a new strategy called power in global markets. And it's fantastic to be on such a strong start. And a lot of that has to do with our engagement with our customers.  We have been out talking to our customers, listening to them, understanding how they see the combined value of the company. And I personally have been very busy traveling around the world speaking with our key customers from every industry, from all of our businesses, and I'm more confident than ever about our strategy. And their comments provide us further information to validate our priorities, our investment in technology, our investment in AI, the quality of our people, how we see the products that we're developing in the future. And I'm just so confident about what we're seeing out there.  I also want to thank all of our people for helping us launch 2023. As always, they are phenomenal and it's why we're off to such a strong start. And so I'm really excited about everything we've achieved this year. I look forward to sharing more on our next earnings call. And again, thank you everyone for joining us today. Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes this morning's call.

            "content": "Thanks, Ewout. And Owen, thanks for the question. I described the work that we do with Kensho and more broadly the concept of AI across commodity insights is a foundational piece of everything that we are doing that's future looking and growth driving. So Kensho, for example, built a tool that we use in our what we call the price assessment process, specifically the market on closed process, wherein we kind of at the end of the day pull together everything we've heard during the closing out of the trading markets to understand what the outlook for price. And Kensho build a tool that compressed the workflow time by about 70%. That frees up time for our researchers, for our price reporters to do other productive thing for our customers, and also helps us get information out to the market faster. In addition, AI is a broader theme. We do a lot of work. And I draw your attention to some of the newer products like Energy Studio Impact, which is essentially 6 million North America wells, of which for about 1 million wells we do real-time live forecasts. And you can imagine that something like that involves more than 1 trillion rows of data, and computing that without leveraging AI and machine learning models, and we have about 4,200 of them in that one product alone would be nearly impossible. And that's just one example where we are using -- just I would say two examples where we are using Kensho and machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts more broadly to develop and demonstrate additional customer value. Jeff, thanks for the question. So just as a reminder, so CERAWeek is a marquee energy event that we hold and it's increasingly broadly more than energy event that you hold in Houston in March every year.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. As a reminder, the financial metrics that we will be discussing today refer to non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for our 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP.  For the first quarter of 2023, adjusted earnings per share increased 9% year-over-year. This growth was driven by a combination of 3% revenue growth, 100 basis points of operating margin expansion and an 8% reduction in the fully diluted share count. This is an excellent example of strong execution and prudent capital management combining to create long-term shareholder value, and we're pleased with the start to 2023.  Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by growth in market intelligence and strong performance in commodity insights and mobility. This was offset by a lower issuance environment compared to the first quarter of last year, though issuance improved sequentially from the fourth quarter. We'll walk through the deficients in more detail in a moment. Adjusted expenses were up only 1% year-over-year, driven by cost synergies and other operational efficiencies. Adjusted operating profit increased 5% year-over-year, as margins expanded to 46.2%. I'm pleased to report a sustainability and energy transition revenue increase of 27% to $69 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand in sustainability products in MI's climate and physical risk products and CI's energy transition products.  Private market solutions revenue remained at the $100 million level, as growth in products from market intelligence were offset by declines in ratings due to the timing of private market issuance. We still expect growth in private markets this year to be in line with the targets laid out at Investor Day.  Vitality revenue, which is the revenue generated by innovation through new or enhanced products from across the organization, was $326 million in the first quarter, representing a 17% increase compared to prior year. Synergies are a key contributor to expense savings and margin expansion this quarter.  In the first quarter of 2023, we recognized $131 million of expense savings due to cost synergies and our annualized run rate exiting the quarter was $552 million. And we continue to expect our year-end run rate to be approximately $600 million. We continue to make progress on our revenue synergies as well, with $17 million in synergies achieved in the first quarter, and an annualized run rate of $52 million.  Turning to strategic capital allocation, we remain committed to discipline capital management, including investing for long-term growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. We executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR in the first quarter, and we plan to launch a new $1 billion ASR in the coming weeks, leveraging the proceeds of the engineering solutions divestiture and cash on hand.  We have been able to take advantage of market dislocations over the last year to repurchase shares at attractive prices, which allows us to reduce our fully diluted share count by 8% over that time period. Since the close of the merger last year, we have been able to repurchase more than 31% of the shares issued to complete the merger with IHS Markit. We continue to invest in organic growth as well and remain on track to invest $150 million in our 2023 strategic projects. Now let's turn to the deficient results. Market intelligence revenue increased 5% driven by strong growth in data and advisory solutions and credit and risk solutions and favorable commercial conditions overall. That's improved 3.5% in the first quarter, driven in part by strong demand for new content and capabilities supported by the merger, though growth was tempered somewhat by a continuation of the modest softness in financial services that we called out last quarter.  Renewal rates remain strong in the mid to high 90s. Data and advisory solutions and enterprise solutions both benefited from solid growth and subscription-based offerings. Credit and risk solutions benefitted from strong new sales for ratings express and ratings direct products. Adjusted expenses were roughly flat year-over-year, as increases in compensation expense, cloud spent and T&E were offset by cost synergies and lower occupancy costs. Operating profit increased 16% and operating margin increased 300 basis points to 32%. Looking at the remainder of 2023, we know the comparisons will get easier as we progress through the year and we continue to expect improvements in those products within enterprise solutions that depend on capital markets activity. We also expect revenue synergies to begin positively impacting results in the back half of the year.  We continue to recognize significant cost synergies as well and remain confident in our ability to deliver accelerating growth and full year margin expansion in market intelligence. While we are not changing the formal guidance ranges for revenue or adjusted operating margin, we do see increased uncertainty in the markets and within the banking sector specifically. As such, we may come in closer to the low end of these ranges.  Now turning to ratings, despite being down year-over-year, we're encouraged by the improvement we have seen in the issuance environment relative to last quarter. Revenue decreased 5% year-over-year. However, this is the second quarter in a row of sequential improvement in transaction revenue, as investment grade and high yield showed pockets of strength in the quarter, particularly in January and February.  Non-transaction revenue declined 4% and 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to declines in initial issuer credit rating and rating evaluation surface, partially offset by growth in CRISIL. Adjusted expenses decreased 3%, driven by lower occupancy costs and outside surfaces expenses partially offset by higher compensation expense. This resulted in a 6% decrease in operating profit and an 80 basis points decrease in operating margin to 58.3%.  We raised our built issuance assumption for 2023, and expect issuance to increase in the range of 3% to 7%, reflecting the stronger issuance trend in the first quarter. We expect to see an improvement in full year transaction revenues compared to our initial expectations, though we expect the upside to be offset by slightly lower contribution from non-transaction due to ICR and RES headwinds. And now turning to commodity insights, revenue growth accelerated to 9% despite a very high comparison last year. Excluding the impact of the CERAWeek conference, revenue growth for commodity insights would have been approximately 6% year-over-year. Growth was partially offset by the loss of revenue related to Russia, which contributed $11 million in the first quarter of 2022.  Advisory and transactional services increased 28% in the quarter, primarily due to CERAWeek official record attendance coupled with strong sponsorship sales. Upstream data and insights declined approximately 1% year-over-year, and subscription growth was offset by reduced one-time sales relative to last year. As we noted last quarter, we continue to expect low single digit revenue growth in upstream for the full year.  Price assessments and energy resources data and insights both grew 8% compared to prior year, driven by strong performance in crude oil products and continued commercial momentum. Adjusted expenses increased 3% primarily due to higher event costs driven by conferences, T&E and compensation, partially offset by realization of cost synergies and lower consulting spent. Excluding the impact of CERAWeek, expense growth would have been only 1%.  Operating profit for CI increased a very strong 17% and operating margin improved 310 basis points to 46.1%. We expect commodity insights to continue to benefit from strong demand in price assessments and other subscription offerings, as well as the continuation of secular trends around energy transition and sustainability.  As we saw from the incredible growth at CERAWeek, there remains a remarkable opportunity to further our leadership in the energy sector and in commodities more broadly. And we will continue to invest to capture that opportunity and drive multiyear profitable growth.  In our mobility deficient, revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by continued new business growth in CARFAX, strong recall activity and growth within planning solutions products. The Market Scan acquisition contributed approximately 1 point of revenue growth in the quarter and is recognized in the dealer category.  Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by price increases and new store growth, particularly in CARFAX for Life and used car subscription products. Manufacturing grew 11% year-over-year, driven by our planning products and recall activity. Financials and other also increased 11% as the business line continues to benefit from strong underwriting volumes and a favorable pricing environment.  Adjusted expenses increased 8% due to year-over-year increases in headcount, investment in software, and additional cloud usage, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. This resulted in a 14% increase in adjusted operating profit and 130 basis points operating margin expansion year-over-year. As we expected, we've seen expense growth rates moderate from fourth quarter, and we continue to expect margin expansion this year. We expect the Market Scan acquisition to contribute approximately 150 basis points of revenue growth in the full year, though we expect it to be modestly diluted to adjusted margins in 2023. All of this is reflected in our updated guidance.  Turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices, revenue increased 1%, primarily due to strong growth in exchange-traded derivative volumes, offset by declines in asset-linked fees. Asset-linked fees were down 6%, primarily driven by lower AUM in ETFs, which decreased 4% from the year ago period as price depreciation more than offset slightly positive year-over-year net inflows. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue increased 30% on increased trading volumes across key contracts, including an approximately 59% increase in S&P 500 index options volume. Data and custom subscriptions was flat on the quarter, though excluding the impact of some minor reclassification of revenue, as outlined on the slide, growth would have been 5% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for end of day and real-time data feats.  During the quarter, expenses decreased 7% year-over-year, driven by realization of cost synergies, lower bad debt expense and timing of discretionary spend, which was partially offset by continued strategic investments. Operating profit in indices increased 4% and operating margin improved 250 basis points to 71.8%.  As reflected in today's results, indices will continue to face headwinds in asset-linked fees as the year-over-year depreciation in underlying asset prices impacts to deficient on a lagged basis. Exchange-traded derivative revenue was well above our earlier expectations, though these volumes can be volatile and difficult to predict. We continue to invest to achieve the 2025 and 2026 target for 10% plus growth in indices. And we expect those investments as well as the timing of certain expenses to drive margins for the full year back within the guidance range.  In engineering solutions, we saw 2% revenue growth and 4% adjusted expense growth. As noted in our materials, we now expect to close the divestiture of engineering solutions next week. We're updating our guidance to reflect the accelerated timeline relative to our initial expectation for a June 30 close.  I've had the pleasure of overseeing the engineering solutions division since the merger closed, and I would like to thank them for the incredible dedication and professionalism the teams have consistently demonstrated. We're confident that there will be a strong addition to KKR and wish them all the best.  Now let's move to the latest views from our economists who are forecasting global GDP growth of 2.7% in 2023. While GDP growth is expected to be positive, our guidance still assumes a mild recession in the middle of the year and a modest recovery as we exit 2023. We continue to expect inflation above the target rates of central banks and energy prices like crude oil to remain above the historical averages as well. This creates favorable commercial conditions for many of our businesses, though it also contributes to volatility in the issuance environment, as we have been discussing over the last year.  As we consider how all of this will ultimately impact our financial performance in 2023, let's turn to our guidance. Now that we have some certainty around the timing of the engineering solutions divestiture, we can introduce initial GAAP guidance. Adjusted guidance for the company reflects the first quarter results as well as the updated view on the macroeconomic environment, issuance trends, equity valuations and other key drivers, as previously outlined. Our full year guidance now assumes that strong revenue performance in the first quarter is offset by a lower revenue contribution from engineering solutions due to the accelerated timing of the divestiture. The only change to our consolidated full year adjusted guidance is in adjusted free cash flow, which has been reduced by approximately $100 million primarily driven up by updated assumptions around cash taxes related to the R&D tax credit.  We have provided granular guidance on corporate unallocated expense, due related amortization, interest income and tax rate in the supplemental deck posted to our IR site, though these are unchanged from prior guidance. The final slides in this deck illustrate our revenue and margin guidance by deficient, reflecting the drivers that I mentioned previously.  In conclusion, despite the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, we've had a solid start to 2023 and remain confident about the outlook for the rest of the year. Before we open up for Q&A, I want to reiterate how excited we are as a management team when we consider the incredible opportunities we have to drive growth and innovation and the secular trends that continue to benefit our business, from key investment areas like energy transition and private markets through the inspiring breakthroughs that our Kensho team has driven in artificial intelligence and large language models.  It's a privilege to discuss the many ways we plan to create long-term shareholder value in the coming years. It's also a privilege to share this stage with leaders like Saugata Saha, President of Commodity Insights; and Dan Draper, CEO of S&P Dow Jones Indices, both of whom we would like to invite to join us for Q&A.  And with that, we'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Sure, Manav. Good morning. If you look at the dimensions with respect to market issuance and built issuance, actually we're seeing exactly the opposite of the pattern of 2022. So there are two large categories in market issuance that are down more that are not included in built issuance. So this is unrated debt, as well as frequent issuer. So frequent issuers, we don't have in build issuance because as you know they're on the fixed fee construction up to a certain level of volume. So therefore, we expect build issuance to be significantly higher than market issuance for the full year 2023. Thank you. Good morning, Ashish. We are overall really confident around the outlook for the full year. We are very pleased, of course, with the results in the first quarter, and then also the confidence around what we are going to achieve for the full year. And you see that reflected in the overall guidance that as you have noted is unchanged. But you have to realize that we're taking out two months of engineering solutions revenues and earnings. So you could say implicitly, we've slightly raised our full year guidance. And then by deficient, as you were asking for, the changes are due to the following. If you look at commodity insights, that is driven really by the outperformance of revenue growth in the first quarter. If you look at mobility, strong growth in the first quarter, but also the acquisition of Market Scan is helping there from a revenue perspective. And indices as well, what we're seeing there is also a very strong first quarter, and that is therefore also reflected in the full year revenue growth outlook. In terms of ratings, there is a shift that we have told you, a little bit higher transactional revenue, but a little bit lower non-transactional revenue. So net-net is still the same. But there is a shift in those two underlying categories. And then with respect to margins, mobility has been tuned down a bit. That is the dilutive effect of the acquisition. But on the flipside, for the indices business, we see that the margins are actually up, given the strong performance in the first quarter again. With respect to market intelligence, we have said that we come in more at the lower end of the ranges, both for revenues and margins. And that has to do with the macro environment, a bit of the uncertainty, the fact that we expect some of the capital markets products, more to come back later in the year, because now we assume the recession is somewhere mid of this year, as well as some of the impacts of the banking crisis, although we think that impact will be really minimal for market intelligence. Of course, George. Thank you so much, and good morning. We are, of course, very pleased with the progress we're making with synergies. This is really a statement of execution of the whole team, of the whole company and the speed of the implementation of all of our programs is really impressive from my perspective. So we are at 550 million run rate cost synergies at this moment. These are cost synergies we're doing in all the categories that we have outlined before. There's of course organizational and duplication of roles that we're taking care of. Then there's real estate consolidation, vendor consolidation, and several other categories. This is all linked to integration. So we like to get the integration behind us as quickly as possible, and that we can fully operate as a combined company going forward. And we're very close to that point now. And that is expressed by the progress we have made with cost synergies, and getting really now not too far away anymore from the 600 million cost synergy mark. And so this is all across the company. With respect to revenue synergies, we see very nice progress in the divisions. The largest growth there we see in market intelligence and commodity insights, but contributions by all of the divisions. We have always said from the beginning that revenue synergies will take more time. At this moment, the focus is mostly on cross sell. And then later this year and the next few years, we will shift to new product development. But obviously the lead time to develop new products into the system, enhancement for that will take a bit longer. But both on cost and revenue synergies we're very pleased where we are at this moment. Toni, when we look at the first quarter revenues for sustainability and energy transition, we actually think that this is really strong for the company. And we are still confident that for the full year outlook, the growth will be in line with our medium-term expectations. And the reason for that is, as Doug outlined, that we have very diverse revenue streams underneath sustainability and energy transition, and all of our decisions contribute to the progress and to the growth. So think about, for example, in mobility what is happening, the huge transformation of the industry around electrification, move to EVs and what that means for the OEMs with respect to thinking about supply chains and new manufacturing and where they sourced the batteries, what is happening in the commodity space with energy transition, what is happening with new price assessments around hydrogen and carbon and biofuels and recycled plastics, what is happening in the rating space with second party opinions? And then Doug already mentioned climate, really there's so much focus now about climate; climate analytics, climate credit analytics, climate data. Just to give you one data point, Trucost actually grew more than 50% in the quarter. So overall, if we added up, I think we have very strong revenue streams. And therefore we are confident about our future growth in this industry and this particular growth area. Toni, the way how we look at it is, we really believe we're ahead of the game here. We did the acquisition of Kensho five years ago when just very few people were thinking about artificial intelligence. We have already embedded a lot of Kensho's products and tools within our businesses over the last few years. And our intention is really to stay ahead and to really make sure that we continue to implement this and be one of the winners in this market. We told you this morning we have not five Kensho products that are in the market, that's just for external customers. But internally, there are many more products. And actually the efficiency opportunities that Kensho has created for the deficients is very large. Maybe if I may expand on this in one particular area. If we think about large language models and generative AI, actually three areas are really critical. It is compute, which is really expensive. Then there are the algorithms which are more open source and generic. And then it is about training data. And training data is really differentiating. And if you have really good training data, you can improve the algorithms and you can drive down the compute cost. We have at S&P Global the largest training data set for financial markets, plus the best team of Kensho that we already outlined. So we have no need to export our data to someone else models or generic large language models. We can do this in-house. And you may expect that we will have more announcements around this later this year. Yes, Alex, good morning. This is Ewout. I will start and then hand it over to Doug. Generally, we are confident about the outlook of market intelligence for the remainder of the year due to a couple of reasons. The first is growth of the subscription book of business, we see some healthy growth. Then we have good revenue synergies that will come in over the next period of time. We're expecting a capital markets recovery at the end of the year. So that should help enterprise solutions. And then also the comps will become easier and FX headwinds will become easier during the course of this year. So those are the elements that will help us to remain confident with the outlook. With respect to the specifics of the banking impact, we think this is overall manageable and not material for market intelligence. And the reason for that is the following. Market intelligence actually has a very diverse customer base. Only 10% of the customer revenue is coming from commercial banks, and these are global commercial banks, so not specifically U.S. or Europe. So that's actually a relatively low percentage. And then we have multiyear subscription contracts with those customers. We have tuned it down in the guidance range to the lower end of the range given the uncertainty, given the fact that we are still expecting a shallow and short recession in the mid of this year, and we want to be cautious. But overall, that's why we still believe we should be able to come in within the range for market intelligence for the full year. Good morning, Craig. We're actually really looking positively for all the underlying revenue drivers within mobility. First, when you look at dealers, you see a little bit two effects going in opposite directions, as Doug explained earlier. So maybe their margins are coming down a bit, inventory levels are going up. So therefore retention is a little bit lower. But on the flipside is that there is more demand for sales and marketing products, because they need to be more proactively reaching out to potential customers in the future. So that is actually driving the growth in the dealership. Moreover, I think CARFAX is super entrepreneurial, really innovative, launching a lot of new products. And that is helping with the growth there as well. Manufacturing, the same thing. Also, there they are exposed to more needs to really reach out to customers through our marketing and sales products. So that is going to be helpful there as well. Plus all the changes that are happening with the transformation to EVs and our planning products, they are helping our OEM customers. And then our data is flowing to insurance companies, to banks and other loan entities that need the data for the pricing of their products. So we expect that to continue to grow as well at healthy levels during the course of this year. So overall, I would say positive momentum for mobility and I have no reason to believe that that would not continue in the future. Absolutely, Jeff. So the way we look at this is most of our products are must-have products for our customers. We are deeply embedded in their workflows, in their day-to-day activities. Therefore, we add a lot of value to our customers. And that should give us an opportunity to pass on any cost price increases as a result of the inflationary environment in terms of pricing and fees. But obviously, we're doing that in a very responsible way. We're doing that in a very balanced way that will come in gradually over time at the moment of contract renewals. But overall, we think that is reasonable to pass on cost price increases to customers, and therefore we still expect to expand margins in this current environment. I'm looking at maybe one of my colleagues, Dan or Saugata, if you would like to give any particular color for your businesses. Thanks, Owen. I will give you a more broader perspective and then hand it over to Saugata for some specific Kensho implementations in commodity insights. So overall, Kensho for the last few years has been very much focused on product development, speed to market, new product design, new design of delivery, customer experience within S&P Global, but slowly is now also turning more externally, again, because many of those products that have been developed are also attractive for external customers. Overall, if you look at the value that is generated, it's both value internally and externally. In terms of external customers, we have now more than 50 external customers in areas like asset managers, large banks, hedge funds, and corporates. And this is all the products that we have highlighted before; Link, Nerd, Scribe, Extract and Classify, so many good products. But let me hand it over to Saugata to give you more details about commodity insights. Andrew, we said that for Market Scan, during the quarter, the impact is around 1 point. So it's around $3 million to $4 million. It's overall immaterial for the company as a whole as you understand. The other two sides in ChartIQ really are immaterial for market intelligence. So from a modeling perspective, I wouldn't put any number into your model. But then I would like to point out that the revenues and the earnings were loose in our models. And our plan for the full year by divesting engineering solutions two months earlier is actually net-net going to reduce the overall impact on our plans. So the net of divestiture of engineering solutions and in requisitions is actually a negative, hence my comments earlier during this call that implicitly we're raising the guidance for the full year by holding the range to same for the company as a whole. Yes, that's correct. And then looking at one part, and that is with respect to the last part of the question around the total contribution of new products to the top line growth of the company, we said at Investor Day, as you might recall, about 80 basis points of contribution to overall growth for the company from the new initiatives. And obviously, our focus is to continue to see that developing further in the future. Therefore, vitality is such an important metric for us, because it is an indicator of a healthy innovation within S&P Global. But I just would like to point out that products will rotate off from the vitality index after three to five years, because at some point, they are not a new product anymore, and they will become business as usual. But the last piece of information I want to give in terms of the health of innovation around vitality is we have seen double digit vitality levels within our businesses this quarter from market intelligence, from mobility, from commodity insights, and from indices. So very positive all across the board. Russell, there's two kinds of investments in new initiatives. There is investments in our strategic programs, our strategic investment program of $150 million. You should assume that that comes in gradually over time, so no particular seasonality. And then we're making investments, what we called cost to achieve, which are related to revenue synergies and realization of revenue synergies. Those will come in also over time, but those are pulled out from a performance perspective. So those you won't see in the actual performance results, the normal cap results that we're reporting now and in the future. Yes, we have said revenue synergies, Simon, are coming in over a period of three to five years, about 45% cross sell, which is more the first two years and then 55% coming from new products, which is more year three to five. So you should see this actually -- see that ramping up over the next period during the course of this year, and we saw actually quite a nice jump from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we're now at that 52 million run rate level. But you see that going up in quite a nice way over the next couple of quarters. But obviously, revenue synergies take more time to accomplish compared to cost synergies. Yes. Thanks, Stephanie. Our expectation now in terms of assumptions for the year is the following. Obviously, strong performance in the first quarter, as you have seen, then more a short and shallow recession in second quarter, third quarter. Obviously, we're still very careful what to expect for the year that there's not some unexpected volatility happening in the markets. So we're actually running a very tight ship, very careful from expenses and investments, headcounts very careful. But then we are ready to invest, because the most important is that we are investing in future growth. And hopefully, we'll see somewhere at the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter really markets coming back in a very strong way. And we're ready to take advantage of that. In terms of downturn levers that we have, it's the usual list that we have always been outlining, and you know that we're on top of our game. And we will pull those levers, if needed. But already today, as you have seen, the cost controls are really very strong and the cost growth is really low. Certainly also if you take into account of that last year, we had actually flat expenses, and now only really minimal expense growth in the first quarter. But the downturn levers are the usual one around variable spend, discretionary spend, hiring, investment spend in other areas. So we're ready to take action, if that's needed. But hopefully, we are more in a position that we can invest in future growth, because that's the real fun part, and the part how we really can deliver shareholder value from a medium and long-term perspective."

            "name": "Dan Draper",
            "content": "Yes, sure. Jeff, it's Dan. Thank you very much for the question. Look, to echo Ewout's comments that we align pricing with the value we create for our customers. And if you look at something specifically for indices, this massive secular growth trends switch from active to passive management, that's something that we want to be aligned with our clients and ensure that again we're representing the value and really working closely. And I think if you look at the outcome that we estimate over the last 26 years from our three core indices, the S&P 500, 400 and 600 that we saved investors over $400 billion in management fees. So that's benefiting directly savers, retirees, people saving for college education, things like that. So I think pricing is a strategic tool that we look through and really use again to align growth and interests with clients. Yes. Hi, Jeff. Thanks for the question. In terms of the vitality, we think of that sustainability was a theme. I think Doug and Ewout both kind of emphasized, that's a huge opportunity for us, particularly as we expand to other regions in Europe, Asia, that's always top of mind for us. I'd also say factors schematics [ph], and specifically if you think about the need for income globally. So for us having the leading dividend, equity dividend franchise, our aristocrats, we're seeing a lot of demand there. If you think about in developed markets ageing populations, the need for retirement income, but hey, now there's inflation. So all of a sudden, I need to protect capital and standards of living. So that's where the combination of using, say, our S&P 500 equity franchise to supplement fixed income, that's clearly a big synergy from the IHS Markit, and specifically our IBOX franchise. So what we're seeing now is combining like around the world kind of that dividend franchise we have with credit, and being able to offer now multi-asset solutions. And particularly markets like Japan, one of our largest asset management clients, just launched the first multi-asset ETF in that marketplace. So again, really bringing synergy and capabilities, but I think income leading into that, also in sustainability looking to combine really the partnership within S&P Global. Even Saugata's business in commodity insights, we've been able to use unique proprietary data sets around the electric vehicles. I think Ewout had mentioned, we came out in partnership again with commodity insights with our GSCI franchise to come out with an electric vehicles metal index. Again, other data sets were Trucost and sustainability. So I think this is really -- as we go back to that 2025, 2026 outlook we gave in Investor Day, this is really looking through increasingly these proprietary data sets, being part of S&P Global to really look at some of these mega trends around the world."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Doug Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As we look at this quarter's highlights, I want to remind you that the financial metrics we'll be discussing today refer to the non-GAAP adjusted metrics for the current period and for 2023 adjusted guidance and non-GAAP pro forma adjusted metrics in the year ago period, unless explicitly called out as GAAP.  We're pleased to report 3% revenue growth in the first quarter compared to pro forma results in the year ago period. We continue to generate substantial synergies and manage our other expenses with discipline, as demonstrated by the 1% growth in total adjusted expenses in the first quarter. Our focus on top line growth and expense management resulted in an expansion more than 100 basis points in the adjusted margin and a 9% year-over-year growth in adjusted EPS.  In addition to our strong financial results, we also made progress on many of the strategic initiatives we laid out for you at Investor Day. We continue to prioritize innovation in our technology budgets, and reached important milestones in our cloud migration. We also hosted a record-breaking CERAWeek in the first quarter, and we also expanded our lead in AI with Kensho releasing two more commercially available products built on our proprietary AI and machine learning platforms. We'll discuss these important highlights in more detail in a moment. One of the key messages from our Investor Day last December was the introduction of the five pillars that drive our strategy of powering global markets. Beginning this quarter, we'll be discussing our results using that same framework. We use these pillars as a lens to inform our decisions on capital allocation and organic investment that impact our people, our customers and the communities in which we live and work. First, I want to start with our customers. Delivering value to our customers drives every decision we make at S&P Global. We constantly hear from our customers that they're focused on the same things we are. During the first quarter in almost every customer conversation I had, we discussed energy transition and sustainability, as well as our products that serve private markets. We continue to see evidence of the value we create for our customers.  We saw strong and stable retention rates in the first quarter, with year-over-year improvements in commodity insights and several products and other divisions. As expected and previously discussed, retention rates and mobility have declined modestly, as automotive inventory levels and volumes start to normalize.  We also saw some modest lengthening of the sales cycle in certain parts of the business in the first quarter, as some enterprise customers, particularly in financial services, are understandably focused on margin protection and managing their own expenses. This is a continuation of what we saw on the back half of last year.  As I've met with customers over the last few months, including large automotive OEMs, retail companies, asset managers, banks and others, the recurring theme is that they want to do more with us. There's a large opportunity to raise awareness of the breadth of our product offerings, and customers have been consistently impressed by the products we've introduced to them. That should ultimately improve customer value and our results.  We also look to create quality of life improvements in those customer relationships, and our CI teams have done an excellent job of helping customers migrate to enterprise contracts. That migration reduces contract complexity for our customers, and enhances the overall customer experience in a meaningful way.  Turning to our ratings customers. During the first quarter, global build issuance in aggregate decreased 7% year-over-year. While we saw strong sequential improvement from issuance levels last quarter, the uncertainty in the banking sector that emerged in March muted the impact to build issuance for the whole quarter. Refinancing activity was strong in the first quarter, particularly in high yield and bank loans, though opportunistic issuance remained muted.  We're pleased that build issuance for investment grade increased in the first quarter, though this was largely due to a few very large deals. We're also pleased with the strength we saw in CLOs in the first quarter. The decision we made last year to preserve capacity and maintain the strength of our analytical organization is already proving to be the right call, as our growth in CLOs was particularly strong. Next, I'd like to focus on our strategic priority to grow and innovate. So far this year, we've launched several new products. An example of our product synergies, teams from Platts and IHS Markit worked together to integrate the Platts forward curve into our real-time analytics platform energy studio impact. We preview this innovation at our Investor Day, which provides clients with the most comprehensive and valuable data and insights in the industry while strengthening our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation.  So far this year, we've also introduced new price assessments for black mass in Europe and Asia, and for R-PET in India to improve transparency in pricing of battery raw materials and recycled plastics. We remain focused and disciplined in our M&A, completing the acquisitions of TruSight and ChartIQ within market intelligence and market scan within mobility. These tuck-in acquisitions strengthen our current offerings that we expect even this type of M&A activity to be rare for the rest of the year.  As discussed at Investor Day, we're introducing our vitality revenue metric which consists of revenue derived from new or substantially enhanced products. We're pleased that in the first quarter, vitality revenue constituted 11% of total revenue, consistent with our goal of maintaining a vitality index at or above 10%. Much of this growth will be enabled by enhancements to our own data and technology capabilities.  As we optimize our technology spend to accelerate the pace of innovation, we're thrilled with the progress made in the first quarter. As we disclosed in February, we announced a strategic partnership with Amazon AWS to collaborate in product development and joint go-to-market initiatives. That partnership allows us to further transition workloads to the cloud and decommission our own data centers, three of which we closed just in the first quarter.  Cross organization teams also worked diligently to complete two software systems integrations to ensure that the combined company is operating on unified platforms in the most efficient way possible. Initiatives like these allow us to put more resources behind revenue-generating innovation as well, like the AI-powered products that Kensho has been developing for five years. There is excitement in the field of artificial intelligence, and we're extending our leadership and focusing on innovation that will benefit our customers and increase the value of our products. With the commercial launch of two new products in the first quarter, there are five Kensho branded AI-powered products commercially available today on the S&P Global marketplace. We're very excited about the developments in this field, and we'll discuss our own launches in more detail in the coming months.  Shifting now to how we lead and inspire our people, customers and communities. In the first quarter, we launched the ninth iteration of our people-first initiative, and made investments to expand resources for continuous learning, leadership development, and upskilling through our Central Tech programs. These investments in our people help us attract, retain and develop incredibly talented people, which ultimately lead to better financial results for our shareholders too.  We also continue to lead and inspire the industries we serve as we power global markets. In the first quarter, we published the inaugural Look Forward Report, which outlines the expectations of our economists, analysts, researchers and data experts. This report is a product of our research council at S&P Global, which was formed last year to help us look beyond the near term, and explore the trends that will shape our collective future.  Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, we hosted CERAWeek in Houston, Texas in March. This conference brought together over 8,000 leaders in the energy industry, who participated in over 650 events to help tackle global issues like energy security, energy transition and sustainability, as well as how to navigate the turbulent times in the commodity markets today.  Now looking across the company, we're pleased with the strong execution of all our divisions this quarter. While we continue to see the impact of the issuance environment, our ratings division, we're also seeing signs of revenue stabilization as we begin to lap the challenging issuance conditions that began during the first quarter last year.  We saw positive revenue growth in all of our other divisions in the first quarter, and continued to balance expense managed with strategic organic investment to make sure we're well positioned to accelerate our revenue growth over the next few years. Expenses can of course be seasonal. So we look at the margins on a trailing 12-month basis, and we expect these figures to improve as we progress through the year. As we look through the remainder of the year, I'd like to touch on some of the factors influencing our company's performance. We continue to expect a mild recession this year, though the timing is more likely a few months later, relative to our initial expectations. We also expect to see volatility in various markets, including equities, credit and commodities. We see no change to the secular trends shaping the future opportunities for us, like the shift from active to passive asset management and energy transition.  While these market expectations are mostly unchanged from February, we wanted to highlight the potential impact in the banking market. As we're all aware, the events around regional banks in the U.S. and a major Swiss bank added uncertainty to the markets in March. We do not have material direct exposure to the impacted regional banks, and we do not expect the events in that end market to materially increase the risk to our financial guidance in 2023, or to the medium term targets we laid out in Investor Day.  We do see slightly elevated risk of default rates impacting the broader credit markets, particularly in high yield, which will also inform our updated issuance outlook. Our ratings financial results and guidance are closely tied to build issuance. And for 2023, we now expect build issuance to be up approximately 3% to 7% for the full year.  Our latest ratings research group forecast calls for a decline in global market issuance. As a reminder, market issuance can differ materially from build issuance, as we've described in recent quarters, with much of the delta this year driven by declines in unrated debt and sovereign and international public finance, which don't impact build issuance.  And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ewout Steenbergen who's going to provide additional insights into our financial performance and outlook. Ewout? Good morning. Thank you, Manav, for joining the call. The mobility question you have relates to some of the changes that are happening at a structural level in the mobility and transportation business. If you recall the last couple of years, we saw all of the used cars became a very large sales aspect for the dealers and the automotive manufacturers. The OEMs were struggling to actually meet demand. So we're seeing a shift away from used cars to new cars. And we actually expect that there's going to be a lot of growth in the sales of automotive products around the globe this year. And where we're seeing some of the slowdown in subscription relates to dealers, as dealers don't have necessarily the same margin, they might be changing some of their approach to how they're working with the sales force they have. So we're seeing that that's one of the areas where we see some disruption in some retention rates that have started to drop. Other than that across the board and the rest of the company, we do not see any changes whatsoever to retention rates. Yes. Thank you, Ashish. What's driving growth in that segment, if you recall over the last couple of years, there was -- the supply chains had been disrupted. There were no access to different types of chips, which are used in the automotive sector, including even things like key fobs. And you also saw a lot of disruption demand from the market as people were looking for cars, but they couldn't get them. So we're seeing that manufacturing is up. In fact, our total vehicle sales globally, we're seeing very strong sales coming up in the U.S., over about 7.5% growth in China, about 6% growth in Asia, including Japan and South Korea, about 6.5% growth and in Europe about 7.5% growth. So across the board, we see a lot of growth in production as well as coming from a very, very depressed base. But at the same time, it puts some pressure because the demand is starting to decrease as well, given the inflation, given interest rates are going up. So we see that right now, there's a lot of demand for information from our mobility team, because we provide the forecasting, we provide the information about the changes going on in the industry, as well as the day-to-day dynamics. But we're shifting the dynamics from what had been a supply constrained market to a richer approach to more supply in the market and shifts in customer demand that all of this benefits our mobility business because they provide the data and analytics that dealers and OEMs and suppliers need to make decisions. Thank you. Thank you, George. Well, first of all, this was a very lumpy quarter when you look at the issuance. It started out quite strong of issuance. Investment grade had started off strong, but through the quarter in the U.S. it declined 14%, in Europe it increased 3%. A high yield increase in the U.S. 20% but it decreased in Europe 2% and structured finance in the U.S. decreased 48%. And in Europe, it increased 7%. So this was an incredibly lumpy quarter for us. But we've been very adamant about having our sales people and our commercial people out in the markets. We keep our finger to the pulse of what's happening across the markets. We've been involved in supplying information for the structured credit, an area in particular CLOs. We've been strong in the CLO market in the last quarter. We see going forward we think that for the rest of the year that it's going to be mostly refinancing that's going to drive what we see is the issuance. If you take a step back and last quarter, we issued a slide which we show once a year, which is the pipeline of refinancing, which is on the balance sheet of companies, financial institutions and other organizations over the next 5 to 10 years. And you can see there was a lot of financing that took place over the last 10 years with typically five, seven, sometimes up to 10-year maturity. That's starting to mature now. And we're starting to see some of that pull forward. And the question is, what are the right conditions for people to come back to the market? And that's something we're watching very closely, because there is a very, very large pipeline of refinancing that's going to be coming over the next three to five years, and we're going to watch that carefully including what's going to be coming this year. Thanks, George. Thank you, Toni. I'm going to start and then hand it over to Ewout. If you take a step back and you think about something like the ESG sustainability, climate markets, they go back the last five, six, seven years. And if you look at our company, we have products that go back 50, 65, 100 years. And the experience of a market like this, it's really changing rapidly. And fortunately, because of our Sustainable 1 organization and the way that we've been investing in sustainability products, energy transition climate, ESG across our entire company and coordinating it through S1, we're seeing strength across pretty much the entire portfolio. And in particular, we're seeing a shift away from ESG to climate in the U.S. and around the rest of the globe. One of the things that I always say is that the train has left the station on this. This is an area that's going to be growing very quickly. It's high demand, it's coming from corporates, it's coming from governments, from regulators, from financial institutions, every part of the financial institution area. And we have products from Trucost, our ESG data suite. We've got bond referencing prices, physical risk, we're in the middle of what I'd say is one of the most important dialogues taking place with regulators around the globe about disclosure. But let me hand it over to Ewout to talk a little bit more about the numbers. Thank you, Toni. Alex, what I wanted to add is that I've been on the road almost nonstop this year and seeing clients. And it's been incredible the kind of feedback we're getting about the value that the market intelligence team is bringing with the data that's getting built into different platforms. And what Ewout just highlighted that market intelligence customer base is very diversified. We don't just have a financial institution. Client base within financial institutions, we're not just focused on only one single segment. So I've had really interesting conversations with corporates about the data that we have in market intelligence, what we can provide in investor relations coordinator, which is used by different traders, by supply chain. We have a new product which is a supply chain console that corporates are finding incredibly useful for them to understand what would be their needs for managing shipping, supply chain risk, et cetera. So I'm really encouraged by what we're seeing. The client dialogue is what I wanted to highlight. Yes, thanks for that, Alex. Well, first of all, we have much, much lower exposure to that sector than some of the other competitors in our space. We do watch it very closely, because it does help with some of the -- understanding some of the credit dynamics in the country overall. We do see in the U.S. that there could be some slowdown in credit. And that's one of the reasons that we've been cautious about our own economic forecast for the rest of the year. You heard as Ewout said that we expect that there would be a mild recession or a mild slowdown as we see a dip in the second or third quarter. And we think part of that could be caused by the slowdown in credit. But overall, we have very low exposure to this area. And it's likely that some of the areas that we see that the credit will get picked up by the private markets or securitization, and some of those we might actually benefit from some of the activity on those. Thanks, Alex. Thanks, Craig. Well, let me give you a broader sense of issuance and just reconcile a little bit what we talked about earlier on the call. As you know, we have our credit research team issues a report on what they see is the full forecast for the year. And right now they're expecting that the range across all of the different areas would be down about 3.5%. And then we've said that we think what the range of build issuance will be up about 3% to 7%. We don't break it out between what would be leveraged loans and high yield. Those are part of that. But in the first quarter, high yield issuance was up about 6% of build issuance and bank loans was down about 33%. In many cases, those are substitutes for each other. Sometimes you can see somebody says, well, am I going to issue a floating rate or a fixed rate, what are the market conditions or I'm going to go to the private markets, which had been quite quick, they're fast, but they also have in some cases, higher spreads on them, as well as maybe more covenants. But we think that there's going to be a very dynamic market. Overall, I think you should focus on the 3% to 7% build issuance up and look at the different components of where we see that's happening. Just as an FYI, in our credit research teams forecast, they see that corporates will be up about 8.5% for the year. So think of that as kind of an anchor. And also remember what I said earlier to one of the earlier questions about the amount of refinancing that it's already taking place. Maybe the last point I'd make is that we see that in this market with these conditions with some uncertainty about rates and inflation, et cetera, issuance is very, very opportunistic. You can see a flood of issuance over a week or two weeks. And then sometimes the markets are pulling back. For instance, the last couple of weeks have been very encouraging. But we said the same thing about the first two months of the year. So we watch this closely. We're forecasting, but go back to what the long-term issue is. M&A is going to come back, rates will eventually stabilize, conditions will be positive for people to invest and grow. We have these massive programs in the U.S. that are just starting to get launched for an infrastructure build, for the CHIPS Act, for the IRA, the capital that's going to be going into energy transition, all of that is going to attract investment. It's going to attract M&A. It's going attract debt investment. This isn't just going to be done using capital from the government. There's going to be public/private partnership, public/private capital going into these areas, and I just see a huge amount of capital that's going to be deployed here. We're going to see the same thing in Europe, same thing in Asia. So I just believe that this energy transition, what we're going to see with the CHIPS Act, et cetera, is going to create a lot of investment globally. And we should be benefiting from all of that over the long run. Thanks, Craig. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, hi, Owen. Thanks, again, for the question. I think in terms of the performance, as Ewout had mentioned, we had the difficult comps, but also the asset prices and our asset-linked, if you think back, you kind of build that in arrears [indiscernible] quarter was coming off of the market highs at the end of 2021, so comparing that. And also there was some seasonality in products like the S&P 500. You do see the liquidity benefits of that product. I really think inflows late in the year and that can come out in early through the year on that. Where we saw the outperformance was in exchange-traded derivatives. Obviously, we've seen a very fast increase in nominal interest rates. And that's really caused some dislocation in the way that risk premium across asset classes, and so that's obviously increased volatility. So we're so well positioned in this ecosystem we built. What we discussed back in the Investor Day in December, being able to align and provide price discovery, liquidity and crucially for the exchange-traded derivative market being able to manage risks. And so what we're seeing is a combination of secular growth trends there, extended trading hours, shorting down to intraday or even single day types of access to derivative products, but there's also cyclicality. We do know that over time, volatility will particularly normalize, potentially mean will revert to some degree. So in terms of our outlook, we want to make sure that we manage that appropriately. So if you think about the margin, just kind of looking for the rest of the year, we do like exchange-traded derivatives. They do have a higher gross margin than our asset-linked, but we do expect that mix to change. We do expect, hopefully, the flows to change that. So it's going to be reflected in the revenue mix we have. Also we had some one-time expenses that were non-recurring. And we also had some lapping incentive comp expense reductions last year. But what we really want to do ultimately is to reinvest back into the business. And I think that reflects, again, the way we're thinking about the margin for the rest of the year, and really leaning into again the secular growth trends we have. Thanks, Owen. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, hi, Russell. Thanks for the question. No, we actually have hit I think probably one of the most notable products in Europe was our Paris-Aligned & Climate Transition launch in fixed income. And so that aligns already what we've done in equities. So that was something we got to market. And there's now demand, we call it, the PACT Indices to do those in other parts of the world and other kind of regional exposures, whether it be emerging markets, global, what have you. So that was a really important product and index that we got to market. As I mentioned as well, multi-asset is really, really important for us too. So to align, again, the IBOX range, for example, investment grade, high yield, but to put that more intentionally alongside our leading equity franchises. So being able to do that on a channel basis, particularly areas like insurance. If you think about the annuity space, being able to go specifically there where multi-asset demand, it's also a channel historically that's had a lot of active management. So this bigger trend of shifting from active to passive, we are a leader in that space, but it's early days. Can we expand kind of our first mover advantage to again bring the IBOX capabilities? And again, we've already launched products I mentioned in Japan on multi-asset. We have development now moving forward really across the globe. But I'd say insurance is interesting. Retirement, I mentioned as well, another area that in some areas historically have been very actively oriented, again, combining fixed income with equity is where we want to be able to move forward. And it's a competitive place. Thanks, Russell. Thank you, Simon. This is Doug. Well, first of all, as you know, we've always been in a competitive environment and we also respect our competitors very, very much. This is an environment where, for us, it's up to bringing the most relevant, the newest, the fastest, the highest quality information, being responsive, as you've heard us talk about Kensho, artificial intelligence, machine learning, all of these types of things allow us to bring information and data and analytics and benchmarks to our customers even faster. So it's a very competitive environment. This also puts us on the -- keeps us on our toes. It makes us better because we have to always respond to the demands of the markets, as well as ensuring that we're faster and ahead of all of our competitors. Thanks, Simon. Thank you, Stephanie. I'd like to make a quick closing remark. And I want to thank everybody for being on the call today and your excellent questions. I also want to thank Dan and Saugata for joining us in the room. Great answers. It's nice to have you here. And we're also very pleased with how our year has started. As you recall, in December, we had an Investor Day where we launched a new strategy called power in global markets. And it's fantastic to be on such a strong start. And a lot of that has to do with our engagement with our customers.  We have been out talking to our customers, listening to them, understanding how they see the combined value of the company. And I personally have been very busy traveling around the world speaking with our key customers from every industry, from all of our businesses, and I'm more confident than ever about our strategy. And their comments provide us further information to validate our priorities, our investment in technology, our investment in AI, the quality of our people, how we see the products that we're developing in the future. And I'm just so confident about what we're seeing out there.  I also want to thank all of our people for helping us launch 2023. As always, they are phenomenal and it's why we're off to such a strong start. And so I'm really excited about everything we've achieved this year. I look forward to sharing more on our next earnings call. And again, thank you everyone for joining us today. Thank you very much."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Mark. S&P Global delivered exceptional financial results in the [Technical Difficulties]. Total revenue increased 16% year-over-year, marking the third consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our ratings division continues to contribute meaningfully to our outperformance with transaction revenue increasing more than 80% year-over-year. Revenue from subscription products across the company increased 8% year-over-year as customers continue to turn to S&P Global to provide the benchmarks, data, thought leadership, and tools they need to make crucial decisions in today's macroeconomic landscape. We delivered 330 basis points of trailing 12-month margin expansion and 21% growth in EPS as we continue to invest prudently across the business and return capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $2 billion in shares and plan to repurchase $1.3 billion more through year-end. In addition to our strong financial results, we continue to invest in innovation, particularly around generative AI and our strategic initiatives, which we'll touch on shortly. We also continue the important work of optimizing our portfolio of products in order to create the most customer and shareholder value. We closed the divestiture of Fincentric during the third quarter and today announced the planned divestiture of PrimeOne. PrimeOne sits within our Market Intelligence division and won't have a material impact on either the division or the company's financial results. That said, the divestiture further enables the company to focus our efforts on the best opportunities to drive long-term profitable growth. Last week, we announced management changes in conjunction with our CEO transition. Martina will walk through that later in the call. Now turning to market and commercial conditions. The debt, equity, and commodities markets all continue to show improvement benefiting our businesses. With more than $1 trillion in billed issuance in the third quarter, we've surpassed $3 trillion year-to-date. It's very encouraging to see how participants in the debt markets, both public and private consistently turn to S&P Global ratings to help assess risk, balance exposures across portfolios, and assess credit conditions. The experience and expertise of our analysts, the breadth and depth of our coverage across credit asset classes and geographies and the relevance of our methodologies and thought leadership has all served the markets very well thus far in 2024. We've also seen some improvement in equity markets as our flagship indices like the S&P 500 have performed very well year-to-date. We continue to see gradual increases in IPO volumes, which benefit some of our volume-driven businesses and M&A activity has also started to show early signs of recovery. The commodities markets have remained strong as well, especially in end-markets like energy that are important to our business. We continue to see retention rates improve year-over-year in Commodity Insights and are very pleased with both the execution and the market reception of the new products. That said, we've been calling out headwinds among our financial services customers for some time now. Those have continued in the third quarter with elongated sales cycles as well as signs of increased price sensitivity and vendor consolidation. Vendor consolidation has historically been beneficial to S&P Global given the breadth and diversity of products that we offer, though the pricing environment has had an impact this year. For the last few quarters, we have noted our expectation that retention rates in financial services would be slightly below last year. That said, cancellations among our smaller customers in Market Intelligence caused retention rates to dip below our expectations slightly in the third quarter, and we expect that to continue to impact the business in the fourth quarter. We'll discuss the impact of all these moving pieces on our guidance in a moment, but the aggregate impact is that we are substantially increasing our outlook on revenue growth, operating margins, and EPS for 2024. Now, let's turn to activity in the debt markets. For Billed Issuance, we saw a 76% increase year-over-year in the third quarter as we saw strong growth across all products. Refinancing activity remains very strong, including some pull-forward out of 2025 and even out of 2026, but certainly within the normal ranges of what we would expect at this time of the year. We're starting to see more activity beyond refinancing with some of the outperformance in the third quarter driven by opportunistic issuance around dividend recapitalizations and the beginning of a recovery in M&A activity. Market conditions, specifically the tight spreads and stability around the rate outlook have continued to be major drivers of issuance in the third quarter and inform our improved outlook for the remainder of 2024 as well. As we look to additional rate cuts over the next 12 months to 18 months, we continue to expect strong demand among investors for public debt as the current yields are expected to moderate somewhat as rates come down. Turning to Vitality, newer enhanced products generated $377 million in the third quarter. This represents 11% of our total revenue and is consistent with what we reported last quarter. Key contributors to our Vitality index are updated from last quarter as we've seen strong demand for CARFAX Listings in the CARFAX Banking and Insurance Group. We also see strong growth in energy transition and climate and LNG price assessment products from our Commodity Insights division. We're encouraged by the acceleration in the pace of innovation at S&P Global and look forward to maintaining our Vitality index at or above the 10% target. Now turning to our latest initiatives around Generative AI. Each quarter, we've been highlighting just a few of the many ways we've been leveraging both Traditional AI and Generative AI within S&P Global. In the third quarter, we had a number of new use cases within our products and services, but also within our own internal processes that are very exciting. Within market intelligence, we introduced new advanced analytics solutions and GenAI functionality through Cap IQ Pro, which allows users to build predictive models, automate workflows, and better identify patterns and data more quickly. Within Commodity Insights, we enabled cloud delivery of AI-ready data on clean-energy technology. This is a great example of our efforts to make sure that the investments we've made to prepare datasets for ingestion in AI models directly translate into benefits for our customers and economics for our business. Also in Commodity Insights, we introduced our AI-powered chatbot called ChatAI to improve the user experience, answer customer questions in real-time and help users more quickly discover the valuable insights in our Platts Connect platform. Within mobility, we're leveraging GenAI and animation automation to embed the CARFAX, CAR FOX directly within the vehicle history reports that customers use. Soon, the animated Fox will appear on additional products, including car care user dashboards and our listings products, driving deeper customer engagement and enhancing brand affinity. Lastly, we continue to invest in our people so they can take full advantage of these incredible technologies as they emerge. Through our recently launched Spark AI Academy, our employees received meaningful training on prompt engineering and other insights into how they can best leverage AI in their own daily work. Not only does this make our employees more productive, but it allows us to cross-pollinate new use cases across the organization. It's been inspiring to see some of these early use cases emerge in code development, document analysis, record-keeping, and process improvement and the way people are sharing their new skills across S&P Global. We're confident that AI will be a strong influence to improve efficiency, productivity, the quality of life for years to come and that over time, you will see these improvements in our growth and profitability. Turning to our financial results. With our consistent focus on innovation and execution. We're pleased with the exceptional financial results across the enterprise this quarter. By serving our customers effectively and efficiently, we delivered exceptional growth and profitability in the third quarter. Now let me turn to Chris Craig, our Interim CFO, to review the financial results. Chris, over to you.\nChris Craig: Thank you, Doug. We delivered strong performance in the third quarter of 2024 as revenue growth accelerated across three of five divisions and we achieved solid margin expansion for the company. Revenue grew by 16% year-over-year to a second consecutive quarterly record of $3.6 billion in the third quarter as we continue to see strength across our market-driven businesses. As Doug noted earlier, we're seeing variation in the relative strength of different end-markets this year. We are benefiting significantly from the strength in debt and equity markets, while some softness in the financial services sector is tempering growth in pockets of the business. The year-to-date outperformance of the market-driven businesses is also leading to elevated incentive compensation across the company. This is a great problem to have and will impact all of our divisions to varying degrees, which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21% year-over-year to $3.89. This was driven by a combination of our strong revenue growth, margin expansion of 180 basis points and a 2% reduction in fully diluted share count. Turning to expense growth, we saw total adjusted expenses increase by 12%. As I mentioned earlier, incentive compensation and commissions have been significant drivers to our expense growth this year. This was true in the third quarter and we expect it to be even more pronounced in the fourth quarter. Overall, while incentives are driving expense growth across our divisions and the enterprise, it is also a critical component of our strategy to align employee performance with our growth and profitability. The year-over-year variance in these expenses is particularly pronounced in ratings and indices, where we are seeing the largest increase in performance-based incentives. It is important to note, however, that our consolidated results impact incentive compensation in every division. We've also seen an increase in cloud costs throughout the year as we moved many products to the cloud and have exited 15 data centerssince the IHS Markit merger closed. This increase is reflected in the core and investment growth category, along with our strategic investments and the increase in certain operating expenses that come naturally as the business continues to grow. We also saw increased expense associated with traditional compensation outside of incentives and commissions, reflecting the usual course of hiring and the annual merit increases across the company. While important to remain transparent about the drivers of expense growth, it is just as important to reinforce the fact that the majority of these increased expenses come as a result of strong growth and fantastic financial results to date. Now turning to strategic investment areas where we continue to deliver on our initiatives supporting growth across various parts of the business. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 15% to $90 million in the quarter. Growth was driven primarily by strong demand for Commodity Insights Energy transition subscription offerings. In Private Market Solutions, revenue increased by 22% to $134 million. Growth was driven primarily by increased traction of our product offerings in the private market services of S&P Global Ratings. For revenue synergies, we exited the third quarter with an annualized run-rate of $249 million. During the quarter, we recognized $72 million in revenue synergies, which came from a mix of cross-sell activity and revenue generated from new products. Turning to our divisions. Market Intelligence revenue increased 6% in the third quarter, desktop grew 8% or 1% when excluding the impact from the Visible Alpha acquisition. We continue to see demand for our core products in desktop, but we also face headwinds in the financial services end market. The elevated cancellations that we discussed in prior quarters continue to impact the organic desktop growth rate and we expect that impact to continue through at least the end of the year. Data and advisory solutions grew 5%, driven by strong demand for high-growth products such as alternative data from our market data valuations and analytics product suite. Enterprise solutions grew 5% or 11% when excluding the impact of the Fincentric divestiture. Growth was driven by strong levels of primary loan restructuring and amendment activity and several large multi-year software renewals. Credit and Risk Solutions grew 4%, lapping a difficult comparison from the prior year. Growth was driven by solid subscription performance for Ratings Express across North America, along with new use cases emerging from content externalization and digitization. Adjusted expenses increased 8% year-over-year due primarily to the growth drivers around compensation, commissions, and strategic investments that I previously discussed. Operating profit increased 2% and operating margin decreased 130 basis points to 32%. Importantly, Market Intelligence margins would have expanded year-over-year were it not for incentives and commission accruals related to the company's overall overperformance particularly driven by stellar results in our ratings and indices divisions. Trailing 12-month margins expanded 60 basis points to 32.9%. Now turning to ratings, where we saw revenue growth accelerate to 36%, materially exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew by 83% in the third quarter, driven by strong activity, particularly in investment-grade and high-yield bonds during what has historically been a seasonally quiet summer period. Non-transaction revenue increased 4%. As we highlighted in the third quarter of last year, there was a one-time $19 million benefit from a cumulative catch-up related to commercial paper in 2023. Excluding the impact of that item last year, growth in non-transaction revenue would have been 8% year-over-year as a result of strong annual fee revenue and an increase in new rating mandates. Adjusted expenses increased 20%, primarily due to increased incentive compensation. This resulted in a 48% increase in operating profit and a 510 basis-point increase in operating margin to 61.7%. For the trailing 12 months, ratings margin expanded 650 basis points to 61.9%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 9%, driven by strong performance across the division, including double-digit growth from two of four business lines. Price assessments in Energy and Resources, Data and Insights each grew 11%, driven by strength in our crude and refined product offerings. In addition, both business lines benefited from favorable commercial conditions across various regions, most notably Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Advisory and transaction services revenue grew by 6% or 5% when excluding the impact from the World Hydrogen Leaders acquisition. This was primarily driven by strong trading volumes across key sectors in global trading services. Upstream data and Insights revenue grew by 4%, driven by strong demand for subscription-based software and analytics products as well as continued improvement in retention rates. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 8% and operating margin contracted by 60 basis points to 47.8%. Similar to Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights margins would have expanded were it not for incentives and commission accruals related to the enterprise's overperformance. Trailing 12-month margin increased by 50 basis points to 46.7%. Now turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 9% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in two of three business lines. Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong subscription growth across CARFAX offerings. Manufacturing revenue growth accelerated to 2%, driven by a strong quarter of subscription sales. As expected, we continue to see lower transaction revenue related to our recall business, which can fluctuate based on the level of recall activity in any given period. Financials and other increased 12% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and increased market penetration. Adjusted expenses increased 9%. This resulted in operating profit increasing by 8% for the quarter and an operating margin of 42.2%, which is unchanged compared to the prior year period. Trailing 12-month margin contracted by 20 basis points to 38.8%. Now turning to S&P Dow Jones indices. Revenue increased 18%, primarily driven by strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM. Asset-linked fees were up 22%, driven by market appreciation and inflows. For the third quarter, our global ETF AUM exceeded $4 trillion, while we acquired a substantial portion of US ETF equity flows. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 16%, primarily driven by strong volumes across our equity complex products. Data and customs subscriptions increased 5% year over year. The commercial initiatives we have previously discussed are beginning to benefit this business line as ACV in the largest product group increased mid-teens in the third quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased incentive compensation. Indices operating profit increased 19% and operating margin expanded by 80 basis points to 70.2%. On a trailing 12-month basis, Indices operating margin expanded by 200 basis points to 70%. As an enterprise, we delivered an exceptional quarter with robust growth while managing expenses prudently. Our diverse product suite is contributing to our strong results and reinforcing the benefits we realized from having these incredible global brands together. I'm pleased with our team's strong execution during this period and look forward to finishing the year on a high note. And with that, I will now turn the call to Martina to provide an update on our leadership transition. Martina?\nMartina Cheung: Thank you, Chris. Over the 14 years that I've been at S&P Global and under Doug's leadership, I've come to appreciate how this company has gone from strength to strength. That development and our consistent track record of strong performance has been built on trusted brands, exceptional talent, and a disciplined focus on exceeding our clients' expectations. Over the last few months, I've been deeply engaged with our Board of Directors and every internal and external stakeholder group to make sure we continue that legacy of growth and customer delight. Doug and I have met jointly with many of our largest customers to hear directly from them, how best we can position S&P Global to meet their needs in the coming years. I've also met with strategic partners, shareholders, regulators and vendors to make sure that we as a leadership team have a clear understanding of the varying needs of each group, so we can prioritize our investment in both time and capital in the most effective ways. I've spent a significant amount of time with our internal product, commercial, and analytical teams as well. While I've had broad experience in my career, including the privilege of leading two of our largest divisions, it's vital to me that I have a current and timely view of our products, our customer pain points, our innovation pipeline, our operations and the environment in which we're currently operating. I've met with leaders across the organization to gain insights into all of these key areas and this will remain an important part of how our leadership team maintains a customer-centric, innovative, and informed strategy going forward. I've also spent time hearing directly from our people on the topics that matter most to them. I've hosted nearly 40 town hall meetings, roundtable discussions, and deep-dive sessions across the organization to discuss everything from culture to organizational design and to make sure that our leadership is accessible and transparent with our people around the world. These experiences have made it crystal-clear to me how incredible this organization is. Our core products are strong, our people are remarkable. There's a real sense of pride, excitement, and optimism as we look to expand our vision of what we can accomplish in the coming years. Now as many of you saw last week, we announced several leadership changes to ensure we have the right team in place to deliver this expanded vision. We have a strong culture of developing leaders at S&P Global, and it's a testament to that culture that six of the seven leaders on this slide who are taking on new roles are internal promotions. As we announced last week, we are thrilled to welcome Eric Aboaf as our new CFO, and we expect him to join in February of 2025. Eric brings a wealth of experience as a CFO in the financial services sector and a very strong track record of exactly the type of disciplined execution that we hope to continue here at S&P Global. We also announced last week that we are making some changes in our Division Leadership. Effective November 1, Saugata Saha will become the President of our Market Intelligence Division, having previously led Commodity Insights. Yann Le Pallec will become the President of S&P Global Ratings, having most recently served as the Global Head of Rating Services. We will have Co-Presidents of Commodity Insights; Mark Eramo, who is our current Head of the Fuels, Chemicals and Resource Solutions Business; and Dave Ernsberger, who currently leads the Market Reporting and Trading Solutions Business. S&P Global Mobility will continue under the leadership of Edouard Tavernier and S&P Dow Jones indices will continue to be led by Dan Draper. In addition to our division leadership, I also wanted to highlight two horizontal functions that we've introduced. First, in addition to his role as President of Market Intelligence, Saugata Saha will also serve as our Chief Enterprise Data Officer. In that role, Saugata will lead enterprise-wide efforts to expand and connect S&P Global's vast data estate, harnessing the full potential of the company's data capabilities for our customers. Lastly, Sally Moore will be assuming the newly created role of Chief Client Officer. Given the immense breadth of the data products and services that S&P Global brings to the market, we often meet with customers who are buying several products from various divisions. As current Head of Strategy, M&A, and Partnerships, Sally has a deep understanding of our capabilities and strong relationships across the industry. In her new role, she will lead our commercial initiatives across the company to make sure that we are bringing the full power of S&P Global to our largest clients and she will establish an enterprise-wide capability to drive strategic account management at scale. With our executive leadership team in place, we are in a strong position to execute against well-defined strategic initiatives, benchmarks, private markets, sustainability and energy transition, enterprise data and Generative AI were all topics that we discussed at our Investor Day in 2022, and we plan to continue our strategic focus and investments in these areas. Back in July, we established teams of senior leaders from across the organization to do deep reviews in the key strategic areas that we believe are aligned to our core competencies, competitive advantages, and market opportunities. And it was encouraging to see the work these teams delivered as we believe each of these areas remains an attractive investment and we identified important opportunities to drive incremental growth beyond what we had previously considered. We will have more to say about the strategic initiatives over time, but I wanted to assure you all that we continue to see very strong potential in each of these areas. We remain committed to transparency and accountability around the investments we are making and the impact we're seeing on our performance as a result. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2024, our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 3.2%, US inflation of 2.9% and an average price for Brent crude of $81 per barrel. These are all roughly in line with our previous expectations. While there is some variation in market expectations around the pace of rate cuts through the end of the year, our base-case assumption is that we see at least one more rate cut this year in the US and while encouraging for various parts of our business going forward, we would not expect the number of rate cuts in the remainder of 2024 to drive much variation in our financial results for 2024. Given stability in our macroeconomic outlook and the significant outperformance since we last provided guidance, we are increasing our outlook for 2024. We are increasing our Billed Issuance forecast for 2024 by 25 percentage points. Given the outperformance in Q3 and our expectation that Q4 will likely see positive growth in Billed Issuance, we are now expecting total Billed Issuance to increase approximately 50% in 2024. These factors combined with the exceptional results year-to-date inform our decision to substantially increase our full-year financial guidance for the company once again. This slide illustrates our current guidance for GAAP results. We are once again raising our enterprise outlook for the full year on all headline metrics, given the strength of the third quarter and our improved outlook for the fourth quarter. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, adjusted margin expansion of 200 basis points to 250 basis points and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $15.10 to $15.30, representing a $0.70 to $0.75 increase from our prior guidance. Additional details on our consolidated financial guidance can be found in our press release, but I also wanted to note we have increased our guidance for adjusted free cash flow to approximately $5.2 billion, up $500 million from our prior guidance. As I'll discuss in a moment, we continue to balance near-term profitability with the need to invest for future growth and we continue to prioritize long-term profitable growth for the company as a whole. The strength of our market-driven businesses so far in 2024 provides us with an opportunity to invest in our products, our people, and our brands across divisions while still delivering significant outperformance at the enterprise level, and that will be reflected in our outlook today. Specifically, as Chris discussed earlier, the strong outperformance thus far this year will increase incentive compensation across the company in 2024 and will also provide capital to pull forward some planned future investment in technology into this year. This is a good thing. And while it has the combined impact of tempering potential margin expansion in some divisions in 2024, we firmly believe that investing in our products and people will enhance our ability to deliver stronger enterprise financial results over the long term. Moving to our division outlook. Given the continued headwinds that Doug mentioned facing our financial services customers, we are tightening the range for Market Intelligence revenue growth in 2024. We now expect growth in the range of 6% to 6.5%. Following the very strong third quarter and the improved outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising the guidance range for ratings revenue growth by 12 percentage points and now expect revenue in the range of 26% to 28% for the full year. While this represents an even more significant increase from the initial guidance we provided back in February, we remind investors that our guidance reflects our expectations based on the best information and estimates available at the time. And ratings remains largely a market-driven business that is difficult to predict in the near term. The issuance environment in 2024 has progressed well beyond what we expected at the beginning of the year and we have adjusted our guidance as we saw the market dynamics evolving throughout the year. We are pleased that our decisions to preserve and invest in capacity in prior years have allowed us to meet the elevated demand in 2024, and we look forward to finishing the year strong. In Commodity Insights, we are tightening the range and raising the low-end to reflect the strength we've seen throughout the year. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 9% to 9.5%. In mobility, we are tightening the range as well, and we now expect revenue in the range of 8% to 8.5%. Lastly, in Indices, the continued strength in AUM, exchange-traded derivatives and subscription ACV led to an improved outlook for the year. We are raising our guidance by 3 percentage points to a new range of 13% to 15%. Turning to division margins; in Market Intelligence, we now expect margins in the range of 32.5% to 33%, tightening and slightly lowering our prior range due to the updated revenue outlook and the elevated expenses associated with compensation that were discussed earlier. In Ratings, we now expect higher revenue to improve margins as well and now expect full-year margins in the range of 61% to 62%. In Commodity Insights, we are tightening the guidance to a range of 46.5% to 47%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, planned strategic investments and the impact of compensation expenses. In mobility, we are tightening the guidance to a range of 38.5% to 39%, reflecting the performance year-to-date and the continued investments to drive future growth. In Indices, we expect higher-growth to drive improved margins, somewhat offset by incentive compensation and strategic investments. We now expect margins in the range of 69.5% to 70.5%. As we continue to prioritize enterprise growth and identify areas for incremental investment in both people and products, we are thrilled to be able to make those incremental investments while still passing on much of the revenue upside from this year to the margins. Compared to the initial guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, we now expect 5 to 6 percentage points more revenue growth, 100 basis points to 150 basis points of further margin expansion, and nearly 10% higher adjusted EPS. We believe that this enterprise mindset and focus on solving for the collective whole will drive strong profitable growth and long-term shareholder value for years to come. With that, we will turn the call back to Mark for your questions.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Martina. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to drill down further on the MI segment, execution there has been a bit choppy. And so just as we think about with the new leadership changes and some of the portfolio rationalization that we have seen, is there further opportunity for more rationalization there or how do we get that business on a more steady execution? Thanks.\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Ashish, it's Martina here. Thank you very much for the question. Well, in Market Intelligence, as we said during the prepared remarks, we've certainly seen a little bit of an uptick there in cancellations in some of our smaller customers. We talked about some pricing pressure, tightening of budgets and some longer sales cycles. I think an important point here is that this is really around the end markets, Ashish, and some of the headwinds that we're seeing with those end markets. Now, as we move forward, we're continuing to drive innovation in our products within market intelligence, we're very focused on touch points with our customers and making sure we're meeting their needs. And maybe I would say while these are some cyclical headwinds and it's a little bit difficult to call where a trough might be here, but we're very confident that the value we're creating for the customers will be evident as we move through a cycle recover -- cyclical recovery there as well. And perhaps to answer your question on the portfolio optimization piece of it, yes, we've announced two divestitures this year, but this is part of our ongoing model around portfolio optimization. We are always very disciplined at examining businesses and product lines across the company to make sure they're a fit for our strategy and that we are the right owners of those businesses. And so that's something that we'll continue to do in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Martina, I wanted to ask you a bit of a broad question about where you see as the biggest areas of opportunity for investment in your mind. Just any -- I imagine AI is probably up there, but just any others you've identified where you feel like the opportunity is really there for the company? Thanks.\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Toni. Thanks for the question. As we said in the opening remarks, we've spent a lot of time in the last several months collectively as a team, myself and Doug meeting with customers and quite frankly, this is a phenomenal business and one that we as a new leadership team will look to make even better. I highlighted five secular trends in the presentation and each of these five we had discussed during the Investor Day in 2022. And I'll tell you the thing that got me most excited is not only -- was the work that we did in the last few months, it's a reaffirmation of the strategy that we have, but we've also identified other areas within those five where we think we've got good opportunities for maybe new incremental growth. So those would be the things I would highlight there and a lot of excitement with the new leadership team to go after us.\nMark Grant: Thanks, Toni.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Martina, I was just wondering with all the, I guess, work you've done leading up to taking over here, I think you ended with the question -- the comment on solving for the collective whole. And it feels like with five big businesses, there's a whole lot going on. So I was just curious if the comments you made around simplification in MI, if you have any thoughts on the broader company and portfolio in terms of where it stands today?\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Manav. Thanks so much for the question. Look, you've seen us be very disciplined around capital management over the past several years and very specifically under Doug as CEO. And we're going to remain committed to capital management and returns to our shareholders. So, I'll start by saying that. With that, we will continue to look at whether it's M&A, whether it's portfolio management with the same level of discipline that we always do. And as I said in the last question, we're going to test constantly, are we the right owners for businesses are we investing the right amount or should we be reprioritizing and redirecting investments. And those are all things that we'll do as new leadership team going forward.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Manav.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to hit on the synergy topic. I mean, good to see the run-rate increasing there. And just wondering in the context of maybe some of the choppiness that we're seeing in Market Intelligence and the outperformance in some of the other segments, are we seeing any sort of change in geography in terms of where the synergies are impacting by division? Thanks.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Scott. This is Doug. When we look at the synergy performance of the company, we're very pleased. Across the board, we're ahead of what we had as our expectations. We see in particular cross-sell as one of the areas that has done incredibly well. And when I talk about cross-sell, I talk about cross-sell intra-division. We're also very excited about the new role that Sally Moore is going to have, which is going to bring up a lot more opportunity across divisions for cross-sell. And then within the divisions on new products, new services, we've been quite successful getting things out. And for example, we've had 23 new products this year so far from Market Intelligence. Those products are all doing well and we continue to be on track to deliver our synergies.\nMark Grant: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you. So I wanted to ask about ratings. I think, Doug, in your comments, you mentioned some pull-forward from 2025 and even 2026 this year. It's certainly been a very strong year for issuance. And I'm curious if you have any early thoughts around 2025? And I know a few years ago, you talked about 6% to 9% was the long-term growth rate or the 25% growth rate. Do you think that is achievable and what are some of the factors to consider?\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Faiza. This is Martina. Thanks so much for the question. Yes, we have seen certainly higher levels of issuance than we anticipated earlier in the year. And this is the third time, I believe that we've raised guidance for ratings. The business itself when it comes to refinancing and the levels that we've seen for pull-forward et cetera, if we look at 2025 maturities and where they stand right now, how much is pulled forward into 2024. It's not dramatically different from what we would have seen in the last couple of years. And so when we say, as we usually do in our calls that there is a healthy maturity wall anywhere from $2 trillion to $2.8 trillion each year over the next five years, that is still very much the case for us. Now we always also say that we can't predict with exact precision the actual timing of refinancing and so much of that this year for example has been related to spreads. So to the extent that we see certain things continuing to move ahead that could impact more pull-forward or less pull-forward. Moreover, I would say, for us, the biggest correlation in issuance overall is actually GDP growth. And so this is something that we would pay very close attention to over the next several years as we think about the ratings business and any of the other businesses that are impacted by GDP growth. And then finally, to your point on the 6% to 9% Investor Day, this was really a target from 2023 to 2025, 2026, so a multiyear target. And I would say for an -- for the enterprise as a whole, we are very much on track for reaching that target and with ratings.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Faiza.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the competition in Market Intelligence. It sounded like that the pricing competition picked up a little bit this quarter. Wondering if you could just elaborate on that. And maybe secondly, specifically within Market Intelligence, Martina, if you're thinking about maybe incremental areas of investment that are needed to reach the 7% to 9% revenue growth target? Thank you.\nDoug Peterson: Great. Thanks, David. Let me start. As we've mentioned, there's been headwinds on this area for many, many quarters. This isn't something new for us. We saw this when the investment banks and both the buy-side and the sell-side were pulling back when inflation had gone up quite dramatically. Interest rates were spiking. There were a lot of trends which had slowed down the environment. We'd seen a slowdown of the sales cycle. So as opposed to this necessarily being pricing, we have seen some price sensitivity. This is just a residual impact of all of the changes and the expense management that we saw in the area. We have seen something that we discussed, we call vendor consolidation that historically has been very beneficial to us. We have the kind of datasets in a way that many organizations when we start talking with them, they don't realize how many things we have. It gives us an opportunity to bring more and more capabilities when we have these discussions. So yes, we have seen some consolidation. We've seen some sales cycle slowdown. We've seen some pricing pressure overall, but it is an incredibly strong business. The synergies have been coming along and the integration has gone incredibly well. Martina, over to you.\nMartina Cheung: Yes, thanks, Doug, and thanks for the question. I would say that as it relates to Market Intelligence growth rates going forward. As Doug commented and we've discussed in the earlier remarks as well, this is really a story of end-markets. And we're not -- we're never going to be the ones to call a trough, but we very firmly believe that with the increased touch points, the innovation that we've seen in the business, as we come through the recovery, we'll see the value come back into some of the areas that have been a little challenged with the end-market challenges that we've seen so far. Thanks for the question.\nMark Grant: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.\nCraig Huber: Thank you. Doug, I just want to say I thought you've done a great job running the company here, I guess, for the last 11 years. I wish all at best going forward here. You're a tough act for Martina to follow here. But Martina, my question to you is, as you think about what you -- what your plans here for the company here, what do you plan on potentially doing different here going forward? Of course, we don't want to screw up anything here, it's the number one thing. But what are your plans to potentially do anything different here to enhance shareholder value? Thank you.\nMartina Cheung: Thanks for the question, Craig, and I completely agree with you that Doug is a very hard act to follow. I can tell you, we are focused really here on this wonderful company, great as it is, and how much better we can make it. And the new leadership team as it's been announced does have some different functions than what we had before and those are some areas where we plan to connect the dots a bit more across the divisions through the Chief Commercial Officer and to have really a scaled capability for strategic accounts and through our enterprise data office, we're looking at ways in which we can connect our data together so that it provides us with really interesting and easier pathways to growth across the organization. As you know, we have one of the deepest and richest data estates in the business and we're very excited about the potential for that. Thanks for the question.\nMark Grant: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nAlex Hess: Yes. Hi, this is Alex Hess on for Andrew. On the Indices business, I'm going to ask about the indices business. Can you walk through some of what gives you conviction in the price actions flowing through the year? I know you guys touched on an ACV number and how we should maybe think about the relative strength that you're calling out in that index data and custom piece versus a challenging end-market for financial services versus one of your peers calling out some softness in their ETF business. So it would be helpful maybe get your thoughts on the landscape in the index segment.\nChris Craig: Sure. Hi, Alex. This is Chris. Thank you for your question. So first, we are solving for long-term customer relationship and growth at indices. We will see some acceleration in the data and custom in line with what we expected next quarter. We want to take the necessary steps in time to make sure we preserve long-term relationships rather than solve them for short-term economics with our pricing. That said, data and customs did increase 5% year-over-year. The commercial initiatives we previously discussed earlier in the year are really starting to pick up now. ACV in the largest group, the end of day data revenue, we see that going to mid-teens this quarter and we really expect to see some ACV acceleration later on in the year.\nMark Grant: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into Market Intelligence. Can you elaborate on what you would need to see with respect to external market conditions for growth performance to improve? And what the low watermark for MI growth should be, including when you would expect to see growth to bottom out?\nMartina Cheung: Hey, George, it's Martina. Thanks for the question. Well, the low watermark in my parlance, I mentioned trough in response to one of the earlier questions that we're not going to be the one to call a trough, but we have very good conviction here, George, that with the innovation that's going into the core products, with the increased touch points that we have with the customers that as we emerge from this cycle, we'll see the recovery reflected in our financials as well as with our customers. And look, it's too early to tell about and it could differ by discrete sector within financial services, but we are hearing a little bit of green shoots here and there, continued pressure in other places. I would say we will watch this very, very carefully, but we feel good that we have the products in place, the investments in new products that Doug mentioned, which we're quite excited about and continue to really engage as closely as possible with our customers. Thanks for the question.\nMark Grant: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Can you can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in Commodity Insights and your outlook here going forward? I mean, I think this year you're punching nicely above your kind of medium-term Investor Day targets. I know the energy market backdrop is pretty good, but I think things like energy transition are still early. So, I think as you look going forward, do you guys think some of the cyclicality is going to get worse or -- and on the secular side, do you think we're just at the beginning here at maybe some prolonged like upside. So maybe the cyclical versus secular is really the heart of the question. Thanks.\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Alex, it's Martina. Thanks so much for the question. Well, we're quite excited as we have been for several years now about the Commodity Insights business and the performance there. And one of the things that excites us as we go forward is the breadth and if you like, sort of embedded diversification across the various different commodity pieces, whether it's oil and gas, power and some of the other areas we've been investing in. In particular, we see in addition to great performance for the larger core product areas, we've also seen really nice performance in some of the newer investment areas. So, for example, we're seeing rapid growth around some of our energy transition products. In particular, we had our new clean-energy tech product that's been launched that's been very well received in the market and lots of other stuff that the teams are doing there, whether it's voluntary carbon markets, low-carbon assessments, etc. So, we think that we're making the right investments here in the areas that will continue to grow going forward and sustaining very good positions and discipline around the core products in the business and overall have, we think a good story going forward here. Thanks for the question.\nMark Grant: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Ryan here on for Jeff. Just on the Private Market Solutions, it sounds like the revenues there were up 22% in 3Q and you're seeing some strength from the buzz going on in private credit going on at the moment. I was just curious how you think your products are positioned to succeed and win share as the market heats up and gets more competitive going forward? Thank you.\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Ryan, it's Martina here. Thanks for the question. Well, private markets is something that we've been investing in and growing very fast in over the last several years. And it impacts us across the portfolio. We have phenomenal products in Market Intelligence, for example high-level and Wall Street Office and those two products have come up in some of the conversations that Doug and I have been having as we've been doing our transition meetings with senior clients. We also, as you know, have been making great strides in the ratings division with our private markets ratings and assessments as well as seeing some really interesting opportunities in the index business also. So overall, this is a transversal opportunity for us. We're excited about it. We're going to continue to invest and prioritize within this area because there are so many ways in which we can play in this market and we're going to be very disciplined and thoughtful about prioritizing within the private market opportunity to put the money where we can get the best return, deliver the best value for our customers and overall returns for our shareholders. But it's a good story there for us. Thanks very much, Ryan.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Ryan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Just can you address the mobility revenue guidance? It's the second quarter in a row, you've trimmed the high end and there's multiple positive call-outs for vitality and subscription growth looks good. Is it still recall activity headwinds or just any other call-outs on mobility guidance? Thank you.\nChris Craig: Hey, Jeff, thanks for the question. This is Chris again. So first, mobility sort of core subscription growth really did terrific this quarter, coming in at a little over double-digits -- low-double-digits. Even with the CDK outage, still we see strong growth in the subscription business. So yes, the challenge continues to be recall, but coming into next year, that will really have an easy lap when we look at 2025, mostly because of the recall. So that does continue to be the headwind in that market.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJason Haas: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Curious if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of the pace of AI adoption among your customers. What if anything do you see holding them back from further adoption of some of the AI products that you're rolling out? Is it budgetary? Is it about data accuracy? And then I don't know if it's relevant or not, but if you can talk about your own learnings as you roll out AI and maybe what others can learn from that? Thank you.\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Jason, it's Martina. Thanks for the question. I think it goes without saying, but I suppose maybe I'll make the point anyway, a large language model is only as good as the quality and quantity of data that it's trained on and we have lots of high-quality data. And so we feel really good about how we are integrating generative AI into our products. I would say probably two areas to think about. So, one is how do we take existing products and make them better and the second is the extent to which we see opportunities to create maybe new versions of products, different cuts of data using generative AI. And we have tremendous momentum, I would say. You've seen a lot of that on one of the slides, for example, in our presentation that Doug highlighted. And to your point, we have a lot of our customers because we've had Kensho since 2018 and Kensho has been riding the wave of machine learning, natural language processing, and then all the way into GenAI. And between that and just this incredible breadth and depth of data that we have, we have a lot of our clients actually saying, hey, could you come in and talk to us about how you're thinking about using your data, what can we learn from that? And those have been some really interesting and fruitful conversations and a lot of engagement from our customers on AI-ready data as well. So those are just some examples. Internally, we -- as Doug said, we're making really, really incredible progress on the rollout of Spark Assist, both the training on GenAI as well as the use of Spark Assist as a tool internally. And I can say that we are all very excited about the uptick and adoption across our own employees and the types of use cases that we're seeing and we're able to share those earnings with our clients to make the conversations even more interesting. And I would say that the Spark Assist approach that we have taken, we have not necessarily seen many other organizations doing the same thing. So, we have a lot to share in terms of our learnings with our customers and great dialog. Thanks for the question.\nMark Grant: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Could you please give us more color on your sustainability products? What is the outlook there? And how should we think about the new product launches? Thanks.\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Owen, it's Martina, and thanks so much for the question. Well, this is an area that we announced a change in when we did our leadership announcement last week. So the plan forward here is to move the Sustainable One business and combine it with the energy transition products and assets within Commodity Insights. And that merged group will essentially still function as a horizontal from within Commodity Insights. Now this is very exciting for us. As I said earlier, the Commodity Insights division has some of the most unique and proprietary ways to think about and measure energy transition. It's incredibly helpful, for example, for our financial services customers as they're thinking about whether or not they're financing some of these new technologies, what their financed emissions are et cetera. And so this pulling together of these capabilities allows us to create some really unique and forward-looking ways in which we can help our clients as they're navigating the transition. And I think as importantly, will allow us to bring those really high-value commodity Insights products to multiple different sectors outside of the commodity sector. So we're quite excited about it. We'll talk more about it next year, and well, thanks for the question.\nMark Grant: Thanks, Owen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\nRussell Quelch: Hi, thanks for having me on. I wanted to go back to Market Intelligence, please, specifically the desktop business. Doug, you mentioned cyclical headwinds to sales and pricing has been a narrative for many quarters now. I wondered, isn't this more a function of lack of structural growth in financial service headcount and sort of high competition in this area that permanently restricts growth opportunities in terms of TAM and pricing. I also wondered how S&P thinks it could win market share in desktops and if it can give or if you can give us a flavor perhaps of what customer sets you're targeting, what asset classes you're targeting, what geographies you're targeting -- sorry, that would be very helpful.\nMartina Cheung: Hi, Russell, it's Martina here. Thanks so much for the question. Well, as we mentioned earlier, we do think this is an end-market consideration and we -- here's a point that I would make on this. Structural is something that can play to our strengths as much as anything else. And a good example of that is the growth in sponsor business, for example, with private credit, and that's an area where you'll see us actually being able to pick up additional business as opposed to, let's say, other parts of the financial services vertical that are a bit more constrained right now. But I also mentioned that we are seeing some green shoots in some of the additional area in the additional sectors, some good green shoots in some banking areas, for example, with some of our banking clients. All that being said, we have such an incredible breadth of offerings within Market Intelligence. And when you think about Visible Alpha, which has performed really well this year on top of the desktop growth, these are all areas where we think we can continue to engage our clients at the highest levels. We'd also expect for our strategic accounts, Sally Moore's new function as the Chief Client Officer to be able to really connect the dots more effectively across divisions and create higher levels of long-term value with our customers. So thanks for the question.\nMark Grant: Thank you, Russell.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our final question from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Following up on the creation of the Chief Client Officer role, you've talked about connecting the dots at the client level. Maybe can you provide a bit more color in the sense of the challenge that's being addressed? Is the idea to have a more integrated approach to sales here or customer service, how should we think about that?\nMartina Cheung: Hey, Surinder, thanks very much for the question. So yes, we are -- it is in fact some of the things that you mentioned in your question around a bit more consistency in how we do things. The connecting of the dots is an important point because our sales teams today are quite independent as we go across the entire book of business. And the results that we can have is that we'll have customers who buy more products or buy products from more than one division, but maybe don't even know the full breadth and depth of the products that we actually have and probably one of the most common things that Doug and I have heard as we've been going out with senior clients over the last several months is, I didn't know you did that. So a good first point here for Sally and his team will be making sure that our customers understand the full breadth and depth of everything that we do. She'll also be looking to bring some consistency around the overall go-to-market practices that we have and really bolstering the strategic relationships that we have with our clients going forward. Thanks for the question.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, Surinder. And I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and especially your great questions. Over the past 11 years, I've had the honor of leading S&P Global through significant transformation and we've always strived to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders and our customers. This is my 44th Earnings call and I've had hundreds of meetings with analysts and investors, and I've always appreciated the discussion, and the dialogue and the tough questions that you've asked. I've always learned. I want to thank our 40,000 people at the company. They are the heart, the soul and the brain of S&P Global and the reason for our success. And I know they're going to continue to deliver growth and innovation in the years ahead. I want to thank Martina and congratulate her on her new role. I'm confident that she's going to be a great CEO and will be a fabulous addition to the company with the full support of our people and a great knowledge and commitment to our customers, the communities, and our shareholders. I'm very excited about what lies ahead and that we have a world-class Board, a talented management team and we're very well-positioned for the future. I can't thank you all enough. This has been the best run I've ever had.\nMartina Cheung: Thank you so much, Doug, for those heartfelt words and for your remarkable leadership that has transformed S&P Global. You grew our market cap from $16 billion to $165 billion, while fundamentally strengthening our capabilities through the IHS Markit acquisition. But beyond these impressive numbers, you've led with extraordinary empathy and wisdom, creating a legacy that I'm deeply honored to follow upon. So thank you to everyone who joined today's call. I look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&P Global's website for one year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month. On behalf of S&P Global, we thank you for participating and wish you a good day.",

            "name": "Chris Craig",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. We delivered strong performance in the third quarter of 2024 as revenue growth accelerated across three of five divisions and we achieved solid margin expansion for the company. Revenue grew by 16% year-over-year to a second consecutive quarterly record of $3.6 billion in the third quarter as we continue to see strength across our market-driven businesses. As Doug noted earlier, we're seeing variation in the relative strength of different end-markets this year. We are benefiting significantly from the strength in debt and equity markets, while some softness in the financial services sector is tempering growth in pockets of the business. The year-to-date outperformance of the market-driven businesses is also leading to elevated incentive compensation across the company. This is a great problem to have and will impact all of our divisions to varying degrees, which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21% year-over-year to $3.89. This was driven by a combination of our strong revenue growth, margin expansion of 180 basis points and a 2% reduction in fully diluted share count. Turning to expense growth, we saw total adjusted expenses increase by 12%. As I mentioned earlier, incentive compensation and commissions have been significant drivers to our expense growth this year. This was true in the third quarter and we expect it to be even more pronounced in the fourth quarter. Overall, while incentives are driving expense growth across our divisions and the enterprise, it is also a critical component of our strategy to align employee performance with our growth and profitability. The year-over-year variance in these expenses is particularly pronounced in ratings and indices, where we are seeing the largest increase in performance-based incentives. It is important to note, however, that our consolidated results impact incentive compensation in every division. We've also seen an increase in cloud costs throughout the year as we moved many products to the cloud and have exited 15 data centerssince the IHS Markit merger closed. This increase is reflected in the core and investment growth category, along with our strategic investments and the increase in certain operating expenses that come naturally as the business continues to grow. We also saw increased expense associated with traditional compensation outside of incentives and commissions, reflecting the usual course of hiring and the annual merit increases across the company. While important to remain transparent about the drivers of expense growth, it is just as important to reinforce the fact that the majority of these increased expenses come as a result of strong growth and fantastic financial results to date. Now turning to strategic investment areas where we continue to deliver on our initiatives supporting growth across various parts of the business. Sustainability and energy transition revenue grew 15% to $90 million in the quarter. Growth was driven primarily by strong demand for Commodity Insights Energy transition subscription offerings. In Private Market Solutions, revenue increased by 22% to $134 million. Growth was driven primarily by increased traction of our product offerings in the private market services of S&P Global Ratings. For revenue synergies, we exited the third quarter with an annualized run-rate of $249 million. During the quarter, we recognized $72 million in revenue synergies, which came from a mix of cross-sell activity and revenue generated from new products. Turning to our divisions. Market Intelligence revenue increased 6% in the third quarter, desktop grew 8% or 1% when excluding the impact from the Visible Alpha acquisition. We continue to see demand for our core products in desktop, but we also face headwinds in the financial services end market. The elevated cancellations that we discussed in prior quarters continue to impact the organic desktop growth rate and we expect that impact to continue through at least the end of the year. Data and advisory solutions grew 5%, driven by strong demand for high-growth products such as alternative data from our market data valuations and analytics product suite. Enterprise solutions grew 5% or 11% when excluding the impact of the Fincentric divestiture. Growth was driven by strong levels of primary loan restructuring and amendment activity and several large multi-year software renewals. Credit and Risk Solutions grew 4%, lapping a difficult comparison from the prior year. Growth was driven by solid subscription performance for Ratings Express across North America, along with new use cases emerging from content externalization and digitization. Adjusted expenses increased 8% year-over-year due primarily to the growth drivers around compensation, commissions, and strategic investments that I previously discussed. Operating profit increased 2% and operating margin decreased 130 basis points to 32%. Importantly, Market Intelligence margins would have expanded year-over-year were it not for incentives and commission accruals related to the company's overall overperformance particularly driven by stellar results in our ratings and indices divisions. Trailing 12-month margins expanded 60 basis points to 32.9%. Now turning to ratings, where we saw revenue growth accelerate to 36%, materially exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew by 83% in the third quarter, driven by strong activity, particularly in investment-grade and high-yield bonds during what has historically been a seasonally quiet summer period. Non-transaction revenue increased 4%. As we highlighted in the third quarter of last year, there was a one-time $19 million benefit from a cumulative catch-up related to commercial paper in 2023. Excluding the impact of that item last year, growth in non-transaction revenue would have been 8% year-over-year as a result of strong annual fee revenue and an increase in new rating mandates. Adjusted expenses increased 20%, primarily due to increased incentive compensation. This resulted in a 48% increase in operating profit and a 510 basis-point increase in operating margin to 61.7%. For the trailing 12 months, ratings margin expanded 650 basis points to 61.9%. And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 9%, driven by strong performance across the division, including double-digit growth from two of four business lines. Price assessments in Energy and Resources, Data and Insights each grew 11%, driven by strength in our crude and refined product offerings. In addition, both business lines benefited from favorable commercial conditions across various regions, most notably Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Advisory and transaction services revenue grew by 6% or 5% when excluding the impact from the World Hydrogen Leaders acquisition. This was primarily driven by strong trading volumes across key sectors in global trading services. Upstream data and Insights revenue grew by 4%, driven by strong demand for subscription-based software and analytics products as well as continued improvement in retention rates. Adjusted expenses increased 10%, operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 8% and operating margin contracted by 60 basis points to 47.8%. Similar to Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights margins would have expanded were it not for incentives and commission accruals related to the enterprise's overperformance. Trailing 12-month margin increased by 50 basis points to 46.7%. Now turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 9% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in two of three business lines. Dealer revenue increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strong subscription growth across CARFAX offerings. Manufacturing revenue growth accelerated to 2%, driven by a strong quarter of subscription sales. As expected, we continue to see lower transaction revenue related to our recall business, which can fluctuate based on the level of recall activity in any given period. Financials and other increased 12% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and increased market penetration. Adjusted expenses increased 9%. This resulted in operating profit increasing by 8% for the quarter and an operating margin of 42.2%, which is unchanged compared to the prior year period. Trailing 12-month margin contracted by 20 basis points to 38.8%. Now turning to S&P Dow Jones indices. Revenue increased 18%, primarily driven by strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM. Asset-linked fees were up 22%, driven by market appreciation and inflows. For the third quarter, our global ETF AUM exceeded $4 trillion, while we acquired a substantial portion of US ETF equity flows. Exchange-traded derivatives revenue grew 16%, primarily driven by strong volumes across our equity complex products. Data and customs subscriptions increased 5% year over year. The commercial initiatives we have previously discussed are beginning to benefit this business line as ACV in the largest product group increased mid-teens in the third quarter. Adjusted expenses increased 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased incentive compensation. Indices operating profit increased 19% and operating margin expanded by 80 basis points to 70.2%. On a trailing 12-month basis, Indices operating margin expanded by 200 basis points to 70%. As an enterprise, we delivered an exceptional quarter with robust growth while managing expenses prudently. Our diverse product suite is contributing to our strong results and reinforcing the benefits we realized from having these incredible global brands together. I'm pleased with our team's strong execution during this period and look forward to finishing the year on a high note. And with that, I will now turn the call to Martina to provide an update on our leadership transition. Martina? Sure. Hi, Alex. This is Chris. Thank you for your question. So first, we are solving for long-term customer relationship and growth at indices. We will see some acceleration in the data and custom in line with what we expected next quarter. We want to take the necessary steps in time to make sure we preserve long-term relationships rather than solve them for short-term economics with our pricing. That said, data and customs did increase 5% year-over-year. The commercial initiatives we previously discussed earlier in the year are really starting to pick up now. ACV in the largest group, the end of day data revenue, we see that going to mid-teens this quarter and we really expect to see some ACV acceleration later on in the year. Hey, Jeff, thanks for the question. This is Chris again. So first, mobility sort of core subscription growth really did terrific this quarter, coming in at a little over double-digits -- low-double-digits. Even with the CDK outage, still we see strong growth in the subscription business. So yes, the challenge continues to be recall, but coming into next year, that will really have an easy lap when we look at 2025, mostly because of the recall. So that does continue to be the headwind in that market."

            "name": "Martina Cheung",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Over the 14 years that I've been at S&P Global and under Doug's leadership, I've come to appreciate how this company has gone from strength to strength. That development and our consistent track record of strong performance has been built on trusted brands, exceptional talent, and a disciplined focus on exceeding our clients' expectations. Over the last few months, I've been deeply engaged with our Board of Directors and every internal and external stakeholder group to make sure we continue that legacy of growth and customer delight. Doug and I have met jointly with many of our largest customers to hear directly from them, how best we can position S&P Global to meet their needs in the coming years. I've also met with strategic partners, shareholders, regulators and vendors to make sure that we as a leadership team have a clear understanding of the varying needs of each group, so we can prioritize our investment in both time and capital in the most effective ways. I've spent a significant amount of time with our internal product, commercial, and analytical teams as well. While I've had broad experience in my career, including the privilege of leading two of our largest divisions, it's vital to me that I have a current and timely view of our products, our customer pain points, our innovation pipeline, our operations and the environment in which we're currently operating. I've met with leaders across the organization to gain insights into all of these key areas and this will remain an important part of how our leadership team maintains a customer-centric, innovative, and informed strategy going forward. I've also spent time hearing directly from our people on the topics that matter most to them. I've hosted nearly 40 town hall meetings, roundtable discussions, and deep-dive sessions across the organization to discuss everything from culture to organizational design and to make sure that our leadership is accessible and transparent with our people around the world. These experiences have made it crystal-clear to me how incredible this organization is. Our core products are strong, our people are remarkable. There's a real sense of pride, excitement, and optimism as we look to expand our vision of what we can accomplish in the coming years. Now as many of you saw last week, we announced several leadership changes to ensure we have the right team in place to deliver this expanded vision. We have a strong culture of developing leaders at S&P Global, and it's a testament to that culture that six of the seven leaders on this slide who are taking on new roles are internal promotions. As we announced last week, we are thrilled to welcome Eric Aboaf as our new CFO, and we expect him to join in February of 2025. Eric brings a wealth of experience as a CFO in the financial services sector and a very strong track record of exactly the type of disciplined execution that we hope to continue here at S&P Global. We also announced last week that we are making some changes in our Division Leadership. Effective November 1, Saugata Saha will become the President of our Market Intelligence Division, having previously led Commodity Insights. Yann Le Pallec will become the President of S&P Global Ratings, having most recently served as the Global Head of Rating Services. We will have Co-Presidents of Commodity Insights; Mark Eramo, who is our current Head of the Fuels, Chemicals and Resource Solutions Business; and Dave Ernsberger, who currently leads the Market Reporting and Trading Solutions Business. S&P Global Mobility will continue under the leadership of Edouard Tavernier and S&P Dow Jones indices will continue to be led by Dan Draper. In addition to our division leadership, I also wanted to highlight two horizontal functions that we've introduced. First, in addition to his role as President of Market Intelligence, Saugata Saha will also serve as our Chief Enterprise Data Officer. In that role, Saugata will lead enterprise-wide efforts to expand and connect S&P Global's vast data estate, harnessing the full potential of the company's data capabilities for our customers. Lastly, Sally Moore will be assuming the newly created role of Chief Client Officer. Given the immense breadth of the data products and services that S&P Global brings to the market, we often meet with customers who are buying several products from various divisions. As current Head of Strategy, M&A, and Partnerships, Sally has a deep understanding of our capabilities and strong relationships across the industry. In her new role, she will lead our commercial initiatives across the company to make sure that we are bringing the full power of S&P Global to our largest clients and she will establish an enterprise-wide capability to drive strategic account management at scale. With our executive leadership team in place, we are in a strong position to execute against well-defined strategic initiatives, benchmarks, private markets, sustainability and energy transition, enterprise data and Generative AI were all topics that we discussed at our Investor Day in 2022, and we plan to continue our strategic focus and investments in these areas. Back in July, we established teams of senior leaders from across the organization to do deep reviews in the key strategic areas that we believe are aligned to our core competencies, competitive advantages, and market opportunities. And it was encouraging to see the work these teams delivered as we believe each of these areas remains an attractive investment and we identified important opportunities to drive incremental growth beyond what we had previously considered. We will have more to say about the strategic initiatives over time, but I wanted to assure you all that we continue to see very strong potential in each of these areas. We remain committed to transparency and accountability around the investments we are making and the impact we're seeing on our performance as a result. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of 2024, our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 3.2%, US inflation of 2.9% and an average price for Brent crude of $81 per barrel. These are all roughly in line with our previous expectations. While there is some variation in market expectations around the pace of rate cuts through the end of the year, our base-case assumption is that we see at least one more rate cut this year in the US and while encouraging for various parts of our business going forward, we would not expect the number of rate cuts in the remainder of 2024 to drive much variation in our financial results for 2024. Given stability in our macroeconomic outlook and the significant outperformance since we last provided guidance, we are increasing our outlook for 2024. We are increasing our Billed Issuance forecast for 2024 by 25 percentage points. Given the outperformance in Q3 and our expectation that Q4 will likely see positive growth in Billed Issuance, we are now expecting total Billed Issuance to increase approximately 50% in 2024. These factors combined with the exceptional results year-to-date inform our decision to substantially increase our full-year financial guidance for the company once again. This slide illustrates our current guidance for GAAP results. We are once again raising our enterprise outlook for the full year on all headline metrics, given the strength of the third quarter and our improved outlook for the fourth quarter. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, adjusted margin expansion of 200 basis points to 250 basis points and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $15.10 to $15.30, representing a $0.70 to $0.75 increase from our prior guidance. Additional details on our consolidated financial guidance can be found in our press release, but I also wanted to note we have increased our guidance for adjusted free cash flow to approximately $5.2 billion, up $500 million from our prior guidance. As I'll discuss in a moment, we continue to balance near-term profitability with the need to invest for future growth and we continue to prioritize long-term profitable growth for the company as a whole. The strength of our market-driven businesses so far in 2024 provides us with an opportunity to invest in our products, our people, and our brands across divisions while still delivering significant outperformance at the enterprise level, and that will be reflected in our outlook today. Specifically, as Chris discussed earlier, the strong outperformance thus far this year will increase incentive compensation across the company in 2024 and will also provide capital to pull forward some planned future investment in technology into this year. This is a good thing. And while it has the combined impact of tempering potential margin expansion in some divisions in 2024, we firmly believe that investing in our products and people will enhance our ability to deliver stronger enterprise financial results over the long term. Moving to our division outlook. Given the continued headwinds that Doug mentioned facing our financial services customers, we are tightening the range for Market Intelligence revenue growth in 2024. We now expect growth in the range of 6% to 6.5%. Following the very strong third quarter and the improved outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising the guidance range for ratings revenue growth by 12 percentage points and now expect revenue in the range of 26% to 28% for the full year. While this represents an even more significant increase from the initial guidance we provided back in February, we remind investors that our guidance reflects our expectations based on the best information and estimates available at the time. And ratings remains largely a market-driven business that is difficult to predict in the near term. The issuance environment in 2024 has progressed well beyond what we expected at the beginning of the year and we have adjusted our guidance as we saw the market dynamics evolving throughout the year. We are pleased that our decisions to preserve and invest in capacity in prior years have allowed us to meet the elevated demand in 2024, and we look forward to finishing the year strong. In Commodity Insights, we are tightening the range and raising the low-end to reflect the strength we've seen throughout the year. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 9% to 9.5%. In mobility, we are tightening the range as well, and we now expect revenue in the range of 8% to 8.5%. Lastly, in Indices, the continued strength in AUM, exchange-traded derivatives and subscription ACV led to an improved outlook for the year. We are raising our guidance by 3 percentage points to a new range of 13% to 15%. Turning to division margins; in Market Intelligence, we now expect margins in the range of 32.5% to 33%, tightening and slightly lowering our prior range due to the updated revenue outlook and the elevated expenses associated with compensation that were discussed earlier. In Ratings, we now expect higher revenue to improve margins as well and now expect full-year margins in the range of 61% to 62%. In Commodity Insights, we are tightening the guidance to a range of 46.5% to 47%, reflecting the strong revenue growth, planned strategic investments and the impact of compensation expenses. In mobility, we are tightening the guidance to a range of 38.5% to 39%, reflecting the performance year-to-date and the continued investments to drive future growth. In Indices, we expect higher-growth to drive improved margins, somewhat offset by incentive compensation and strategic investments. We now expect margins in the range of 69.5% to 70.5%. As we continue to prioritize enterprise growth and identify areas for incremental investment in both people and products, we are thrilled to be able to make those incremental investments while still passing on much of the revenue upside from this year to the margins. Compared to the initial guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, we now expect 5 to 6 percentage points more revenue growth, 100 basis points to 150 basis points of further margin expansion, and nearly 10% higher adjusted EPS. We believe that this enterprise mindset and focus on solving for the collective whole will drive strong profitable growth and long-term shareholder value for years to come. With that, we will turn the call back to Mark for your questions. Hi, Ashish, it's Martina here. Thank you very much for the question. Well, in Market Intelligence, as we said during the prepared remarks, we've certainly seen a little bit of an uptick there in cancellations in some of our smaller customers. We talked about some pricing pressure, tightening of budgets and some longer sales cycles. I think an important point here is that this is really around the end markets, Ashish, and some of the headwinds that we're seeing with those end markets. Now, as we move forward, we're continuing to drive innovation in our products within market intelligence, we're very focused on touch points with our customers and making sure we're meeting their needs. And maybe I would say while these are some cyclical headwinds and it's a little bit difficult to call where a trough might be here, but we're very confident that the value we're creating for the customers will be evident as we move through a cycle recover -- cyclical recovery there as well. And perhaps to answer your question on the portfolio optimization piece of it, yes, we've announced two divestitures this year, but this is part of our ongoing model around portfolio optimization. We are always very disciplined at examining businesses and product lines across the company to make sure they're a fit for our strategy and that we are the right owners of those businesses. And so that's something that we'll continue to do in the future. Hi, Toni. Thanks for the question. As we said in the opening remarks, we've spent a lot of time in the last several months collectively as a team, myself and Doug meeting with customers and quite frankly, this is a phenomenal business and one that we as a new leadership team will look to make even better. I highlighted five secular trends in the presentation and each of these five we had discussed during the Investor Day in 2022. And I'll tell you the thing that got me most excited is not only -- was the work that we did in the last few months, it's a reaffirmation of the strategy that we have, but we've also identified other areas within those five where we think we've got good opportunities for maybe new incremental growth. So those would be the things I would highlight there and a lot of excitement with the new leadership team to go after us. Hi, Manav. Thanks so much for the question. Look, you've seen us be very disciplined around capital management over the past several years and very specifically under Doug as CEO. And we're going to remain committed to capital management and returns to our shareholders. So, I'll start by saying that. With that, we will continue to look at whether it's M&A, whether it's portfolio management with the same level of discipline that we always do. And as I said in the last question, we're going to test constantly, are we the right owners for businesses are we investing the right amount or should we be reprioritizing and redirecting investments. And those are all things that we'll do as new leadership team going forward. Hi, Faiza. This is Martina. Thanks so much for the question. Yes, we have seen certainly higher levels of issuance than we anticipated earlier in the year. And this is the third time, I believe that we've raised guidance for ratings. The business itself when it comes to refinancing and the levels that we've seen for pull-forward et cetera, if we look at 2025 maturities and where they stand right now, how much is pulled forward into 2024. It's not dramatically different from what we would have seen in the last couple of years. And so when we say, as we usually do in our calls that there is a healthy maturity wall anywhere from $2 trillion to $2.8 trillion each year over the next five years, that is still very much the case for us. Now we always also say that we can't predict with exact precision the actual timing of refinancing and so much of that this year for example has been related to spreads. So to the extent that we see certain things continuing to move ahead that could impact more pull-forward or less pull-forward. Moreover, I would say, for us, the biggest correlation in issuance overall is actually GDP growth. And so this is something that we would pay very close attention to over the next several years as we think about the ratings business and any of the other businesses that are impacted by GDP growth. And then finally, to your point on the 6% to 9% Investor Day, this was really a target from 2023 to 2025, 2026, so a multiyear target. And I would say for an -- for the enterprise as a whole, we are very much on track for reaching that target and with ratings. Yes, thanks, Doug, and thanks for the question. I would say that as it relates to Market Intelligence growth rates going forward. As Doug commented and we've discussed in the earlier remarks as well, this is really a story of end-markets. And we're not -- we're never going to be the ones to call a trough, but we very firmly believe that with the increased touch points, the innovation that we've seen in the business, as we come through the recovery, we'll see the value come back into some of the areas that have been a little challenged with the end-market challenges that we've seen so far. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question, Craig, and I completely agree with you that Doug is a very hard act to follow. I can tell you, we are focused really here on this wonderful company, great as it is, and how much better we can make it. And the new leadership team as it's been announced does have some different functions than what we had before and those are some areas where we plan to connect the dots a bit more across the divisions through the Chief Commercial Officer and to have really a scaled capability for strategic accounts and through our enterprise data office, we're looking at ways in which we can connect our data together so that it provides us with really interesting and easier pathways to growth across the organization. As you know, we have one of the deepest and richest data estates in the business and we're very excited about the potential for that. Thanks for the question. Hey, George, it's Martina. Thanks for the question. Well, the low watermark in my parlance, I mentioned trough in response to one of the earlier questions that we're not going to be the one to call a trough, but we have very good conviction here, George, that with the innovation that's going into the core products, with the increased touch points that we have with the customers that as we emerge from this cycle, we'll see the recovery reflected in our financials as well as with our customers. And look, it's too early to tell about and it could differ by discrete sector within financial services, but we are hearing a little bit of green shoots here and there, continued pressure in other places. I would say we will watch this very, very carefully, but we feel good that we have the products in place, the investments in new products that Doug mentioned, which we're quite excited about and continue to really engage as closely as possible with our customers. Thanks for the question. Hi, Alex, it's Martina. Thanks so much for the question. Well, we're quite excited as we have been for several years now about the Commodity Insights business and the performance there. And one of the things that excites us as we go forward is the breadth and if you like, sort of embedded diversification across the various different commodity pieces, whether it's oil and gas, power and some of the other areas we've been investing in. In particular, we see in addition to great performance for the larger core product areas, we've also seen really nice performance in some of the newer investment areas. So, for example, we're seeing rapid growth around some of our energy transition products. In particular, we had our new clean-energy tech product that's been launched that's been very well received in the market and lots of other stuff that the teams are doing there, whether it's voluntary carbon markets, low-carbon assessments, etc. So, we think that we're making the right investments here in the areas that will continue to grow going forward and sustaining very good positions and discipline around the core products in the business and overall have, we think a good story going forward here. Thanks for the question. Hi, Ryan, it's Martina here. Thanks for the question. Well, private markets is something that we've been investing in and growing very fast in over the last several years. And it impacts us across the portfolio. We have phenomenal products in Market Intelligence, for example high-level and Wall Street Office and those two products have come up in some of the conversations that Doug and I have been having as we've been doing our transition meetings with senior clients. We also, as you know, have been making great strides in the ratings division with our private markets ratings and assessments as well as seeing some really interesting opportunities in the index business also. So overall, this is a transversal opportunity for us. We're excited about it. We're going to continue to invest and prioritize within this area because there are so many ways in which we can play in this market and we're going to be very disciplined and thoughtful about prioritizing within the private market opportunity to put the money where we can get the best return, deliver the best value for our customers and overall returns for our shareholders. But it's a good story there for us. Thanks very much, Ryan. Hi, Jason, it's Martina. Thanks for the question. I think it goes without saying, but I suppose maybe I'll make the point anyway, a large language model is only as good as the quality and quantity of data that it's trained on and we have lots of high-quality data. And so we feel really good about how we are integrating generative AI into our products. I would say probably two areas to think about. So, one is how do we take existing products and make them better and the second is the extent to which we see opportunities to create maybe new versions of products, different cuts of data using generative AI. And we have tremendous momentum, I would say. You've seen a lot of that on one of the slides, for example, in our presentation that Doug highlighted. And to your point, we have a lot of our customers because we've had Kensho since 2018 and Kensho has been riding the wave of machine learning, natural language processing, and then all the way into GenAI. And between that and just this incredible breadth and depth of data that we have, we have a lot of our clients actually saying, hey, could you come in and talk to us about how you're thinking about using your data, what can we learn from that? And those have been some really interesting and fruitful conversations and a lot of engagement from our customers on AI-ready data as well. So those are just some examples. Internally, we -- as Doug said, we're making really, really incredible progress on the rollout of Spark Assist, both the training on GenAI as well as the use of Spark Assist as a tool internally. And I can say that we are all very excited about the uptick and adoption across our own employees and the types of use cases that we're seeing and we're able to share those earnings with our clients to make the conversations even more interesting. And I would say that the Spark Assist approach that we have taken, we have not necessarily seen many other organizations doing the same thing. So, we have a lot to share in terms of our learnings with our customers and great dialog. Thanks for the question. Hi, Owen, it's Martina, and thanks so much for the question. Well, this is an area that we announced a change in when we did our leadership announcement last week. So the plan forward here is to move the Sustainable One business and combine it with the energy transition products and assets within Commodity Insights. And that merged group will essentially still function as a horizontal from within Commodity Insights. Now this is very exciting for us. As I said earlier, the Commodity Insights division has some of the most unique and proprietary ways to think about and measure energy transition. It's incredibly helpful, for example, for our financial services customers as they're thinking about whether or not they're financing some of these new technologies, what their financed emissions are et cetera. And so this pulling together of these capabilities allows us to create some really unique and forward-looking ways in which we can help our clients as they're navigating the transition. And I think as importantly, will allow us to bring those really high-value commodity Insights products to multiple different sectors outside of the commodity sector. So we're quite excited about it. We'll talk more about it next year, and well, thanks for the question. Hi, Russell, it's Martina here. Thanks so much for the question. Well, as we mentioned earlier, we do think this is an end-market consideration and we -- here's a point that I would make on this. Structural is something that can play to our strengths as much as anything else. And a good example of that is the growth in sponsor business, for example, with private credit, and that's an area where you'll see us actually being able to pick up additional business as opposed to, let's say, other parts of the financial services vertical that are a bit more constrained right now. But I also mentioned that we are seeing some green shoots in some of the additional area in the additional sectors, some good green shoots in some banking areas, for example, with some of our banking clients. All that being said, we have such an incredible breadth of offerings within Market Intelligence. And when you think about Visible Alpha, which has performed really well this year on top of the desktop growth, these are all areas where we think we can continue to engage our clients at the highest levels. We'd also expect for our strategic accounts, Sally Moore's new function as the Chief Client Officer to be able to really connect the dots more effectively across divisions and create higher levels of long-term value with our customers. So thanks for the question. Hey, Surinder, thanks very much for the question. So yes, we are -- it is in fact some of the things that you mentioned in your question around a bit more consistency in how we do things. The connecting of the dots is an important point because our sales teams today are quite independent as we go across the entire book of business. And the results that we can have is that we'll have customers who buy more products or buy products from more than one division, but maybe don't even know the full breadth and depth of the products that we actually have and probably one of the most common things that Doug and I have heard as we've been going out with senior clients over the last several months is, I didn't know you did that. So a good first point here for Sally and his team will be making sure that our customers understand the full breadth and depth of everything that we do. She'll also be looking to bring some consistency around the overall go-to-market practices that we have and really bolstering the strategic relationships that we have with our clients going forward. Thanks for the question. Thank you so much, Doug, for those heartfelt words and for your remarkable leadership that has transformed S&P Global. You grew our market cap from $16 billion to $165 billion, while fundamentally strengthening our capabilities through the IHS Markit acquisition. But beyond these impressive numbers, you've led with extraordinary empathy and wisdom, creating a legacy that I'm deeply honored to follow upon. So thank you to everyone who joined today's call. I look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call."

            "name": "Doug Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. S&P Global delivered exceptional financial results in the [Technical Difficulties]. Total revenue increased 16% year-over-year, marking the third consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our ratings division continues to contribute meaningfully to our outperformance with transaction revenue increasing more than 80% year-over-year. Revenue from subscription products across the company increased 8% year-over-year as customers continue to turn to S&P Global to provide the benchmarks, data, thought leadership, and tools they need to make crucial decisions in today's macroeconomic landscape. We delivered 330 basis points of trailing 12-month margin expansion and 21% growth in EPS as we continue to invest prudently across the business and return capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've repurchased $2 billion in shares and plan to repurchase $1.3 billion more through year-end. In addition to our strong financial results, we continue to invest in innovation, particularly around generative AI and our strategic initiatives, which we'll touch on shortly. We also continue the important work of optimizing our portfolio of products in order to create the most customer and shareholder value. We closed the divestiture of Fincentric during the third quarter and today announced the planned divestiture of PrimeOne. PrimeOne sits within our Market Intelligence division and won't have a material impact on either the division or the company's financial results. That said, the divestiture further enables the company to focus our efforts on the best opportunities to drive long-term profitable growth. Last week, we announced management changes in conjunction with our CEO transition. Martina will walk through that later in the call. Now turning to market and commercial conditions. The debt, equity, and commodities markets all continue to show improvement benefiting our businesses. With more than $1 trillion in billed issuance in the third quarter, we've surpassed $3 trillion year-to-date. It's very encouraging to see how participants in the debt markets, both public and private consistently turn to S&P Global ratings to help assess risk, balance exposures across portfolios, and assess credit conditions. The experience and expertise of our analysts, the breadth and depth of our coverage across credit asset classes and geographies and the relevance of our methodologies and thought leadership has all served the markets very well thus far in 2024. We've also seen some improvement in equity markets as our flagship indices like the S&P 500 have performed very well year-to-date. We continue to see gradual increases in IPO volumes, which benefit some of our volume-driven businesses and M&A activity has also started to show early signs of recovery. The commodities markets have remained strong as well, especially in end-markets like energy that are important to our business. We continue to see retention rates improve year-over-year in Commodity Insights and are very pleased with both the execution and the market reception of the new products. That said, we've been calling out headwinds among our financial services customers for some time now. Those have continued in the third quarter with elongated sales cycles as well as signs of increased price sensitivity and vendor consolidation. Vendor consolidation has historically been beneficial to S&P Global given the breadth and diversity of products that we offer, though the pricing environment has had an impact this year. For the last few quarters, we have noted our expectation that retention rates in financial services would be slightly below last year. That said, cancellations among our smaller customers in Market Intelligence caused retention rates to dip below our expectations slightly in the third quarter, and we expect that to continue to impact the business in the fourth quarter. We'll discuss the impact of all these moving pieces on our guidance in a moment, but the aggregate impact is that we are substantially increasing our outlook on revenue growth, operating margins, and EPS for 2024. Now, let's turn to activity in the debt markets. For Billed Issuance, we saw a 76% increase year-over-year in the third quarter as we saw strong growth across all products. Refinancing activity remains very strong, including some pull-forward out of 2025 and even out of 2026, but certainly within the normal ranges of what we would expect at this time of the year. We're starting to see more activity beyond refinancing with some of the outperformance in the third quarter driven by opportunistic issuance around dividend recapitalizations and the beginning of a recovery in M&A activity. Market conditions, specifically the tight spreads and stability around the rate outlook have continued to be major drivers of issuance in the third quarter and inform our improved outlook for the remainder of 2024 as well. As we look to additional rate cuts over the next 12 months to 18 months, we continue to expect strong demand among investors for public debt as the current yields are expected to moderate somewhat as rates come down. Turning to Vitality, newer enhanced products generated $377 million in the third quarter. This represents 11% of our total revenue and is consistent with what we reported last quarter. Key contributors to our Vitality index are updated from last quarter as we've seen strong demand for CARFAX Listings in the CARFAX Banking and Insurance Group. We also see strong growth in energy transition and climate and LNG price assessment products from our Commodity Insights division. We're encouraged by the acceleration in the pace of innovation at S&P Global and look forward to maintaining our Vitality index at or above the 10% target. Now turning to our latest initiatives around Generative AI. Each quarter, we've been highlighting just a few of the many ways we've been leveraging both Traditional AI and Generative AI within S&P Global. In the third quarter, we had a number of new use cases within our products and services, but also within our own internal processes that are very exciting. Within market intelligence, we introduced new advanced analytics solutions and GenAI functionality through Cap IQ Pro, which allows users to build predictive models, automate workflows, and better identify patterns and data more quickly. Within Commodity Insights, we enabled cloud delivery of AI-ready data on clean-energy technology. This is a great example of our efforts to make sure that the investments we've made to prepare datasets for ingestion in AI models directly translate into benefits for our customers and economics for our business. Also in Commodity Insights, we introduced our AI-powered chatbot called ChatAI to improve the user experience, answer customer questions in real-time and help users more quickly discover the valuable insights in our Platts Connect platform. Within mobility, we're leveraging GenAI and animation automation to embed the CARFAX, CAR FOX directly within the vehicle history reports that customers use. Soon, the animated Fox will appear on additional products, including car care user dashboards and our listings products, driving deeper customer engagement and enhancing brand affinity. Lastly, we continue to invest in our people so they can take full advantage of these incredible technologies as they emerge. Through our recently launched Spark AI Academy, our employees received meaningful training on prompt engineering and other insights into how they can best leverage AI in their own daily work. Not only does this make our employees more productive, but it allows us to cross-pollinate new use cases across the organization. It's been inspiring to see some of these early use cases emerge in code development, document analysis, record-keeping, and process improvement and the way people are sharing their new skills across S&P Global. We're confident that AI will be a strong influence to improve efficiency, productivity, the quality of life for years to come and that over time, you will see these improvements in our growth and profitability. Turning to our financial results. With our consistent focus on innovation and execution. We're pleased with the exceptional financial results across the enterprise this quarter. By serving our customers effectively and efficiently, we delivered exceptional growth and profitability in the third quarter. Now let me turn to Chris Craig, our Interim CFO, to review the financial results. Chris, over to you. Thanks, Scott. This is Doug. When we look at the synergy performance of the company, we're very pleased. Across the board, we're ahead of what we had as our expectations. We see in particular cross-sell as one of the areas that has done incredibly well. And when I talk about cross-sell, I talk about cross-sell intra-division. We're also very excited about the new role that Sally Moore is going to have, which is going to bring up a lot more opportunity across divisions for cross-sell. And then within the divisions on new products, new services, we've been quite successful getting things out. And for example, we've had 23 new products this year so far from Market Intelligence. Those products are all doing well and we continue to be on track to deliver our synergies. Great. Thanks, David. Let me start. As we've mentioned, there's been headwinds on this area for many, many quarters. This isn't something new for us. We saw this when the investment banks and both the buy-side and the sell-side were pulling back when inflation had gone up quite dramatically. Interest rates were spiking. There were a lot of trends which had slowed down the environment. We'd seen a slowdown of the sales cycle. So as opposed to this necessarily being pricing, we have seen some price sensitivity. This is just a residual impact of all of the changes and the expense management that we saw in the area. We have seen something that we discussed, we call vendor consolidation that historically has been very beneficial to us. We have the kind of datasets in a way that many organizations when we start talking with them, they don't realize how many things we have. It gives us an opportunity to bring more and more capabilities when we have these discussions. So yes, we have seen some consolidation. We've seen some sales cycle slowdown. We've seen some pricing pressure overall, but it is an incredibly strong business. The synergies have been coming along and the integration has gone incredibly well. Martina, over to you. Thanks, Surinder. And I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and especially your great questions. Over the past 11 years, I've had the honor of leading S&P Global through significant transformation and we've always strived to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders and our customers. This is my 44th Earnings call and I've had hundreds of meetings with analysts and investors, and I've always appreciated the discussion, and the dialogue and the tough questions that you've asked. I've always learned. I want to thank our 40,000 people at the company. They are the heart, the soul and the brain of S&P Global and the reason for our success. And I know they're going to continue to deliver growth and innovation in the years ahead. I want to thank Martina and congratulate her on her new role. I'm confident that she's going to be a great CEO and will be a fabulous addition to the company with the full support of our people and a great knowledge and commitment to our customers, the communities, and our shareholders. I'm very excited about what lies ahead and that we have a world-class Board, a talented management team and we're very well-positioned for the future. I can't thank you all enough. This has been the best run I've ever had."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Mark. S&P Global delivered an incredible first half in 2024 as the second quarter saw accelerated revenue growth, significant margin expansion, and the highest quarterly adjusted EPS in our company's history. Total revenue increased 16%, excluding the divestiture of engineering solutions. Transaction revenue in our ratings division continues to drive significant outperformance at more than 60% growth. The revenue from all our subscription products across the company also increased 8% year-over-year in the second quarter despite some of the market headwins that are common across our industry this year. We delivered 450 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and 30% growth in EPS as we captured market demand and contained our expense growth. As you saw last month, we also announced our CEO succession plan which I’ll discuss in a moment. We’ve been cultivating more than just our leaders at S&P Global and we’re pleased with the product innovation coming to the market in the second quarter. The June release of CapIQ Pro included significant enhancements, and we launched new benchmarks and commodity insights. We continue to accelerate our deployment of generative AI and launch new capabilities both at the division and enterprise level. We also continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses and products, with Visible Alpha closing in the second quarter and the recent signing of an agreement to divest Fincentric, which we expect to close in the third quarter. We're excited that we get to cover key developments in each of our five strategic pillars this quarter, beginning with our customers. S&P Global rated more than $1 trillion of billed issuance in the second quarter. Growth was diversified across public and private markets, as private market participants increasingly turned to S&P Global for expertise in assessing credit risk. Revenue from rating services in the private markets increased more than 70% year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to create new products from the combined data sets and solutions of S&P Global and IHS Market to create incremental value for our customers. In the second quarter, we achieved nearly $200 million of annualized run rate revenue synergies. As Chris will discuss in a moment, this puts us ahead of the pace to achieve the $350 million in revenue synergies we're targeting in 2026. It's remarkable that we're able to deliver these strong results despite the well-known market headwinds that continue to impact pockets of our business. Our diverse customer base and broad product portfolio provide for more stable financial performance for the company overall, as headwinds can often be offset by tailwinds. As an example, while renewal rates were slightly lower than last year in market intelligence this quarter, renewal rates were slightly higher than last year in commodity insights. These market dynamics are not unexpected, and the financial impact was largely included in our initial guidance. Despite macroeconomic cyclicality, we continue to find ways to help our customers achieve their goals using our differentiated data and product offerings. This ability to align our product innovation and investment with customer needs was further demonstrated in the second quarter by the acceleration in revenue growth from our private market solutions and our sustainability and energy transition offerings. Turning back to billed issuance, it increased 54% year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to see tight credit spreads contributing to favorable market conditions. We also saw modest improvement in some of the important macroeconomic indicators, particularly in North America, that have lent strength to the issuance environment. We continue to see particular strength in bank loans and structured finance, along with robust growth in high-yield investment-grade bonds. Refinancing activity was very strong in the quarter as we saw a pull forward of issuance from investment-grade issuers refinancing 2024 maturities, as well as speculative-grade issuers refinancing 2024 and future-year maturities. This leaves some uncertainty around the back half as we wait to see how much of the out-year refinancings get pulled into 2024. This continues to inform our view that the second half will be softer than the first half in terms of billed issuance and transaction revenue in our ratings business. With the timing and likelihood of any rate cuts in the U.S. market still uncertain, our base case still assumes a modest year-over-year decline in issuance in the fourth quarter. Turning to Vitality, newer enhanced products generated $375 million in the second quarter. This represents 11% of our total revenue and an improvement from the 10% we reported last quarter. Key contributors to our Vitality Index are unchanged from last quarter as we see strong demand for CARFAX listings and the CARFAX Banking and Insurance Group. We also see strong growth in energy transition and climate products from our Commodity Insights Division and Sustainable Bonds from Ratings. As you'll recall from last quarter, key contributors from our pricing valuations and reference data, as well as several thematic and factor-based indices, matured out of the Vitality Index at the end of the year. We're encouraged by the continued acceleration and the pace of innovation of S&P Global and look forward to maintaining our Vitality Index at or above the 10% target. As we look to examples of that innovation, a common thread running through many of the products we're bringing to market is our enterprise expertise in generative AI. In the second quarter, we launched ChatAI on Platts Connect. Launched as a new platform combining Platts Dimensions Pro with IHS Connect, the Platts Connect platform provides access to a truly massive amount of data, research, and insights to power the global commodity markets. With the depth and breadth of information in the platform, we new users would need an intuitive way to navigate and find the information that would be critical to their daily workflows. ChatAI is a powerful customer tool developed through a partnership of Kensho and Commodity Insights that uses generative AI models to provide real-time responses to conversational user queries to help them quickly find the necessary data to make informed, faster decisions. In addition to this AI-powered interface, Commodity Insights continues to bring new benchmark Price Assessments to market. Our Platts team introduced five daily Price Assessments for beef and four daily Price Assessments for poultry, as well as a new report with up-to-date coverage of the protein's market. These continue to broaden and strengthen our position in agriculture commodities. We also continue to scale new functionality in our differentiated energy transition offerings. We significantly enhanced our global integrated energy model in the second quarter, which now enables modeling and scenario building for energy demand in over 140 countries using deep data sets going back more than 30 years. With our enterprise focus on artificial intelligence, we've continued to develop internal tools, including new functionality in the S&P Spark Assist platform we introduced earlier this year. Approximately 14,000 of our people are using Spark Assist internally after just a few short months. As we shared with you last quarter, this platform is designed to be cost effective, vendor agnostic, highly scalable, and secure by design. By encouraging collaboration across the enterprise, we're able to quickly iterate on time-saving use cases and share those developments across the company. We're already seeing users leverage S&P Spark Assist to optimize code, rewrite configuration files for software migrations, and summarize complex documents. We've also used it to aggregate and digest feedback and ideas that we receive through our employee engagement surveys in town halls, empowering leadership to more effectively act on what matters the most to our people. We believe this crowd-sourced approach to developing tools shortens the time to discover and develop new applications using GenAI models. Leveraging LLMs from multiple sources allows us to benefit from the rapid innovation taking place across the technology ecosystem without being locked into a single vendor. Lastly, the June release of CapIQ Pro brought powerful enhancements to the platform that we believe will strengthen our competitive position and create meaningful value for our customers. We fully integrated the fixed income data from IHS market, which brings data on more than 19 million government agency and corporate fixed income securities and makes it readily available through the CapIQ Pro platform. This was a tremendous undertaking made possible through the merger that will benefit our existing customers and help potential customers more easily see the incredible value in CapIQ Pro. The June release also included a complete reimagining of the charting and visualization capabilities within CapIQ Pro, deploying the technology and expertise that came to us through the Chart IQ acquisition. Back to the theme of generative AI. We also introduced transcript summarization within CapIQ Pro. This new tool was built organically and not only provides a quick summary of earnings calls, it also organizes topics and sentiment and empowers the user to immediately click through and find the direct quotes behind the summaries. And it's built on a foundation of Scribe developed by Kensho four years ago. I want to take a moment to discuss an important acquisition that closed in second quarter. Visible Alpha is well known and highly respected among both our customers and our investors. And we're excited to see the progress the market intelligence team has already made since closing the deal in May. Visible Alpha compiles highly detailed financial models via direct feed from over 200 contributing brokers. With over 6,000 contributing analysts including most of the analysts joining us on this call, Visible Alpha has the most detailed and comprehensive consensus estimates available anywhere in the world. We frequently hear from customers that they could not do their jobs without it. S&P Global's position as a trusted partner across the financial markets is opening doors for visible health and private equity, banking and consulting, and driving further penetration and asset management and research. Leveraging the strength of S&P Global's relationships, brand and commercial teams, we've already seen a 5% increase in number of contributing brokers in just the last three months. In addition, we've generated over 150 sales leads and closed 10 deals already. We've seen numerous opportunities to leverage the Visible Alpha Platform in conjunction with the differentiated datasets throughout S&P Global to create unique, deep sector content. We look forward to sharing new developments in the coming quarters. Now, turning to a very exciting announcement we made in the second quarter that fittingly comes under our four strategic pillars, Lead and Inspire. In June, we announced that I will be retiring from my role as President and CEO of S&P Global effective November 1st. Martina Cheung, the President of Ratings and Sponsor of Sustainable1, will become the 11th CEO of S&P Global since we were listed on the New York Stock Exchange over 90 years ago. We are very pleased to see our succession plan work the way it was designed, with development of strong internal leaders resulting in a unanimous decision from our board of directors. I'm focused on delivering strong results over the next few months as I work with Martina on a comprehensive transition plan before she takes over November. As you might have seen, I'll stay on the board until the next shareholders meeting and on as an advisor until the end of 2025. Martina has already joined the board of directors and is working hard to get ready for November. We will have more to say on the transition next quarter, but it's been wonderful to see the outpouring of support and appreciation for Martina from customers, employees, and shareholders. Turning to our financial results, with strong growth across every division, we continue to meet increasing market demand while maintaining expense discipline. We saw accelerating revenue growth in the quarter, and on a trailing 12-month basis, we have expanded our operating margin by 300 basis points. Now let me turn to Chris Craig, our interim CFO, to review the financial results. Chris, over to you.\nChris Craig: Thank you, Doug. We finished the second quarter of 2024 with exceptional performance across the entire company, with three of five divisions achieving double-digit growth in both revenue and operating profit. Reported revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to a record $3.5 billion in the second quarter. And while parts of our market-driven businesses benefited from the tailwinds Doug highlighted earlier, we are also seeing strong performance across strategic investment areas, which I'll touch on shortly. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 30% year-over-year to $4.04. This was driven by a combination of our strong revenue growth, margin expansion of 450 basis points, and a 2% reduction in fully diluted share count. Now, turning to strategic investment areas, where I'm pleased to report we saw growth accelerate across all initiatives. Sustainability and Energy Transition revenue grew 23% to $87 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Commodity Insights Energy Transition Advisory Services and subscription offerings. Our Sustainable1 team continues to expand the company's sustainability and energy transition offerings, while leveraging cross-divisional industry expertise to provide our customers with broader solutions. In Private Market Solutions, revenue increased by 26% to $134 million. Growth was driven by debt, bank loan, and CLO ratings, and demand for our private market solutions within market intelligence, which includes products like Qval and iLEVEL. For revenue synergies, we exited the second quarter with an annualized run rate of $199 million. During the quarter, we recognized $54 million in revenue synergies, which came from a mix of cross-sell activity and revenue generated from new products. Turning to our divisions, Market Intelligence revenue increased 7% in the second quarter. Desktop grew 6% or 2% when excluding the impact from the Visible Alpha acquisition. Growth in the quarter was impacted by the continued softness in the financial services end market that we've highlighted previously. Nevertheless, we're focused on adding value for our customers by improving performance and introducing new content and capabilities, including the recent integration of markets' fixed income securities data. Data Advisory Solutions grew 6%, driven by expanded coverage and continued investment in the high-growth areas of our market data and valuations and industry and company data product offerings. Enterprise solutions grew 11% as loan platforms such as ClearPar and our primary markets group were beneficiaries of stronger equity and debt capital market activity in the quarter. For modeling purposes, it's important to note that the enterprise solutions business line includes Fincentric. Credit and risk solutions grew 5% due to demand for our RatingsExpressed and RatingsDirect distribution platforms in North America and Europe. RatingsDirect is also benefiting from user adoption of Capital IQ Pro. Adjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in compensation and the impact of the Visible Alpha acquisition. Partially offset by reduction in expenses associated with headcount and outside services. Operating profit increased 9% and operating margin increased 60 basis points to 32.9%. Trailing 12-month margins expanded 90 basis points to 33.3%. Now turning to Ratings where we saw exceptional revenue growth of 33% which exceeded our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew by 63% in the second quarter, fueled by increased bank loan and bond issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 9%, primarily due to an increase in annual fee revenue and an increase in new mandates, particularly from the return of high-yield issuers. Adjusted expenses increased 8%, driven by higher compensation, including incentives, as well as investments in strategic initiatives. This resulted in a 52% increase in operating profit and an 810 basis point increase in operating margin to 65.8%. For the trailing 12 months, Ratings margin expanded 570 basis points to 60.9%. And now, turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 12%, driven by strong performance across all business lines, with price assessments and Energy and Resources Data and Insights both growing at double digits. Notably, this marks the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our Price Assessments business. Price Assessments and Energy and Resources Data and Insights grew 11% and 12% respectively. Both businesses benefited from strong performance in crude and refined products. In addition, we continue to see favorable commercial conditions across both segments, including strong subscription sales across Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Advisory and Transactional services had an exceptional quarter, with revenue growing 32% or 27% when excluding the impact from the World Hydrogen Leaders acquisition. This is driven by strong trading volumes across key sectors in global trading services and a pickup in consulting activity, particularly for energy transition-related initiatives. Upstream Data and Insights revenue grew by 5% year-over-year, benefiting from meaningful contribution from organic investments, including our Upstream Energy Transition offerings, as well as continued improvement in retention rates. For the full year, we expect low single-digit growth for Upstream. Adjusted expenses increased 8% due to higher compensation costs, ongoing investments in growth initiatives, and the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 16%, and operating margin improved by 170 basis points to 47.3%. Trailing 12-month margin increased by 130 basis points to 46.8%. Now, turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year, or 9% when excluding the impact of the divestiture of the after-sales business. Dealer revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by new business growth in products such as new car listings and continued success in CARFAX. Manufacturing declined modestly by 1%, driven by a decrease in one-time transaction revenue, particularly in our recall business, which can fluctuate based on the level of recall activity in any given period. This was partially offset by another strong quarter of subscription sales. Financials & Other increased 13% as the business line benefited from historically high underwriting volumes. Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to planned investments in strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expense. This resulted in operating profit increasing by 10% for the quarter, and operating margin improving by 60 basis points to 40.9%. Trailing 12-month margin contracted by 10 basis points to 38.8%. Now, turning to S&P Dow Jones indices. Revenue increased 12%, primarily due to strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM and growth in our data and custom subscriptions offerings. Asset-linked fees were up 16%, driven by market appreciation and inflows. Impressively, the Global ETF market saw record inflows in excess of $300 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, highlighting the continued shift to passive investing and opportunities for future growth. Exchange-Traded derivatives revenue grew 4%, primarily driven by strong volumes across our equity complex products. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6% year-over-year, driven by new business growth in end-of-day contracts and real-time data. Expenses increased 4% year-over-year, driven by investments in strategic growth initiatives and an increase in incentive compensation expense. Indices operating profit increased 15% and impressively operating margin expanded by 210 basis points to 70.7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, indices operating margin expanded by 150 basis points to 69.8%. Looking at the quarter holistically, we saw broad strength across the business. Market factors like issuance volumes and asset price appreciation contributes to strong growth in our market driven businesses. And our subscription business lines benefited from the continuing investment in our differentiated data, content, and workflow capabilities. We are pleased with the profitable growth delivered by the combination of strong customer demand and disciplined execution in the quarter. And with that, I will now turn it back to Doug to discuss our outlook for the second half of the year. Doug?\nDoug Peterson: Thank you, Chris. Our financial guidance assumes Global GDP growth of 3.3%. U.S. inflation is 3% and an average price for Brent crude of $84 per barrel. We continue to see fluctuations in the market expectations for rate cuts. Though our base case still assumes there'll be one rate cut in the U.S. in the second half of 2024. While the macroeconomic indicators that help inform our guidance are very similar to last quarter, we're significantly raising our financial outlook for the full year. We're increasing our build issuance forecasts for 2024 by nearly 20 percentage points. Given the dramatic increase in issuance in the first half, we now expect growth in build issuance to be approximately 25% compared to our prior range of 6% to 10%. In our most recent study of debt financing, we examined the volume of debt set to mature over the next several years. We're presenting this data in a slightly different way than we have in the past in the hopes it's more easily interpreted by analysts and investors. Here, we compare the amount of S&P global rated debt set to mature over the next six months, 18 months, and so on out more than seven years as of July 1st in each of the last three years. As you can see, there is very little debt set to mature over the second half of 2024, though this is consistent with what we've seen in prior years. On a cumulative basis, the maturity walls coming over the next several years gives us confidence in the long-term strength of our business. Though the timing of that refinancing activity remains difficult to predict on a quarter-by-quarter basis, all of these factors impact our new full-year guidance calling for higher growth, stronger margins, and substantial generation of free cash. This slide illustrates our current guidance for GAAP results. We're once again raising our enterprise outlook for the full year on all headline metrics given the strength of the second quarter and our improved outlook for the second half. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 125 basis points to 175 basis points, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $14.35 to $14.60, representing a $0.50 increase from our prior guidance. Additional details on our consolidated financial guidance can be found on our press release, but I also wanted to note that we've increased our guidance for adjusted free cash flow to approximately $4.7 billion, up $200 million from our prior guidance, and reflecting the strong results year-to-date. Moving toward division outlook, our revenue guidance for Market Intelligence is unchanged, and we continue to expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7.5%. This guidance reflects the contribution from Visible Alpha, which closed in May, largely offset by the loss of revenue following the divestiture of Fincentric later this quarter. Importantly for models, Visible Alpha is reported in the desktop business line for Market Intelligence, which should accelerate on a reported basis in the second half, while Fincentric is reported in the enterprise solutions business, which should see a corresponding deceleration in the second half following the divestiture, particularly in the fourth quarter. We're raising our outlook for Ratings Business substantially, following the second quarter performance. We still expect the second half to be softer than the first, reflecting normal seasonality, but exacerbated by the level of pull forward that we believe took place thus far this year. For the second half, the favorable market conditions and improved visibility and form a slightly more optimistic view around the third quarter in a modest year-over-year decline in both build issuance and ratings transaction revenue in the fourth quarter. Our revenue guidance for commodity insights is unchanged. We're slightly lowering and tightening the guidance range from ability revenue growth. As we noted last quarter in this morning, the recall business has been abnormally soft year-to-date, and we expect that softness to continue in the second half. The recall business is non-recurring and difficult to predict, but the lowered outlook means that the remainder of the revenue is more predictable, recurring subscription, which gives us confidence in the tighter range of 8% to 9% revenue growth compared to the prior range of 8.5% to 10%. We've also seen significant outperformance in our indices division in the first half, and we're raising our guidance again. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12%, up from 9% to 11%. Importantly, this guidance assumes market levels are essentially flat from levels at the end of June. Turning to our margin outlook, for Market Intelligence, while the revenue impacts from Visible Alpha and Fincentric, are largely offsetting, the net impact is expected to be modestly dilutive to margins in 2024. As such, we're lowering the margin guidance for Market Intelligence to a range of 33% to 34%. For Ratings, we're raising the margin guidance by 100 basis points to reflect the strong revenue outperformance, partially offset by higher expected incentive compensation expense. Commodity Insights margin guidance is unchanged. For Mobility, given our expectations for softer revenue from the recall business, we now expect margins in the division to be slightly lower in the range of 38.5% to 39.5%, down 50 basis points from prior guidance. Our margin expectations for Indices are unchanged despite the higher expected revenue growth as we plan to continue investing to position the business for growth through 2024 and beyond. With that, I'd like to invite Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Mark?\nMark Grant: Thank you, Doug. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats to both Doug and Martina. I just wanted to kick off with MI. As we think about, I was wondering if you could talk about the pipeline there. Also, if you could talk about what you're seeing on the sales cycle trend. And how do we think about the Desktop business going forward? Obviously, we see the acceleration from Visible Alpha, but just underlying growth in that business with getting all the info data there? Thanks.\nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Ashish. This is Doug. First of all, thank you for the question. And let me start by mentioning that the softness that we saw was something that we expected. As you know, there were over 60,000 seats that were eliminated from banks and investment banks since the COVID cycle. We saw softness as the interest rates had gone up. They spiked in 2022 under with underlying inflation. We do see some of that business starting to come back. You saw very strong debt capital markets, equity capital markets. Some of the investment banks signaled that there was going to be a return of M&A. But we do see that within the large banks, so basically, the sell side that there is some talk about vendor consolidation, there's a slowdown in the negotiation of contracts. So let me talk about a few of the ways we think about it. First of all, as you know, we have enterprise contracts. The enterprise contracts are not negotiated by seat. They're not negotiated every single year. We see that we have a strong opportunity to bring more and more data to the discussion as people look at vendor consolidation. As we enhance our technology, we improve all of our different products and services that we have. You heard us talk about what we've been doing with the Desktop by enhancing it with new services and new products. But let me turn very quickly to a couple of the products themselves. As the Desktop was enhanced with Visible Alpha. Visible Alpha is a must have product and service. As I said in the prepared remarks, probably everybody on this call is using it. We've seen a great increase in people coming to the product. When we closed the deal, we had 180 contributing brokers. Now we have over 200. We also saw that with the new release of the Desktop, a really good results from the new visualization tools that we added. Let me mention one other sub segments on Enterprise Solutions, which grew at 11%. That also was very much driven by what we saw happening with the capital markets improving. So we see, many different aspects to Market Intelligence. The last thing I want to mention is we did reiterate our guidance, which is in line with what we said earlier this year. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. If I could just follow up on that in Market Intelligence. Firstly, could you help us with the annualized contribution both from Visible Alpha and I guess what's lost from Fincentric? And just along those lines, what we should anticipate in terms of your continued participation in this vendor consolidation? And are there other things like Fincentric that could be cleaned up there as well?\nDouglas Peterson: Yes, let me start with what we believe is really important for us is our capital allocation model. As we believe that it's really important to continually be looking at our portfolio to ensure that everything that's in part of S&P Global contributes to the whole, that helps the enterprise be stronger, that we see opportunities for some sort of consolidation either through technology, through sales cycles, through product research, etcetera. So we believe that this was both of these transactions, Visible Alpha coming in and Fincentric going out, were both really valuable overall for S&P Global. Now when you think about the modeling that I mentioned on the prepared remarks, Visible Alpha roughly adds about 1% of growth and Fincentric basically takes out about 1% of growth. But as I mentioned also, they're in different segments. The Visible Alpha is in the desktop segment and the Fincentric is in the enterprise solution segment. So you're going to see a slightly different growth rate in each of those based on the Visible Alpha coming in and Fincentric going out. To the second part of your question about vendor consolidation or discussions with the different organizations, we bring incredible strength because of the data and the analytics we have across the entire platform. Not only do we have the traditional market intelligence and financial services, desktop and other solutions, we also have information, for example, which we've been investing in private credit, private markets. We have a really strong sustainability platform which is becoming more and more important. So we can bring data services, data sets from across S&P Global that make it very relevant to any discussion we're having as people look at consolidating their data relationships. Mark's going to add to this.\nMark Grant: Yes, Hey Manav, just to make sure we're really clear here, the percentage points impact that we're talking about were to market intelligence revenue growth, not to the company as a whole. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You raised your build issuance outlook from 6% to 10% to about 25% for the full year. In terms of issuance category, where did your outlook for the year change the most for build issuance and what were the drivers?\nMartina Cheung: Hi, George. It's Martina. Thanks so much for the question. I would say we saw growth in the build issuance outlook for the full year across all categories, but I would say accelerated growth in high yield and bank loan ratings. We did see very strong issuance in the first half in investment grade, but that was characterized more by an acceleration in Q1, slightly tapering off in Q2. A lot of that refinancing activity in investment grade was done last year and in Q1. So a bit of a taper off there overall. Some more modest expectations for investment grade for the full year. High yield at BLR, very strong growth. I would say maybe a couple of sub-asset classes to highlight. CLOs is expected to have a very strong year from an issuance standpoint, for example, and a number of other sub-asset classes in structured finance that are seeing quite a bit of growth, for example, data center securitizations. Hope that helps. Thanks for the question.\nDoug Peterson: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the index business and what you're seeing there specifically with data and subscriptions. I know at one point we had talked about sort of growth accelerating here. So just curious on what type of trends you're seeing generally in the index business and on the subscription side.\nDoug Peterson: Yes. So let me start with what we're seeing thematically. As you know and as Chris mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've seen massive flows from active to passive. That continues to be a trend. And within that space, a lot of the flows go to U.S. equities. And within U.S. equities, S&P, Dow Jones indexes picks up the bulk of that. So you've seen that coming through last quarter in terms of volume. There was also some increase in the value, the AUM value. So we benefited from that with the 16% growth in the asset linked fees. As some of those fees are going to be seen on a lagged basis. So we expect that we built into our guidance the expectation that the market was going to remain flat for the rest of the year. But we would see some increases, those average flows continue to come through the rest of the year. In terms of themes, we continue to see a lot of interest in different types of asset classes. So within even the asset class of the S&P 500 large cap U.S., we've had new partnerships with some large asset managers with new types of S&P 500 funds. The S&P 500 quality, the S&P 500 economic ETF. We also see a lot of innovation around fixed income and credit through the Cboe iBoxx emerging market bond index. We've also seen some really interesting new products coming out that bring in mid-cap using our indices, the Vanguard S&P Global 1200 ADR. So across the board, we're seeing a lot of new interest, asset classes. Another one which we want to mention very briefly relates to the private markets and private credit. This is an area where we have a lead. We already have strong positions in private credit indices. And we'll be building that out much more as we take advantage of this asset class, which has a lot of interest in the market. Thanks, Faiza.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you very much. I was hoping to ask about investment spend, especially given the success you're seeing in terms of your strategic investments. How are you thinking about the pace of spending going forward, especially as issuance continues to recover? Any changes in philosophy there?\nDouglas Peterson: Heather, let me take that. And as you know, we always believe that it's important for us to have investment in new products, new areas, new services. You saw the benefit of many of those this quarter. Our Vitality Index, which is revenue that we start the beginning of the year with about a 10% approach to what we want to see for the percentage of our revenue, that grew this quarter to 11%. That's a very important indicator for us to see growth in the innovation, the investments we're making. We've been investing in a couple of key areas. Private markets is one. Another relates to Sustainability & Energy Transition. Artificial intelligence is one, and there's many other subcategories that are important for us. We know that the ability to continue to have loyal customers, the ability for us to generate positive pricing is always going to be based on the value that we bring to our markets, the value we bring to our customers. So you're going to see us continuing to set aside capital to invest. And fortunately, we've been very successful in the last few years. That doesn't mean that we are successful with everything we do, but we're very pleased with the track record we have. Thanks so much for the question, Heather.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about AI. You had a very early head start when you bought Kensho, but maybe just talk about how you're viewing the competitive position now. Have competitors closed the gap by working with Microsoft? And also maybe just talk about your opportunity to use your proprietary data within new AI products. Thanks.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks, Toni, for that. I'm going to start and then hand it over to Martina, who can give some practical applications. As you know, when we first bought Kensho six years ago, we had a vision that artificial intelligence tools were going to be used by people like us on this call to enhance our decision-making, to make us -- allow us to make decisions faster with more data. And we're seeing that play out, especially now that artificial intelligence has moved into generative AI. As you know, we have in place a system of governance, where we have a Chief AI Officer for the Company. We have an AI Council. We have a system towards ensuring that we have the right kind of training across the entire company. We have an accelerator if we see a really good opportunity that we want to move fast on. But really at the foundation of everything is an open architecture model. We've built something called S&P Spark Assist, which is now used by over 14,000 users. S&P Spark Assist allows us to bring our models into our model garden and use it as a copilot. It means that we can be agnostic towards which model is best. We think that it's bringing us all kinds of new opportunities. You saw this quarter, we announced the launch of Chat AI on Platts Connect. This is a really good product. I actually use myself this quarter the transcript summaries on CapIQ Pro. Those are really valuable. But I think Martina can add some to this with applications that she's seeing on the ground in Ratings.\nMartina Cheung: Yes. Great. Thanks, Doug. Thanks for the question. I would say in Ratings that we've had, like most other organizations, dozens of pilots underway. We're very excited overall about the potential for GenAI to improve quality, to create efficiency and time to market for our core Ratings business. And one example I thought would be interesting is what you've mentioned in the past that we had focused in on a tool to help our CLO credit analyst with making sense of very complex CLO documentation. And that proved to be fortuitous, given the very, very busy year that we've seen so far in CLOs. And we're excited about this tool which we're deploying out into production for our analysts over the second half of the year and its ability to help save time for the analysts so they can focus in on the important jobs of getting the ratings done. Just other minor point for us, more major point for Market Intelligence, but as a rating agency and with a very large pool of credit analysts using RatingsDirect on CapIQ Pro, we're super excited about the work that Market Intelligence is doing to build out a GenAI interface on RatingsDirect and CapIQ Pro, and we've been helping them do that as well. Thanks for the question.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks, Toni.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Hey good morning everyone. Just wanted to come back to Market Intelligence and the performance there. And I'm particularly interested in the cyclical upside and downside. We obviously all realized that since market came in, the business is a little bit more cyclical. And when I look at this quarter, non-subscription and recurring variable, both up double digits or more than double digits. So it seems like the cyclical side is helping you a little bit already. So can you maybe just talk about where you think you are on the more cyclical elements in that business? And what the biggest things we should still be looking for, i.e., IPO markets opening up, etcetera, to drive cyclical upside even higher, and maybe you can dimensionalize that in terms of revenue potential upsides from as markets open up. Thank you.\nDouglas Peterson: Yes. Thanks, Alex. As you know, we already built in our expectation into the guidance that we gave. But when we look at some of the cyclicality that took place, we grew in the Enterprise Solutions sub segment almost 11%. And this included some revenue that came from some non-subscription revenue, things like we had strong growth in lending solutions and markets. We had very strong growth in regulatory and compliance. And these were -- these are some of the areas that really are driven by volume. If you ask me, what are some of the key factors that we're going to be watching very closely, obviously, interest rates is number one. We gave you our expectation of one interest rate decrease of 25 basis points at the end of the year would be in the fourth quarter, more likely towards the end of the fourth quarter. We see that the markets have different views on that. In the recent earnings calls, a couple of banks show that they would have that they would have up to 3 interest rate declines this year. But we're not including any of that into our own guidance. The other factor we're going to look at quite closely is M&A revenue and M&A activity in the investment banks. M&A is still relatively weak. It's not on a track for what we would normally have seen. It was incredibly strong in 2020, 2021. And ever since then, it's been quite weak. And so we did see some green shoots of M&A activity this quarter, but there's a lot of pent-up capital, a lot of firepower in private credit, in private equity. There's a lot of private equity that's sitting on the sidelines getting ready for exits. There's a lot of M&A activity that's ready, we believe, from corporates. We're going to be looking at how they're going to be managing their own balance sheets and their own capital positions. So it's our view that over time, these are going to be some tailwinds that would benefit us, but that's not built into our guidance for this year. Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the revenue synergy side. Obviously, it seems like you're making very good progress there against your targets. I know going back the last few quarters, we've talked about maybe a little bit more shift from cross-sell to new product development. So just wondering if you could maybe help contextualize a little bit more in terms of the synergies that were recognized during the quarter in terms of new product versus cross-sell? Thanks.\nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Scott. Let me take that and talk about what we're seeing really are important. We still mostly see cross-sell. That's the most important source of our growth, but we are now very successfully launching new products. We had over 21 products that were launched so far this year in Market Intelligence. We have 9 in the Commodity Insights area. And then we have a good pipeline between the rest of the year of another about 15 between those 2 divisions. In Indices, we've launched a series of new approach to providing custom indices using the fixed income and credit indices that were from IHS Markit. But as I said, the cross-sell has been really, really important. We probably underestimated the value and the power of the S&P Global brand. And we also probably underestimated the diversified relationships that we have. If you think about the Financial Services business at IHS Markit, it was a Financial Services business. But at S&P Global, we've always had a very strong corporate business, government, academics, all types of financial services. It's buy side, sell side, it's sovereign wealth funds, etcetera. So we believe that we've had the opportunity to bring that very powerful set of clients, diversified clients and bring them to many, many more products and services for the financial services products. That's been one of the big upsides. But let me just take one step back and point to a couple of things we already talked about. Adding 19.4 million prices, bond prices into CapIQ Pro, that was one of our synergy opportunities. That's something that's tangible. You can see that. We've also had in Commodity Insights a whole new set of products. We talked earlier about ChatAI, which was added to a feature. So that takes what we have from artificial intelligence layered on top of Commodity Insights platform. That platform was a merger of Platts Dimensions Pro and Connect, which was the IHS Markit platform. So there, you can see it everywhere in the company. We're at $199 million run rate. That was $54 million in the quarter, and we're on track. We're actually ahead of track, and we're very, very pleased with that. And so keep asking, and we will keep delivering. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nThomas Roesch: Hi, good morning. This is Tom Roesch on for Andrew. I want to -- in the first quarter, you guys talked about a number of private deals being refinanced in the public markets. I was wondering if you could provide any color on what you saw this quarter in the sense of refis coming from private to public markets. And if you kind of see that trend continuing where more that is coming from the private markets than the public? Thank you.\nMartina Cheung: Hey Tom, this is Martina. Thanks for the question. It's been interesting, certainly some different trends in the two quarters. As you said, we certainly saw more in the first quarter go from private to public. We actually saw going both directions in the second quarter. Some of that we see as being more attractive pricing in the private markets compared to what might have been available in the first quarter. But I think all of this goes to the original thesis and strategy that we've had around private markets, which is, number one, we see this opportunity. We've had a very specific strategy around it. And we have continued to say since Investor Day that we will be ready to serve the debt wherever it comes, whether it's the public market or private markets. And you see that strategy on the private side play out with the results in Q2, the 70% growth in our private market's revenues and Ratings obviously, as well as the broader public market bond rating growth that we've seen on the transaction side as well. So this is a good story for us. These two trends are complementary for us. We've got the right capacity. We've got the right expertise around this, and we feel good about our position to serve the debt either way going forward. Thanks for the question.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So for Rating, one of your competitors guided to high teens growth for the full year, and you have around 14% to 16% growth. I mean it's not that way off, but I'm curious to see if you have done any analysis to try to understand the delta and different assumptions. And also how much impact for your one run rate cut I think at the end of the fourth quarter assumption would impact your Rating revenue guidance? Thanks.\nMartina Cheung: Thanks so much, Owen. As you know, we don't plan with competitors in mind if that's a clear way to say it. We feel very good about the strategy that we set out. Obviously, the over performance comes in a variety of ways. First, it is a very strong market revenues, but we've also been able to meet that demand either because we've had a specific strategy as in the case of private markets, but also in other cases where we've preserved capacity and expertise over the last couple of years, and we can handle additional volumes. So we feel very good about that. I would say overall, our growth rate with the new guidance 14% to 16% reflects a couple of key drivers that Doug highlighted in his remarks. First is that we continue to hear totally from the market that issuers are avoiding, in particular Q4. And so that certainly has a tapering effect on the back half of the year for us overall. I would say we've also -- I think you maybe alluded to this a little bit of a tougher comp in the back half, whether it's lapping that onetime revenue from the second half of last year, but also a very, very strong Q4 from last year. And as Doug said, we'd expect a modest year-over-year decline in Q4. But overall, if you look at the full year, we feel really good about it. It reflects growth not just on the transaction side, but on the key strategic areas, strong performance and growth as reflected in the second quarter, things like our annual fees where we continue to align the value with the economics that we have with the customer and good growth in other areas such as new mandates. So a great story for us overall, I think. Thanks for the question.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks, Owen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Your line is open.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. I believe three months ago, you guys said in Market Intelligence that you've expected to perhaps see some improvements in the growth rates of Market Intelligence revenue in the second half of the year. You obviously have your guidance where you kept flat for the revenue outlook for the full year, given what's happened in the first half of the year. Do you still feel it's possible just given the new products you've cited here?\nDouglas Peterson: Craig, it's possible. As you heard in a couple of questions ago, I talked about some of the potential tailwinds that we could see in the business, whether it's related to rates, to M&A activity, but we don't build the guidance based on wishful thinking. We have to build on what we see, what our expectations are. So the guidance is built right now based on what we see in the market, and that's why we've guided for the top line growth to be consistent where it was the last time we provided guidance. Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi Doug, on MI, could you just tell us directionally how MI organic ACV growth did in the second quarter compared to the organic revenue growth? And with the possibility of acceleration, my question is, is organic ACV growth at MI accelerating?\nDouglas Peterson: Well, we don't report on ACV. It's not a metric that we use. We report on revenue. We -- obviously, we do look at our sales pipelines. And we're very pleased with what I mentioned earlier with the opportunities we see in cross-sell with the power of the brand, with the ability to open doors for new clients. We have a very strong pipeline of innovation that's coming through. We're incredibly pleased with Visible Alpha. I can't just, I almost can gush about it, what the opportunities are there, what it means for our ability to cross-sell because of Visible Alpha. So I think that for us to keep looking forward, this is a really powerful franchise, whether it's in the Desktop area, the data and advisory, the industry research that we're providing. It's in the Enterprise Solutions and then in the Credit & Risk Solutions. We know Credit & Risk Solutions is an area that is in growing demand because of what's happening in the volatility of the market. So across the board, we're quite pleased with our progress. You can also see it from what we're delivering from the synergies. But we don't use ASV. That's not one of the metrics that we use for -- that we report on. Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes, thank you. I just want to make sure there's nothing in Mobility beyond the recall weakness or variability. I get it. The sales growth looks good. Vitality products sound good. But the reason I ask is you also lowered the segment margin guidance. And I know there's a range of products there, but I think a lot of the recall products are lower margin. So I'm just trying to confirm there wasn't a change in the subs booking trajectory or trends from the CDK ran similar impact on some of your clients or anything else? Thank you.\nChristopher Craig: Thanks for your question. Well, for sure, when we look at the subscription growth, it's actually been tremendous this quarter. When you look back, 81% of the revenue is driven out of subscription growth, and that grew 10.5%. In terms of the recall activities, actually very high-margin business that comes through. So when we do see that loss and slowdown in the recall, that actually does impact margins fairly significantly.\nDouglas Peterson: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Silber: Thanks so much. I know you don't provide specific guidance by quarter, but I was wondering if you can provide any color between what you're expecting 3Q, 4Q, anything to call out? You mentioned you expect a decline in issuance in the fourth quarter, but anything else on the revenue or expense line, that will be helpful for us. Thank you.\nDouglas Peterson: As you mentioned, we don't provide guidance by quarter. You already mentioned the one thing that we've seen, which relates to some issuance potentially between the third and fourth quarter. But there's nothing else. Chris, do you want to add anything?\nChristopher Craig: No, nothing else.\nDouglas Peterson: Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\nRussell Quelch: Yes, hi guys. In Commodity Insights, this is the fourth quarter of double-digit top line growth. The midpoint of the guidance implies 6.7% growth for H2. So I'm wondering why you're expecting such a strong slowdown in H2 in Commodity Insights. It seems much more than a tough comp. And if I look at seasonality, it's normally the other way around in the second half is normally stronger than the first half. So can you just address that for me, please?\nDouglas Peterson: Yes. Let me mention, first of all, Commodity Insights has had a really good run. It's an important area for the global markets. You see that everywhere we go, kind of every single conversation I ever have, we're talking about energy transition. We're talking about ESG. We're talking about what's happening the future of metals, mining. As you see, we launched some new products related to egg [ph], beef and poultry benchmarks. But when you look at the overall dynamic in the business, we've had a really, really strong performance in the advisory and transaction services area. It grew at 32% in the quarter. This is an area that is -- it's more volume driven. It's transaction driven. We don't want to necessarily project for the rest of the year that, that kind of level of transaction services is going to continue. So we've guided to the level which is more of a blend of the rates coming from upstream, from price assessments, from energy resources and Data and Insight. So that's what you can see the difference that brought us back down to a level from the 8% to 9%. Thanks, Russell.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Just a big picture question on terms of when you put together guidance overall, how do you think about visibility in the current environment relative to maybe where it's been in years past? Is client behavior a bit more difficult to project across some of the different line items? Or how should we think about the quality of the forecast at this point?\nDouglas Peterson: Well, I think that's half a year left. We believe that we've got a pretty good view on what the pipeline is for the rest of the year. As I mentioned throughout, there are certain factors which are maybe a little bit more market driven like interest rates and M&A. There's always going to be uncertainty around that. We have to work closely with our analysts that are close to the market. There's analysts that are working all the time with the buy side, the sell side. We get feedback from them. We also have relationships directly with bankers to understand what they're seeing in their pipelines of debt capital markets, equity capital markets, M&A. So we have an informal and formal way to gather information to use for our guidance for the rest of the year, and we look very carefully at that. And it's something that we've built into this year. You see the results of that. Overall, we're incredibly pleased with where we are. But with that, Surinder, thank you very much for joining the call. And let me wrap it up and close the call. And I want to thank everyone again for joining the call today and for your questions. I also want to thank Martina for joining us. Martina, thank you very much for being on the call. I want to congratulate her here, she's in the room, for appointment as the next CEO of S&P Global. At the next earnings call, you're going to hear a lot more about the transition, which is starting to take place, and it's going incredibly well. I also want to thank all of our people, as always. We have tremendous people in this company that delivered a strong quarter. We've got incredible, really good initiatives that we're developing and delivering in energy transition, sustainability with private markets, with generative AI. We continue to make great progress on our synergies from the merger, and we're very pleased with all of that. So I also hope that everybody gets a little bit of time this summer. So enjoy some time over the summer, and I look forward to seeing everyone on the next call. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about two hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&P Global's website for one year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for one month. On behalf of S&P Global, we thank you for participating, and wish you a good day.",

            "name": "Chris Craig",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. We finished the second quarter of 2024 with exceptional performance across the entire company, with three of five divisions achieving double-digit growth in both revenue and operating profit. Reported revenue grew by 14% year-over-year to a record $3.5 billion in the second quarter. And while parts of our market-driven businesses benefited from the tailwinds Doug highlighted earlier, we are also seeing strong performance across strategic investment areas, which I'll touch on shortly. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 30% year-over-year to $4.04. This was driven by a combination of our strong revenue growth, margin expansion of 450 basis points, and a 2% reduction in fully diluted share count. Now, turning to strategic investment areas, where I'm pleased to report we saw growth accelerate across all initiatives. Sustainability and Energy Transition revenue grew 23% to $87 million in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Commodity Insights Energy Transition Advisory Services and subscription offerings. Our Sustainable1 team continues to expand the company's sustainability and energy transition offerings, while leveraging cross-divisional industry expertise to provide our customers with broader solutions. In Private Market Solutions, revenue increased by 26% to $134 million. Growth was driven by debt, bank loan, and CLO ratings, and demand for our private market solutions within market intelligence, which includes products like Qval and iLEVEL. For revenue synergies, we exited the second quarter with an annualized run rate of $199 million. During the quarter, we recognized $54 million in revenue synergies, which came from a mix of cross-sell activity and revenue generated from new products. Turning to our divisions, Market Intelligence revenue increased 7% in the second quarter. Desktop grew 6% or 2% when excluding the impact from the Visible Alpha acquisition. Growth in the quarter was impacted by the continued softness in the financial services end market that we've highlighted previously. Nevertheless, we're focused on adding value for our customers by improving performance and introducing new content and capabilities, including the recent integration of markets' fixed income securities data. Data Advisory Solutions grew 6%, driven by expanded coverage and continued investment in the high-growth areas of our market data and valuations and industry and company data product offerings. Enterprise solutions grew 11% as loan platforms such as ClearPar and our primary markets group were beneficiaries of stronger equity and debt capital market activity in the quarter. For modeling purposes, it's important to note that the enterprise solutions business line includes Fincentric. Credit and risk solutions grew 5% due to demand for our RatingsExpressed and RatingsDirect distribution platforms in North America and Europe. RatingsDirect is also benefiting from user adoption of Capital IQ Pro. Adjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in compensation and the impact of the Visible Alpha acquisition. Partially offset by reduction in expenses associated with headcount and outside services. Operating profit increased 9% and operating margin increased 60 basis points to 32.9%. Trailing 12-month margins expanded 90 basis points to 33.3%. Now turning to Ratings where we saw exceptional revenue growth of 33% which exceeded our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew by 63% in the second quarter, fueled by increased bank loan and bond issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 9%, primarily due to an increase in annual fee revenue and an increase in new mandates, particularly from the return of high-yield issuers. Adjusted expenses increased 8%, driven by higher compensation, including incentives, as well as investments in strategic initiatives. This resulted in a 52% increase in operating profit and an 810 basis point increase in operating margin to 65.8%. For the trailing 12 months, Ratings margin expanded 570 basis points to 60.9%. And now, turning to Commodity Insights, revenue increased 12%, driven by strong performance across all business lines, with price assessments and Energy and Resources Data and Insights both growing at double digits. Notably, this marks the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our Price Assessments business. Price Assessments and Energy and Resources Data and Insights grew 11% and 12% respectively. Both businesses benefited from strong performance in crude and refined products. In addition, we continue to see favorable commercial conditions across both segments, including strong subscription sales across Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Advisory and Transactional services had an exceptional quarter, with revenue growing 32% or 27% when excluding the impact from the World Hydrogen Leaders acquisition. This is driven by strong trading volumes across key sectors in global trading services and a pickup in consulting activity, particularly for energy transition-related initiatives. Upstream Data and Insights revenue grew by 5% year-over-year, benefiting from meaningful contribution from organic investments, including our Upstream Energy Transition offerings, as well as continued improvement in retention rates. For the full year, we expect low single-digit growth for Upstream. Adjusted expenses increased 8% due to higher compensation costs, ongoing investments in growth initiatives, and the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 16%, and operating margin improved by 170 basis points to 47.3%. Trailing 12-month margin increased by 130 basis points to 46.8%. Now, turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year, or 9% when excluding the impact of the divestiture of the after-sales business. Dealer revenue increased 11% year-over-year, driven by new business growth in products such as new car listings and continued success in CARFAX. Manufacturing declined modestly by 1%, driven by a decrease in one-time transaction revenue, particularly in our recall business, which can fluctuate based on the level of recall activity in any given period. This was partially offset by another strong quarter of subscription sales. Financials & Other increased 13% as the business line benefited from historically high underwriting volumes. Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to planned investments in strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expense. This resulted in operating profit increasing by 10% for the quarter, and operating margin improving by 60 basis points to 40.9%. Trailing 12-month margin contracted by 10 basis points to 38.8%. Now, turning to S&P Dow Jones indices. Revenue increased 12%, primarily due to strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM and growth in our data and custom subscriptions offerings. Asset-linked fees were up 16%, driven by market appreciation and inflows. Impressively, the Global ETF market saw record inflows in excess of $300 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, highlighting the continued shift to passive investing and opportunities for future growth. Exchange-Traded derivatives revenue grew 4%, primarily driven by strong volumes across our equity complex products. Data and custom subscriptions increased 6% year-over-year, driven by new business growth in end-of-day contracts and real-time data. Expenses increased 4% year-over-year, driven by investments in strategic growth initiatives and an increase in incentive compensation expense. Indices operating profit increased 15% and impressively operating margin expanded by 210 basis points to 70.7%. On a trailing 12-month basis, indices operating margin expanded by 150 basis points to 69.8%. Looking at the quarter holistically, we saw broad strength across the business. Market factors like issuance volumes and asset price appreciation contributes to strong growth in our market driven businesses. And our subscription business lines benefited from the continuing investment in our differentiated data, content, and workflow capabilities. We are pleased with the profitable growth delivered by the combination of strong customer demand and disciplined execution in the quarter. And with that, I will now turn it back to Doug to discuss our outlook for the second half of the year. Doug?"

            "name": "Martina Cheung",
            "content": "Hi, George. It's Martina. Thanks so much for the question. I would say we saw growth in the build issuance outlook for the full year across all categories, but I would say accelerated growth in high yield and bank loan ratings. We did see very strong issuance in the first half in investment grade, but that was characterized more by an acceleration in Q1, slightly tapering off in Q2. A lot of that refinancing activity in investment grade was done last year and in Q1. So a bit of a taper off there overall. Some more modest expectations for investment grade for the full year. High yield at BLR, very strong growth. I would say maybe a couple of sub-asset classes to highlight. CLOs is expected to have a very strong year from an issuance standpoint, for example, and a number of other sub-asset classes in structured finance that are seeing quite a bit of growth, for example, data center securitizations. Hope that helps. Thanks for the question. Yes. Great. Thanks, Doug. Thanks for the question. I would say in Ratings that we've had, like most other organizations, dozens of pilots underway. We're very excited overall about the potential for GenAI to improve quality, to create efficiency and time to market for our core Ratings business. And one example I thought would be interesting is what you've mentioned in the past that we had focused in on a tool to help our CLO credit analyst with making sense of very complex CLO documentation. And that proved to be fortuitous, given the very, very busy year that we've seen so far in CLOs. And we're excited about this tool which we're deploying out into production for our analysts over the second half of the year and its ability to help save time for the analysts so they can focus in on the important jobs of getting the ratings done. Just other minor point for us, more major point for Market Intelligence, but as a rating agency and with a very large pool of credit analysts using RatingsDirect on CapIQ Pro, we're super excited about the work that Market Intelligence is doing to build out a GenAI interface on RatingsDirect and CapIQ Pro, and we've been helping them do that as well. Thanks for the question. Hey Tom, this is Martina. Thanks for the question. It's been interesting, certainly some different trends in the two quarters. As you said, we certainly saw more in the first quarter go from private to public. We actually saw going both directions in the second quarter. Some of that we see as being more attractive pricing in the private markets compared to what might have been available in the first quarter. But I think all of this goes to the original thesis and strategy that we've had around private markets, which is, number one, we see this opportunity. We've had a very specific strategy around it. And we have continued to say since Investor Day that we will be ready to serve the debt wherever it comes, whether it's the public market or private markets. And you see that strategy on the private side play out with the results in Q2, the 70% growth in our private market's revenues and Ratings obviously, as well as the broader public market bond rating growth that we've seen on the transaction side as well. So this is a good story for us. These two trends are complementary for us. We've got the right capacity. We've got the right expertise around this, and we feel good about our position to serve the debt either way going forward. Thanks for the question. Thanks so much, Owen. As you know, we don't plan with competitors in mind if that's a clear way to say it. We feel very good about the strategy that we set out. Obviously, the over performance comes in a variety of ways. First, it is a very strong market revenues, but we've also been able to meet that demand either because we've had a specific strategy as in the case of private markets, but also in other cases where we've preserved capacity and expertise over the last couple of years, and we can handle additional volumes. So we feel very good about that. I would say overall, our growth rate with the new guidance 14% to 16% reflects a couple of key drivers that Doug highlighted in his remarks. First is that we continue to hear totally from the market that issuers are avoiding, in particular Q4. And so that certainly has a tapering effect on the back half of the year for us overall. I would say we've also -- I think you maybe alluded to this a little bit of a tougher comp in the back half, whether it's lapping that onetime revenue from the second half of last year, but also a very, very strong Q4 from last year. And as Doug said, we'd expect a modest year-over-year decline in Q4. But overall, if you look at the full year, we feel really good about it. It reflects growth not just on the transaction side, but on the key strategic areas, strong performance and growth as reflected in the second quarter, things like our annual fees where we continue to align the value with the economics that we have with the customer and good growth in other areas such as new mandates. So a great story for us overall, I think. Thanks for the question."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Doug Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. S&P Global delivered an incredible first half in 2024 as the second quarter saw accelerated revenue growth, significant margin expansion, and the highest quarterly adjusted EPS in our company's history. Total revenue increased 16%, excluding the divestiture of engineering solutions. Transaction revenue in our ratings division continues to drive significant outperformance at more than 60% growth. The revenue from all our subscription products across the company also increased 8% year-over-year in the second quarter despite some of the market headwins that are common across our industry this year. We delivered 450 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year and 30% growth in EPS as we captured market demand and contained our expense growth. As you saw last month, we also announced our CEO succession plan which I'll discuss in a moment. We've been cultivating more than just our leaders at S&P Global and we're pleased with the product innovation coming to the market in the second quarter. The June release of CapIQ Pro included significant enhancements, and we launched new benchmarks and commodity insights. We continue to accelerate our deployment of generative AI and launch new capabilities both at the division and enterprise level. We also continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses and products, with Visible Alpha closing in the second quarter and the recent signing of an agreement to divest Fincentric, which we expect to close in the third quarter. We're excited that we get to cover key developments in each of our five strategic pillars this quarter, beginning with our customers. S&P Global rated more than $1 trillion of billed issuance in the second quarter. Growth was diversified across public and private markets, as private market participants increasingly turned to S&P Global for expertise in assessing credit risk. Revenue from rating services in the private markets increased more than 70% year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to create new products from the combined data sets and solutions of S&P Global and IHS Market to create incremental value for our customers. In the second quarter, we achieved nearly $200 million of annualized run rate revenue synergies. As Chris will discuss in a moment, this puts us ahead of the pace to achieve the $350 million in revenue synergies we're targeting in 2026. It's remarkable that we're able to deliver these strong results despite the well-known market headwinds that continue to impact pockets of our business. Our diverse customer base and broad product portfolio provide for more stable financial performance for the company overall, as headwinds can often be offset by tailwinds. As an example, while renewal rates were slightly lower than last year in market intelligence this quarter, renewal rates were slightly higher than last year in commodity insights. These market dynamics are not unexpected, and the financial impact was largely included in our initial guidance. Despite macroeconomic cyclicality, we continue to find ways to help our customers achieve their goals using our differentiated data and product offerings. This ability to align our product innovation and investment with customer needs was further demonstrated in the second quarter by the acceleration in revenue growth from our private market solutions and our sustainability and energy transition offerings. Turning back to billed issuance, it increased 54% year-over-year in the second quarter. We continue to see tight credit spreads contributing to favorable market conditions. We also saw modest improvement in some of the important macroeconomic indicators, particularly in North America, that have lent strength to the issuance environment. We continue to see particular strength in bank loans and structured finance, along with robust growth in high-yield investment-grade bonds. Refinancing activity was very strong in the quarter as we saw a pull forward of issuance from investment-grade issuers refinancing 2024 maturities, as well as speculative-grade issuers refinancing 2024 and future-year maturities. This leaves some uncertainty around the back half as we wait to see how much of the out-year refinancings get pulled into 2024. This continues to inform our view that the second half will be softer than the first half in terms of billed issuance and transaction revenue in our ratings business. With the timing and likelihood of any rate cuts in the U.S. market still uncertain, our base case still assumes a modest year-over-year decline in issuance in the fourth quarter. Turning to Vitality, newer enhanced products generated $375 million in the second quarter. This represents 11% of our total revenue and an improvement from the 10% we reported last quarter. Key contributors to our Vitality Index are unchanged from last quarter as we see strong demand for CARFAX listings and the CARFAX Banking and Insurance Group. We also see strong growth in energy transition and climate products from our Commodity Insights Division and Sustainable Bonds from Ratings. As you'll recall from last quarter, key contributors from our pricing valuations and reference data, as well as several thematic and factor-based indices, matured out of the Vitality Index at the end of the year. We're encouraged by the continued acceleration and the pace of innovation of S&P Global and look forward to maintaining our Vitality Index at or above the 10% target. As we look to examples of that innovation, a common thread running through many of the products we're bringing to market is our enterprise expertise in generative AI. In the second quarter, we launched ChatAI on Platts Connect. Launched as a new platform combining Platts Dimensions Pro with IHS Connect, the Platts Connect platform provides access to a truly massive amount of data, research, and insights to power the global commodity markets. With the depth and breadth of information in the platform, we new users would need an intuitive way to navigate and find the information that would be critical to their daily workflows. ChatAI is a powerful customer tool developed through a partnership of Kensho and Commodity Insights that uses generative AI models to provide real-time responses to conversational user queries to help them quickly find the necessary data to make informed, faster decisions. In addition to this AI-powered interface, Commodity Insights continues to bring new benchmark Price Assessments to market. Our Platts team introduced five daily Price Assessments for beef and four daily Price Assessments for poultry, as well as a new report with up-to-date coverage of the protein's market. These continue to broaden and strengthen our position in agriculture commodities. We also continue to scale new functionality in our differentiated energy transition offerings. We significantly enhanced our global integrated energy model in the second quarter, which now enables modeling and scenario building for energy demand in over 140 countries using deep data sets going back more than 30 years. With our enterprise focus on artificial intelligence, we've continued to develop internal tools, including new functionality in the S&P Spark Assist platform we introduced earlier this year. Approximately 14,000 of our people are using Spark Assist internally after just a few short months. As we shared with you last quarter, this platform is designed to be cost effective, vendor agnostic, highly scalable, and secure by design. By encouraging collaboration across the enterprise, we're able to quickly iterate on time-saving use cases and share those developments across the company. We're already seeing users leverage S&P Spark Assist to optimize code, rewrite configuration files for software migrations, and summarize complex documents. We've also used it to aggregate and digest feedback and ideas that we receive through our employee engagement surveys in town halls, empowering leadership to more effectively act on what matters the most to our people. We believe this crowd-sourced approach to developing tools shortens the time to discover and develop new applications using GenAI models. Leveraging LLMs from multiple sources allows us to benefit from the rapid innovation taking place across the technology ecosystem without being locked into a single vendor. Lastly, the June release of CapIQ Pro brought powerful enhancements to the platform that we believe will strengthen our competitive position and create meaningful value for our customers. We fully integrated the fixed income data from IHS market, which brings data on more than 19 million government agency and corporate fixed income securities and makes it readily available through the CapIQ Pro platform. This was a tremendous undertaking made possible through the merger that will benefit our existing customers and help potential customers more easily see the incredible value in CapIQ Pro. The June release also included a complete reimagining of the charting and visualization capabilities within CapIQ Pro, deploying the technology and expertise that came to us through the Chart IQ acquisition. Back to the theme of generative AI. We also introduced transcript summarization within CapIQ Pro. This new tool was built organically and not only provides a quick summary of earnings calls, it also organizes topics and sentiment and empowers the user to immediately click through and find the direct quotes behind the summaries. And it's built on a foundation of Scribe developed by Kensho four years ago. I want to take a moment to discuss an important acquisition that closed in second quarter. Visible Alpha is well known and highly respected among both our customers and our investors. And we're excited to see the progress the market intelligence team has already made since closing the deal in May. Visible Alpha compiles highly detailed financial models via direct feed from over 200 contributing brokers. With over 6,000 contributing analysts including most of the analysts joining us on this call, Visible Alpha has the most detailed and comprehensive consensus estimates available anywhere in the world. We frequently hear from customers that they could not do their jobs without it. S&P Global's position as a trusted partner across the financial markets is opening doors for visible health and private equity, banking and consulting, and driving further penetration and asset management and research. Leveraging the strength of S&P Global's relationships, brand and commercial teams, we've already seen a 5% increase in number of contributing brokers in just the last three months. In addition, we've generated over 150 sales leads and closed 10 deals already. We've seen numerous opportunities to leverage the Visible Alpha Platform in conjunction with the differentiated datasets throughout S&P Global to create unique, deep sector content. We look forward to sharing new developments in the coming quarters. Now, turning to a very exciting announcement we made in the second quarter that fittingly comes under our four strategic pillars, Lead and Inspire. In June, we announced that I will be retiring from my role as President and CEO of S&P Global effective November 1st. Martina Cheung, the President of Ratings and Sponsor of Sustainable1, will become the 11th CEO of S&P Global since we were listed on the New York Stock Exchange over 90 years ago. We are very pleased to see our succession plan work the way it was designed, with development of strong internal leaders resulting in a unanimous decision from our board of directors. I'm focused on delivering strong results over the next few months as I work with Martina on a comprehensive transition plan before she takes over November. As you might have seen, I'll stay on the board until the next shareholders meeting and on as an advisor until the end of 2025. Martina has already joined the board of directors and is working hard to get ready for November. We will have more to say on the transition next quarter, but it's been wonderful to see the outpouring of support and appreciation for Martina from customers, employees, and shareholders. Turning to our financial results, with strong growth across every division, we continue to meet increasing market demand while maintaining expense discipline. We saw accelerating revenue growth in the quarter, and on a trailing 12-month basis, we have expanded our operating margin by 300 basis points. Now let me turn to Chris Craig, our interim CFO, to review the financial results. Chris, over to you. Thank you, Chris. Our financial guidance assumes Global GDP growth of 3.3%. U.S. inflation is 3% and an average price for Brent crude of $84 per barrel. We continue to see fluctuations in the market expectations for rate cuts. Though our base case still assumes there'll be one rate cut in the U.S. in the second half of 2024. While the macroeconomic indicators that help inform our guidance are very similar to last quarter, we're significantly raising our financial outlook for the full year. We're increasing our build issuance forecasts for 2024 by nearly 20 percentage points. Given the dramatic increase in issuance in the first half, we now expect growth in build issuance to be approximately 25% compared to our prior range of 6% to 10%. In our most recent study of debt financing, we examined the volume of debt set to mature over the next several years. We're presenting this data in a slightly different way than we have in the past in the hopes it's more easily interpreted by analysts and investors. Here, we compare the amount of S&P global rated debt set to mature over the next six months, 18 months, and so on out more than seven years as of July 1st in each of the last three years. As you can see, there is very little debt set to mature over the second half of 2024, though this is consistent with what we've seen in prior years. On a cumulative basis, the maturity walls coming over the next several years gives us confidence in the long-term strength of our business. Though the timing of that refinancing activity remains difficult to predict on a quarter-by-quarter basis, all of these factors impact our new full-year guidance calling for higher growth, stronger margins, and substantial generation of free cash. This slide illustrates our current guidance for GAAP results. We're once again raising our enterprise outlook for the full year on all headline metrics given the strength of the second quarter and our improved outlook for the second half. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 125 basis points to 175 basis points, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $14.35 to $14.60, representing a $0.50 increase from our prior guidance. Additional details on our consolidated financial guidance can be found on our press release, but I also wanted to note that we've increased our guidance for adjusted free cash flow to approximately $4.7 billion, up $200 million from our prior guidance, and reflecting the strong results year-to-date. Moving toward division outlook, our revenue guidance for Market Intelligence is unchanged, and we continue to expect revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7.5%. This guidance reflects the contribution from Visible Alpha, which closed in May, largely offset by the loss of revenue following the divestiture of Fincentric later this quarter. Importantly for models, Visible Alpha is reported in the desktop business line for Market Intelligence, which should accelerate on a reported basis in the second half, while Fincentric is reported in the enterprise solutions business, which should see a corresponding deceleration in the second half following the divestiture, particularly in the fourth quarter. We're raising our outlook for Ratings Business substantially, following the second quarter performance. We still expect the second half to be softer than the first, reflecting normal seasonality, but exacerbated by the level of pull forward that we believe took place thus far this year. For the second half, the favorable market conditions and improved visibility and form a slightly more optimistic view around the third quarter in a modest year-over-year decline in both build issuance and ratings transaction revenue in the fourth quarter. Our revenue guidance for commodity insights is unchanged. We're slightly lowering and tightening the guidance range from ability revenue growth. As we noted last quarter in this morning, the recall business has been abnormally soft year-to-date, and we expect that softness to continue in the second half. The recall business is non-recurring and difficult to predict, but the lowered outlook means that the remainder of the revenue is more predictable, recurring subscription, which gives us confidence in the tighter range of 8% to 9% revenue growth compared to the prior range of 8.5% to 10%. We've also seen significant outperformance in our indices division in the first half, and we're raising our guidance again. We now expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12%, up from 9% to 11%. Importantly, this guidance assumes market levels are essentially flat from levels at the end of June. Turning to our margin outlook, for Market Intelligence, while the revenue impacts from Visible Alpha and Fincentric, are largely offsetting, the net impact is expected to be modestly dilutive to margins in 2024. As such, we're lowering the margin guidance for Market Intelligence to a range of 33% to 34%. For Ratings, we're raising the margin guidance by 100 basis points to reflect the strong revenue outperformance, partially offset by higher expected incentive compensation expense. Commodity Insights margin guidance is unchanged. For Mobility, given our expectations for softer revenue from the recall business, we now expect margins in the division to be slightly lower in the range of 38.5% to 39.5%, down 50 basis points from prior guidance. Our margin expectations for Indices are unchanged despite the higher expected revenue growth as we plan to continue investing to position the business for growth through 2024 and beyond. With that, I'd like to invite Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Mark? Thanks, George. Yes. So let me start with what we're seeing thematically. As you know and as Chris mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've seen massive flows from active to passive. That continues to be a trend. And within that space, a lot of the flows go to U.S. equities. And within U.S. equities, S&P, Dow Jones indexes picks up the bulk of that. So you've seen that coming through last quarter in terms of volume. There was also some increase in the value, the AUM value. So we benefited from that with the 16% growth in the asset linked fees. As some of those fees are going to be seen on a lagged basis. So we expect that we built into our guidance the expectation that the market was going to remain flat for the rest of the year. But we would see some increases, those average flows continue to come through the rest of the year. In terms of themes, we continue to see a lot of interest in different types of asset classes. So within even the asset class of the S&P 500 large cap U.S., we've had new partnerships with some large asset managers with new types of S&P 500 funds. The S&P 500 quality, the S&P 500 economic ETF. We also see a lot of innovation around fixed income and credit through the Cboe iBoxx emerging market bond index. We've also seen some really interesting new products coming out that bring in mid-cap using our indices, the Vanguard S&P Global 1200 ADR. So across the board, we're seeing a lot of new interest, asset classes. Another one which we want to mention very briefly relates to the private markets and private credit. This is an area where we have a lead. We already have strong positions in private credit indices. And we'll be building that out much more as we take advantage of this asset class, which has a lot of interest in the market. Thanks, Faiza."

[Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Mark Grant, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for S&P Global. Sir, you may begin. \nMark Grant: Good morning, and thank you for joining today's S&P Global First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Presenting on today's call are Doug Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Craig, Interim Chief Financial Officer. For the Q&A portion of today's call, we will also be joined by Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings.  \n We issued a press release with our results earlier today.

However, this call is intended for investors, and we would ask that questions from the media be directed to our Media Relations team whose contact information can be found in the release.  \n At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Doug Peterson. Doug? \nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Mark. S&P Global is off to a tremendous start for 2024. Total revenue increased 14%, excluding the divestiture of Engineering Solutions. Transaction revenue in our Ratings division drove much of the upside, but importantly, subscription revenue across the entire company increased 8% year-over-year as well.  \n Strong growth across the enterprise contributed to quarterly revenue of nearly $3.5 billion, representing the highest quarterly revenue we've ever generated in the history of our company. Execution was its theme in the first quarter. And our efforts to capture market opportunities, combined with discipline on the expense side, led to more than 350 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year and adjusted EPS growth of 27%.  \n In addition to the stellar financial results in the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate our leadership across global markets. Capital markets were vibrant in the first quarter, and customers turned to S&P Global to help power their investment, funding and trading activities.  \n Equity markets saw strong volumes from both IPOs and M&A. And we saw the highest level of debt issuance since 2021. As the globe grapples with the future of energy security and energy transition, it's no coincidence that this conversation took place on the stage of S&P Global CERAWeek conference and other S&P events around the world.  \n As we Power Global Markets in equity, fixed income, commodities, derivatives and in many industrial verticals, our innovation drives customer value. We'll continue to innovate and invest in our leading data, technology and workflow tools to drive growth, and we'll highlight some of that innovation today.  \n As we look to the 5 strategic pillars we outlined for you at our Investor Day, we're pleased with the progress we've made across the board. While that fifth pillar of execute and deliver is on full display this quarter with the strength of our financial results, we continue to invest in customer relationships, innovation, technology and our people.  \n Beginning with our customers. We saw nearly $1 trillion of billed issuance in the first quarter. This represents the dollar value of debt issued by our customers for which they actively sought out a rating from S&P Global. Issuers know that an S&P Global rating provides a credible, trusted and objective measure of their credit risk, and they know that we have the capacity, even in a very active market, to fully meet their needs.  \n When we look at the broader financial services landscape, we're certainly not back to what we would consider normal levels in the capital markets overall, but we did see improvement. With the macro and geopolitical uncertainties still facing our customers through this year, we continue to hear some concern about the back half, and many market participants are still carefully evaluating expenses for 2024. All of this is consistent with what we shared in February regarding our expectation that Ratings would see a stronger first half than second half, while Market Intelligence would likely start to see improvements in the growth rates in the back half. \n Energy customers from all of our divisions and from around the globe converged once again in Houston, Texas for our annual CERAWeek conference. We're thrilled that customers, partners, regulators, government officials and global thought leaders view S&P Global's CERAWeek as the premier event of the year.  \n Customer engagement remains vital for S&P Global. And in the first quarter, we had well over 100,000 calls and meetings with customers in addition to the thousands of meaningful interactions our Ratings colleagues had with fixed income investors.  \n Billed issuance increased 45% year-over-year in the first quarter. Tight spreads and stabilizing risk appetite in the market created favorable conditions for issuers. We saw investment-grade, high-yield and bank loan volumes all increased as issuers took full advantage to raise debt early in the year. We do expect much of this strength was pull-forward from later in 2024, reinforcing our continued view of a stronger first half than second half in issuance volumes.  \n The strength in billed issuance in the quarter also underscored the importance and advantages of a robust public debt market. We saw tremendous growth over the last 2 years in private debt markets, but we began to see early signs of some of that debt being refinanced in the public markets in the first quarter. While this private-to-public refinancing activity only represented a low single-digit percent of billed issuance, we've heard from customers that they're saving up to 150 to 200 basis points in their interest rates by refinancing to public markets. \n We expect the private markets to play an important role going forward as well, and we're working with major private debt partners to deliver risk analytical solutions. Private markets revenue in our Ratings division increased 30% year-over-year in the first quarter.  \n Turning to Vitality. We're pleased to see that our Vitality Index continues to account for 10% of our total revenue despite the fact that several strong and fast-growing products matured out of Vitality Index at the end of 2023. As we've called out in the past, this index is meant to highlight the contributions from new or enhanced products. So as products mature, they will no longer be part of the Vitality Index even if they continue to grow rapidly.  \n Key contributors were pricing, valuations and reference data, as well as several thematic and factor-based indices, matured out of the Vitality Index at the end of the year. We remain committed to that 10% target as a steady stream of new innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. That was the case this quarter as products that contributed roughly $80 million of revenue to the Vitality Index in the first quarter of 2023 were no longer in the Vitality Index this quarter. We expect the Vitality Index to increase as a percent of total revenue as we progress through the remainder of the year.  \n Turning to some examples of that innovation. In the first quarter, our Commodity Insights team launched a new food and agriculture commodities dashboard, providing a comprehensive view on commodity data as well as new reports and research on energy. Additionally, we launched new price assessments for renewable energy as well as new benchmark prices for the Middle East and Asia. Our energy transition and climate products continued to show rapid growth, nearly 30% year-over-year in the first quarter, supported by the continued innovation in price assessments, new and enhanced data sets and crucial insights solutions.  \n We also introduced an exciting innovation in Market Intelligence. We've spoken at length about the tools and data sets available through our Market Intelligence Marketplace. But in the first quarter, we introduced what we are calling Blueprints. These Blueprints are packages of data sets and tools combined based on specific customer personas and workflows, such as private markets performance analytics. We introduced the first 5 Blueprints in the first quarter with plans to add more in the coming months. These intuitive combinations allow customers to easily discover how our data and tools can work together to facilitate analytics and workflows in new ways.  \n We're also pleased to see early results from the enterprise AI initiatives we outlined for you last quarter. By elevating artificial intelligence to a position of enterprise-wide strategic focus, we're accelerating the development of new tools, deploying common capabilities across multiple divisions and increasing the value we create for our customers and our shareholders. With our in-house expertise, we've developed tools to help market participants benchmark performance of large language models, specifically for business and finance use cases. \n The S&P AI benchmarks by Kensho is a project informed by our world-class data and industry expertise. The questions in our benchmark are designed to assess the ability of large language models to understand and solve realistic finance problems, and each question has been verified by an experienced domain expert.  \n Lastly, we introduced a remarkable tool we call S&P Spark Assist. This is a copilot platform developed jointly between Kensho and our other internal technology teams. We're deploying this platform throughout the organization to improve productivity, facilitate more rapid innovation and reduce the time necessary to accomplish many routine tasks.  \n Because of our proprietary data, the tools and expertise developed through Kensho and remarkable technologists we are working throughout S&P Global, we were able to develop S&P Spark Assist chat interface without relying on a third-party vendor. As a result, we're delivering the power of generative AI to our people in an easy-to-use platform at the cost of less than $1 per user per month. We're incredibly excited about what this tool can do for our people, and we'll provide more details around use cases and productivity as we progress through the year.  \n Turning to our financial results. Chris will walk through the first quarter results in more detail in a moment, but we have had an incredible start to 2024. With strong growth across every division, we continue to balance the need to invest for future growth with the opportunity to deliver margin expansion and earnings growth this year.  \n Revenue grew double digits as reported. But excluding the impact from the Engineering Solutions divestiture, revenue increased an impressive 14%. Trailing 12-month margins improved 170 basis points to nearly 47%.  \n Now I'll turn to Chris Craig, our interim CFO, to review the financial results. Chris, welcome to the call. Over to you. \nChristopher Craig: Thank you, Doug. 2024 got off to a strong start as we saw 3 of 5 divisions achieve double-digit growth. As Doug mentioned, reported revenue grew 10% in the first quarter. And excluding the impact of the Engineering Solutions divestiture, revenue growth was 14%.  \n Adjusted expenses grew by only 3% year-over-year as we continue to focus on disciplined execution and benefiting from the Engineering Solutions divestiture. Strong growth and solid execution combined to deliver more than 350 basis points of adjusted margin expansion in the quarter. With our commitment to capital returns over the last 12 months, we've reduced the fully diluted share count by 3% year-over-year. This led to adjusted earnings per share increasing by 27% year-over-year to $4.01.  \n Now turning to strategic investment areas. Sustainability & Energy Transition revenue grew 15% to $78 million in the quarter driven by strong demand for Commodity Insights, energy transition products and benchmark offerings as well as EV transition-related consulting in Mobility. We are continuing to invest in our energy transition offerings where we see opportunities across our divisions.  \n Moving to Private Market Solutions. Revenue increased by 16% year-over-year to $116 million. Growth was driven by debt and bank loan ratings as well as continued strength in iLEVEL and other Private Market Solutions within Market Intelligence.  \n We continue to build momentum in our revenue synergies and are ahead of schedule toward our $350 million target. We exited the first quarter with an annualized run rate of $184 million. During the first quarter alone, we recognized $56 million in revenue synergies. While the majority of this was from cross-sell initiatives, we are beginning to gain traction with new products as well. As of the end of Q1, we have launched 25 new products through our revenue synergy initiatives, and we plan to launch more than 15 additional synergy products by the end of 2024.  \n Turning to our divisions. Market Intelligence revenue increased 7% in the first quarter with all business lines growing in the mid- to high single-digit range. Desktop grew 5% as we continue to focus on speed, performance improvements and the introduction of new content and capabilities, including the expansion of our collection of premium broker research providers within aftermarket research. Data & Advisory Solutions grew 7% driven by expanded coverage and continued investment in high-growth areas of our company information and analytics and market data and valuation product offerings. Enterprise Solutions benefited from an increase in issuance volumes in the debt and equity capital markets and grew over 8% in the quarter. Credit & Risk Solutions grew 6%, supported by strong new sales and price realization, particularly for RatingsXpress subscriptions. \n We saw solid growth in Market Intelligence in Q1 that was in line with our expectations and consistent with what we signaled on our fourth quarter earnings call. Adjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, cloud costs and royalties, partially offset by a reduction in outside services expense. Operating profit increased 9%, and the operating margin increased 70 basis points to 32.7%. Trailing 12-month margins expanded 50 basis points to 33.1%.  \n Now turning to Ratings. As Doug mentioned earlier, we saw issuers take advantage of favorable financing conditions, which led to strong refinancing and opportunistic issuance in the first quarter. Ratings revenue increased 29% year-over-year, exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew by 54% in the first quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high-yield issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 8% primarily due to an increase in annual fee revenue and strong demand for our Rating Evaluation Service and Issuer Credit Rating products.  \n Adjusted expenses increased 9% driven by higher compensation, including incentives as well as increased T&E expense as our commercial and analytical teams were actively meeting with issuers to help drive the strong growth we saw in the quarter. This resulted in a 43% increase in operating profit and a 640 basis point increase in operating margin to 64.7%. For the trailing 12 months, Ratings margin expanded 290 basis points to 58.5%.  \n And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 10% following the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 14% and 12%, respectively. We continue to see commercial momentum across both business lines as our established benchmark data and insights products have driven customer conversations about our emerging offerings.  \n Advisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 10% driven by strong trading volumes across key sectors in Global Trading Services and an excellent turnout at our premier global energy conference, CERAWeek. \n Upstream Data & Insights revenue grew by 2% year-over-year, benefiting from demand for our carbon emissions monitoring offerings as well as improvement in retention rate. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base.  \n Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to higher compensation costs and ongoing investment in growth initiatives. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 13%, and operating margin improved by 110 basis points to 47.2%. The trailing 12-month margin increased by 120 basis points to 46.4%.  \n Now turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year. The dealer segment marked its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and we also saw solid performance from our Financials & Other business line. Dealer revenue increased 12% year-over-year driven by new business growth in products, such as new car listings and CARFAX for Life, as well as the addition of Market Scan. \n Manufacturing declined by 3% driven by a decrease in onetime transactional revenue, particularly in our recall and marketing businesses, which was partially offset by growth in subscription sales. It's important to understand that revenue from recall products will fluctuate based on the level of activity in any given period. Financials & Other increased 12% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases. \n Adjusted expenses increased 10% due to both planned investments in strategic growth initiatives and the full quarter impact of the Market Scan acquisition. While this resulted in a 100 basis points of margin contraction to 38.1% for the quarter and a 70 basis point reduction to 38.6% for the trailing 12 months, operating profit for Mobility increased by 5% year-over-year.  \n Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 14% primarily due to strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM and continued strength in Exchange-Traded Derivative revenue. Revenue associated with Asset-Linked Fees was up an impressive 16% in the first quarter. This was driven by higher ETF and mutual fund AUM benefiting from both market appreciation and net inflows. We also saw an increase in revenue for OTC products. Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue grew 12% primarily driven by strong volumes in SPX products and price realization. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 6% year-over-year driven by new business growth in end-of-day contracts. \n Expenses increased 9% year-over-year primarily due to increasing investments in strategic growth initiatives as well as an increase in compensation expense. Indices operating profit increased 15%, and operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 72.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins expanded by 30 basis points to 69.3%. \n In the aggregate, our businesses demonstrated exceptional revenue and margin growth while at the same time permitting us to invest in our strategic growth initiatives during the quarter, giving us a strong start to 2024.  \n And with that, I will now turn it back to Doug to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Doug? \nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Chris. We've updated our outlook reflecting our economists' view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024 as well as the outperformance against our internal estimates during the first quarter.  \n Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 3.2%, U.S. inflation of 2.8% and an average price for Brent crude of $85 per barrel. All three of these figures are slightly higher than we originally assumed in our outlook in February. Additionally, our original macroeconomic view included the base case assumption for 3 rate cuts by the U.S. Fed, beginning no earlier than June. As we've seen over the last 3 months, market expectations around interest rates have shifted. And while our economists have not formally updated the number of rate cuts in their base case scenario, our financial guidance now assumes fewer than 3 rate cuts in 2024.  \n We're increasing our billed issuance forecast for 2024 by approximately 3 percentage points to a range of 6% to 10%. As we noted last quarter, our initial outlook for 2024 assumed a stronger first half of the year for issuance. Even with that assumption, the first quarter outperformed our expectations, though we believe much of that outperformance is pull-forward as issuers look to take advantage of very favorable market conditions. All of these factors impact our new full year guidance calling for higher growth and stronger margins.  \n This slide illustrates our current guidance or GAAP results. For our adjusted guidance, we're now expecting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, reflecting the outperformance in Ratings and Indices in the first quarter, partially offset by slightly softer expectations for issuance in the second half of the year. Excluding the impact of 2023 divestitures, we expect revenue growth to be slightly more than 1 percentage point higher than reported revenue growth. \n We also now expect to deliver stronger margins in 2024 with margin expansion in the range of 100 to 150 basis points compared to our prior guidance of approximately 100 basis points. We're taking a balanced approach to reinvesting for future growth while still expanding margins and remain on track to achieve the Investor Day targets from 2022.  \n We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.85 to $14.10, which represents 11% growth at the midpoint. This represents a $0.10 increase from our prior range driven by the increased revenue and profitability outlook for the year. We're also increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, by $100 million despite modestly higher expected CapEx. Higher expected net income and disciplined management of working capital both contribute to the higher expected cash flow for the year.  \n Moving to our division outlook. We're reiterating our revenue growth expectations for Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and Mobility. And we're increasing the growth outlook for Ratings and Indices based on the strength in the first quarter. We're also raising the margin outlook for Indices to reflect the very strong performance year-to-date. While margins were also very strong in our Ratings division in the first quarter, we're reiterating the range for full year margins, which implies approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint.  \n Since much of the revenue outperformance in Q1 likely came from pull-forward, our full year guidance assumes year-over-year declines in Ratings transaction revenue in the fourth quarter as we begin to lap much stronger comps from last year. As a result, we expect margins to be softer in the back half of the year than in the first half in Ratings.  \n With that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. \n I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Thank you. \nMark Grant: Thank you, Doug. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we will now take our first question. \nOperator: Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. \nToni Kaplan: I wanted to focus on Market Intelligence. We've heard some negative commentary from others in the market, which made it sound like this past quarter was particularly challenging. So I wanted to see if that was your experience as well. And also if the large investment bank consolidation impact was in this quarter or if it hasn't hit yet. \n And then I know you're talking about Market Intelligence being better in the back half. And so wanted to just flesh out what gives you the confidence that, that happens. \nAdam Kansler: Toni, it's Adam. Thank you for the question. So yes, we're seeing many of the things that others are seeing in our markets, particularly for our financial services customers. We're seeing that particularly in the smallest of those customers, and that's probably comparable to what some others are seeing. But for us, that's really where the concentrations are. \n The specific consolidation that you're talking about, in terms of the overall scale of our division, it's not something that impacts us in a material way. That -- some of that has already been absorbed. Some will continue to come. But all of that has been anticipated by us in the guidance and the view that we've given you forward. \n We do view what's going on in the market today as very much a cyclical headwind. But the secular tailwinds that we see in our businesses, particularly in our core areas of focus, like private markets, the expansion of our Desktop, you see some of the improvements in the investment we've made over the last 2 years. That gives us a lot of confidence in achieving our long-term goals and the continued growth of the business, confidence in what we've explained we expect to do for the current year, and in delivering against the longer-range Investor Day targets that we set out in 2022. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. \nManav Patnaik: I just wanted to ask on Market Intelligence as well. Just in terms of the strategy going forward, obviously, tough budget environment. Competitors are probably sharpening their pencils, too. Just can you help us with the strategy there? \n And also kind of tied to that is the -- when does Visible Alpha close? How should we think about the contribution and also the divestiture that you were planning? Like what else is in there? \nAdam Kansler: Okay. Thanks, Manav, and thank you for the question. Let me just start with the last piece, Visible Alpha. We do expect that transaction to close here in the second quarter. We're quite excited about it. I think it's an important part of one of our strategic areas, which is the continued expansion and improvement in quality of the Cap IQ Pro set of solutions that we offer to the market. \n As we highlighted, I think really as far back as Investor Day, we have a few core areas of focus that we do think we'll continue to grow. And that really shapes our strategic focus. Those are in areas like private markets, sustainability of the supply chain, the expansion of our Desktop, the ability to deliver our data and solutions to customers in as easy a way as possible. These are things that our largest customers are looking for as they go through consolidations of vendors. That's where the scale and breadth of services that we're able to offer, through Market Intelligence, and of course across the broader S&P Global enterprise, really has impact. \n We'll be laser-focused on that strategy. And as you've seen when we announced at our last call, we'll look at those businesses where we see underperformance or lack of strategic fit, and we'll make decisions on those. And where we see opportunities to acquire unique assets that are high-growth or have particular proprietary value, a company like Visible Alpha, the one you mentioned, quite excited to get that integrated, we're going to take advantage of our position and our opportunity to bring them into the business. So thanks again, Manav. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. \nHeather Balsky: I'd love to hear more about how -- you talked about a pull-forward in issuance into the first quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about, on a regular basis, how much visibility do you have as you look 3 quarters out? \n And how do you think about taking some level of conservatism? Given we're in an election year, there's an uncertain rate environment, just how are you positioning yourself with regards to the guidance, given what you saw in the first quarter? \nMartina Cheung: Heather, it's Martina. Thanks very much for the question. So we look at a variety of factors to give us a good sense for the issuance pipeline in the immediate time frame. Typically, we would look at 180-day pipelines, for example, as well as more near term, but also throughout as much as we can, next 9 to 12 months. \n Those factors, macro factors, GDP, inflation rates, geopolitical factors, which of course is something we're paying very close attention to this year. But we also look, as we've mentioned in the past, obviously, at maturity walls, the pace of refinancing as well as growth and investor interest in different asset classes such as private markets, sustainable finance, structured finance, infrastructure, et cetera. \n So the -- those factors give us a very good sense at any point in time for where we are with respect to the year. If you look at what we saw in Q1 of this year in terms of billed issuance, we saw a very high volume of refinancing of maturity walls in high-yield and bank loans. About 2/3 overall the issuance activity that we saw was related to refinancing. That was a combination of heavy refinancing of '24, but we also saw some '25 and '26 refinancing in the quarter as well. \n So that's really the key area of outperformance from an issuance standpoint in Q1. And we would expect that refinancing activity to continue in bank loan and high-yield through the second quarter and then taper off a little bit, largely because we've been hearing consistently, even since before our last call, that high-yield and bank loan issuers as well as to some extent investment-grade issuers, are wanting to really get ahead of any volatility you see in the back half of the year and take advantage of the relative market stability and favorable spreads that we're seeing at this time. \n Now in investment grade, a very strong quarter, but we think a lot of that investment-grade issuance is pulled forward from the second half of the year. There were a handful of several large M&A deals there as well, but not enough volume for us to really change our view for investment-grade issuance for the rest of the year. So I hope that helps. And happy to take any more questions on issuance. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. \nFaiza Alwy: Wanted to follow up on Ratings and maybe more on the margin front. So while you're increasing the revenue outlook, margins -- you haven't increased margins. So I'm curious if it's mix of business or any investment, sort of how we should think about the margin performance through the rest of the year. \nMartina Cheung: Thanks for the question. Well, as you know, we've said numerous times in the past, we're solving for long-term sustainable margin in the Ratings business. And we are a very disciplined stewards of capital in the business. So our guidance for the year, which we reiterated at 57.5% to 58.5%, as Doug said in his remarks, at the midpoint represents about 150 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. \n We can do a lot with the base that we have. So the reason why I say that is because we have this incredible blockbuster quarter from an issuance standpoint without having to add tremendous amounts of additional staff to meet that need. And that is really, I think, a reinforcement of the capacity preservation strategy that we initiated a couple of years ago. \n So we're very pleased with how we're operating from an expense management, capacity management standpoint and very comfortable with the margin range that we have right now as we -- as it relates to the full year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. \nAndrew Steinerman: Martina, it's Andrew. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about issuance pull-forward. Just you're talking so much about it intra-year kind of second half pull-forward to first half. Just broadly, aren't we still in the midst of a pretty large issuance recovery after the big declines of '22? \nMartina Cheung: Andrew, thanks very much for the question. I would say a couple of things. So the context on a lot of my commentary on intra-year, I would say I'd lean more on the investment-grade side where we think we saw a 2H pull-forward. I think we did see pull-forward of '25 and '26 maturities, for example, on the refinancing front for high-yield and bank loans. So a little bit of a mix there between the spec-grade asset class and investment-grade asset class. \n I think to your broader point, yes, we are and continue to be in midst of a recovery. Notwithstanding the very steep growth rates for example in high yield and investment grade, we're still not seeing the issuance volumes back to anything close to what we might have characterized as market highs, for example in the past, or even market averages that we might have seen in the past. So there's still room to go here throughout the next several years. This is something that we've commented on since '22, believing that it was going to take some years to come back to it. \n But of course, the maturity walls themselves are quite a large factor here. And on the spec-grade asset classes, high-yield and BLR, jointly, we've got about $1.1 trillion in maturities still outstanding for us in '25 and '26. So we're monitoring very, very closely and tightly the indicators that would give us a sense for the pace and timing of those maturities. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. \nAlex Kramm: Just another one on the margin actually, but more on the outlook for the full company. And nice to see the margin outlook being raised. But just wondering, is this just a business mix-driven upside? Or is there anything else going on and such? And I'm asking particularly since you mentioned execution in your prepared remarks. So just wondering, is this just execution on the sales and revenue side? Or following last year's, I guess, disappointments a couple of times, if you take a little bit of a harder look at the cost base and where you can be more efficient. \nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Alex. Well, as you know, we run the company with an approach to budgeting and management, where we always start the year with a positive jaw. That's just our philosophy. We look and see how we're going to do in our core businesses. We go out to see our customers. We understand what we can build as a forward-looking pipeline, forward-looking expectations for the market. We then ourselves say, \"What would be the expense level that we want to have to support that growth?\" On top of that, we then come back and say, \"How much can we afford to invest?\"\n As you saw in this quarter, our expenses grew 3%. That's a result of very, very strong execution coming out of 2023. We're ensuring that we can have very clear tracking of all of our expenses. It's just part of our philosophy of how we run the company. \n Going forward for the rest of the year, you see that we're going to continue that approach. But we think that this is part of the way we manage the company. We're always looking at being very tight on understanding our revenue sources and then moving forward to have a tight approach to our expenses. Thanks, Alex. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. \nAshish Sabadra: I just wanted to drill down further on Market Intelligence, both the recurring variable and the subscription growth. We've seen some really strong 13% growth in recurring variable the last 2 quarters. How should we think about those tailwinds there? And is that mostly contributed from Ipreo and WSO going forward? \n And then on the subscription side, the 6% growth, that moderated a bit. But how should we think about those momentum as we get -- go through the year? \nAdam Kansler: Thanks, Ashish, for the question. So we watch our recurring revenue growth very carefully in this quarter, more than 7% growth in our recurring revenue. Some of that comes from volumes in our businesses that are affected by capital markets volumes. Over the years, we've sought to actually temper that a bit using more fixed contracts. Our customers in most of those markets prefer it. And for us, it adds a little bit more stability and regular growth to the business. \n Quarter-to-quarter, we'll see some variation in those numbers, but we do expect our recurring revenue, our subscription revenue, to continue to grow in line with our full year guidance for the division. Thanks again. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. \nJeffrey Silber: I just wanted to continue with the Ratings question. I think you said that billed issuance was up 45% year-over-year in the quarter, but Ratings revenue was only up 29%. I know in prior quarters, they've been much tighter in terms of the correlation. Can you explain what happened this quarter, why the difference? \nMartina Cheung: Jeff, it's Martina. Thanks for the question. So to your point, billed issuance was up 45%. But transaction revenue, which is the revenue portion or revenue category that is most closely correlated to billed issuance, was up 54%. So we grew faster than billed issuance in the quarter. Overall revenue growth of 29% represented both the transaction revenue growth of 54% and the non-transaction revenue growth of 8%. So really just the evening out of the performance across those to get to the 29% growth. \n Perhaps I will just comment briefly on the non-transaction growth drivers. We were quite pleased with the performance in the quarter. We had continued strength in RES with a lot of companies looking for scenarios around their capital stacks. We saw some new ICR issuance in the quarter and had strong performance on the surveillance book and fee programs. Thanks for the question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. \nScott Wurtzel: I wanted to ask just on the revenue synergies here. I mean, it looks like it was a pretty strong quarter, recognizing $56 million, and then the run rate being pretty impressive here. And in the context of you guys talking about recognizing 45% of synergies in 2024, wondering how we should think about that number now that we seem to be tracking ahead there? And also just kind of wondering what's really resonating on the synergy side here. \nDouglas Peterson: Thanks, Scott. Let me start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Adam. When it comes to our tracking of the revenue synergies, it's something that we look at every quarter. We look at them. We actually looked at it with our Executive Committee earlier this week. We have a combination of cross-sell as well as new products. \n We've been quite successful with cross-sell. It's been our -- the most important aspect of what we've been doing. As you know, we have a target of $350 million into the '25, '26. And we're already running ahead of our expectations for that, especially because of cross-sell. \n When it comes to new products, we've been successful with many right out of the box with Indices with, for example, fixed income indices, we have a fixed income VIX that we've come up with. We have a set of fixed income products that we built around ESG. We've also had multi-asset class products. \n But I think in Market Intelligence, we've also seen a lot of really, really strong synergies. So let me ask Adam to supplement the answer. Thank you. \nAdam Kansler: Thanks, Doug, and thanks, Scott. It's Adam. We're very excited about our synergy progress. We've got 15 more new products that will come to market in 2024. The combination of businesses, the strength that we have in the marketplace, the receptivity of our customers to what a combined offering can do, that's all been a tremendous uplift, and I think it's given us the path to achieve the revenue synergy targets that we outlined. \n I think what's most exciting for me and most exciting for our customers are the new products, right, where we're able to integrate new data sets into workflow solutions or give customers in private markets the ability to immediately look at public company comparables, the ability to put our fixed income capabilities into our Desktop. These are all things that roll out over the course of 2024. \n As Doug mentioned, the cross-sell has given us such early wind in our sails to achieve the synergy targets we set out. As we start to roll out new products into the back half of this year, we're even more excited about what that will look like as we exit the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: Doug, maybe you could talk a little bit about -- touch on both Market Intelligence and Mobility. Just talk about the sales cycles, what you're hearing from your on-the-ground guys sequentially from last quarter and then also year-over-year. And has there been any change in the competitive landscape with some of the new products you've put in there? If you can kind of touch on those ideas, I'd appreciate it. \nDouglas Peterson: Okay. Great. Well, first of all, we've been out seeing our customers, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. We've been out seeing customers everywhere we can. We've been around the globe. I myself have been traveling extensively this year seeing customers. As you know, in the financial services market, there's been a little bit of a slowdown in sales cycles. We've talked about that in the past, which we've seen it just takes a little bit longer to close some transactions. You've heard about that from us before. \n In the Mobility business, there is a massive transformation taking place in the entire industry. If you think about it, you see that there's this electric vehicle transformation that's taking place. And what we've seen is that for -- whether you're an OEM, you're a supplier, you're a dealer, you need data and analytics to understand what is happening in the market. And we provide that no matter what the sales cycle is, no matter what's happening in the industry. \n In addition to that, we're providing new products for dealers, for OEMs, for them to be able to make much more informed decisions. So as you've seen, the amount of EVs have started to stack up in ports and on dealers' lots. It's something that we can provide them much more information. The manufacturers can use that information to make decisions about how they're going to look at incentives going forward. \n So it's a very close dialogue, very good relationship with all sets of clients in every industry around the globe. And we're able to pivot very quickly to provide them the kind of data and analytics they need to make decisions. Thanks, Shlomo. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. \nCraig Huber: On your AI investments, obviously, you're doing that to enhance the products you have but also improve the ongoing efficiency of the company, which is already at a high level and stuff. I'm curious, as you guys think out over the next couple of years, your internal investment spending behind AI, you've been able to do it so far within your technology budget, not a huge increase where it puts downward pressure on your margins near term. I'm just curious, do you think you can continue that going forward here? \nDouglas Peterson: Thank you, Craig. As you know, when we've been looking at our artificial intelligence road map, it's something that we've been very explicit about going back many, many years. This isn't something new for us. It started with our acquisition of Kensho 6 years ago. We since then have come up with a very structured approach to AI, which starts with a vision and a strategy. \n We've recently set in place a leadership team that's led by Chief Digital Solutions Officer and a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer for the entire organization. We have governance over that, and the governance includes looking very cautiously and carefully at budget. \n We've already been absorbing AI expenses in our budget for the last 6 years. We're very conscious that rolling out an AI program is not inexpensive. It requires us to have that kind of discipline. And we're also tracking our successes. And we've had a lot of successes when it comes to new products, which we're starting getting -- we're getting ready to roll out. We're looking at how we can have more productivity. We hope that, over time, the productivity can be returned partially through margin but also be using as a way to reinvest in innovation and growth. \n So overall, I think the message you should take is that we have a very structured approach to AI. It's an open ecosystem. We can take advantage of all of the AI developments happening anywhere with any large language models coming out from anybody. And we're also protecting our data in a way that we can ensure that our intellectual property is not being used by others to build great AI products, that we're going to do that ourselves. \n So overall, we're very pleased with our progress so far, and we really appreciate -- we'll continue to bring you a lot of our progress over time. So thanks, Craig. Thanks for that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. \nJeffrey Meuler: So questions on Market Intelligence. I think you kind of heard the angst coming into the quarter from investors given the peer results. Adam, I was just hoping you can maybe highlight some of the MI businesses that are maybe more unique to S&P and how they're doing. Or maybe highlight any businesses that have already gone through some pretty significant cyclical headwinds, like the Ipreo bookbuilding business or whatever, to just help with investor confidence regarding what's assumed over the remainder of the year through the cyclical challenges. \nAdam Kansler: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate the question. We do have a number of unique solutions and a pretty diversified set of solutions to the marketplace. So you do see dislocations in the market or volatility affecting parts of our business differently than other parts of the business. You mentioned some of our capital markets platforms. \n Obviously, in the last quarter, those saw quite a lot of resilience. We saw very strong markets, particularly in credit and debt markets. Equity markets, I think, are still a little bit slower to recover, and we'll see what happens through the balance of the year. \n Some of our unique offerings really are around alternative assets in the loan marketplace, in private markets. These are places where our workflow solutions, our valuations capability, reference data, we saw that across the firm in other divisions as well. Those are areas that continue to build and areas where we see large secular growth. Those are somewhat unique offerings for us, given our market position in some of those businesses. \n Across our data and reference data, pricing, valuations, those are in pretty steady demand. So they're less subject to the activity in the marketplace quarter-to-quarter. And that's where we see some of the stability and the general growth. \n What's really unique about the S&P Global offering is the scale and breadth that we can deliver to a customer. It's really being able to service them across the portfolio, from discovery and research for an investment, to processing the investment, monitoring it, valuing it, keeping it in a workflow tool. That set of solutions and the efficiencies we can drive through it, I think that's the biggest part of our value proposition. And particularly our larger customers, as they look to consolidate relationships, that gives us a bit of an advantage there. Thanks again for the question, Jeff. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic. \nRussell Quelch: Doug, another really good quarter in Commodity Insights. So I was wondering if you could share what drove the 14% growth in Price Assessments in the first quarter. Is that maybe new product-related? Any early feedback on Platts Connect? Is that helping drive more cross-selling? \n And perhaps is there upside risk to guidance here? I mean, obviously, you've upgraded guidance on some of the sort of transactional base revenue segments, but this is maybe a higher-quality revenue line. So is there upside risk here? \nDouglas Peterson: Yes. Thank you for that, Russell. When you look at Commodity Insights, we've continued to advance incredibly well. We've had -- this is one of the home runs when it comes to the integration of the ENR business and the Platts business. We very quickly been able to bring together products like Price Assessments. Cross-sell has been strong if you think about being able to sell in ENR products to Platts clients as well as selling Platts clients to ENR clients. So that was, right out of the gate, a very strong approach. \n But we've also seen a demand -- high demand for energy transition, and we're at the sweet spot of energy transition. This relates to products like oil and gas, what are all of the different substitutes. It's also carbon intensity of oil and gas products. It goes into renewables, looking at what's happening with the renewable space. We also have a whole set of new clean energy and alternative energy products and services. \n As you know, we've been launching an additional set of products related to metals and mining as well as ag. So across the board, we've seen very strong results. We also had a strong quarter for CERAWeek, which is CERAWeek is a conference that took place in Houston a few weeks ago. It's the place to be for anybody that wants to understand what's happening in the energy space. So across the board, it's just been very, very strong this year. \n We do expect that later in the year, we're going to have tougher comps. So we looked at that very carefully as we were setting our guidance. Last year, our third and fourth quarter, especially our fourth quarter, was quite strong. So we do get towards the end of the year when we do have a tougher comp. \n But overall, the Commodity Insights business is doing incredibly well. It's a broad-based business. And then something like what you mentioned, Platts Connect has been one of the examples of a really early win and something that we're very pleased with. And you'll see more coming from Platts Connect over the next few quarters. Thanks, Russell. Thanks for the question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. \nKeen Fai Tong: In your updated Indices guidance, can you talk about how much of the growth comes from flows versus market performance? And what you're seeing from a pricing and mix perspective from customers? \nMark Grant: George, this is Mark. The updated guidance on Indices is really driven just by strength across that business. But just giving you the underlying assumptions for the full year guide, we're expecting the S&P 500 to be essentially flat from 3/31 through the end of the year. The guidance assumes modest growth in the ETD volumes. And then we are expecting that subscription line to accelerate a little bit as we progress through the full year. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. \nKwun Sum Lau: So just a quick follow-up on Commodity Insights, and there are lots of conversation about commodities trading, growing our U.S. customers and the prices growth and things like that. How much does this volatility contribute to your business this year? And if this kind of volatility subside, how do you see the sustainability of your growth? \nDouglas Peterson: Thanks, Owen. Yes, we think that, that volatility is something that helps drive more people to try to understand what's happening in the markets. But as we've seen over time, the volatility doesn't seem to go away. There's always something else that comes up to create interest in the area. \n We do think that there are some very important long-term secular trends related to the business, which are energy transition I mentioned earlier. Energy transition is a topic that is on everybody's minds, especially when you go outside of the United States. I've been traveling this year, and I can't have a conversation anywhere I go without having a discussion about energy transition. \n And what are -- not just the impacts that we see that benefit the Commodity Insights business, but also those that benefit businesses like the Ratings business and Market Intelligence, because those are moving also over into how do you finance energy transition question as well, which crosses into our other divisions. \n Finally, with Commodity Insights, you can recall that this business is principally a subscription-based business. And so we can see over time the subscription flow, where we're seeing the growth coming from, the new customers coming into the portfolio. \n There's something that I say all the time that every single company is an energy company. It doesn't matter what you do, you're an energy company. And so we also see an expanding set of new clients that aren't necessary traditional energy companies that are needing the solutions we have so they can manage their own energy footprint. So Owen, thank you very much for that, and I think you were the last call. \n So let me give a couple of closing remarks. I really want to thank everyone today for being on this call and for your excellent questions as usual. This was a great quarter, and we're really pleased with the results. And we think this validates our strategy, but it also showcases our execution. \n As I mentioned, I've been very busy traveling around the world this year, speaking with customers across all of our businesses and from every industry. And in those meetings, we're hearing that the themes that we have, that we have the strength in this franchise are those that the customers need going forward. And that includes things like energy transition and private markets and supply chain and credit and risk. But it also includes artificial intelligence, and I'm pleased that we've been able to roll out in our road map many, many new capabilities and products and services to protect our IP, but also to take a leadership position in AI. \n I want to thank Martina and Adam for providing their perspectives today on this call. And I also want to thank our people across the company as usual for a fantastic quarter. And again, thank all of you for joining the call today, and hope you have a great day. Thank you very much. \nOperator: That concludes this morning's call. A PDF version of the presenter slides is available for downloading from investor.spglobal.com. Replays of the entire call will be available in about 2 hours. The webcast with audio and slides will be maintained on S&P Global's website for 1 year. The audio-only telephone replay will be maintained for 1 month. \n On behalf of S&P Global, we thank you for participating, and wish you a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Douglas Peterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. S&P Global is off to a tremendous start for 2024. Total revenue increased 14%, excluding the divestiture of Engineering Solutions. Transaction revenue in our Ratings division drove much of the upside, but importantly, subscription revenue across the entire company increased 8% year-over-year as well.  \n Strong growth across the enterprise contributed to quarterly revenue of nearly $3.5 billion, representing the highest quarterly revenue we've ever generated in the history of our company. Execution was its theme in the first quarter. And our efforts to capture market opportunities, combined with discipline on the expense side, led to more than 350 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year and adjusted EPS growth of 27%.  \n In addition to the stellar financial results in the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate our leadership across global markets. Capital markets were vibrant in the first quarter, and customers turned to S&P Global to help power their investment, funding and trading activities.  \n Equity markets saw strong volumes from both IPOs and M&A. And we saw the highest level of debt issuance since 2021. As the globe grapples with the future of energy security and energy transition, it's no coincidence that this conversation took place on the stage of S&P Global CERAWeek conference and other S&P events around the world.  \n As we Power Global Markets in equity, fixed income, commodities, derivatives and in many industrial verticals, our innovation drives customer value. We'll continue to innovate and invest in our leading data, technology and workflow tools to drive growth, and we'll highlight some of that innovation today.  \n As we look to the 5 strategic pillars we outlined for you at our Investor Day, we're pleased with the progress we've made across the board. While that fifth pillar of execute and deliver is on full display this quarter with the strength of our financial results, we continue to invest in customer relationships, innovation, technology and our people.  \n Beginning with our customers. We saw nearly $1 trillion of billed issuance in the first quarter. This represents the dollar value of debt issued by our customers for which they actively sought out a rating from S&P Global. Issuers know that an S&P Global rating provides a credible, trusted and objective measure of their credit risk, and they know that we have the capacity, even in a very active market, to fully meet their needs.  \n When we look at the broader financial services landscape, we're certainly not back to what we would consider normal levels in the capital markets overall, but we did see improvement. With the macro and geopolitical uncertainties still facing our customers through this year, we continue to hear some concern about the back half, and many market participants are still carefully evaluating expenses for 2024. All of this is consistent with what we shared in February regarding our expectation that Ratings would see a stronger first half than second half, while Market Intelligence would likely start to see improvements in the growth rates in the back half. \n Energy customers from all of our divisions and from around the globe converged once again in Houston, Texas for our annual CERAWeek conference. We're thrilled that customers, partners, regulators, government officials and global thought leaders view S&P Global's CERAWeek as the premier event of the year.  \n Customer engagement remains vital for S&P Global. And in the first quarter, we had well over 100,000 calls and meetings with customers in addition to the thousands of meaningful interactions our Ratings colleagues had with fixed income investors.  \n Billed issuance increased 45% year-over-year in the first quarter. Tight spreads and stabilizing risk appetite in the market created favorable conditions for issuers. We saw investment-grade, high-yield and bank loan volumes all increased as issuers took full advantage to raise debt early in the year. We do expect much of this strength was pull-forward from later in 2024, reinforcing our continued view of a stronger first half than second half in issuance volumes.  \n The strength in billed issuance in the quarter also underscored the importance and advantages of a robust public debt market. We saw tremendous growth over the last 2 years in private debt markets, but we began to see early signs of some of that debt being refinanced in the public markets in the first quarter. While this private-to-public refinancing activity only represented a low single-digit percent of billed issuance, we've heard from customers that they're saving up to 150 to 200 basis points in their interest rates by refinancing to public markets. \n We expect the private markets to play an important role going forward as well, and we're working with major private debt partners to deliver risk analytical solutions. Private markets revenue in our Ratings division increased 30% year-over-year in the first quarter.  \n Turning to Vitality. We're pleased to see that our Vitality Index continues to account for 10% of our total revenue despite the fact that several strong and fast-growing products matured out of Vitality Index at the end of 2023. As we've called out in the past, this index is meant to highlight the contributions from new or enhanced products. So as products mature, they will no longer be part of the Vitality Index even if they continue to grow rapidly.  \n Key contributors were pricing, valuations and reference data, as well as several thematic and factor-based indices, matured out of the Vitality Index at the end of the year. We remain committed to that 10% target as a steady stream of new innovation takes the place of any products that graduate from the index. That was the case this quarter as products that contributed roughly $80 million of revenue to the Vitality Index in the first quarter of 2023 were no longer in the Vitality Index this quarter. We expect the Vitality Index to increase as a percent of total revenue as we progress through the remainder of the year.  \n Turning to some examples of that innovation. In the first quarter, our Commodity Insights team launched a new food and agriculture commodities dashboard, providing a comprehensive view on commodity data as well as new reports and research on energy. Additionally, we launched new price assessments for renewable energy as well as new benchmark prices for the Middle East and Asia. Our energy transition and climate products continued to show rapid growth, nearly 30% year-over-year in the first quarter, supported by the continued innovation in price assessments, new and enhanced data sets and crucial insights solutions.  \n We also introduced an exciting innovation in Market Intelligence. We've spoken at length about the tools and data sets available through our Market Intelligence Marketplace. But in the first quarter, we introduced what we are calling Blueprints. These Blueprints are packages of data sets and tools combined based on specific customer personas and workflows, such as private markets performance analytics. We introduced the first 5 Blueprints in the first quarter with plans to add more in the coming months. These intuitive combinations allow customers to easily discover how our data and tools can work together to facilitate analytics and workflows in new ways.  \n We're also pleased to see early results from the enterprise AI initiatives we outlined for you last quarter. By elevating artificial intelligence to a position of enterprise-wide strategic focus, we're accelerating the development of new tools, deploying common capabilities across multiple divisions and increasing the value we create for our customers and our shareholders. With our in-house expertise, we've developed tools to help market participants benchmark performance of large language models, specifically for business and finance use cases. \n The S&P AI benchmarks by Kensho is a project informed by our world-class data and industry expertise. The questions in our benchmark are designed to assess the ability of large language models to understand and solve realistic finance problems, and each question has been verified by an experienced domain expert.  \n Lastly, we introduced a remarkable tool we call S&P Spark Assist. This is a copilot platform developed jointly between Kensho and our other internal technology teams. We're deploying this platform throughout the organization to improve productivity, facilitate more rapid innovation and reduce the time necessary to accomplish many routine tasks.  \n Because of our proprietary data, the tools and expertise developed through Kensho and remarkable technologists we are working throughout S&P Global, we were able to develop S&P Spark Assist chat interface without relying on a third-party vendor. As a result, we're delivering the power of generative AI to our people in an easy-to-use platform at the cost of less than $1 per user per month. We're incredibly excited about what this tool can do for our people, and we'll provide more details around use cases and productivity as we progress through the year.  \n Turning to our financial results. Chris will walk through the first quarter results in more detail in a moment, but we have had an incredible start to 2024. With strong growth across every division, we continue to balance the need to invest for future growth with the opportunity to deliver margin expansion and earnings growth this year.  \n Revenue grew double digits as reported. But excluding the impact from the Engineering Solutions divestiture, revenue increased an impressive 14%. Trailing 12-month margins improved 170 basis points to nearly 47%.  \n Now I'll turn to Chris Craig, our interim CFO, to review the financial results. Chris, welcome to the call. Over to you. Thank you, Chris. We've updated our outlook reflecting our economists' view of the most important economic and market factors that will impact 2024 as well as the outperformance against our internal estimates during the first quarter.  \n Our financial guidance assumes global GDP growth of 3.2%, U.S. inflation of 2.8% and an average price for Brent crude of $85 per barrel. All three of these figures are slightly higher than we originally assumed in our outlook in February. Additionally, our original macroeconomic view included the base case assumption for 3 rate cuts by the U.S. Fed, beginning no earlier than June. As we've seen over the last 3 months, market expectations around interest rates have shifted. And while our economists have not formally updated the number of rate cuts in their base case scenario, our financial guidance now assumes fewer than 3 rate cuts in 2024.  \n We're increasing our billed issuance forecast for 2024 by approximately 3 percentage points to a range of 6% to 10%. As we noted last quarter, our initial outlook for 2024 assumed a stronger first half of the year for issuance. Even with that assumption, the first quarter outperformed our expectations, though we believe much of that outperformance is pull-forward as issuers look to take advantage of very favorable market conditions. All of these factors impact our new full year guidance calling for higher growth and stronger margins.  \n This slide illustrates our current guidance or GAAP results. For our adjusted guidance, we're now expecting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%, reflecting the outperformance in Ratings and Indices in the first quarter, partially offset by slightly softer expectations for issuance in the second half of the year. Excluding the impact of 2023 divestitures, we expect revenue growth to be slightly more than 1 percentage point higher than reported revenue growth. \n We also now expect to deliver stronger margins in 2024 with margin expansion in the range of 100 to 150 basis points compared to our prior guidance of approximately 100 basis points. We're taking a balanced approach to reinvesting for future growth while still expanding margins and remain on track to achieve the Investor Day targets from 2022.  \n We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS for the full year in the range of $13.85 to $14.10, which represents 11% growth at the midpoint. This represents a $0.10 increase from our prior range driven by the increased revenue and profitability outlook for the year. We're also increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow, excluding certain items, by $100 million despite modestly higher expected CapEx. Higher expected net income and disciplined management of working capital both contribute to the higher expected cash flow for the year.  \n Moving to our division outlook. We're reiterating our revenue growth expectations for Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights and Mobility. And we're increasing the growth outlook for Ratings and Indices based on the strength in the first quarter. We're also raising the margin outlook for Indices to reflect the very strong performance year-to-date. While margins were also very strong in our Ratings division in the first quarter, we're reiterating the range for full year margins, which implies approximately 150 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint.  \n Since much of the revenue outperformance in Q1 likely came from pull-forward, our full year guidance assumes year-over-year declines in Ratings transaction revenue in the fourth quarter as we begin to lap much stronger comps from last year. As a result, we expect margins to be softer in the back half of the year than in the first half in Ratings.  \n With that, I'd like to invite Adam Kansler, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence; and Martina Cheung, President of S&P Global Ratings and Executive Lead for Sustainable1, to join us. \n I'll turn the call back over to Mark for your questions. Thank you. Thank you, Alex. Well, as you know, we run the company with an approach to budgeting and management, where we always start the year with a positive jaw. That's just our philosophy. We look and see how we're going to do in our core businesses. We go out to see our customers. We understand what we can build as a forward-looking pipeline, forward-looking expectations for the market. We then ourselves say, \"What would be the expense level that we want to have to support that growth?\" On top of that, we then come back and say, \"How much can we afford to invest?\"\n As you saw in this quarter, our expenses grew 3%. That's a result of very, very strong execution coming out of 2023. We're ensuring that we can have very clear tracking of all of our expenses. It's just part of our philosophy of how we run the company. \n Going forward for the rest of the year, you see that we're going to continue that approach. But we think that this is part of the way we manage the company. We're always looking at being very tight on understanding our revenue sources and then moving forward to have a tight approach to our expenses. Thanks, Alex. Thanks, Scott. Let me start, and then I'm going to hand it over to Adam. When it comes to our tracking of the revenue synergies, it's something that we look at every quarter. We look at them. We actually looked at it with our Executive Committee earlier this week. We have a combination of cross-sell as well as new products. \n We've been quite successful with cross-sell. It's been our -- the most important aspect of what we've been doing. As you know, we have a target of $350 million into the '25, '26. And we're already running ahead of our expectations for that, especially because of cross-sell. \n When it comes to new products, we've been successful with many right out of the box with Indices with, for example, fixed income indices, we have a fixed income VIX that we've come up with. We have a set of fixed income products that we built around ESG. We've also had multi-asset class products. \n But I think in Market Intelligence, we've also seen a lot of really, really strong synergies. So let me ask Adam to supplement the answer. Thank you. Okay. Great. Well, first of all, we've been out seeing our customers, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. We've been out seeing customers everywhere we can. We've been around the globe. I myself have been traveling extensively this year seeing customers. As you know, in the financial services market, there's been a little bit of a slowdown in sales cycles. We've talked about that in the past, which we've seen it just takes a little bit longer to close some transactions. You've heard about that from us before. \n In the Mobility business, there is a massive transformation taking place in the entire industry. If you think about it, you see that there's this electric vehicle transformation that's taking place. And what we've seen is that for -- whether you're an OEM, you're a supplier, you're a dealer, you need data and analytics to understand what is happening in the market. And we provide that no matter what the sales cycle is, no matter what's happening in the industry. \n In addition to that, we're providing new products for dealers, for OEMs, for them to be able to make much more informed decisions. So as you've seen, the amount of EVs have started to stack up in ports and on dealers' lots. It's something that we can provide them much more information. The manufacturers can use that information to make decisions about how they're going to look at incentives going forward. \n So it's a very close dialogue, very good relationship with all sets of clients in every industry around the globe. And we're able to pivot very quickly to provide them the kind of data and analytics they need to make decisions. Thanks, Shlomo. Thank you, Craig. As you know, when we've been looking at our artificial intelligence road map, it's something that we've been very explicit about going back many, many years. This isn't something new for us. It started with our acquisition of Kensho 6 years ago. We since then have come up with a very structured approach to AI, which starts with a vision and a strategy. \n We've recently set in place a leadership team that's led by Chief Digital Solutions Officer and a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer for the entire organization. We have governance over that, and the governance includes looking very cautiously and carefully at budget. \n We've already been absorbing AI expenses in our budget for the last 6 years. We're very conscious that rolling out an AI program is not inexpensive. It requires us to have that kind of discipline. And we're also tracking our successes. And we've had a lot of successes when it comes to new products, which we're starting getting -- we're getting ready to roll out. We're looking at how we can have more productivity. We hope that, over time, the productivity can be returned partially through margin but also be using as a way to reinvest in innovation and growth. \n So overall, I think the message you should take is that we have a very structured approach to AI. It's an open ecosystem. We can take advantage of all of the AI developments happening anywhere with any large language models coming out from anybody. And we're also protecting our data in a way that we can ensure that our intellectual property is not being used by others to build great AI products, that we're going to do that ourselves. \n So overall, we're very pleased with our progress so far, and we really appreciate -- we'll continue to bring you a lot of our progress over time. So thanks, Craig. Thanks for that. Yes. Thank you for that, Russell. When you look at Commodity Insights, we've continued to advance incredibly well. We've had -- this is one of the home runs when it comes to the integration of the ENR business and the Platts business. We very quickly been able to bring together products like Price Assessments. Cross-sell has been strong if you think about being able to sell in ENR products to Platts clients as well as selling Platts clients to ENR clients. So that was, right out of the gate, a very strong approach. \n But we've also seen a demand -- high demand for energy transition, and we're at the sweet spot of energy transition. This relates to products like oil and gas, what are all of the different substitutes. It's also carbon intensity of oil and gas products. It goes into renewables, looking at what's happening with the renewable space. We also have a whole set of new clean energy and alternative energy products and services. \n As you know, we've been launching an additional set of products related to metals and mining as well as ag. So across the board, we've seen very strong results. We also had a strong quarter for CERAWeek, which is CERAWeek is a conference that took place in Houston a few weeks ago. It's the place to be for anybody that wants to understand what's happening in the energy space. So across the board, it's just been very, very strong this year. \n We do expect that later in the year, we're going to have tougher comps. So we looked at that very carefully as we were setting our guidance. Last year, our third and fourth quarter, especially our fourth quarter, was quite strong. So we do get towards the end of the year when we do have a tougher comp. \n But overall, the Commodity Insights business is doing incredibly well. It's a broad-based business. And then something like what you mentioned, Platts Connect has been one of the examples of a really early win and something that we're very pleased with. And you'll see more coming from Platts Connect over the next few quarters. Thanks, Russell. Thanks for the question. Thanks, Owen. Yes, we think that, that volatility is something that helps drive more people to try to understand what's happening in the markets. But as we've seen over time, the volatility doesn't seem to go away. There's always something else that comes up to create interest in the area. \n We do think that there are some very important long-term secular trends related to the business, which are energy transition I mentioned earlier. Energy transition is a topic that is on everybody's minds, especially when you go outside of the United States. I've been traveling this year, and I can't have a conversation anywhere I go without having a discussion about energy transition. \n And what are -- not just the impacts that we see that benefit the Commodity Insights business, but also those that benefit businesses like the Ratings business and Market Intelligence, because those are moving also over into how do you finance energy transition question as well, which crosses into our other divisions. \n Finally, with Commodity Insights, you can recall that this business is principally a subscription-based business. And so we can see over time the subscription flow, where we're seeing the growth coming from, the new customers coming into the portfolio. \n There's something that I say all the time that every single company is an energy company. It doesn't matter what you do, you're an energy company. And so we also see an expanding set of new clients that aren't necessary traditional energy companies that are needing the solutions we have so they can manage their own energy footprint. So Owen, thank you very much for that, and I think you were the last call. \n So let me give a couple of closing remarks. I really want to thank everyone today for being on this call and for your excellent questions as usual. This was a great quarter, and we're really pleased with the results. And we think this validates our strategy, but it also showcases our execution. \n As I mentioned, I've been very busy traveling around the world this year, speaking with customers across all of our businesses and from every industry. And in those meetings, we're hearing that the themes that we have, that we have the strength in this franchise are those that the customers need going forward. And that includes things like energy transition and private markets and supply chain and credit and risk. But it also includes artificial intelligence, and I'm pleased that we've been able to roll out in our road map many, many new capabilities and products and services to protect our IP, but also to take a leadership position in AI. \n I want to thank Martina and Adam for providing their perspectives today on this call. And I also want to thank our people across the company as usual for a fantastic quarter. And again, thank all of you for joining the call today, and hope you have a great day. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Adam Kansler",
            "content": "Toni, it's Adam. Thank you for the question. So yes, we're seeing many of the things that others are seeing in our markets, particularly for our financial services customers. We're seeing that particularly in the smallest of those customers, and that's probably comparable to what some others are seeing. But for us, that's really where the concentrations are. \n The specific consolidation that you're talking about, in terms of the overall scale of our division, it's not something that impacts us in a material way. That -- some of that has already been absorbed. Some will continue to come. But all of that has been anticipated by us in the guidance and the view that we've given you forward. \n We do view what's going on in the market today as very much a cyclical headwind. But the secular tailwinds that we see in our businesses, particularly in our core areas of focus, like private markets, the expansion of our Desktop, you see some of the improvements in the investment we've made over the last 2 years. That gives us a lot of confidence in achieving our long-term goals and the continued growth of the business, confidence in what we've explained we expect to do for the current year, and in delivering against the longer-range Investor Day targets that we set out in 2022. Okay. Thanks, Manav, and thank you for the question. Let me just start with the last piece, Visible Alpha. We do expect that transaction to close here in the second quarter. We're quite excited about it. I think it's an important part of one of our strategic areas, which is the continued expansion and improvement in quality of the Cap IQ Pro set of solutions that we offer to the market. \n As we highlighted, I think really as far back as Investor Day, we have a few core areas of focus that we do think we'll continue to grow. And that really shapes our strategic focus. Those are in areas like private markets, sustainability of the supply chain, the expansion of our Desktop, the ability to deliver our data and solutions to customers in as easy a way as possible. These are things that our largest customers are looking for as they go through consolidations of vendors. That's where the scale and breadth of services that we're able to offer, through Market Intelligence, and of course across the broader S&P Global enterprise, really has impact. \n We'll be laser-focused on that strategy. And as you've seen when we announced at our last call, we'll look at those businesses where we see underperformance or lack of strategic fit, and we'll make decisions on those. And where we see opportunities to acquire unique assets that are high-growth or have particular proprietary value, a company like Visible Alpha, the one you mentioned, quite excited to get that integrated, we're going to take advantage of our position and our opportunity to bring them into the business. So thanks again, Manav. Thanks, Ashish, for the question. So we watch our recurring revenue growth very carefully in this quarter, more than 7% growth in our recurring revenue. Some of that comes from volumes in our businesses that are affected by capital markets volumes. Over the years, we've sought to actually temper that a bit using more fixed contracts. Our customers in most of those markets prefer it. And for us, it adds a little bit more stability and regular growth to the business. \n Quarter-to-quarter, we'll see some variation in those numbers, but we do expect our recurring revenue, our subscription revenue, to continue to grow in line with our full year guidance for the division. Thanks again. Thanks, Doug, and thanks, Scott. It's Adam. We're very excited about our synergy progress. We've got 15 more new products that will come to market in 2024. The combination of businesses, the strength that we have in the marketplace, the receptivity of our customers to what a combined offering can do, that's all been a tremendous uplift, and I think it's given us the path to achieve the revenue synergy targets that we outlined. \n I think what's most exciting for me and most exciting for our customers are the new products, right, where we're able to integrate new data sets into workflow solutions or give customers in private markets the ability to immediately look at public company comparables, the ability to put our fixed income capabilities into our Desktop. These are all things that roll out over the course of 2024. \n As Doug mentioned, the cross-sell has given us such early wind in our sails to achieve the synergy targets we set out. As we start to roll out new products into the back half of this year, we're even more excited about what that will look like as we exit the year. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Appreciate the question. We do have a number of unique solutions and a pretty diversified set of solutions to the marketplace. So you do see dislocations in the market or volatility affecting parts of our business differently than other parts of the business. You mentioned some of our capital markets platforms. \n Obviously, in the last quarter, those saw quite a lot of resilience. We saw very strong markets, particularly in credit and debt markets. Equity markets, I think, are still a little bit slower to recover, and we'll see what happens through the balance of the year. \n Some of our unique offerings really are around alternative assets in the loan marketplace, in private markets. These are places where our workflow solutions, our valuations capability, reference data, we saw that across the firm in other divisions as well. Those are areas that continue to build and areas where we see large secular growth. Those are somewhat unique offerings for us, given our market position in some of those businesses. \n Across our data and reference data, pricing, valuations, those are in pretty steady demand. So they're less subject to the activity in the marketplace quarter-to-quarter. And that's where we see some of the stability and the general growth. \n What's really unique about the S&P Global offering is the scale and breadth that we can deliver to a customer. It's really being able to service them across the portfolio, from discovery and research for an investment, to processing the investment, monitoring it, valuing it, keeping it in a workflow tool. That set of solutions and the efficiencies we can drive through it, I think that's the biggest part of our value proposition. And particularly our larger customers, as they look to consolidate relationships, that gives us a bit of an advantage there. Thanks again for the question, Jeff."

            "name": "Martina Cheung",
            "content": "Heather, it's Martina. Thanks very much for the question. So we look at a variety of factors to give us a good sense for the issuance pipeline in the immediate time frame. Typically, we would look at 180-day pipelines, for example, as well as more near term, but also throughout as much as we can, next 9 to 12 months. \n Those factors, macro factors, GDP, inflation rates, geopolitical factors, which of course is something we're paying very close attention to this year. But we also look, as we've mentioned in the past, obviously, at maturity walls, the pace of refinancing as well as growth and investor interest in different asset classes such as private markets, sustainable finance, structured finance, infrastructure, et cetera. \n So the -- those factors give us a very good sense at any point in time for where we are with respect to the year. If you look at what we saw in Q1 of this year in terms of billed issuance, we saw a very high volume of refinancing of maturity walls in high-yield and bank loans. About 2/3 overall the issuance activity that we saw was related to refinancing. That was a combination of heavy refinancing of '24, but we also saw some '25 and '26 refinancing in the quarter as well. \n So that's really the key area of outperformance from an issuance standpoint in Q1. And we would expect that refinancing activity to continue in bank loan and high-yield through the second quarter and then taper off a little bit, largely because we've been hearing consistently, even since before our last call, that high-yield and bank loan issuers as well as to some extent investment-grade issuers, are wanting to really get ahead of any volatility you see in the back half of the year and take advantage of the relative market stability and favorable spreads that we're seeing at this time. \n Now in investment grade, a very strong quarter, but we think a lot of that investment-grade issuance is pulled forward from the second half of the year. There were a handful of several large M&A deals there as well, but not enough volume for us to really change our view for investment-grade issuance for the rest of the year. So I hope that helps. And happy to take any more questions on issuance. Thanks for the question. Well, as you know, we've said numerous times in the past, we're solving for long-term sustainable margin in the Ratings business. And we are a very disciplined stewards of capital in the business. So our guidance for the year, which we reiterated at 57.5% to 58.5%, as Doug said in his remarks, at the midpoint represents about 150 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. \n We can do a lot with the base that we have. So the reason why I say that is because we have this incredible blockbuster quarter from an issuance standpoint without having to add tremendous amounts of additional staff to meet that need. And that is really, I think, a reinforcement of the capacity preservation strategy that we initiated a couple of years ago. \n So we're very pleased with how we're operating from an expense management, capacity management standpoint and very comfortable with the margin range that we have right now as we -- as it relates to the full year. Andrew, thanks very much for the question. I would say a couple of things. So the context on a lot of my commentary on intra-year, I would say I'd lean more on the investment-grade side where we think we saw a 2H pull-forward. I think we did see pull-forward of '25 and '26 maturities, for example, on the refinancing front for high-yield and bank loans. So a little bit of a mix there between the spec-grade asset class and investment-grade asset class. \n I think to your broader point, yes, we are and continue to be in midst of a recovery. Notwithstanding the very steep growth rates for example in high yield and investment grade, we're still not seeing the issuance volumes back to anything close to what we might have characterized as market highs, for example in the past, or even market averages that we might have seen in the past. So there's still room to go here throughout the next several years. This is something that we've commented on since '22, believing that it was going to take some years to come back to it. \n But of course, the maturity walls themselves are quite a large factor here. And on the spec-grade asset classes, high-yield and BLR, jointly, we've got about $1.1 trillion in maturities still outstanding for us in '25 and '26. So we're monitoring very, very closely and tightly the indicators that would give us a sense for the pace and timing of those maturities. Jeff, it's Martina. Thanks for the question. So to your point, billed issuance was up 45%. But transaction revenue, which is the revenue portion or revenue category that is most closely correlated to billed issuance, was up 54%. So we grew faster than billed issuance in the quarter. Overall revenue growth of 29% represented both the transaction revenue growth of 54% and the non-transaction revenue growth of 8%. So really just the evening out of the performance across those to get to the 29% growth. \n Perhaps I will just comment briefly on the non-transaction growth drivers. We were quite pleased with the performance in the quarter. We had continued strength in RES with a lot of companies looking for scenarios around their capital stacks. We saw some new ICR issuance in the quarter and had strong performance on the surveillance book and fee programs. Thanks for the question."

            "name": "Christopher Craig",
            "content": "Thank you, Doug. 2024 got off to a strong start as we saw 3 of 5 divisions achieve double-digit growth. As Doug mentioned, reported revenue grew 10% in the first quarter. And excluding the impact of the Engineering Solutions divestiture, revenue growth was 14%.  \n Adjusted expenses grew by only 3% year-over-year as we continue to focus on disciplined execution and benefiting from the Engineering Solutions divestiture. Strong growth and solid execution combined to deliver more than 350 basis points of adjusted margin expansion in the quarter. With our commitment to capital returns over the last 12 months, we've reduced the fully diluted share count by 3% year-over-year. This led to adjusted earnings per share increasing by 27% year-over-year to $4.01.  \n Now turning to strategic investment areas. Sustainability & Energy Transition revenue grew 15% to $78 million in the quarter driven by strong demand for Commodity Insights, energy transition products and benchmark offerings as well as EV transition-related consulting in Mobility. We are continuing to invest in our energy transition offerings where we see opportunities across our divisions.  \n Moving to Private Market Solutions. Revenue increased by 16% year-over-year to $116 million. Growth was driven by debt and bank loan ratings as well as continued strength in iLEVEL and other Private Market Solutions within Market Intelligence.  \n We continue to build momentum in our revenue synergies and are ahead of schedule toward our $350 million target. We exited the first quarter with an annualized run rate of $184 million. During the first quarter alone, we recognized $56 million in revenue synergies. While the majority of this was from cross-sell initiatives, we are beginning to gain traction with new products as well. As of the end of Q1, we have launched 25 new products through our revenue synergy initiatives, and we plan to launch more than 15 additional synergy products by the end of 2024.  \n Turning to our divisions. Market Intelligence revenue increased 7% in the first quarter with all business lines growing in the mid- to high single-digit range. Desktop grew 5% as we continue to focus on speed, performance improvements and the introduction of new content and capabilities, including the expansion of our collection of premium broker research providers within aftermarket research. Data & Advisory Solutions grew 7% driven by expanded coverage and continued investment in high-growth areas of our company information and analytics and market data and valuation product offerings. Enterprise Solutions benefited from an increase in issuance volumes in the debt and equity capital markets and grew over 8% in the quarter. Credit & Risk Solutions grew 6%, supported by strong new sales and price realization, particularly for RatingsXpress subscriptions. \n We saw solid growth in Market Intelligence in Q1 that was in line with our expectations and consistent with what we signaled on our fourth quarter earnings call. Adjusted expenses increased 6% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, cloud costs and royalties, partially offset by a reduction in outside services expense. Operating profit increased 9%, and the operating margin increased 70 basis points to 32.7%. Trailing 12-month margins expanded 50 basis points to 33.1%.  \n Now turning to Ratings. As Doug mentioned earlier, we saw issuers take advantage of favorable financing conditions, which led to strong refinancing and opportunistic issuance in the first quarter. Ratings revenue increased 29% year-over-year, exceeding our internal expectations. Transaction revenue grew by 54% in the first quarter as heightened refinancing activity increased bank loan and high-yield issuance. Non-transaction revenue increased 8% primarily due to an increase in annual fee revenue and strong demand for our Rating Evaluation Service and Issuer Credit Rating products.  \n Adjusted expenses increased 9% driven by higher compensation, including incentives as well as increased T&E expense as our commercial and analytical teams were actively meeting with issuers to help drive the strong growth we saw in the quarter. This resulted in a 43% increase in operating profit and a 640 basis point increase in operating margin to 64.7%. For the trailing 12 months, Ratings margin expanded 290 basis points to 58.5%.  \n And now turning to Commodity Insights. Revenue increased 10% following the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights. Price Assessments and Energy & Resources Data & Insights grew 14% and 12%, respectively. We continue to see commercial momentum across both business lines as our established benchmark data and insights products have driven customer conversations about our emerging offerings.  \n Advisory & Transactional Services revenue grew 10% driven by strong trading volumes across key sectors in Global Trading Services and an excellent turnout at our premier global energy conference, CERAWeek. \n Upstream Data & Insights revenue grew by 2% year-over-year, benefiting from demand for our carbon emissions monitoring offerings as well as improvement in retention rate. The business line continues to prioritize growth in its subscription base.  \n Adjusted expenses increased 7% due to higher compensation costs and ongoing investment in growth initiatives. Operating profit for Commodity Insights increased 13%, and operating margin improved by 110 basis points to 47.2%. The trailing 12-month margin increased by 120 basis points to 46.4%.  \n Now turning to Mobility. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year. The dealer segment marked its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and we also saw solid performance from our Financials & Other business line. Dealer revenue increased 12% year-over-year driven by new business growth in products, such as new car listings and CARFAX for Life, as well as the addition of Market Scan. \n Manufacturing declined by 3% driven by a decrease in onetime transactional revenue, particularly in our recall and marketing businesses, which was partially offset by growth in subscription sales. It's important to understand that revenue from recall products will fluctuate based on the level of activity in any given period. Financials & Other increased 12% as the business line benefited from strong underwriting volumes and price increases. \n Adjusted expenses increased 10% due to both planned investments in strategic growth initiatives and the full quarter impact of the Market Scan acquisition. While this resulted in a 100 basis points of margin contraction to 38.1% for the quarter and a 70 basis point reduction to 38.6% for the trailing 12 months, operating profit for Mobility increased by 5% year-over-year.  \n Now turning to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Revenue increased 14% primarily due to strong growth in asset-linked fees, which benefited from higher AUM and continued strength in Exchange-Traded Derivative revenue. Revenue associated with Asset-Linked Fees was up an impressive 16% in the first quarter. This was driven by higher ETF and mutual fund AUM benefiting from both market appreciation and net inflows. We also saw an increase in revenue for OTC products. Exchange-Traded Derivatives revenue grew 12% primarily driven by strong volumes in SPX products and price realization. Data & Custom Subscriptions increased 6% year-over-year driven by new business growth in end-of-day contracts. \n Expenses increased 9% year-over-year primarily due to increasing investments in strategic growth initiatives as well as an increase in compensation expense. Indices operating profit increased 15%, and operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 72.9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, margins expanded by 30 basis points to 69.3%. \n In the aggregate, our businesses demonstrated exceptional revenue and margin growth while at the same time permitting us to invest in our strategic growth initiatives during the quarter, giving us a strong start to 2024.  \n And with that, I will now turn it back to Doug to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year.
