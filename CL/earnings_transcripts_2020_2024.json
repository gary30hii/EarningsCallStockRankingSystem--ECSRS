This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. For opening remarks, I will turn the conference over to the Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks Shannon. Good morning and welcome to our 2020 fourth quarter and year-end earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.  This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning and Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stan Sutulla, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q4 and full-year performance as well as our 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to re-enter the queue. We finished 2020 in very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis. Importantly, we continued to deliver balanced growth which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance. For both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth, organic growth in all four of our categories - oral care, personal care, home care, and pet nutrition, and organic sales growth in every division with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well. Our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show.  Importantly, this growth is driving our income statement. We delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange.  Our net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in pricing. The impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind.  In the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis, where were up 100 basis points year over year, and a base business basis where we were up 90 basis points. For the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin while raw materials were a 320 basis point headwind driven by increases in the cost of raw materials, like pulling oils, and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 280 basis point benefit. On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year. On a base business basis, in the fourth quarter our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent of sales basis. This was primarily driven by a 210 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and ecommerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs primarily in the U.S. and investments behind in growth and innovation. For the full year on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points driven primarily by a 100 basis point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics costs. For the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year-over-year while it was up 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis. For the full year, our EPS growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis.  We delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year. As we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Filorga transaction with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases.  A few comments on our divisional performance. North America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic. We also benefited from a rebound in performance by our skin health businesses in the quarter. Our ecommerce business in North America finished the year strongly with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year\u2019s sales. North America saw significant increases in brand support behind the Hum by Colgate electric brush, the Colgate Optic White overnight teeth whitening pen, our toothpaste business, and Irish Spring.  Latin America net sales were down low single digits as double-digit organic sales growth was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. The strong organic sales growth performance was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub for both the quarter and the year. Oral care innovation has been a key growth driver with Colgate Total Tartar Control, Luminous White Charcoal, and our Natural Extracts line all driving incremental growth. Europe delivered double-digit net sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by volume growth across all three segments: oral care, personal care, and home care, and in every hub. Strong oral care volume growth on the Colgate and elmex brands was accompanied by significant brand building investment in traditional media and digital. We were also encouraged by a return to organic growth for Filorga where strong China growth more than offset weakness in the travel retail channel. We delivered 7% net sales and 5% organic sales growth in Asia-Pacific led by volume growth across our biggest hubs: Greater China, India, the Philippines, and South Pacific. In India and China, our growth strategies are driving improved toothpaste performance through Colgate Miracle Repair in China, Colgate Vedshakti in India, and our re-launched Colgate anti-cavity business across the division. Our personal care and home care businesses also benefited from COVID-related demand in the South Pacific region. Africa Eurasia net sales declined 1.5% due to significant foreign exchange headwinds as the division delivered organic sales growth across all three categories and in every hub. Toothpaste organic sales growth was led by Colgate Herbal, Colgate Max Fresh, and Colgate Total. Meridol also delivered strong growth as we look to gain share in the pharmacy channel. Hill\u2019s finished the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite continued difficult comparisons. Organic sales growth was again led by the U.S. with ecommerce up significantly, but Europe also delivered double-digit growth. Encouragingly, we are seeing a re-acceleration in our prescription diet business as vet channel traffic continues to improve. Now for guidance. We expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long term target range. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although we expect currencies to remain volatile. We expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. We expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021 despite difficult comparisons given our performance in 2020, increases in raw materials, and the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID. Advertising is also expected to be up on a percent of sales basis, although less so than in 2020. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% to 24.5% on both a GAAP and base business basis. We point out that our guidance range does not account for any changes in U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.  On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid single digits. On a base business basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the mid to high single digits. Obviously this is a wider range than what we normally provide, which we think is prudent given what we consider to be a heightened level of uncertainty as we plan out the year. There are several factors that could impact where we fall within this wider range. First, COVID-related consumption. In the categories where consumption has risen during the pandemic, primarily liquid hand soap, dish soap and cleaners, we are expecting lower rates of growth or even declines year-over-year in 2021, depending on the market. However, we expect overall consumption in these categories to remain elevated versus 2019 levels. Also, particularly in emerging markets, movements in foreign exchange could impact our ability to take pricing. We are optimistic about our pricing plans for 2021 and believe they are appropriate given recent raw material trends, the competitive environment, and foreign exchange.  Raw materials - we have budgeted for increased raw material costs, but we do highlight that many raw material prices are accelerating faster than anticipated. If this continues, it could pressure on gross margin expansion depending on our ability to take pricing or drive additional productivity. Finally, logistics - we have seen a further rise in logistics costs over the past few quarters, particularly in the U.S. but also relate to shipping containers in Asia. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term but to moderate later in the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Noel.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks John, and good morning everyone. Like me, I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and you share some sense of optimism that we can return to a more normal existence over the course of this year. I want to welcome Stan Sutulla to the first Colgate-Palmolive earnings call. Stan joined us back in November, as we announced, and obviously we\u2019re deeply excited to have him here. He\u2019s hit the ground running already. As I reflected on 2020, I\u2019m so proud of the Colgate people around the world and what they\u2019ve accomplished. Our first quarter call, I discussed three topics related to how we planned to manage through the crisis. These three topics were staying true to our values and purpose and helping us navigate a very difficult environment, adapting our strategies where necessary and executing with agility, and importantly managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future.  On the first topic, we\u2019ve implemented programs to keep our employees safe and healthy while keeping our supply chain and our laboratories up and running and delivering record output from our facilities and our R&D organization. Nothing is more important than the safety and health of Colgate people and we will continue in 2021 to keep them as our first priority. We worked with the World Health Organization this year in local hospitals to distribute free health and hygiene products to people all over the world to help stop the spread of COVID and enable people to live healthier lives, programs that Colgate people are deeply proud of.  In the second area, we continued to execute on our growth mindset strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth through more impactful premium innovation, which you\u2019ll hear more about at CAGNY, increasing our brand building globally, and executing against our digital transformation. As John laid out, we did this all while delivering strong and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share, and free cash flow. We were able to achieve those results despite many operating challenges we confronted and a sizeable negative impact from foreign exchange. Most importantly, while we\u2019ve been delivering on 2020 results, we have been very focused on positioning ourselves for growth in 2021 and beyond by taking advantage of our momentum, and that was the third topic - managing through this crisis with an eye towards the future. Now I\u2019ll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond. There are three reasons. The first is that as an organization, we have truly changed how we think about growth. As a company with leading brands, we have to be focused on driving category growth, and we can drive this growth in many ways. Of course, we can increase the number of people buying our products, we can increase the price that people are willing to pay for our products, and we can increase the frequency of how often people use our products. We have strengthened existing tools and, importantly, built new capabilities to drive this growth. For example, on Hill\u2019s we\u2019re reaching a much larger group of consumers through increased advertising to broaden our reach and improving our digital targeting so we can raise brand awareness and household penetration in what is truly a differentiated brand. Think about this as finding the right person with the right message at the right time. It\u2019s not just spending more, but spending smarter. In Latin America, we have used revenue growth management tools to drive value with price mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment. For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by three points in the last two years, all driven by tactical and strategic revenue growth management.  As I discussed at the Barclays conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products. Pure performance, new forms, delivery systems and innovation for new channels all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently, and given that Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth. The second reason is that we\u2019re developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth. We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can\u2019t just grow the top line, we need to deliver profitable growth. You can see this in our 2020 results where we delivered 8% earnings per share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization. We\u2019re doing this by pulling on all the levers: premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads, and laser focused on all cost elements throughout the income statement.  Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas, so that we can continue to invest in the transformational capabilities that we\u2019re deploying and that will rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively.  The third reason is that we\u2019re making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people. As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched. In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth. To that end, we made real progress on ecommerce, where we have brought in more external talent while up-skilling existing talent across the enterprise, launched more online-specific innovation like the Optic White Pen and the Miracle Repair Serum, and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities. All of this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll exit the year with ecommerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales. Lastly, it\u2019s building out the right team. You need to provide the right tools to them, the right technology to digitally transform the organization. We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation, like our transition SAP S/4HANA that\u2019s giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes, and simplified transactions. We\u2019ve developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed and capability building, our ability now to develop applications much faster and realize the value of those applications much faster, and with our partners building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead. We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate business planning process - you will remember that was called CBP, that will significantly reduce the process time required by providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management. To sum it up, I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results. I would also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future. With that, I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. \nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys. You\u2019ve been able to realize some pretty significant pricing in the last few quarters of 2020. You mentioned optimism on pricing for 2021, also mentioned the rising raw material environment, clearly. Just wanted to understand the balance between pricing and volume in your 3% to 5% organic sales outlook, how much pricing you\u2019re assuming, and perhaps you can touch on your ability to take further pricing in emerging markets in a weaker dollar environment and given the state of the consumer, and then in the U.S. the promotional environment also relative to 2020. The gist of the question is, look, it\u2019s a robust organic sales growth outlook relative to last year, so just trying to understand what gives you confidence versus a tough comparison and how pricing plays into that. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks Dara. Let me come back again, I guess overarching in terms of strategy for us, because it plays into obviously our ability to deliver sustained profitable growth, which is a balance between volume and price. Obviously you can look at the details with volume and price across all divisions and categories - it certainly suggests that the underlying momentum and strategy seem to be working, but let me come back and reiterate some of the focus areas that have built that momentum this year. Obviously the re-focus and orientation around premium innovation, just aside from recovering some of the transactional elements that moved through foreign exchange, we\u2019ve been very focused on getting premium innovation in the market, we\u2019ve been very focused on delivering revenue growth management and discipline and teaching our commercial teams to execute that differently. We\u2019ve addressed adjacencies in certain markets which tend to give us more margin and value in the categories as well. We\u2019ve talked about our core strategy, which likewise in some of our big businesses around the world, great superior technology going into the market, allowing us to take more value as we move up, and obviously the discipline that we\u2019ve historically had around just taking pricing to recover foreign exchange transaction, and you\u2019ve seen that particularly in the back half of this year, so we\u2019ll have good flow-through of that as we see an environment that you talked about with increasing raw material prices, particularly over the last couple months. So again, it\u2019s our ability to deliver balanced growth, getting the pricing where we need to, but making sure that the innovation is there to continue to drive both volume and price. We see it both in emerging as well as developed markets across the board. Relative to your question on the promotional environment, certainly we\u2019ve seen a slightly more benign promotional environment through the year. Obviously we had some low points, but if you take the back half just as an example in toothpaste, we\u2019re looking now running--the category is running at about 28% of sales on promotion. Pre-COVID, it was running 31, 32, so it\u2019s back to where it was previously, and my sense is there\u2019s discipline in the market. We\u2019ll see what happens post-COVID as consumers move back into stores and foot traffic increases and retailers decide to dial up the promotion piece, but right now it\u2019s more disciplined and we\u2019ll continue to manage that going forward.  But again, I think it comes back to the core strategies of innovation, how we\u2019re thinking about premium, core and adjacencies, and then the other piece of this is a lot of good work around revenue growth management across the world that\u2019s allowing us to get better balance and better quality pricing in the marketplace.\nOperator: Thank you, and we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Andrea, please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Yes, sorry. Sorry, just making sure--yes, hello. I apologize for the problem. My question is on shipments, I guess consumption. If you look at the fourth quarter and how it flows through in the first and perhaps the second quarter, I understand what some of the--when we look at Nielsen, especially in the U.S., we can\u2019t basically see how shipment against consumption is in cat food and all the other categories, so as we look into 2021, how we should be thinking as you see your outlook for volumes. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Two aspects there. I think behind the question is where are inventories relative to the trade and consumers. Certainly following the pantry load that we saw in the first quarter, we saw those inventories come out in subsequent quarters - second, third and in the fourth, and trade inventories obviously, I think, were well in line. A little discontinuity in the fourth quarter and into January, I think as retailers came out of the Christmas season. They overloaded in some commodity categories and they\u2019re looking to balance it across the board, but by and large we\u2019re where we wanted to be. The replenishment of some of the high demand categories is basically there, and we think we\u2019re in a good place relative to where we stand. We still have some opportunities in categories like liquid hand soap and dish, given the heightened demand, but overall inventories are not in a place that has any concern to us. I think what\u2019s interesting, another point behind your question is obviously that our consumption or our shipments are running ahead of some of the market share trends we see around the world, and that again comes back to the point that we\u2019ve talked about before, that our focus has been in driving top line organic growth, getting to where consumers are shopping, and the high growth that we\u2019ve seen obviously in ecommerce and other channels that are non-tracked is obviously in our shipment numbers and not necessarily reflected in the consumption numbers, given that the non-tracked are growing at a significant multiple to the tracked channels today. By and large, I think the strategies of continuing to drive balanced top line growth across the growing channels is certainly delivering the acceleration that you\u2019ve seen in the back half of this year, which has obviously been underpinned by strong advertising support and brand building.\nOperator: Thank you, and we\u2019ll take our next question from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yes, good morning everyone. Noel, I wanted to ask you a question about self diagnostics and self care - I mean, these are increasing trends especially as the population ages, COVID has put kind of a highlight on that. I just wanted to get a sense how--you know, given Colgate\u2019s credentials in science, strong brand name, is this an area that you think you can explore and create a new pillar of growth? Then just piggybacking off of that, how would you do that? Would it be through M&A or could you do it through organic means? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, interesting question, Nik. Strategically when you start looking at some of the behavior changes that we\u2019ve seen in categories like oral health and skin health, let me start with oral health where we obviously have a very strong relationship with the professional community and understanding how they\u2019ve begun to embrace telehealth. What\u2019s interesting is go back two years and telehealth was very much non-existent, and obviously COVID has accelerated trends necessary, and the ability to look at monitoring systems and how those relationships between the dental practitioners and consumers are elevated is a space that we think very, very interesting.  Let\u2019s take the new product that we\u2019ve launched online this year, the Hum electric toothbrush which give you diagnostics live through a consumer app on exactly how you\u2019re brushing your teeth and areas of improvement. We see that as an ongoing trend relative to connecting and building education at home, and you can start to piece it together long term how you then connect that with the profession in terms of a fully integrated end-to-end process. Likewise in skin health, the same thing - we\u2019re starting to see obviously telehealth expand there. We\u2019re seeing do-it-yourself procedures being done more at home. The consumers are much more open to taking part in things like skin peel, as an example, where we\u2019ve launched a new entry level skin peel for PCA that allows us to do more do it at home versus having to come to the derm office. Obviously for the more sophisticated procedures, we continue to partner with consumers to get them into the profession to do that. There\u2019s certainly a trend there. We\u2019ve got people working on that and then opportunity to continue to elevate our partnerships and obviously bring new growth opportunities to the business as we think about connecting both the profession with the consumer with integrated devices. \nOperator: Thank you, and our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thank you. Good morning. Wanted to just get a little bit more detail into the key puts and takes to get to the 3% to 5% organic sales target, obviously volume versus pricing contribution to the top line given that promotion should continue to normalize, and obviously FX turning to a contribution, and then just a little bit of a view in terms of growth rate by product segment, oral care versus personal care and home care and Hill\u2019s. Just trying to get a better sense of your level of visibility and where the flex points might be, given how much the current environment is evolving. Then as you think about what spending is already in the base, particularly for SG&A, versus what you\u2019re planning for 2021, where do you think the areas are for potential upside and downside? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, let\u2019s talk a little bit more on the categories. Obviously the uncertainty we have in the categories is exactly when you\u2019ll see categories normalize relative to some of the accelerated consumption you\u2019ve seen, particularly in COVID-related categories like liquid hand soap, like dish liquid. Our assumptions and plans as we built the 2021 budget were that we would see those begin to normalize in the back half of 2021, albeit at a lower level than we saw growth rates versus 2020 but slightly above the \u201919 levels, so we still expect that we\u2019ll see some opportunities for growth in the first half and then normalizing more in the back half versus \u201919. But again, it depends very much, Olivia, on where you are in the world. As you probably well know, the COVID growth in consumption has been very much driven by the developed markets, particularly North America, to a certain extent some markets in Europe which had some pantry loading in the first quarter, and Australia. You have not seen that in emerging markets; in fact, if you take Africa, to a certain extent Asia, the Middle East, you\u2019ve seen categories, quite frankly, languish and not nearly as robust as you\u2019ve seen in emerging markets, which I think makes our emerging market growth particularly pleasing given the balance that we\u2019ve seen, both in price and volume, across our big emerging markets and the growth that\u2019s come behind that, which has been terrific. Again, balanced growth through the first half of the year, we\u2019ll see things normalize, and that\u2019s built into the current consensus as John laid out.  In terms of advertising, again strategic for us this year. We\u2019ve talked about from the first quarter on that we were going to invest behind the brands. The increased momentum that we\u2019ve seen in the business has allowed us to broaden our spending across more categories, but particularly focused on where we\u2019re seeing significant growth in the categories. Let\u2019s take the Hill\u2019s business, which constituted a big percentage of the advertising increase on the year and in the fourth quarter, and you\u2019ve obviously seen the continued very strong performance on that business. That\u2019s a business with more or less 10% awareness and low brand penetration, so the runway ahead of that business, we believe continues to be very strong and we will continue to obviously put the investment where we\u2019re getting the return on that. Likewise in the North America business, we obviously put more money into some of the premium innovations that we\u2019ve launched in the back half - the whitening pen, the super premium Optic White Renewal toothpaste, some of the work that we\u2019re doing online and being much more targeted in that space. So again, the advertising has been very focused, broad in the sense of allowing us to go after certain categories around the world that we had not been supporting, where we saw some good opportunities, particularly in adjacencies, so we\u2019re quite pleased with our ability strategically to get more investment behind the brands given the health of the P&L.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Morning everyone, and congratulations on the strong results this year. Noel, I wanted to spend some time on your emerging markets business, just specifically around category growth and market share momentum, and then tie that into your outlook for the year. Obviously really strong performance, and that\u2019s been part of the story here, driving the solid results in the back half of the year. Pricing has remained a strong contributor - one kind of understands that with respect to inflation and FX headwinds that the company has been coping with, but I think what\u2019s noteworthy is that volume has been quite resilient in the back half of the year in a way that it wasn\u2019t, even despite the fact you\u2019re lapping tougher year-over-year comparisons. I was hoping you\u2019d spend a moment, is this sort of the rising tide is raising all boats? Have you observed an acceleration in your categories, perhaps owing to increased consumer mobility related to the pandemic, or are you seeing very tangible signs of encouraging market share momentum owing to some of the strategic shifts in spending and investment that you discussed earlier in the call? If you could just tie that in also at a high level, what is the company embedding in its 2021 outlook related to emerging markets. Thank you for all that.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, a lot packed in that question. Let me get to emerging categories. What\u2019s particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year relative to the comparison on developed, and a lot of the good volume growth we\u2019ve driven in those markets again comes back to the strategy - more premium innovation where we were under-indexed. You heard me mention Brazil, where we\u2019ve increased three points in super premium toothpaste, ASPs are up about 12%, and all quality growth in the Brazilian market. Now, we\u2019ve given up a little bit of share at the low end of the price points where we\u2019ve seen some of our competitors driving a lot of volume at low price points, but the quality of our share and the profitability of our share in that market is far better than it was, given the focus on premium innovation. The other point that\u2019s driving good volume growth in emerging markets again is our core. Focusing on core in Asia, a big part of our toothpaste in those markets, where we\u2019ve seen obviously sluggish market growth, are shipments ahead of consumption, which is, I think, a tracked channel issue, again driven by good core innovation - taking pricing, bringing superior value to the consumer, and leveraging some big parts of our business across a couple markets. The third would be the adjacency strategy that we\u2019ve had in emerging markets, whether that\u2019s in Africa, whether that\u2019s in Latin America, looking at adjacencies that we can get good margin accretion in, that have high growth rates. Skin and facial products in Latin America, as an example, behind our Protex brand have performed very, very well, particularly in markets like Brazil. So again, the strategies that we\u2019ve been deploying across innovation, particularly core premium and adjacencies, have played out. The other piece of this is depending on where you are, the emerging growth of ecommerce has been quite important for us, both in developing markets as well as the developed markets. If you take the growth that we\u2019ve seen in emerging, ecommerce is still a low percentage of the total ACV in Latin America and in Africa. Obviously in Asia, the inverse - it\u2019s significant growth in the category right now, and we\u2019ve had terrific performance across our Asian business, particularly in China behind some of the unique innovation that we\u2019ve put in the market.  We\u2019ll see how ecommerce continues to perform as foot traffic increases, but if you take the China piece specifically where we\u2019ve been very focused on driving our online and digital capabilities, we\u2019ve seen our market shares in ecommerce grow nicely in 2020 based on the strategy that we\u2019ve been deploying. Overall, I think we\u2019ve been looking at the channel growth in the right way, we\u2019ve been looking at the portfolio strategies from an innovation standpoint in the right way. Now as COVID gets behind us, you would hope that we\u2019d start to see a re-acceleration of the categories in emerging markets in the back half of 2021, and obviously they\u2019ve been a little bit sluggish given, I think, some of the issues with the mobility in those markets and the significant increase in the virus, particularly in markets like Latin America and in certain markets of Africa. The belief is that in the back half, we\u2019ll see that start to stabilize and we\u2019ll see markets return, which will give us obviously an increased opportunity to continue to drive volume.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. My question actually had to do with India, because I saw the numbers that came out of that division yesterday, and it\u2019s obviously the exception that we actually get to see numbers for a specific country for you. I know it\u2019s small, but the thing that struck me was top line growth was good but not great, but margin expansion was huge, off the charts, and gross margin, I think in India is now north of 70%. I just wanted to ask about it in the context, Noel, of your focus on balanced growth.  Again, India is a small market, but when I think about some of your other big emerging market businesses that should be faster growers over the long term, I think, to help you meet your long-term growth algorithm, at what point do you say, wow, a 70% gross margin in an emerging market business is too high? Are there other countries where margins have really been exploding like that? It just struck me as kind of a surprise in the numbers, and I wondered if there was something more to it in terms of how you think about balancing top line versus bottom line growth over the longer term.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks Wendy. Listen, India is a very important market for us. We were very pleased with the rebound in the growth that we saw in the back half of 2020. Given some of the COVID issues experienced in the first quarter leading to lockdowns at the back end of that quarter and into the second quarter, generating a 7% organic in the third and just shy of 10% organic in the fourth, we think is just a terrific performance. Again, coming back to the strategy, India is very focused, likewise given the strong oral care business we have, on premiumizing that marketplace, and we\u2019ve launched premium SKUs in Vedshakti, which is our new naturals position. We\u2019ve continued to improve on the learning we\u2019re seeing coming out of the naturals segment, which is an important growth opportunity for us. We\u2019ve launched new adjacencies, new pulling oil mouth sprays in the market with anti-bacterial benefits, which have been terrific, so we\u2019re looking at ways to continue to premiumize that business and move pricing up at the same time, which you\u2019ve seen. I talked about it just earlier, the core renovations that we\u2019ve had. A big part of the India business is their core anti-cavity business, and we\u2019ve had a significant re-launch underway for the better part of a year now on the core anti-cavity business, which allowed us to get pricing up as well as drive significant superiority into that product in terms of a consumer benefit. The third would be the revenue growth management aspects that we\u2019re starting to deploy with a lot more discipline and learning, and we\u2019ve got more work to do certainly in emerging markets but we\u2019ve seen great response from the teams getting behind opportunities to look at our promotional spend, specifically price-side architecture and looking for opportunities to drive more margin into the business.  Overall, I think that the focus there is good top line growth - you\u2019ve seen it in the organic, and strategically we think we\u2019ve got some opportunities to continue to accelerate there. The comparisons get a little bit easier in the first half. We\u2019ll obviously have difficult comps more in the back half given what I just stated, but we think the strategy is working and the investment that we\u2019re putting into that market, as you saw from the release yesterday, is delivering. \nOperator: Thank you, and our next question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. I think you mentioned that toothpaste is running maybe 300, 400 basis points below historicals from a promotional standpoint. You\u2019re probably seeing even lower promotional levels in home care categories. I guess--and maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but it sounded to me like you think that these lower promo levels can potentially hold going into 2021 and maybe even beyond. Maybe for 2021 but also just higher level, did you learn something in 2020 about how much promotion is actually needed to drive growth in your categories, and do you think that these lower levels of promotion can potentially sustain longer term?\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thank you. Again, based on how retailers are looking and how we\u2019re partnering with retailers to grow category growth, we\u2019re looking to optimize category by value, and we\u2019ve had a lot more time to spend analyzing how promotion effectiveness is delivering that. Certainly as foot traffic has come down, some of the retailers haven\u2019t pushed more aggressive promotions, but as I mentioned, the promotional levels are slightly below where they were historically - three points, and my sense is post-COVID, you might see those return to normalization, back to the levels that we had historically, but that will be determined. This is an emerging market issue more than anything and the developing--excuse me, developed market issue. In the developing part of the world or in emerging markets, we haven\u2019t seen substantive changes there relative to what we\u2019ve seen historically, so I think what retailers and manufacturers are looking for, how do we continue to drive growth in the categories, everyone is recognizing that innovation is the catalyst to do that, and obviously as things have normalized more around COVID and the demand issues in some of those categories, they\u2019re looking to get back to strategic growth opportunities longer term, and that\u2019s where the innovation comes into play and we\u2019ll continue to bring that to them. So we\u2019re being disciplined on it, the revenue growth management is having some impact on that, obviously, where we\u2019re starting to pull away from promotions that don\u2019t deliver quality into the category and deliver quality into the P&L for us and our retailers, and you\u2019ve seen some of that obviously in that number that I mentioned. But by and large, we\u2019ll probably see things normalize in the back of the year. We\u2019ve planned for that, but again our focus right now is on bringing real value to the categories through premium innovation and re-launching our core businesses in certain parts of the world, which drives real value to the category.\nOperator: Thank you, and our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good morning folks, and welcome Stan. Thank you for sliding me in. At the risk of being chastised by Mr. Faucher later today, I\u2019m going to try to sneak in two quick questions, one tactical and one bigger picture. First on tactical, you mentioned December retail load, you mentioned your comps [indiscernible] quarter pantry stocking, expectation of a bit more of a back half-weighted EM growth story. Should we be braced for a more sluggish start to the year? That\u2019s the tactical question. And bigger picture, ecomm growth, you talked about it a few times. Can you quantify what it is as a percentage of your sales today, how it compares to where you were before, and how, if at all, you\u2019re re-imagining your marketing and media approach in the wake of the shift? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. I think the tactical question, where do we see categories evolving first half versus second half 2021, I think you\u2019re going to see--obviously we saw some of the sluggishness in December in the categories. You\u2019ve heard that from others who have announced, and that\u2019s quite frankly not unexpected. I mean, I think when you see the ongoing way of unemployment, the delays in stimulus, but more importantly moving into the holiday season--and again I\u2019m talking U.S. here, moving into the holiday season, people obviously prioritizing their consumption against other necessities at that time. January, the categories have started to come back slightly, so we\u2019re not terribly concerned. The behavior changes that we\u2019ve seen in the categories, whether it\u2019s liquid hand soap, dish liquid or cleaners, I think are there to stay for while, Jason. We\u2019ll see those, at least from a liquid hand soap standpoint, stay there for the medium and long term. Obviously as people move back into offices and move away from home, you\u2019ll see the impact on dish liquids and APCs, but remember those three categories aren\u2019t a significant percentage of our overall sales. We\u2019ll see the categories, I think, sustain at higher levels in 2019, probably slightly lower than \u201920 as we stated in the first half, and then normalize in the back half. Coming to ecommerce, again a very deliberate focus for us. As I mentioned in my comments, one, bringing in talent from outside, training and developing our commercial organization to understand how to execute a lot more flawlessly in ecommerce, and it requires a lot more effort to do that. The sophistication of dealing effectively in ecommerce is very different, and as you look at the sophistication that we brought to the indirect trade over the last 15 to 20 years, it\u2019s that same level of focus that we\u2019re bringing to the online world now, both from a digital standpoint and from an ecommerce standpoint.  The growth was over 50% in the fourth quarter. Obviously as John mentioned, we exited the year with ecommerce at double-digit percentage of our total sales in the company, and you\u2019ve seen strategically in the key markets where we have focused and where ecommerce has become more prevalent, i.e. China, the U.S. and Hill\u2019s, you\u2019ve seen us obviously driving share, getting the right innovation into that channel, understanding the analytics and learning from that, and building on that momentum. We see that as a continued growth opportunity, but we\u2019re going to be where consumers are shopping and we\u2019ll see those shifts as we go throughout the year, but the important part for us is that our share is still slightly below our general market share in ecommerce where we get share, which is in not very many places, so we\u2019d know direction and we still have more upside growth to be had there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities.\nBill Chappell: Thanks, good morning. If you look back at 2020, just trying to understand, especially for the pet business or for Hill\u2019s, as well as the total business, what type of comparison do you think in terms of--it seems like on the oral care any stockpiling that was done in March and April was kind of de-loaded in the later months, and so on a full-year basis the comps aren\u2019t really that different. Is that fair? Then on pet, I don\u2019t have a good idea just because vet centers were closed, so didn\u2019t know if you felt like the business ran at full capacity throughout the year, at 85% capacity. Just trying to understand as we\u2019re looking at the growth for 2021, what comps you really see.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, let me take the toothpaste one first. As I mentioned, broadly the categories were sluggish in the first half, started to come back a little bit in the back half of the year, and as we accelerated our innovation pace and our advertising, we saw obviously our shipments accelerate in the back half on oral care, particularly in toothpaste. As we look to comp that next year, we\u2019ll see how the behavior transpires in the first half of this year. The key is we\u2019ve got strong innovation, as I mentioned, both coming out of 2020 as well as a first half innovation pipeline, that we think is good, so we\u2019ll see what happens. But again, the message here is understanding the behavior shifts is obviously extraordinarily difficult and very different from market to market around the world. Obviously the U.S. being an important part of our toothpaste business, we\u2019ve seen sluggishness there. Strong pipeline, as you talked about pantry in Q1, but we saw that come out and we\u2019re starting to see a more balanced approach and more normal approach in terms of consumption moving forward, but our focus is to accelerate that category with the innovation that we\u2019re bringing. Hill\u2019s, obviously the comps were difficult last year. We comped those with strong growth this year, so if I come back to the Hill\u2019s strategy, again it\u2019s about how do we continue to deliver solid category growth for our partners. We\u2019re doing that with obviously the premiumization of the category. We\u2019re bringing great new products into the segment, we were pleased to see the prescription diet business start to come back, which I think is representative of a couple aspects on that business which is, one, we\u2019re seeing people return back to veterinarians and the prescription diet business benefiting from that - our Hill\u2019s to Home initiative has certainly helped that. Obviously the balanced growth we\u2019re seeing across geographies, more so than just the U.S. which has been terrific, a strong performance in Europe this year, again both on the base business as well as prescription diet, so we see that obviously moving forward into 2021. The comps are difficult to be sure, but again remember this is a business with really low brand awareness and low brand penetration, and a great, great product offering, so as we get the balance right in terms of our digital spending focused on those growth opportunities that we see and the innovation that we\u2019re bringing, both in the prescription on the Science Diet side, we see obviously the ability to continue to lap those comparisons that we\u2019ve had this year. The category continues to be strong, between 3% and 5% growth depending on where you are in the world, and obviously the new channels that we\u2019re experiencing growth, specifically ecommerce continue to deliver on that. So again, I think the right level of premiumization, the right channel focus, the right focus on continuing to invest in a business, which you\u2019ll see in 2021, to drive brand awareness and bringing science-based nutrition to the category, which I think is positioned well based on how consumers are behaving. Comps are tough and we realize that, but we think we\u2019ve got good plans in place for 2021.\nOperator: Thank you, and our next question will come from Kamil Jagrulla [ph] with Credit Suisse.\nKamil Jagrulla: Hi guys, good morning. It wasn\u2019t that long ago, I guess, we were talking about local brands in many of these emerging markets taking share, and it sounds like those share losses have abated, but also if maybe you can provide some context on what\u2019s happened competitively in some of those markets today - you know, did they make it through--are they just as a competitive as they were, did they make it through the pandemic? Obviously you just talked about how trends in many of those markets have slowed and a whole set of other complexities where perhaps you were able to survive in a much better position than them. If you can just give some context on what\u2019s happening in some of those major markets, that\u2019d be helpful.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Listen - you\u2019ve heard it, I think from others, there has been a return to big brands over the course of COVID, and obviously the importance of health and hygiene and trust played into that resurgence, and ultimately as consumers move back into stores and you get the benefit of displays, you will see perhaps some of the local brands reorient themselves and get some benefit of that. But if you look at the online world, obviously the big players have really figured out how to target more effectively, how to spend in the right mediums, which was historically a space that local brands and some of the insurgent brands were taking, and so over time local brands will always be a threat, but I think as you\u2019ve seen through COVID, a resurgence to big brand trust and reputation, and obviously as we continue to bring a strong innovation pipeline to reward those consumers who have come into the franchise and continue to deliver against their expectations, we feel good about the movements moving forward. But I would say we never want to count local brands out. We continue to keep them very much at the forefront of our strategy and look at them very, very carefully in terms of how they\u2019re orienting themselves locally, based on the insights required to win, and we feel like the innovation structure that we\u2019ve put in place around the world in terms of our focus on H1, H2 and H3 and being more local where required, will hopefully address those increasing challenges that we\u2019ll see as foot traffic increases in the back half.\nOperator: Thank you, and our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Thanks. Hey guys, good morning. Noel, I wanted to hear a little bit more around your expected gross margin drivers into \u201921, obviously off a very strong 2020. Can you pull apart those puts and takes that John started talking about at the beginning any further? My real question underneath that is John had laid out a couple of caveats - raw materials, inflation, and others - as potentially pressuring gross profit progression as the year progresses, but it didn\u2019t sound like you expected those would be severe enough to actually turn gross margins negative year-over-year, but more simply just govern the expansion. Is that the right read, or does the lower end of your EPS guidance range actually allow for a scenario where gross margins face some actual contraction if some of those uncertainties break the wrong way? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks Steve. Again, let me walk through perhaps the margin roll forward on the quarter and the year. Obviously we delivered coming out of the third quarter with a 60.2 margin, we delivered 130 of pricing benefit to the margin funding the growth, which was 280 basis points, and you saw the acceleration in raw materials give us a headwind of 320 on the quarter, but ultimately we were able to deliver 90 gross margin points of growth in the quarter and on the year it was 130, with headwinds of around 230 on the year. I think the important aspect here is good back half pricing that we generated across all of our markets, and that back half will obviously roll through to help compensate some of the increases that we\u2019ll see in 2021. Now that being said, raw materials are running slightly ahead of what we anticipated for the year in 2021, so we need to ensure obviously that we get that pricing to hold, which we will do our best to do. We need to continue to bring premium innovation into the market. We need to continue to focus on the strong funding to growth and the productivity that we have in the P&L to ensure that if raw materials grow even further, we\u2019re able to compensate that in the market. The volatility we\u2019ve seen on raw materials over the years, again it puts us in a place to reorient our focus around getting the innovation in the market, getting the productivity and the revenue growth management initiated, but I think the good story that we have, at least we\u2019re in a position where we took strong back half advertising--excuse me, strong back half pricing in order to help us deliver a flow-through of that into the first half. But again, that\u2019s based on the current rates that we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ll see how that behaves over the next couple of months. We\u2019re mindful of that, we feel good about our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion, but based on the current input costs that we have and the current spot rates that we\u2019re seeing on foreign exchange. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I was curious about M&A, and actually more specifically the strategy with regard to premium skin, because with your core and organic strategies - you know, investments working presumably so well and building momentum from here with all the advertising support and innovation you\u2019ve got, I was just curious about the role that premium skin will play going forward. I think at the time to me, when you started building that out, it felt a little bit like trying to look for another leg to the stool as things were a bit slower in the core business. I was just wondering how that fits together looking forward, again with the success you\u2019ve having on the core.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks Lauren. Listen, skin continues to be a really exciting category for us long term. You look at the demographics globally, you look at the economics of that category and you look at where we have made careful choices on where to compete, particularly around professional skin health, so we like the dynamics of the category strategically. Obviously post the acquisitions, we ran into a significant headwind related to COVID, particularly with foot traffic starting in derm offices, foot traffic basically coming to a halt in spas, foot traffic obviously related to travel retail coming to a halt in 2020, so we started to see importantly in the fourth quarter this year, we started to see growth back in those categories, which is terrific. We\u2019ve spent the year, Lauren, and this is a real benefit, I think, to the quality of the performance we had this year, we spent the year investing behind those businesses. We weren\u2019t taking cost out; we were looking to optimize the cost, we were looking to build more capabilities in those businesses, so we had the benefit of spending behind those brands and capabilities to set ourselves up for obviously what we would expect to see a return to growth in those categories, particularly coming out of COVID, likely in the back half. But as John mentioned, we saw some growth of those businesses in the fourth quarter, which was terrific, and we think we\u2019ve set ourselves up relative to seeing those businesses deliver good, sustainable growth for us longer term, and it continues to be a real strategic growth opportunity for us in the long run, hence the reason why we decided to invest in those specific areas that we think give us a unique opportunity to add value to and drive incremental growth in the longer term.  But again, businesses that were severely impacted based on COVID, but again giving us the opportunity to truly understand and build capabilities that we think, long term, those categories will perform quite well.\nOperator: Thank you, and our next question will come from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. I was wondering if you could drill down on the China oral care business. You made a lot of improvements with Darlie and with ecommerce, both with Colgate and Darlie, so maybe an update of where you are with that; and then if I remember right, the challenge was getting Colgate going on the brick and mortar channel, so maybe an update on all those issues. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Again, this was a complete re-look at our strategy in China over the last year. As we alluded to, we expected performance in 2019 to improve in the back half based on those strategies, which it did. We obviously had the significant impact from COVID in the first and second quarters in China, which impacted the business, and we\u2019ve seen the business obviously respond quite well in the back half of this year, in line with the expectations that we have. Our particular focus was around building our go-to-market out differently, specifically with relates to how we want to think about innovation in the online world, which has now become a pretty significant part of that business in China, and pleasingly we have seen shares grow nicely online - again, I think a testament to a reorientation behind premium innovation.  An interesting index for you - pre-COVID or pre-the re-launch strategy in China, our indexes were running around 80% in the online world versus the category, so 20% below the category. Coming out of COVID and into the fourth quarter, our indexes are now running north of 110% to the category on average, so again clear, focused orientation around premiumizing our business, delivering online premium innovation like the Miracle Repair line, like some of the focus that we\u2019ve done in electric toothbrushes have allowed us to really drive the pricing in that category, which has driven incremental value share. Now, the brick and mortar continues to be a bit soft on the Colgate side, quite strong on the Darlie side. Again, the Colgate side is against the significant changes we\u2019ve made in some of our go-to-market that\u2019s taking a little bit more time and obviously impacted by the fact that foot traffic in China was down quite significantly, particularly in hypers and supers as consumers moved online as a result of both behavior change and COVID.  Overall, pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making in China, pleased with the go-to-market changes that are starting to take hold, and encouraged by the early signs of growth momentum in ecommerce and our ability to deliver product innovation digitally in a more effective way.\nOperator: Thank you, and our final question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning everybody. I guess I wanted to ask you maybe a bigger picture question to end here. Overall EBIT margin is down a bit in recent years - I think you ended 2020 around where you were in 2012 or so, but sales have obviously accelerated, so how do you think about the give and take here? Can EBIT margin go back to where it was pre-2019, and if so, how do you think about contribution by line item - you know, gross margin, can that expand realistically from here, SG&A? Is ad spend, which is now above where it was a couple of years ago, at the right level, is it too high, too low? If you can just give some bigger picture thoughts there, that\u2019d be helpful, please.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. First of all, growing operating margin long term starts with obviously delivering sustained top line growth, and that\u2019s been our focus, and revenue is the best creator of operating leverage. Secondly, we have many levers that we use to drive growth, and you\u2019ve heard me talk about quite a few of those today - obviously premiumization efforts, which drive more leverage through the P&L, our revenue growth management efforts which translate right through the P&L as well, you saw the examples I talked about in big markets like Brazil which are certainly bearing fruit, the personal care and home care leverage that we\u2019ve seen obviously in those categories, and as we expect oral care to re-accelerate, it will drive more leverage through the P&L.  Obviously funding the growth and productivity is a real focus for us. Great funding the growth in the back half of 2020, a real dialed-up orientation behind some opportunities particularly around our supply chain and looking at our supply chain differently to drive more efficiency of that moving forward, which we think will translate into more leverage.  The real cause of that--of your point there was obviously an acceleration in our spending and increased logistics costs, which impacted a bit on the leverage, and those logistics costs, we hope will subside in the back half. We\u2019re looking at ways to continue to optimize our warehousing and freight services around the world and very focused on finding opportunities to be more efficient there, but the key driver of it is again investing for the long term health of this business and putting advertising into categories and key geographies where we\u2019re seeing real return on growth, as I mentioned particularly Hill\u2019s, the U.S., China, as well as India.  So overall, we\u2019ll see that leverage come through, but our focus right now is delivering operating margin growth through the top line and continuing to accelerate gross margins to allow us to spend behind the business, so overall it\u2019s about growth and we\u2019ll see that leverage come through as we continue to deliver that.\nOperator: Thank you, and at this time we\u2019ll turn the conference over to Mr. Wallace and presenters for any final or closing remarks. \nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks. Again, a strong quarter, pleasing to see obviously the broad-based growth we had on the business, and very pleased around the capability building and how we\u2019re thinking about the business and the changes that we made throughout 2020. Again, to all Colgate people who are really behind this success, thank you for your commitment to our values and our purpose. Thank you for everything that you\u2019ve done. I\u2019m deeply grateful for your commitment to the business and always optimistic that the way we work together, we\u2019re going to continue to build a healthier future for all. Thanks everyone. Stay safe, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks John, and good morning everyone. Like me, I hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and you share some sense of optimism that we can return to a more normal existence over the course of this year. I want to welcome Stan Sutulla to the first Colgate-Palmolive earnings call. Stan joined us back in November, as we announced, and obviously we're deeply excited to have him here. He's hit the ground running already. As I reflected on 2020, I'm so proud of the Colgate people around the world and what they've accomplished. Our first quarter call, I discussed three topics related to how we planned to manage through the crisis. These three topics were staying true to our values and purpose and helping us navigate a very difficult environment, adapting our strategies where necessary and executing with agility, and importantly managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future.  On the first topic, we've implemented programs to keep our employees safe and healthy while keeping our supply chain and our laboratories up and running and delivering record output from our facilities and our R&D organization. Nothing is more important than the safety and health of Colgate people and we will continue in 2021 to keep them as our first priority. We worked with the World Health Organization this year in local hospitals to distribute free health and hygiene products to people all over the world to help stop the spread of COVID and enable people to live healthier lives, programs that Colgate people are deeply proud of.  In the second area, we continued to execute on our growth mindset strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth through more impactful premium innovation, which you'll hear more about at CAGNY, increasing our brand building globally, and executing against our digital transformation. As John laid out, we did this all while delivering strong and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share, and free cash flow. We were able to achieve those results despite many operating challenges we confronted and a sizeable negative impact from foreign exchange. Most importantly, while we've been delivering on 2020 results, we have been very focused on positioning ourselves for growth in 2021 and beyond by taking advantage of our momentum, and that was the third topic - managing through this crisis with an eye towards the future. Now I'll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond. There are three reasons. The first is that as an organization, we have truly changed how we think about growth. As a company with leading brands, we have to be focused on driving category growth, and we can drive this growth in many ways. Of course, we can increase the number of people buying our products, we can increase the price that people are willing to pay for our products, and we can increase the frequency of how often people use our products. We have strengthened existing tools and, importantly, built new capabilities to drive this growth. For example, on Hill's we're reaching a much larger group of consumers through increased advertising to broaden our reach and improving our digital targeting so we can raise brand awareness and household penetration in what is truly a differentiated brand. Think about this as finding the right person with the right message at the right time. It's not just spending more, but spending smarter. In Latin America, we have used revenue growth management tools to drive value with price mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment. For instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by three points in the last two years, all driven by tactical and strategic revenue growth management.  As I discussed at the Barclays conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products. Pure performance, new forms, delivery systems and innovation for new channels all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently, and given that Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth. The second reason is that we're developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth. We know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can't just grow the top line, we need to deliver profitable growth. You can see this in our 2020 results where we delivered 8% earnings per share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization. We're doing this by pulling on all the levers: premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads, and laser focused on all cost elements throughout the income statement.  Looking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas, so that we can continue to invest in the transformational capabilities that we're deploying and that will rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively.  The third reason is that we're making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people. As anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched. In 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth. To that end, we made real progress on ecommerce, where we have brought in more external talent while up-skilling existing talent across the enterprise, launched more online-specific innovation like the Optic White Pen and the Miracle Repair Serum, and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities. All of this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter and we'll exit the year with ecommerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales. Lastly, it's building out the right team. You need to provide the right tools to them, the right technology to digitally transform the organization. We continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation, like our transition SAP S/4HANA that's giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes, and simplified transactions. We've developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed and capability building, our ability now to develop applications much faster and realize the value of those applications much faster, and with our partners building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead. We also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate business planning process - you will remember that was called CBP, that will significantly reduce the process time required by providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management. To sum it up, I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results. I would also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future. With that, I'll be happy to take your questions. Yes, thanks Dara. Let me come back again, I guess overarching in terms of strategy for us, because it plays into obviously our ability to deliver sustained profitable growth, which is a balance between volume and price. Obviously you can look at the details with volume and price across all divisions and categories - it certainly suggests that the underlying momentum and strategy seem to be working, but let me come back and reiterate some of the focus areas that have built that momentum this year. Obviously the re-focus and orientation around premium innovation, just aside from recovering some of the transactional elements that moved through foreign exchange, we've been very focused on getting premium innovation in the market, we've been very focused on delivering revenue growth management and discipline and teaching our commercial teams to execute that differently. We've addressed adjacencies in certain markets which tend to give us more margin and value in the categories as well. We've talked about our core strategy, which likewise in some of our big businesses around the world, great superior technology going into the market, allowing us to take more value as we move up, and obviously the discipline that we've historically had around just taking pricing to recover foreign exchange transaction, and you've seen that particularly in the back half of this year, so we'll have good flow-through of that as we see an environment that you talked about with increasing raw material prices, particularly over the last couple months. So again, it's our ability to deliver balanced growth, getting the pricing where we need to, but making sure that the innovation is there to continue to drive both volume and price. We see it both in emerging as well as developed markets across the board. Relative to your question on the promotional environment, certainly we've seen a slightly more benign promotional environment through the year. Obviously we had some low points, but if you take the back half just as an example in toothpaste, we're looking now running--the category is running at about 28% of sales on promotion. Pre-COVID, it was running 31, 32, so it's back to where it was previously, and my sense is there's discipline in the market. We'll see what happens post-COVID as consumers move back into stores and foot traffic increases and retailers decide to dial up the promotion piece, but right now it's more disciplined and we'll continue to manage that going forward.  But again, I think it comes back to the core strategies of innovation, how we're thinking about premium, core and adjacencies, and then the other piece of this is a lot of good work around revenue growth management across the world that's allowing us to get better balance and better quality pricing in the marketplace. Sure. Two aspects there. I think behind the question is where are inventories relative to the trade and consumers. Certainly following the pantry load that we saw in the first quarter, we saw those inventories come out in subsequent quarters - second, third and in the fourth, and trade inventories obviously, I think, were well in line. A little discontinuity in the fourth quarter and into January, I think as retailers came out of the Christmas season. They overloaded in some commodity categories and they're looking to balance it across the board, but by and large we're where we wanted to be. The replenishment of some of the high demand categories is basically there, and we think we're in a good place relative to where we stand. We still have some opportunities in categories like liquid hand soap and dish, given the heightened demand, but overall inventories are not in a place that has any concern to us. I think what's interesting, another point behind your question is obviously that our consumption or our shipments are running ahead of some of the market share trends we see around the world, and that again comes back to the point that we've talked about before, that our focus has been in driving top line organic growth, getting to where consumers are shopping, and the high growth that we've seen obviously in ecommerce and other channels that are non-tracked is obviously in our shipment numbers and not necessarily reflected in the consumption numbers, given that the non-tracked are growing at a significant multiple to the tracked channels today. By and large, I think the strategies of continuing to drive balanced top line growth across the growing channels is certainly delivering the acceleration that you've seen in the back half of this year, which has obviously been underpinned by strong advertising support and brand building. Yes, interesting question, Nik. Strategically when you start looking at some of the behavior changes that we've seen in categories like oral health and skin health, let me start with oral health where we obviously have a very strong relationship with the professional community and understanding how they've begun to embrace telehealth. What's interesting is go back two years and telehealth was very much non-existent, and obviously COVID has accelerated trends necessary, and the ability to look at monitoring systems and how those relationships between the dental practitioners and consumers are elevated is a space that we think very, very interesting.  Let's take the new product that we've launched online this year, the Hum electric toothbrush which give you diagnostics live through a consumer app on exactly how you're brushing your teeth and areas of improvement. We see that as an ongoing trend relative to connecting and building education at home, and you can start to piece it together long term how you then connect that with the profession in terms of a fully integrated end-to-end process. Likewise in skin health, the same thing - we're starting to see obviously telehealth expand there. We're seeing do-it-yourself procedures being done more at home. The consumers are much more open to taking part in things like skin peel, as an example, where we've launched a new entry level skin peel for PCA that allows us to do more do it at home versus having to come to the derm office. Obviously for the more sophisticated procedures, we continue to partner with consumers to get them into the profession to do that. There's certainly a trend there. We've got people working on that and then opportunity to continue to elevate our partnerships and obviously bring new growth opportunities to the business as we think about connecting both the profession with the consumer with integrated devices. Sure, let's talk a little bit more on the categories. Obviously the uncertainty we have in the categories is exactly when you'll see categories normalize relative to some of the accelerated consumption you've seen, particularly in COVID-related categories like liquid hand soap, like dish liquid. Our assumptions and plans as we built the 2021 budget were that we would see those begin to normalize in the back half of 2021, albeit at a lower level than we saw growth rates versus 2020 but slightly above the '19 levels, so we still expect that we'll see some opportunities for growth in the first half and then normalizing more in the back half versus '19. But again, it depends very much, Olivia, on where you are in the world. As you probably well know, the COVID growth in consumption has been very much driven by the developed markets, particularly North America, to a certain extent some markets in Europe which had some pantry loading in the first quarter, and Australia. You have not seen that in emerging markets; in fact, if you take Africa, to a certain extent Asia, the Middle East, you've seen categories, quite frankly, languish and not nearly as robust as you've seen in emerging markets, which I think makes our emerging market growth particularly pleasing given the balance that we've seen, both in price and volume, across our big emerging markets and the growth that's come behind that, which has been terrific. Again, balanced growth through the first half of the year, we'll see things normalize, and that's built into the current consensus as John laid out.  In terms of advertising, again strategic for us this year. We've talked about from the first quarter on that we were going to invest behind the brands. The increased momentum that we've seen in the business has allowed us to broaden our spending across more categories, but particularly focused on where we're seeing significant growth in the categories. Let's take the Hill's business, which constituted a big percentage of the advertising increase on the year and in the fourth quarter, and you've obviously seen the continued very strong performance on that business. That's a business with more or less 10% awareness and low brand penetration, so the runway ahead of that business, we believe continues to be very strong and we will continue to obviously put the investment where we're getting the return on that. Likewise in the North America business, we obviously put more money into some of the premium innovations that we've launched in the back half - the whitening pen, the super premium Optic White Renewal toothpaste, some of the work that we're doing online and being much more targeted in that space. So again, the advertising has been very focused, broad in the sense of allowing us to go after certain categories around the world that we had not been supporting, where we saw some good opportunities, particularly in adjacencies, so we're quite pleased with our ability strategically to get more investment behind the brands given the health of the P&L. Sure, a lot packed in that question. Let me get to emerging categories. What's particularly pleasing on our performance this year is that, as I mentioned to Olivia, we've seen a slowdown in some of the categories in emerging markets this year relative to the comparison on developed, and a lot of the good volume growth we've driven in those markets again comes back to the strategy - more premium innovation where we were under-indexed. You heard me mention Brazil, where we've increased three points in super premium toothpaste, ASPs are up about 12%, and all quality growth in the Brazilian market. Now, we've given up a little bit of share at the low end of the price points where we've seen some of our competitors driving a lot of volume at low price points, but the quality of our share and the profitability of our share in that market is far better than it was, given the focus on premium innovation. The other point that's driving good volume growth in emerging markets again is our core. Focusing on core in Asia, a big part of our toothpaste in those markets, where we've seen obviously sluggish market growth, are shipments ahead of consumption, which is, I think, a tracked channel issue, again driven by good core innovation - taking pricing, bringing superior value to the consumer, and leveraging some big parts of our business across a couple markets. The third would be the adjacency strategy that we've had in emerging markets, whether that's in Africa, whether that's in Latin America, looking at adjacencies that we can get good margin accretion in, that have high growth rates. Skin and facial products in Latin America, as an example, behind our Protex brand have performed very, very well, particularly in markets like Brazil. So again, the strategies that we've been deploying across innovation, particularly core premium and adjacencies, have played out. The other piece of this is depending on where you are, the emerging growth of ecommerce has been quite important for us, both in developing markets as well as the developed markets. If you take the growth that we've seen in emerging, ecommerce is still a low percentage of the total ACV in Latin America and in Africa. Obviously in Asia, the inverse - it's significant growth in the category right now, and we've had terrific performance across our Asian business, particularly in China behind some of the unique innovation that we've put in the market.  We'll see how ecommerce continues to perform as foot traffic increases, but if you take the China piece specifically where we've been very focused on driving our online and digital capabilities, we've seen our market shares in ecommerce grow nicely in 2020 based on the strategy that we've been deploying. Overall, I think we've been looking at the channel growth in the right way, we've been looking at the portfolio strategies from an innovation standpoint in the right way. Now as COVID gets behind us, you would hope that we'd start to see a re-acceleration of the categories in emerging markets in the back half of 2021, and obviously they've been a little bit sluggish given, I think, some of the issues with the mobility in those markets and the significant increase in the virus, particularly in markets like Latin America and in certain markets of Africa. The belief is that in the back half, we'll see that start to stabilize and we'll see markets return, which will give us obviously an increased opportunity to continue to drive volume. Yes, thanks Wendy. Listen, India is a very important market for us. We were very pleased with the rebound in the growth that we saw in the back half of 2020. Given some of the COVID issues experienced in the first quarter leading to lockdowns at the back end of that quarter and into the second quarter, generating a 7% organic in the third and just shy of 10% organic in the fourth, we think is just a terrific performance. Again, coming back to the strategy, India is very focused, likewise given the strong oral care business we have, on premiumizing that marketplace, and we've launched premium SKUs in Vedshakti, which is our new naturals position. We've continued to improve on the learning we're seeing coming out of the naturals segment, which is an important growth opportunity for us. We've launched new adjacencies, new pulling oil mouth sprays in the market with anti-bacterial benefits, which have been terrific, so we're looking at ways to continue to premiumize that business and move pricing up at the same time, which you've seen. I talked about it just earlier, the core renovations that we've had. A big part of the India business is their core anti-cavity business, and we've had a significant re-launch underway for the better part of a year now on the core anti-cavity business, which allowed us to get pricing up as well as drive significant superiority into that product in terms of a consumer benefit. The third would be the revenue growth management aspects that we're starting to deploy with a lot more discipline and learning, and we've got more work to do certainly in emerging markets but we've seen great response from the teams getting behind opportunities to look at our promotional spend, specifically price-side architecture and looking for opportunities to drive more margin into the business.  Overall, I think that the focus there is good top line growth - you've seen it in the organic, and strategically we think we've got some opportunities to continue to accelerate there. The comparisons get a little bit easier in the first half. We'll obviously have difficult comps more in the back half given what I just stated, but we think the strategy is working and the investment that we're putting into that market, as you saw from the release yesterday, is delivering. Yes, thank you. Again, based on how retailers are looking and how we're partnering with retailers to grow category growth, we're looking to optimize category by value, and we've had a lot more time to spend analyzing how promotion effectiveness is delivering that. Certainly as foot traffic has come down, some of the retailers haven't pushed more aggressive promotions, but as I mentioned, the promotional levels are slightly below where they were historically - three points, and my sense is post-COVID, you might see those return to normalization, back to the levels that we had historically, but that will be determined. This is an emerging market issue more than anything and the developing--excuse me, developed market issue. In the developing part of the world or in emerging markets, we haven't seen substantive changes there relative to what we've seen historically, so I think what retailers and manufacturers are looking for, how do we continue to drive growth in the categories, everyone is recognizing that innovation is the catalyst to do that, and obviously as things have normalized more around COVID and the demand issues in some of those categories, they're looking to get back to strategic growth opportunities longer term, and that's where the innovation comes into play and we'll continue to bring that to them. So we're being disciplined on it, the revenue growth management is having some impact on that, obviously, where we're starting to pull away from promotions that don't deliver quality into the category and deliver quality into the P&L for us and our retailers, and you've seen some of that obviously in that number that I mentioned. But by and large, we'll probably see things normalize in the back of the year. We've planned for that, but again our focus right now is on bringing real value to the categories through premium innovation and re-launching our core businesses in certain parts of the world, which drives real value to the category. Sure. I think the tactical question, where do we see categories evolving first half versus second half 2021, I think you're going to see--obviously we saw some of the sluggishness in December in the categories. You've heard that from others who have announced, and that's quite frankly not unexpected. I mean, I think when you see the ongoing way of unemployment, the delays in stimulus, but more importantly moving into the holiday season--and again I'm talking U.S. here, moving into the holiday season, people obviously prioritizing their consumption against other necessities at that time. January, the categories have started to come back slightly, so we're not terribly concerned. The behavior changes that we've seen in the categories, whether it's liquid hand soap, dish liquid or cleaners, I think are there to stay for while, Jason. We'll see those, at least from a liquid hand soap standpoint, stay there for the medium and long term. Obviously as people move back into offices and move away from home, you'll see the impact on dish liquids and APCs, but remember those three categories aren't a significant percentage of our overall sales. We'll see the categories, I think, sustain at higher levels in 2019, probably slightly lower than '20 as we stated in the first half, and then normalize in the back half. Coming to ecommerce, again a very deliberate focus for us. As I mentioned in my comments, one, bringing in talent from outside, training and developing our commercial organization to understand how to execute a lot more flawlessly in ecommerce, and it requires a lot more effort to do that. The sophistication of dealing effectively in ecommerce is very different, and as you look at the sophistication that we brought to the indirect trade over the last 15 to 20 years, it's that same level of focus that we're bringing to the online world now, both from a digital standpoint and from an ecommerce standpoint.  The growth was over 50% in the fourth quarter. Obviously as John mentioned, we exited the year with ecommerce at double-digit percentage of our total sales in the company, and you've seen strategically in the key markets where we have focused and where ecommerce has become more prevalent, i.e. China, the U.S. and Hill's, you've seen us obviously driving share, getting the right innovation into that channel, understanding the analytics and learning from that, and building on that momentum. We see that as a continued growth opportunity, but we're going to be where consumers are shopping and we'll see those shifts as we go throughout the year, but the important part for us is that our share is still slightly below our general market share in ecommerce where we get share, which is in not very many places, so we'd know direction and we still have more upside growth to be had there. Sure, let me take the toothpaste one first. As I mentioned, broadly the categories were sluggish in the first half, started to come back a little bit in the back half of the year, and as we accelerated our innovation pace and our advertising, we saw obviously our shipments accelerate in the back half on oral care, particularly in toothpaste. As we look to comp that next year, we'll see how the behavior transpires in the first half of this year. The key is we've got strong innovation, as I mentioned, both coming out of 2020 as well as a first half innovation pipeline, that we think is good, so we'll see what happens. But again, the message here is understanding the behavior shifts is obviously extraordinarily difficult and very different from market to market around the world. Obviously the U.S. being an important part of our toothpaste business, we've seen sluggishness there. Strong pipeline, as you talked about pantry in Q1, but we saw that come out and we're starting to see a more balanced approach and more normal approach in terms of consumption moving forward, but our focus is to accelerate that category with the innovation that we're bringing. Hill's, obviously the comps were difficult last year. We comped those with strong growth this year, so if I come back to the Hill's strategy, again it's about how do we continue to deliver solid category growth for our partners. We're doing that with obviously the premiumization of the category. We're bringing great new products into the segment, we were pleased to see the prescription diet business start to come back, which I think is representative of a couple aspects on that business which is, one, we're seeing people return back to veterinarians and the prescription diet business benefiting from that - our Hill's to Home initiative has certainly helped that. Obviously the balanced growth we're seeing across geographies, more so than just the U.S. which has been terrific, a strong performance in Europe this year, again both on the base business as well as prescription diet, so we see that obviously moving forward into 2021. The comps are difficult to be sure, but again remember this is a business with really low brand awareness and low brand penetration, and a great, great product offering, so as we get the balance right in terms of our digital spending focused on those growth opportunities that we see and the innovation that we're bringing, both in the prescription on the Science Diet side, we see obviously the ability to continue to lap those comparisons that we've had this year. The category continues to be strong, between 3% and 5% growth depending on where you are in the world, and obviously the new channels that we're experiencing growth, specifically ecommerce continue to deliver on that. So again, I think the right level of premiumization, the right channel focus, the right focus on continuing to invest in a business, which you'll see in 2021, to drive brand awareness and bringing science-based nutrition to the category, which I think is positioned well based on how consumers are behaving. Comps are tough and we realize that, but we think we've got good plans in place for 2021. Sure. Listen - you've heard it, I think from others, there has been a return to big brands over the course of COVID, and obviously the importance of health and hygiene and trust played into that resurgence, and ultimately as consumers move back into stores and you get the benefit of displays, you will see perhaps some of the local brands reorient themselves and get some benefit of that. But if you look at the online world, obviously the big players have really figured out how to target more effectively, how to spend in the right mediums, which was historically a space that local brands and some of the insurgent brands were taking, and so over time local brands will always be a threat, but I think as you've seen through COVID, a resurgence to big brand trust and reputation, and obviously as we continue to bring a strong innovation pipeline to reward those consumers who have come into the franchise and continue to deliver against their expectations, we feel good about the movements moving forward. But I would say we never want to count local brands out. We continue to keep them very much at the forefront of our strategy and look at them very, very carefully in terms of how they're orienting themselves locally, based on the insights required to win, and we feel like the innovation structure that we've put in place around the world in terms of our focus on H1, H2 and H3 and being more local where required, will hopefully address those increasing challenges that we'll see as foot traffic increases in the back half. Yes, thanks Steve. Again, let me walk through perhaps the margin roll forward on the quarter and the year. Obviously we delivered coming out of the third quarter with a 60.2 margin, we delivered 130 of pricing benefit to the margin funding the growth, which was 280 basis points, and you saw the acceleration in raw materials give us a headwind of 320 on the quarter, but ultimately we were able to deliver 90 gross margin points of growth in the quarter and on the year it was 130, with headwinds of around 230 on the year. I think the important aspect here is good back half pricing that we generated across all of our markets, and that back half will obviously roll through to help compensate some of the increases that we'll see in 2021. Now that being said, raw materials are running slightly ahead of what we anticipated for the year in 2021, so we need to ensure obviously that we get that pricing to hold, which we will do our best to do. We need to continue to bring premium innovation into the market. We need to continue to focus on the strong funding to growth and the productivity that we have in the P&L to ensure that if raw materials grow even further, we're able to compensate that in the market. The volatility we've seen on raw materials over the years, again it puts us in a place to reorient our focus around getting the innovation in the market, getting the productivity and the revenue growth management initiated, but I think the good story that we have, at least we're in a position where we took strong back half advertising--excuse me, strong back half pricing in order to help us deliver a flow-through of that into the first half. But again, that's based on the current rates that we're seeing. We'll see how that behaves over the next couple of months. We're mindful of that, we feel good about our ability to deliver the gross margin expansion, but based on the current input costs that we have and the current spot rates that we're seeing on foreign exchange. Yes, thanks Lauren. Listen, skin continues to be a really exciting category for us long term. You look at the demographics globally, you look at the economics of that category and you look at where we have made careful choices on where to compete, particularly around professional skin health, so we like the dynamics of the category strategically. Obviously post the acquisitions, we ran into a significant headwind related to COVID, particularly with foot traffic starting in derm offices, foot traffic basically coming to a halt in spas, foot traffic obviously related to travel retail coming to a halt in 2020, so we started to see importantly in the fourth quarter this year, we started to see growth back in those categories, which is terrific. We've spent the year, Lauren, and this is a real benefit, I think, to the quality of the performance we had this year, we spent the year investing behind those businesses. We weren't taking cost out; we were looking to optimize the cost, we were looking to build more capabilities in those businesses, so we had the benefit of spending behind those brands and capabilities to set ourselves up for obviously what we would expect to see a return to growth in those categories, particularly coming out of COVID, likely in the back half. But as John mentioned, we saw some growth of those businesses in the fourth quarter, which was terrific, and we think we've set ourselves up relative to seeing those businesses deliver good, sustainable growth for us longer term, and it continues to be a real strategic growth opportunity for us in the long run, hence the reason why we decided to invest in those specific areas that we think give us a unique opportunity to add value to and drive incremental growth in the longer term.  But again, businesses that were severely impacted based on COVID, but again giving us the opportunity to truly understand and build capabilities that we think, long term, those categories will perform quite well. Sure. Again, this was a complete re-look at our strategy in China over the last year. As we alluded to, we expected performance in 2019 to improve in the back half based on those strategies, which it did. We obviously had the significant impact from COVID in the first and second quarters in China, which impacted the business, and we've seen the business obviously respond quite well in the back half of this year, in line with the expectations that we have. Our particular focus was around building our go-to-market out differently, specifically with relates to how we want to think about innovation in the online world, which has now become a pretty significant part of that business in China, and pleasingly we have seen shares grow nicely online - again, I think a testament to a reorientation behind premium innovation.  An interesting index for you - pre-COVID or pre-the re-launch strategy in China, our indexes were running around 80% in the online world versus the category, so 20% below the category. Coming out of COVID and into the fourth quarter, our indexes are now running north of 110% to the category on average, so again clear, focused orientation around premiumizing our business, delivering online premium innovation like the Miracle Repair line, like some of the focus that we've done in electric toothbrushes have allowed us to really drive the pricing in that category, which has driven incremental value share. Now, the brick and mortar continues to be a bit soft on the Colgate side, quite strong on the Darlie side. Again, the Colgate side is against the significant changes we've made in some of our go-to-market that's taking a little bit more time and obviously impacted by the fact that foot traffic in China was down quite significantly, particularly in hypers and supers as consumers moved online as a result of both behavior change and COVID.  Overall, pleased with the progress that we're making in China, pleased with the go-to-market changes that are starting to take hold, and encouraged by the early signs of growth momentum in ecommerce and our ability to deliver product innovation digitally in a more effective way. Sure. First of all, growing operating margin long term starts with obviously delivering sustained top line growth, and that's been our focus, and revenue is the best creator of operating leverage. Secondly, we have many levers that we use to drive growth, and you've heard me talk about quite a few of those today - obviously premiumization efforts, which drive more leverage through the P&L, our revenue growth management efforts which translate right through the P&L as well, you saw the examples I talked about in big markets like Brazil which are certainly bearing fruit, the personal care and home care leverage that we've seen obviously in those categories, and as we expect oral care to re-accelerate, it will drive more leverage through the P&L.  Obviously funding the growth and productivity is a real focus for us. Great funding the growth in the back half of 2020, a real dialed-up orientation behind some opportunities particularly around our supply chain and looking at our supply chain differently to drive more efficiency of that moving forward, which we think will translate into more leverage.  The real cause of that--of your point there was obviously an acceleration in our spending and increased logistics costs, which impacted a bit on the leverage, and those logistics costs, we hope will subside in the back half. We're looking at ways to continue to optimize our warehousing and freight services around the world and very focused on finding opportunities to be more efficient there, but the key driver of it is again investing for the long term health of this business and putting advertising into categories and key geographies where we're seeing real return on growth, as I mentioned particularly Hill's, the U.S., China, as well as India.  So overall, we'll see that leverage come through, but our focus right now is delivering operating margin growth through the top line and continuing to accelerate gross margins to allow us to spend behind the business, so overall it's about growth and we'll see that leverage come through as we continue to deliver that. Yes, thanks. Again, a strong quarter, pleasing to see obviously the broad-based growth we had on the business, and very pleased around the capability building and how we're thinking about the business and the changes that we made throughout 2020. Again, to all Colgate people who are really behind this success, thank you for your commitment to our values and our purpose. Thank you for everything that you've done. I'm deeply grateful for your commitment to the business and always optimistic that the way we work together, we're going to continue to build a healthier future for all. Thanks everyone. Stay safe, and we'll talk to you soon."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Amanda. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's Web site for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's Web site. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q3 performance and full year guidance before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourselves to one question, so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue. We delivered very strong results in the third quarter consistent with our focus on generating sustainable profitable growth. We delivered both volume and pricing growth. We delivered growth in all four of our categories; oral care, personal care, home care and pet nutrition. And we delivered organic sales growth in every division. Developed markets organic sales growth was 6.5% and emerging markets organic sales growth was 8.5%. The choices we have made in terms of revamping our innovation processes, continuing to drive our digital transformation and investing in our brands are paying off. And as Noel will discuss, we have further opportunities ahead of us. Importantly, this growth is driving our P&L. Our ability to expand our growth margins helped us deliver a double digit percentage increase in base business earnings per share despite continued increased investment in advertising, negative foreign exchange, cost associated with the COVID crisis and headwind from higher logistics costs. Our net sales grew 5.5% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 7.5% was driven by 3% organic volume growth and the 4.5% increase in pricing. The acquisitions of Filorga, Hello and the Nigerian joint venture added an additional 200 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 4% headwind. Our gross profit margin was 61.2%, up 220 basis points year-over-year on both the GAAP and a base business basis. On a base business basis, this was our best year-over-year performance in several years. For the third quarter, pricing was 170 basis points favorable to gross margins while raw materials were a 230 basis point headwind, driven by increases in raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 250 basis point benefit, while other was plus 30 basis points. On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 20 basis points as a percent of sales. On a base business basis, our SG&A was up 90 basis points on a percent of sales basis driven by a 70 basis point increase in advertising for sales as our advertising spending was up 13% year-over-year on an absolute basis, and by a moderate increase in logistics costs as a percent of sales, as we work to meet heightened demand due to COVID-19. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 19% year-over-year, while it was up 11% on a base business basis. Our EPS was up 21% on a GAAP basis and up 11% on a base business basis. We continue to deliver free cash flow growth in the quarter, up 5% year-over-year and up 29% year-to-date. We resumed share repurchases during the quarter as well. And now I have a few comments on our divisional performance. North America delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by a combination of pricing and volume growth. Oral care growth was driven by toothpaste and improved performance in toothbrushes, aided by the launch of our hum by Colgate electric brush later in the quarter. The focus on premium innovation like hum by Colgate, Colgate Optic White Renewal toothpaste, and the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen helped to drive strong pricing growth in oral care. Our personal care and home care businesses continue to benefit from COVID-related demand, particularly in liquid hand soap and dish soap, although our skin health businesses were a drag on growth in the quarter. Overall, we are seeing promotional levels in our categories returning to normal, and we have planned for that to continue going forward. We were very pleased with our performance in Latin America in the third quarter. Latin American net sales were down 5% in the quarter as 2% volume growth and 9.5% pricing growth were offset by significant foreign exchange headwinds. We delivered organic sales growth in every hub in the division, including strong growth in Mexico and Brazil. Volume performance for the division improved sequentially as we return to a more normalized promotional cadence due to higher consumer foot traffic. And we saw benefits from a strong innovation calendar and increased demand for personal and home care products due to COVID. Our innovation in naturals and whitening across the division is helping to drive premiumization in toothpaste as part of our revenue growth management strategy. Our Protex brand is benefiting from heightened consumer interest in antibacterial products, the re-launch of Protex with the new flaxseed oil formula, and the entry into new segments with products like Protex Face in Brazil. Protex is a great example of driving growth in both the core and in higher growth adjacent segments. Europe delivered double digit net sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales growth at 3% was primarily driven by volume growth, as retail foot traffic improved and slightly positive pricing. Net sales also benefited from the inclusion of Filorga and favorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth benefited from strong performance in personal care, driven by COVID-related demand and strength of the Sanex brand behind Sanex Zero% and Sanex Dermo product line. Oral care performance improved sequentially as we saw less pantry destocking and also through increased brand support. We returned to net sales growth in Asia Pacific in the third quarter. Organic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by a mixture of volume and pricing growth. The organic sales growth was driven by our biggest hubs, with Greater China, India and South Pacific all growing year-over-year. Our Colgate China business continues to benefit from the premium innovation Noel had talked about at the Barclays Conference in September, while our South Pacific business delivered continued strong performance through COVID-related demand and innovation. Africa/Eurasia also returned to net sales growth in the quarter, as mid-single digit volume and pricing growth were only partially offset by a low-double digit foreign exchange headwind. Organic growth was broad based, with growth in all three categories and across every hub. Turkey continues to benefit from strong growth across all categories. Hill\u2019s once again delivered stellar results with double digit net and organic sales growth led by the U.S., Europe, Australia and Canada. Higher consumer demand in e-commerce continues to be a significant driver of growth, although brick and mortar growth in the U.S. improved sequentially in the third quarter as foot traffic increased. Sales continues to benefit from increased brand support, which is driving higher brand awareness and market share gains on our wellness products. The pet channel remains subdued due to COVID headwinds. The prescription diet sales growth was robust, given the shift to e-commerce. And now I\u2019ll move to guidance. We are providing annual guidance despite the fact that rising case rates are rising in many of our markets. We still believe the government actions to control the spread of COVID-19 are the biggest risk to delivering on our financial plan. And shutdowns, like we saw in China and India earlier in the year, meaning significant impacts to our ability to manufacture and distribute our products are not built into our forecast. I want to note that we will not be providing any discussion of 2021 guidance at this time. We expect net sales to be at mid-single digits for the year. Organic sales are expected to be up at the high end of mid-single digits. Foreign exchange is expected to be a mid-single digit headwind for the year with current spot rates putting us towards the lower end of that range. We expect gross margin expansion for the full year and advertising as a percent of sales is expected to be up for the year with an even larger increase in advertising year-over-year in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, our tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21.5% to 22%. On a base business basis, our tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Our share repurchase plans remain unchanged as we plan for less benefit from share repurchase this year, as we pay down debt. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be up double digits. On a base business basis, we would expect earnings per share to be up 6% to 7%. And now, I'll turn it over to Noel.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. I'll keep my comments quite brief this morning so we have plenty of time to get to the Q&A. Clearly, we're pleased with the results in Q3 and obviously the progress we've made throughout the year. I think the results speak to the tremendous work of Colgate people and our partners when you think about it from our labs, to the production lines, to our DCs, to getting product in stores, and the incredible work our teams are doing working virtually all over the world. In that regard, our teams continue to show incredible strength. Their compassion for driving the business forward, the collaboration they're showing and importantly, the discipline and professionalism behind the strategy is clearly reflected in the results. So my immense gratitude from all of us to the teams on the ground and their families. So John summarized the results I think quite well. And because the quarter, to some extent, speaks for itself, I'll keep my comments quite brief again, and I'll focus on where we're going next. You've heard me say many times that our growth mindset is really about delivering sustainable, profitable growth and you clearly saw that. While the trends related to COVID have certainly boosted our sales, organic sales growth turnaround was well on its way as we headed into 2020. So as we look at 2021 and beyond, we'll continue to evolve our strategies to deliver this type of growth that you expect and obviously, growth that drive superior shareholder value. To that point, I want to expand on three areas this morning; revamping our innovation process, you've heard me talk about that quite a bit, our digital transformation, which is well underway and then clearly investing differently to build our brands in the current environment.  So first, let me start off by revamping our innovation process. You will recall, we talked quite a bit about that at Barclays and we focused on delivering that strategy through the quarter. It's about delivering transformative and disruptive innovation across our entire portfolio. So to do this, we need to become less reliant on line extensions and by pursuing innovations that really build incremental category growth and market share gains, which is ultimately vital for us to continue to drive gross margin. And we see incredible opportunities, quite frankly, across the mega trends all over the world that we're seeing on the ground. Naturals and sustainability to give an example, the urbanization that we're seeing in big markets, aging population in developed markets, or younger population and per capita consumption opportunities in developing countries and clearly the rapid growth and channel focus that we have, as we've seen channel expansions, particularly in e-commerce and pharmacy for us. But you can imagine these demands new skill sets and new incentives, new structures and new processes to get it right. We brought an outside talent to help us change how we think about innovation, and we're really encouraged by the risk taking and collaboration that the teams are showing. We're encouraged by the new financial models and approach they're taking to innovation and empowering our teams importantly on the ground to take action. So not surprisingly, Colgate people are clearly stepping up and embracing the change that we're trying to implement. In the last six months, we've launched the Hum Smart toothbrush, the Miracle Repair toothpaste line and serums, the Colgate Optic White Whitening Pen and the Hill\u2019s Science Diet Perfect Digestion just to give you a few examples of that. John mentioned Protex, another great example of how we're changing the way we innovate. While it's a brand you're probably less familiar with, it has a strong antibacterial skin health credential. Before COVID, we felt the segment was becoming highly commoditized and overly promotional, and we were highly dependent on line extensions. So what did we do? We focused on real differentiation for the brand. We re-launched the entire core line of Protex bar soap through the flaxseed-based antibacterial formula. That flaxseed oil boosts your natural skin defenses, which is a really interesting idea in the current environment, particularly in Brazil and has truly differentiated us in this environment and we think positions us well for growth moving forward. We also at the same time launched a line of Protex face products, which is positioned in the premium anti-acne segment, a high growth adjacency for sure and we're driving incremental sales, share and margin for the brand with that innovation. So while in the short term we're benefiting from some of the COVID-related demand in this space, I believe this innovation leaves us well positioned to continue to drive incremental category growth and share for our business. So next, we're continuing to drive our digital transformation. You've heard me talk a lot about that over the last six to nine months. And we're making great progress. So what do I mean when I talk about digital? It's about changing how we work every day across the company. We\u2019ve discussed our move to SAP S/4HANA, which is allowing us now to analyze our business all over the world effectively with one global standard. We're also now installing new systems to accelerate our revenue growth management efforts. It's about changing how we interact as well with our customers and consumers. We\u2019re generating much better insights through data and analytics, which allows us to better understand the consumer path to purchase. As an example, in Hill\u2019s from pet adoption to the first vet visits into their ability to buy product ultimately in store. So really understanding that entire journey is allowing us to drive far more growth and efficiencies with our media and as well as with our partners. It's about changing how we execute our communication as well. We're improving our digital marketing through programmatic media buying, to more personalized content and we're doing testing that allows us to more accurately predict the effectiveness of our media driving higher ROI in the end. So starting small and scaling rapidly is a big mindset that we've adopted in our digital strategy. Channel wise, the biggest beneficiary of our digital media investments is clearly e-commerce and we're developing much more sophisticated content to draw attention, increase consideration for our brands, ultimately secure the purchase and importantly, earn loyalty for our brands going forward. And that's driving share gains in key markets, particularly in the U.S. and in China as we've increased our investment in that area. We'll also continue to build the digital muscle across the entire enterprise. That's really important for us. And if you think about marketing to a consumer on Amazon or Alibaba, it's not the same or marketing to a consumer on Tesco.com or through the last milers [ph] in Latin America. This is where the focus on deeply understanding the consumer journey will truly pay off for us. So we need to make sure we build flexibility into our model and win across all the different platforms. While e-commerce requires some specialization, and we brought in the talent to do that, we need to ensure that we have training across the entire organization to raise the skill level to ensure that we build that muscle for the long term. I talked about innovation and I've talked about our digital transformation, so let me talk a little bit about brand investment. We\u2019re spending behind ideas now and capabilities that will broaden the growth in our portfolio in terms of the brands, the categories, likewise the channels which we just spoke about, and the geographies. Our innovation will be more successful if we invest in marketing that lets consumers know what's truly different, and we're very focused on that. We'll also win in e-commerce if we\u2019re more consistently at the top of the first page and delivering the right personalized content. In our revenue growth management strategy in driving premiumization will also be more successful if our advertising clearly demonstrates our products are delivering excellent value. And we\u2019ll continue to keep Colgate as the most penetrated brand in the world at over 60% of households by consistently keeping our brand top of mind and preferred. So these changes I've discussed today are already helping us deliver the better results that you've seen throughout the year. The success of Optic White renewal we talked about is a great example of pairing the right innovation with the right digital strategy with increased brand levels of support. The Hill's Science Diet re-launched has fueled a lot of the growth at Hill\u2019s, likewise a good example of that. So all these efforts are paying off for us as we head into 2021 and building the momentum throughout the year. And we believe that we\u2019ll continue to drive the growth, particularly as we build those skill sets across the organization for the longer term. So before we move into the Q&A, I want to offer a word about our announcement this morning that Stan Sutula will be joining the company on November 9 as our Chief Financial Officer. Stan joins us from Pitney Bowes and previously IBM and brings a wealth of experience in finance and strategy to this role. We're excited to welcome Stan to Colgate and think his experience in building technology-related businesses will add a tremendous value to our digital transformation well underway. Henning Jakobsen will retire from Colgate on December 31 and we are grateful that he's going to stay with us to ensure a smooth transition with Stan throughout the balance of the year before returning to his family in Denmark. Henning\u2019s been with us for 25 years and the service to our company has been exceptional. Henning has served in a number of general management and finance roles throughout the globe. Henning\u2019s contributed too much to Colgate not just in the finance function as an executive but also a thoughtful business leader across the leadership team. Most recently, he has been instrumental in our efforts to drive organizational efficiency. I especially want to thank him for his help in my transition to CEO over the past few years. And behalf of all of us at Colgate, we wish him and his family all the best. And with that, I'll open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi. Good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So corporate pricing was very strong in the quarter, really the best result we've seen in a decade. Latin America is strong in the second straight quarter [indiscernible] improved sequentially. So two parts to the question. A, just short term, can you give us a sense for how much of that strength is due more to list price increases that are more enduring versus short-term changes in promotional cadence and what you're seeing on promotion from a competitive standpoint? But really, Noel, I was interested more in the longer term and taking a step back and thinking about pricing as a strategic lever. It does seem pretty audacious the level of pricing you took in Latin America during the pandemic and obviously volumes seems to have held up well. You can argue that\u2019s the case globally also. So sort of kudos for the success, but help us understand what's enabling the higher pricing and if the recent success emboldens you at all in terms of how you think about pricing and your approach going forward?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Dara. Let me take the \u2013 obviously, a two-part question. The short term, easy to answer. Obviously, as we've seen significant foreign exchange, we have consistently communicated externally that the important objective of our general managers on the ground is recouping the transactional impacts of foreign exchange. And what\u2019s particularly pleasing, as you pointed out, is Latin America following strong pricing in the second quarter at 9% delivered another 9% pricing in the third quarter in parallel with getting volume back into the business. So, again, I think a great result to see the volume coming back in Latin America, behind two quarters of strong pricing and obviously delivering the margin that was required to sustain the higher advertising levels in that division, which is certainly playing out. So short term, it was a combination of list and promotional pricing to a certain extent, but very much a lot of the revenue growth management discipline that we're putting in place around the world. And Latin America, as an example, has done an exceptional job as has Europe, as has Asia in bringing in competencies to ensure that our teams on the ground are really digging deep into our promotional spending and working together with our trade partners to find ways to drive both category and revenue for ourselves. And I'm particularly encouraged with some of the analytics coming out of the revenue growth management teams around the world. And you're seeing some of the short-term benefits of that, and that will clearly play out for the longer term. So if I take a step back now on the longer-term question, listen, getting a pricing into the P&Ls and in the categories is a critical initiative for us. We will continue to find ways to do that with the mechanisms that we have through revenue growth management. Obviously, list price is one of them. But long term, we continue to see opportunities to get pricing up in the markets. We've long talked about the under index of Colgate toothpaste portfolio. We still have an opportunity to drive a lot more premiumization there. You've heard us talk quite consistently about the importance of premiumization across our innovation pipelines and a lot of the innovation that we put into the market in the third quarter, likewise, was very premium-based. I used the example of Protex acne, the acne line in Brazil, all premium priced. We launched the Whitening Pen in the U.S. premium priced; Optic White Renewal, lower ounces but very premium priced as well. So again, I think as the long-term strategy, we continue to find pricing as a key mechanism within our P&L, and it's obviously integral to the fact that the gross margin expansion you saw in the quarter is allowing us to continue to invest more aggressively behind a quite plentiful pipeline of new products.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. Congrats on the results. So if you can help us reconcile the volume growth in basically shipments to fulfill and reset \u2013 not reset, but replenish the shelves vis-\u00e0-vis what consumption was? And then on your last comment, Noel, on, for instance, Latin America, how much do you think is premiumization basically mix, vis-\u00e0-vis just plain pricing?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks for the question. Obviously, again \u2013 let me take the Latin America question first. The strategy that we've been talking for quite some time is obviously getting the core businesses re-launched that allows us to take pricing, moving into adjacencies and premium brands that allows us to obviously premiumize the category and get more margin growth. Looking at certain channel expansion opportunities, particularly across the pharmacy channel, which allows for more premium therapeutic portfolios to get sold through the consumer base there. So all those elements have helped Latin America, as an example, drive the margin growth, drive the pricing in the quarter and there's no question that that strategy that we've been deployed throughout the year continues to take hold through all the divisions. Let me take the question about replenishment. It really has \u2013 it's a function of more the markets where we've seen significant demand in some of our categories. So if I take North America as an example, liquid hand soap, dish continues to be about replenishing the shelves. The demand is in excess of some of the capacity that we had in the third quarter. That's starting to reduce itself as we move into the fourth quarter as we improve our capacity. But we still have some opportunities to replenish shelves. We're still trying to meet some of the excess demand that we have there. But by and large, a good portion of the volume in certain categories only. Now it's not the case in oral care where we're not seeing obviously COVID drive a lot of extra purchases or behavior changes, and we had good volume growth on oral care through the quarter. And again, I think that's a result of the innovation strategy that we're putting in place as well as the increased investment.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. Good morning. My question is on Hill\u2019s. Number one, I know you won't give guidance for 2021, but just as we think about kind of underlying trends in that business, I'm just wondering if you can sort of parse out for us how much is being driven by category growth versus market share gains? Because I assume all of those people who have adopted pets during COVID, they're not going to give them up next year. So I'm sort of assuming that the robust category growth will continue. Is there any reason you would disagree with that? And then if you'll indulge me, just because I think it is a big deal, this is the first time we've seen Colgate hire a senior person externally in a while. And I'm just wondering, Noel, as you settle in and you think about sort of the organization and the culture of the company, is this the beginning of maybe more new blood coming into Colgate or was this just a specific value you thought was right for the role of CFO and it's kind of a one-off? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Let me address the Hill\u2019s questions first. Listen, Hill\u2019s continues to hit on all cylinders. We've talked a lot about big core renovations, which obviously have played out very nicely. We've talked about the premiumization aspect and going into adjacencies, which continues to be an emerging growth segment if you take the wet side of the business and they\u2019re doing an exceptional job of capitalizing on those trends. We talked about the low brand awareness that Hill\u2019s has and obviously the significant upside that still exists as we expand or increase our advertising spend to drive relevance to the brand. We talked a lot about the channel expansion opportunities. They've done an exceptional job with e-commerce. All of that is leading to increased market share is when you take the e-commerce shares, when you take brick and mortar shares around the world. All-in-all, we're driving good share growth across that business. You mentioned obviously the pet adoptions are up significantly in the U.S. as a result of COVID. So we think that will obviously bode well for the category moving forward as we move into 2021, and we see the continued acceleration of pet adoptions, particularly in the current environment. So good category growth combined with good shared growth that's driven by an underlying strategy that's very solid. On your second question, listen, we have an opportunity to bring in someone with some really unique experience. We looked obviously at that opportunity very carefully. Particularly someone with Stan's background, the incredible experience he has at IBM as well as the transformation that he was helping drive at Pitney. And as I mentioned in my upfront comments, a big focus for us is really driving our digital transformation across the entire enterprise, not just from a consumer standpoint but how we operate internally, through our back office systems, through the technology that we use through SAP and the things that we're bringing on-stream as we speak and Stan is very well positioned to do that. And we will \u2013 as we look for opportunities to continue to elevate our skills as we think about our strategy moving forward, we'll identify candidates on the outside to do that. We've done that in the digital space very, very successfully. We've done that in the e-commerce space very, very successfully. That being said, we have an incredible pipeline of talent in the company. We're developing broad-based skills across the organization and we'll continue to obviously encourage and develop our talent from within, which has been a key success factor for the company for many, many years.\nOperator: And next, we will hear from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hi. Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Much appreciate it. And Happy Friday too. So congratulations on great results. It's great to see the organic sales growth, gross margins phenomenal and the reinvestment in advertising, it\u2019s obviously welcome. As we walk through the P&L, we are seeing some more leakage though outside of just advertising in the SG&A, particularly in developed markets. I think in your 10-Q, you're citing overhead inflation as the drag of around 130 bps in Europe, 190 bps in North America. I know Europe\u2019s been running up all year, but North America looks like a sharp inflection. What's driving that? Is it reinvesting in capabilities? Is it underlying inflation? I wanted to just get some better understanding of where that margin pressure is coming from and how durable it may be?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Listen, as John outlined, a lot of the SG&A increase is obviously largely driven by advertising. We had a little bit of an increase related to COVID-related costs in the quarter, related to some compensation costs in the quarter as well. But overall, we feel the overheads are well under control, well under control around the world. We're making the changes necessary. You mentioned, obviously, we're bringing in some skill sets as we just talked about with Wendy to certainly elevate our game in the digital and e-commerce space. But by and large, obviously the focus right now is continued to drive the gross margin as you saw, keep the overheads where they've been, and we've consistently \u2013 we find productivity opportunities in that area and invest behind the business. So, overall, we feel like we\u2019re in a good place, Jason.\nOperator: And next, we\u2019ll hear from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, a lot has happened in the last several months or so since the pandemic started to take hold and you\u2019ve launched a number of new products as well during that time. But you had already started to talk a lot more about innovation investments before COVID. So I\u2019m just kind of curious how the current environment has impacted your longer-term view and your strategy going forward obviously on oral care? But then also pet ownership has increased, so how is that impacting your innovation and your thought process with Hill\u2019s? And then soap\u2019s demand could be higher for quite some time. So just thinking through the innovation strategy and where you plan to spend in the pet given the changes over the last several months? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Olivia. So, if I go back to Barclays and quite frankly, if I go back to the last 12 to 18 months, we've talked a lot about how we're thinking about innovation and a real concerted effort to organize ourselves both from a structural standpoint as well as the processes and the resource allocation, moving away from those closed-in line extensions to more incremental breakthrough innovation. And that has been very deliberate and a very focused effort across every division in the world and we're starting to see obviously the benefits of that. But the intention is obviously it sets us up for long-term sustainable growth moving forward. If I take the current environment, clearly we have an opportunity to continue to drive premium pricing. And that's why a lot of our innovation, as I mentioned earlier, is on the premium side of the business and we're looking for ways to disrupt the category. We're looking for ways to think about oral health differently than just a toothpaste line extension. And you're starting to see that play out in some of our innovation in the quarter, particularly in North America. Relative to Hill\u2019s, interesting \u2013 obviously the Science Diet re-launch has been a big driver, but they're seeing great benefits coming through with some of the innovation they brought in, in early days on prescription diet with far more therapeutic formulas. Metabolic, as an example, is doing extremely well. And if you take some of the innovation opportunities that we see in the wet segment moving forward, we continue to find ample opportunities to drive growth with that. And as pet adoptions and pet ownership increases and clearly we're seeing the trend in the marketplace, likewise, with a move back to science-based, real biology-based products and that obviously plays very well for the Hill\u2019s business, both here in North America and around the world. And we have an innovation pipeline that is very, very robust as we look into 2021. The other aspect of that is certainly vet visits are down as a result of mobility issues in the U.S. related to COVID and the traffic is down. Our home is certainly a great innovative idea that we're bringing into that business to continue to allow vets to extend product to their pet owners directly. And we'll see that increase as we move into 2021, particularly as we see more and more traffic move back into the veterinary space going forward.\nOperator: And next, we will hear from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations on the strong results. A question on gross margin with two components to it really, a more near-term aspect as well as a longer-term orientation. So, of course, it was historically good this core quarter. I think it was a high watermark for the company. And we talked about pricing in an earlier question. How did gross margins come in relative to your expectations? Did it beat the Street pretty handily? And I think it was largely on the pricing component as well as funding the growth. And so I'm not asking for guidance, but we have promo picking up, freight costs moving higher, commodities likely less favorable. Even without asking for guidance, how should we be thinking about this line item sort of in the intermediate term? And how is the Colgate company thinking about it? And then longer term, Noel, the 65% gross margin ambition would come up from time to time on these calls. Is that still realistic? Is that a significant priority for the company? And if so, how quickly do you think that you can get there? So thanks for that.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Let me start. Again, take a step back and for us it's very much around focusing on growth. The growth moves through the P&L. We get increased margin dollars into the P&L. Obviously that allows us to support the businesses more consistently and more broadly as we've communicated in this quarter. You've seen four quarters now gross margins in the 60s and sequentially up from quarter-to-quarter. I think that's a result of a couple of things. One, a much deepened focus behind our revenue growth management. We've talked about that quite a bit. We\u2019ve talked about the importance of premium pricing and innovation that supports that. And we've talked about our ability to react quickly to extraordinary foreign exchange headwinds, as we've seen, both in Latin America and some of the markets in Africa and Middle East. And getting that into the P&L allows us to really control how we want to manage the business more effectively, how we want to spend the money both from below the line and above the line basis, how we want to look at our promotional strategy? So getting that gives us a tremendous amount of clarity on how we want to evolve in the quarter, and allows us to kind of dictate where we want to spend. Relative to the expectations and obviously the revenue growth management is coming in better than we expected; so a little bit better there. Funding the growth aspect continues to be very, very good. So if I walk through the margin roll forward again for you, we started \u2013 if we go back to third quarter last year at 59, we delivered 170 basis points of pricing off of \u2013 if you follow that off the second quarter, which was at 130 basis points. So again, solid pricing. But the quality of that pricing, again, to some of the earlier questions was consistent all around the world and by category, which was really nice to see. Funding the growth came in at 250, positive in the quarter offsetting material prices at 230. And obviously, that\u2019s a little bit of benefit from a mix, but not a lot. So again, coming down to 61.2, which is one of our \u2013 obviously our high point on the margin line, but we want to see that continue to grow. But first and foremost, it's about getting the top line continuing to sustain that healthy growth that you're seeing. That gives us the margin dollars and gives us the leverage. And ultimately, as we implement more discipline around revenue growth management, we take action quickly to offset foreign exchange, we see opportunities to continue to drive margin moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Thanks. Good morning. Can you go a little deeper into what you've seen in Latin America? I guess what's the \u2013 I believe we\u2019re looking for what's the most reassuring across your major markets in that region in the past few months? And what's allowed you to reinstate guidance for the fourth quarter when a quarter ago you didn't feel like you had that same visibility into the third quarter? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: So, listen, we've got one quarter left. We\u2019re obviously just finishing up October. And we felt comfortable based on what we're seeing around the world. Obviously, case counts continue to be a real concern and will \u2013 inevitably, we could see more lockdowns in core markets around the world. And as a result of that, we want to be very cautious. But we felt pretty comfortable given the line of sight that we have on the business right now. And as a result, we gave guidance for the fourth quarter. We'll come back, as we always do, following the fourth quarter and provide you the necessary thoughts on 2021. But we're not getting ahead of ourselves yet. Right now, we're focused on delivering the fourth quarter and we'll talk 2021 at the appropriate time.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Two things, one was just to follow up. You had mentioned freight in passing and I was just curious if you could give just a little bit more color on your outlook for freight in the U.S. and just a relevancy and kind of across the board. And then secondly, more specific to your business was thinking about promotions in the U.S. I think when you'd answered the question though about promotional activity and some of the resources you put in on revenue growth management, you highlighted other markets. In the U.S., Colgate historically has been a heavily promoted brand. So I was wondering to what degree the environment has given you an opportunity to accelerate efforts to kind of bring that down, or if this isn't really the right time, but I\u2019m curious on progress on that front in the U.S.? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Let me take freight first. Freight obviously continues to be somewhat of a headwind, but we saw costs come in marginally better than they came in, in the second quarter. But that being said, a big caveat there is we see increasing case counts around the world that ultimately leads to more disruption along our lanes all around the world. So we're going to be very mindful as we see that unfold in the balance of the year. But so far, we've done a pretty good job in this quarter, mitigating some of the on costs associated with freight and logistics. On your question relative to the U.S., a lot of work on the U.S. around revenue growth management. That's the team that really embraces data and analytics. They've taken it on. I've talked about it I think over the last couple of quarters on how we're being far more disciplined, not only in categories where we're seeing excess demand, but more importantly not chasing a lot of the price promotions that have existed in some of the categories, particularly in toothpaste where we've seen high couponing from some of our competitors. We\u2019ve pulled back. We don't necessarily want to go after that consumer as much as we want to go after the premium consumer, which we believe has much more durability for the franchise moving forward. So we've been very mindful on our promotional spend in the quarter. That being said, as consumers come back into stores and store traffic increases, we want to be sure we're there and present. And we have the money in the P&L to adjust accordingly. But by and large, much more disciplined would be the message, RGM really taking on a new level of focus in the U.S., combined with obviously getting the dollar value of price increases that we're seeing through our revenue growth management initiatives playing through the P&L.\nOperator: And next, we will hear from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning.\nBill Chappell: Noel, can you just talk a little bit more about kind of what you're seeing on consumer habits, and presumably people aren't washing their hands or maybe even brushing their teeth as much as they were in March and April, and didn't know if you've seen that kind of flatten out to certainly an elevated level. And in that same line, since you gave fourth quarter guidance, what would you expect with the lockdowns in Europe, if you expect any kind of a spike back or if this is fairly different where you don't really expect a whole lot of surge in demand through another lockdown, especially in Europe.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. So, Bill, specifically on some of the more COVID-related categories that we've seen an increase in category growth, liquid hand soap would be one. Our research indicates clearly that behavior will stay, perhaps not at the current elevated levels but will certainly versus historical norms be at a higher level. Likewise, a lot more people obviously cooking at home, so dish liquid\u2019s been significantly accelerated. In that regard, I think as long as we see lockdowns, as long as we see people working from home, which in our estimation would be through at least half of next year, you'll continue to see elevated rates. You are not seeing a COVID-related impact on oral care. Obviously, if you see any panic buying going on in the market, you'll get a little bit of benefit. But I think consumers have adjusted themselves far better than at the onset of COVID to how they're managing their inventories and their pantries. So we wouldn't expect any significant changes on oral care. Likewise, on pet food, a little panic buying at the onset right now. I think it's more stabilized. Consumers understand what they have. Not a lot of destocking coming out of pantries. And I think more importantly, people are being more rational on how they manage their purchases. So for behavior change, liquid hand soap, certainly a change, dish liquid at least through the first half of next year and oral care starting to normalize coming out of the strong first quarter panic, but much more on a historical basis. And we're seeing good growth on the innovation side that's driving more category dollar growth, which is good to see.\nOperator: And next, we will hear from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Based on the analytical work that we've done, we see a very high correlation between e-commerce penetration in terms of the category and gross margins, which would suggest \u2013 at least in the U.S. that would suggest that oral care could rapidly move to e-commerce. And so the question is, based on what you've learned and seen in China, are there things that you can do to be better prepared for that in the U.S. and how do you rank or how do you rate your ability and momentum in e-commerce in the U.S. if that happens? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Rob. You've heard me mention a couple of times the incredible digital and e-commerce capabilities that our Hill\u2019s business has and how important it is that we share learnings across the broader enterprise, and we very deliberately are shifting resources back and forth between Hill\u2019s and Colgate. We're obviously getting the same type of learning now out of Asia in terms of the skill sets. And as I mentioned, I think very deliberately in my comments, we feel very strongly that up-scaling the entire organization around e-commerce and that's not just our innovators, that's not our marketing and our customer development organization. That's everyone from logistics to supply chain to packaging. So everyone truly embraces and understands that channel, we think is very important to our long-term growth, as we see more and more consumers moving into that. So the skill sets are there. The transfer of knowledge is there. And I\u2019ve mentioned also that we're supplementing quite a bit of that by bringing in outside talent as well to ensure that we close any gaps that we might have in certain geographies around the world. You're seeing the benefits of that. Our e-commerce business obviously up, close to 50% in Q1; another close to 50% in Q2 and a very strong growth in Q3. Shares are up across our categories, both in North America as well as China, our two biggest markets. And we're seeing some accelerated growth, likewise, in Europe. Hill\u2019s obviously doing exceptionally well in this space. So we think we're well positioned, but we recognize we have a ways to go, given the opportunities we see to build the skill sets across the company and continue to grow market share where we're seeing significant growth.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about market share. So I get the numbers in the release that are translating back into dollars, so mechanically it looks like you're losing share. But I guess maybe, is there any way to parse out share in some of the key markets on a local currency basis? And maybe more broadly, could you just talk about what you're seeing as growth within your categories globally at the high level, oral care, your segment of personal and household as well pet, and then directional comments on how your business is performing relative to those global growth rates?\nNoel Wallace: So, Mark, you\u2019ve identified obviously the impact of foreign exchange, so let me give you a shared summary on a constant currency basis. So year-to-date, we\u2019re flat or up in every single division, ex Asia. We've talked a lot about Asia obviously that we're in relooking at our go-to-market, our portfolio. We talked about the progress that we're making in the second quarter and we saw that playing through. Likewise, that progress accelerated in the third quarter. So we think we're well on our way there. But across the board, our shares are flat to up in every division on a constant currency basis. Last 13 weeks in North America, we've seen good progress on our toothpaste share, particularly as we've seen the investment behind renewal take hold and some of the other innovations that we've brought into the category. You look around the world, a lot of our focus on our premium business is in Europe, both meridol and elmex and the investment we're putting behind that, we're seeing some good growth. Good share growth in the very short \u2013 recent term in both Brazil and Mexico behind some of our innovations there. Mexico now back above an 80 share. And likewise, Brazil not chasing the bottom end of the market, but getting some good premium pricing, as we mentioned earlier, and seeing that translate into more sustainable share growth across the board. Relative to categories, by and large, most of the categories that we compete in have accelerated, obviously some COVID driven, others very pricing driven and from an innovation standpoint, toothpaste in the U.S. now back up into that four to six range on a year-to-date basis. Europe still around 0% to 2%, but again driven by some good pricing. Latin America, down a little bit versus 2019, but again I think driven by a real softness in the categories in the first and second quarters are starting to come back a little bit better in the third quarter, which is encouraging. So, overall, we\u2019ve got some good category growth. We talked Hill\u2019s, likewise, very good growth across the category. And Hill\u2019s and that team is very sustained no matter where you look at it around the world. So, overall, category seems pretty good right now. And I think with the innovation process we have in place and the focus on premiumization and revenue growth management, we\u2019ll continue to bring dollars into the categories in which we compete. So I guess that's the last question. Let me just close off by again thanking the Colgate people around the world on a really strong quarter and a continuation from the progress we've had over the last four to five quarters executing our strategy, building skill sets across the organization and obviously collaborating in ways that we've never collaborated before. So a great thanks to everyone. I wish all of you a safe and healthy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to catching up again on the fourth quarter results. So thanks, everyone.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe. I'll keep my comments quite brief this morning so we have plenty of time to get to the Q&A. Clearly, we're pleased with the results in Q3 and obviously the progress we've made throughout the year. I think the results speak to the tremendous work of Colgate people and our partners when you think about it from our labs, to the production lines, to our DCs, to getting product in stores, and the incredible work our teams are doing working virtually all over the world. In that regard, our teams continue to show incredible strength. Their compassion for driving the business forward, the collaboration they're showing and importantly, the discipline and professionalism behind the strategy is clearly reflected in the results. So my immense gratitude from all of us to the teams on the ground and their families. So John summarized the results I think quite well. And because the quarter, to some extent, speaks for itself, I'll keep my comments quite brief again, and I'll focus on where we're going next. You've heard me say many times that our growth mindset is really about delivering sustainable, profitable growth and you clearly saw that. While the trends related to COVID have certainly boosted our sales, organic sales growth turnaround was well on its way as we headed into 2020. So as we look at 2021 and beyond, we'll continue to evolve our strategies to deliver this type of growth that you expect and obviously, growth that drive superior shareholder value. To that point, I want to expand on three areas this morning; revamping our innovation process, you've heard me talk about that quite a bit, our digital transformation, which is well underway and then clearly investing differently to build our brands in the current environment.  So first, let me start off by revamping our innovation process. You will recall, we talked quite a bit about that at Barclays and we focused on delivering that strategy through the quarter. It's about delivering transformative and disruptive innovation across our entire portfolio. So to do this, we need to become less reliant on line extensions and by pursuing innovations that really build incremental category growth and market share gains, which is ultimately vital for us to continue to drive gross margin. And we see incredible opportunities, quite frankly, across the mega trends all over the world that we're seeing on the ground. Naturals and sustainability to give an example, the urbanization that we're seeing in big markets, aging population in developed markets, or younger population and per capita consumption opportunities in developing countries and clearly the rapid growth and channel focus that we have, as we've seen channel expansions, particularly in e-commerce and pharmacy for us. But you can imagine these demands new skill sets and new incentives, new structures and new processes to get it right. We brought an outside talent to help us change how we think about innovation, and we're really encouraged by the risk taking and collaboration that the teams are showing. We're encouraged by the new financial models and approach they're taking to innovation and empowering our teams importantly on the ground to take action. So not surprisingly, Colgate people are clearly stepping up and embracing the change that we're trying to implement. In the last six months, we've launched the Hum Smart toothbrush, the Miracle Repair toothpaste line and serums, the Colgate Optic White Whitening Pen and the Hill's Science Diet Perfect Digestion just to give you a few examples of that. John mentioned Protex, another great example of how we're changing the way we innovate. While it's a brand you're probably less familiar with, it has a strong antibacterial skin health credential. Before COVID, we felt the segment was becoming highly commoditized and overly promotional, and we were highly dependent on line extensions. So what did we do? We focused on real differentiation for the brand. We re-launched the entire core line of Protex bar soap through the flaxseed-based antibacterial formula. That flaxseed oil boosts your natural skin defenses, which is a really interesting idea in the current environment, particularly in Brazil and has truly differentiated us in this environment and we think positions us well for growth moving forward. We also at the same time launched a line of Protex face products, which is positioned in the premium anti-acne segment, a high growth adjacency for sure and we're driving incremental sales, share and margin for the brand with that innovation. So while in the short term we're benefiting from some of the COVID-related demand in this space, I believe this innovation leaves us well positioned to continue to drive incremental category growth and share for our business. So next, we're continuing to drive our digital transformation. You've heard me talk a lot about that over the last six to nine months. And we're making great progress. So what do I mean when I talk about digital? It's about changing how we work every day across the company. We've discussed our move to SAP S/4HANA, which is allowing us now to analyze our business all over the world effectively with one global standard. We're also now installing new systems to accelerate our revenue growth management efforts. It's about changing how we interact as well with our customers and consumers. We're generating much better insights through data and analytics, which allows us to better understand the consumer path to purchase. As an example, in Hill's from pet adoption to the first vet visits into their ability to buy product ultimately in store. So really understanding that entire journey is allowing us to drive far more growth and efficiencies with our media and as well as with our partners. It's about changing how we execute our communication as well. We're improving our digital marketing through programmatic media buying, to more personalized content and we're doing testing that allows us to more accurately predict the effectiveness of our media driving higher ROI in the end. So starting small and scaling rapidly is a big mindset that we've adopted in our digital strategy. Channel wise, the biggest beneficiary of our digital media investments is clearly e-commerce and we're developing much more sophisticated content to draw attention, increase consideration for our brands, ultimately secure the purchase and importantly, earn loyalty for our brands going forward. And that's driving share gains in key markets, particularly in the U.S. and in China as we've increased our investment in that area. We'll also continue to build the digital muscle across the entire enterprise. That's really important for us. And if you think about marketing to a consumer on Amazon or Alibaba, it's not the same or marketing to a consumer on Tesco.com or through the last milers [ph] in Latin America. This is where the focus on deeply understanding the consumer journey will truly pay off for us. So we need to make sure we build flexibility into our model and win across all the different platforms. While e-commerce requires some specialization, and we brought in the talent to do that, we need to ensure that we have training across the entire organization to raise the skill level to ensure that we build that muscle for the long term. I talked about innovation and I've talked about our digital transformation, so let me talk a little bit about brand investment. We're spending behind ideas now and capabilities that will broaden the growth in our portfolio in terms of the brands, the categories, likewise the channels which we just spoke about, and the geographies. Our innovation will be more successful if we invest in marketing that lets consumers know what's truly different, and we're very focused on that. We'll also win in e-commerce if we're more consistently at the top of the first page and delivering the right personalized content. In our revenue growth management strategy in driving premiumization will also be more successful if our advertising clearly demonstrates our products are delivering excellent value. And we'll continue to keep Colgate as the most penetrated brand in the world at over 60% of households by consistently keeping our brand top of mind and preferred. So these changes I've discussed today are already helping us deliver the better results that you've seen throughout the year. The success of Optic White renewal we talked about is a great example of pairing the right innovation with the right digital strategy with increased brand levels of support. The Hill's Science Diet re-launched has fueled a lot of the growth at Hill's, likewise a good example of that. So all these efforts are paying off for us as we head into 2021 and building the momentum throughout the year. And we believe that we'll continue to drive the growth, particularly as we build those skill sets across the organization for the longer term. So before we move into the Q&A, I want to offer a word about our announcement this morning that Stan Sutula will be joining the company on November 9 as our Chief Financial Officer. Stan joins us from Pitney Bowes and previously IBM and brings a wealth of experience in finance and strategy to this role. We're excited to welcome Stan to Colgate and think his experience in building technology-related businesses will add a tremendous value to our digital transformation well underway. Henning Jakobsen will retire from Colgate on December 31 and we are grateful that he's going to stay with us to ensure a smooth transition with Stan throughout the balance of the year before returning to his family in Denmark. Henning's been with us for 25 years and the service to our company has been exceptional. Henning has served in a number of general management and finance roles throughout the globe. Henning's contributed too much to Colgate not just in the finance function as an executive but also a thoughtful business leader across the leadership team. Most recently, he has been instrumental in our efforts to drive organizational efficiency. I especially want to thank him for his help in my transition to CEO over the past few years. And behalf of all of us at Colgate, we wish him and his family all the best. And with that, I'll open it up to questions. Good morning, Dara. Yes. Thanks, Dara. Let me take the \u2013 obviously, a two-part question. The short term, easy to answer. Obviously, as we've seen significant foreign exchange, we have consistently communicated externally that the important objective of our general managers on the ground is recouping the transactional impacts of foreign exchange. And what's particularly pleasing, as you pointed out, is Latin America following strong pricing in the second quarter at 9% delivered another 9% pricing in the third quarter in parallel with getting volume back into the business. So, again, I think a great result to see the volume coming back in Latin America, behind two quarters of strong pricing and obviously delivering the margin that was required to sustain the higher advertising levels in that division, which is certainly playing out. So short term, it was a combination of list and promotional pricing to a certain extent, but very much a lot of the revenue growth management discipline that we're putting in place around the world. And Latin America, as an example, has done an exceptional job as has Europe, as has Asia in bringing in competencies to ensure that our teams on the ground are really digging deep into our promotional spending and working together with our trade partners to find ways to drive both category and revenue for ourselves. And I'm particularly encouraged with some of the analytics coming out of the revenue growth management teams around the world. And you're seeing some of the short-term benefits of that, and that will clearly play out for the longer term. So if I take a step back now on the longer-term question, listen, getting a pricing into the P&Ls and in the categories is a critical initiative for us. We will continue to find ways to do that with the mechanisms that we have through revenue growth management. Obviously, list price is one of them. But long term, we continue to see opportunities to get pricing up in the markets. We've long talked about the under index of Colgate toothpaste portfolio. We still have an opportunity to drive a lot more premiumization there. You've heard us talk quite consistently about the importance of premiumization across our innovation pipelines and a lot of the innovation that we put into the market in the third quarter, likewise, was very premium-based. I used the example of Protex acne, the acne line in Brazil, all premium priced. We launched the Whitening Pen in the U.S. premium priced; Optic White Renewal, lower ounces but very premium priced as well. So again, I think as the long-term strategy, we continue to find pricing as a key mechanism within our P&L, and it's obviously integral to the fact that the gross margin expansion you saw in the quarter is allowing us to continue to invest more aggressively behind a quite plentiful pipeline of new products. Sure. Thanks for the question. Obviously, again \u2013 let me take the Latin America question first. The strategy that we've been talking for quite some time is obviously getting the core businesses re-launched that allows us to take pricing, moving into adjacencies and premium brands that allows us to obviously premiumize the category and get more margin growth. Looking at certain channel expansion opportunities, particularly across the pharmacy channel, which allows for more premium therapeutic portfolios to get sold through the consumer base there. So all those elements have helped Latin America, as an example, drive the margin growth, drive the pricing in the quarter and there's no question that that strategy that we've been deployed throughout the year continues to take hold through all the divisions. Let me take the question about replenishment. It really has \u2013 it's a function of more the markets where we've seen significant demand in some of our categories. So if I take North America as an example, liquid hand soap, dish continues to be about replenishing the shelves. The demand is in excess of some of the capacity that we had in the third quarter. That's starting to reduce itself as we move into the fourth quarter as we improve our capacity. But we still have some opportunities to replenish shelves. We're still trying to meet some of the excess demand that we have there. But by and large, a good portion of the volume in certain categories only. Now it's not the case in oral care where we're not seeing obviously COVID drive a lot of extra purchases or behavior changes, and we had good volume growth on oral care through the quarter. And again, I think that's a result of the innovation strategy that we're putting in place as well as the increased investment. Sure. Let me address the Hill's questions first. Listen, Hill's continues to hit on all cylinders. We've talked a lot about big core renovations, which obviously have played out very nicely. We've talked about the premiumization aspect and going into adjacencies, which continues to be an emerging growth segment if you take the wet side of the business and they're doing an exceptional job of capitalizing on those trends. We talked about the low brand awareness that Hill's has and obviously the significant upside that still exists as we expand or increase our advertising spend to drive relevance to the brand. We talked a lot about the channel expansion opportunities. They've done an exceptional job with e-commerce. All of that is leading to increased market share is when you take the e-commerce shares, when you take brick and mortar shares around the world. All-in-all, we're driving good share growth across that business. You mentioned obviously the pet adoptions are up significantly in the U.S. as a result of COVID. So we think that will obviously bode well for the category moving forward as we move into 2021, and we see the continued acceleration of pet adoptions, particularly in the current environment. So good category growth combined with good shared growth that's driven by an underlying strategy that's very solid. On your second question, listen, we have an opportunity to bring in someone with some really unique experience. We looked obviously at that opportunity very carefully. Particularly someone with Stan's background, the incredible experience he has at IBM as well as the transformation that he was helping drive at Pitney. And as I mentioned in my upfront comments, a big focus for us is really driving our digital transformation across the entire enterprise, not just from a consumer standpoint but how we operate internally, through our back office systems, through the technology that we use through SAP and the things that we're bringing on-stream as we speak and Stan is very well positioned to do that. And we will \u2013 as we look for opportunities to continue to elevate our skills as we think about our strategy moving forward, we'll identify candidates on the outside to do that. We've done that in the digital space very, very successfully. We've done that in the e-commerce space very, very successfully. That being said, we have an incredible pipeline of talent in the company. We're developing broad-based skills across the organization and we'll continue to obviously encourage and develop our talent from within, which has been a key success factor for the company for many, many years. Yes. Listen, as John outlined, a lot of the SG&A increase is obviously largely driven by advertising. We had a little bit of an increase related to COVID-related costs in the quarter, related to some compensation costs in the quarter as well. But overall, we feel the overheads are well under control, well under control around the world. We're making the changes necessary. You mentioned, obviously, we're bringing in some skill sets as we just talked about with Wendy to certainly elevate our game in the digital and e-commerce space. But by and large, obviously the focus right now is continued to drive the gross margin as you saw, keep the overheads where they've been, and we've consistently \u2013 we find productivity opportunities in that area and invest behind the business. So, overall, we feel like we're in a good place, Jason. Yes. Thanks, Olivia. So, if I go back to Barclays and quite frankly, if I go back to the last 12 to 18 months, we've talked a lot about how we're thinking about innovation and a real concerted effort to organize ourselves both from a structural standpoint as well as the processes and the resource allocation, moving away from those closed-in line extensions to more incremental breakthrough innovation. And that has been very deliberate and a very focused effort across every division in the world and we're starting to see obviously the benefits of that. But the intention is obviously it sets us up for long-term sustainable growth moving forward. If I take the current environment, clearly we have an opportunity to continue to drive premium pricing. And that's why a lot of our innovation, as I mentioned earlier, is on the premium side of the business and we're looking for ways to disrupt the category. We're looking for ways to think about oral health differently than just a toothpaste line extension. And you're starting to see that play out in some of our innovation in the quarter, particularly in North America. Relative to Hill's, interesting \u2013 obviously the Science Diet re-launch has been a big driver, but they're seeing great benefits coming through with some of the innovation they brought in, in early days on prescription diet with far more therapeutic formulas. Metabolic, as an example, is doing extremely well. And if you take some of the innovation opportunities that we see in the wet segment moving forward, we continue to find ample opportunities to drive growth with that. And as pet adoptions and pet ownership increases and clearly we're seeing the trend in the marketplace, likewise, with a move back to science-based, real biology-based products and that obviously plays very well for the Hill's business, both here in North America and around the world. And we have an innovation pipeline that is very, very robust as we look into 2021. The other aspect of that is certainly vet visits are down as a result of mobility issues in the U.S. related to COVID and the traffic is down. Our home is certainly a great innovative idea that we're bringing into that business to continue to allow vets to extend product to their pet owners directly. And we'll see that increase as we move into 2021, particularly as we see more and more traffic move back into the veterinary space going forward. Sure. Let me start. Again, take a step back and for us it's very much around focusing on growth. The growth moves through the P&L. We get increased margin dollars into the P&L. Obviously that allows us to support the businesses more consistently and more broadly as we've communicated in this quarter. You've seen four quarters now gross margins in the 60s and sequentially up from quarter-to-quarter. I think that's a result of a couple of things. One, a much deepened focus behind our revenue growth management. We've talked about that quite a bit. We've talked about the importance of premium pricing and innovation that supports that. And we've talked about our ability to react quickly to extraordinary foreign exchange headwinds, as we've seen, both in Latin America and some of the markets in Africa and Middle East. And getting that into the P&L allows us to really control how we want to manage the business more effectively, how we want to spend the money both from below the line and above the line basis, how we want to look at our promotional strategy? So getting that gives us a tremendous amount of clarity on how we want to evolve in the quarter, and allows us to kind of dictate where we want to spend. Relative to the expectations and obviously the revenue growth management is coming in better than we expected; so a little bit better there. Funding the growth aspect continues to be very, very good. So if I walk through the margin roll forward again for you, we started \u2013 if we go back to third quarter last year at 59, we delivered 170 basis points of pricing off of \u2013 if you follow that off the second quarter, which was at 130 basis points. So again, solid pricing. But the quality of that pricing, again, to some of the earlier questions was consistent all around the world and by category, which was really nice to see. Funding the growth came in at 250, positive in the quarter offsetting material prices at 230. And obviously, that's a little bit of benefit from a mix, but not a lot. So again, coming down to 61.2, which is one of our \u2013 obviously our high point on the margin line, but we want to see that continue to grow. But first and foremost, it's about getting the top line continuing to sustain that healthy growth that you're seeing. That gives us the margin dollars and gives us the leverage. And ultimately, as we implement more discipline around revenue growth management, we take action quickly to offset foreign exchange, we see opportunities to continue to drive margin moving forward. So, listen, we've got one quarter left. We're obviously just finishing up October. And we felt comfortable based on what we're seeing around the world. Obviously, case counts continue to be a real concern and will \u2013 inevitably, we could see more lockdowns in core markets around the world. And as a result of that, we want to be very cautious. But we felt pretty comfortable given the line of sight that we have on the business right now. And as a result, we gave guidance for the fourth quarter. We'll come back, as we always do, following the fourth quarter and provide you the necessary thoughts on 2021. But we're not getting ahead of ourselves yet. Right now, we're focused on delivering the fourth quarter and we'll talk 2021 at the appropriate time. Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Let me take freight first. Freight obviously continues to be somewhat of a headwind, but we saw costs come in marginally better than they came in, in the second quarter. But that being said, a big caveat there is we see increasing case counts around the world that ultimately leads to more disruption along our lanes all around the world. So we're going to be very mindful as we see that unfold in the balance of the year. But so far, we've done a pretty good job in this quarter, mitigating some of the on costs associated with freight and logistics. On your question relative to the U.S., a lot of work on the U.S. around revenue growth management. That's the team that really embraces data and analytics. They've taken it on. I've talked about it I think over the last couple of quarters on how we're being far more disciplined, not only in categories where we're seeing excess demand, but more importantly not chasing a lot of the price promotions that have existed in some of the categories, particularly in toothpaste where we've seen high couponing from some of our competitors. We've pulled back. We don't necessarily want to go after that consumer as much as we want to go after the premium consumer, which we believe has much more durability for the franchise moving forward. So we've been very mindful on our promotional spend in the quarter. That being said, as consumers come back into stores and store traffic increases, we want to be sure we're there and present. And we have the money in the P&L to adjust accordingly. But by and large, much more disciplined would be the message, RGM really taking on a new level of focus in the U.S., combined with obviously getting the dollar value of price increases that we're seeing through our revenue growth management initiatives playing through the P&L. Good morning. Yes. So, Bill, specifically on some of the more COVID-related categories that we've seen an increase in category growth, liquid hand soap would be one. Our research indicates clearly that behavior will stay, perhaps not at the current elevated levels but will certainly versus historical norms be at a higher level. Likewise, a lot more people obviously cooking at home, so dish liquid's been significantly accelerated. In that regard, I think as long as we see lockdowns, as long as we see people working from home, which in our estimation would be through at least half of next year, you'll continue to see elevated rates. You are not seeing a COVID-related impact on oral care. Obviously, if you see any panic buying going on in the market, you'll get a little bit of benefit. But I think consumers have adjusted themselves far better than at the onset of COVID to how they're managing their inventories and their pantries. So we wouldn't expect any significant changes on oral care. Likewise, on pet food, a little panic buying at the onset right now. I think it's more stabilized. Consumers understand what they have. Not a lot of destocking coming out of pantries. And I think more importantly, people are being more rational on how they manage their purchases. So for behavior change, liquid hand soap, certainly a change, dish liquid at least through the first half of next year and oral care starting to normalize coming out of the strong first quarter panic, but much more on a historical basis. And we're seeing good growth on the innovation side that's driving more category dollar growth, which is good to see. Yes. Thanks, Rob. You've heard me mention a couple of times the incredible digital and e-commerce capabilities that our Hill's business has and how important it is that we share learnings across the broader enterprise, and we very deliberately are shifting resources back and forth between Hill's and Colgate. We're obviously getting the same type of learning now out of Asia in terms of the skill sets. And as I mentioned, I think very deliberately in my comments, we feel very strongly that up-scaling the entire organization around e-commerce and that's not just our innovators, that's not our marketing and our customer development organization. That's everyone from logistics to supply chain to packaging. So everyone truly embraces and understands that channel, we think is very important to our long-term growth, as we see more and more consumers moving into that. So the skill sets are there. The transfer of knowledge is there. And I've mentioned also that we're supplementing quite a bit of that by bringing in outside talent as well to ensure that we close any gaps that we might have in certain geographies around the world. You're seeing the benefits of that. Our e-commerce business obviously up, close to 50% in Q1; another close to 50% in Q2 and a very strong growth in Q3. Shares are up across our categories, both in North America as well as China, our two biggest markets. And we're seeing some accelerated growth, likewise, in Europe. Hill's obviously doing exceptionally well in this space. So we think we're well positioned, but we recognize we have a ways to go, given the opportunities we see to build the skill sets across the company and continue to grow market share where we're seeing significant growth. So, Mark, you've identified obviously the impact of foreign exchange, so let me give you a shared summary on a constant currency basis. So year-to-date, we're flat or up in every single division, ex Asia. We've talked a lot about Asia obviously that we're in relooking at our go-to-market, our portfolio. We talked about the progress that we're making in the second quarter and we saw that playing through. Likewise, that progress accelerated in the third quarter. So we think we're well on our way there. But across the board, our shares are flat to up in every division on a constant currency basis. Last 13 weeks in North America, we've seen good progress on our toothpaste share, particularly as we've seen the investment behind renewal take hold and some of the other innovations that we've brought into the category. You look around the world, a lot of our focus on our premium business is in Europe, both meridol and elmex and the investment we're putting behind that, we're seeing some good growth. Good share growth in the very short \u2013 recent term in both Brazil and Mexico behind some of our innovations there. Mexico now back above an 80 share. And likewise, Brazil not chasing the bottom end of the market, but getting some good premium pricing, as we mentioned earlier, and seeing that translate into more sustainable share growth across the board. Relative to categories, by and large, most of the categories that we compete in have accelerated, obviously some COVID driven, others very pricing driven and from an innovation standpoint, toothpaste in the U.S. now back up into that four to six range on a year-to-date basis. Europe still around 0% to 2%, but again driven by some good pricing. Latin America, down a little bit versus 2019, but again I think driven by a real softness in the categories in the first and second quarters are starting to come back a little bit better in the third quarter, which is encouraging. So, overall, we've got some good category growth. We talked Hill's, likewise, very good growth across the category. And Hill's and that team is very sustained no matter where you look at it around the world. So, overall, category seems pretty good right now. And I think with the innovation process we have in place and the focus on premiumization and revenue growth management, we'll continue to bring dollars into the categories in which we compete. So I guess that's the last question. Let me just close off by again thanking the Colgate people around the world on a really strong quarter and a continuation from the progress we've had over the last four to five quarters executing our strategy, building skill sets across the organization and obviously collaborating in ways that we've never collaborated before. So a great thanks to everyone. I wish all of you a safe and healthy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to catching up again on the fourth quarter results. So thanks, everyone."

This call is being recorded and is being broadcasted live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Amanda. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are; Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. I will discuss our Q2 performance and provide some context around 2020 before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on our results and the current operating environment. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourselves to one question, so that as many people as possible get to ask the question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to re-enter the queue. We are pleased with our second quarter performance as we delivered gross and net sales, organic sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow in Q2 2020 despite headwinds from foreign exchange, the worsening global economy and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe.  We delivered growth in five of our six divisions with Europe down slightly where consumers worked down some of the extra pantry inventory they purchased in the first quarter. Our gross profit margin was 60.8% on both a GAAP and a base business basis. On a GAAP basis, this was up 110 basis points year-over-year, on a base business basis our gross profit margin for the quarter was up 120 basis points, our best year-over-year performance in several years.  For the second quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 320 basis points headwinds, primarily driven by the transactional impact in foreign exchange. Productivity added 220 basis points. On a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 40 basis points as a percent of sales.  On a base business basis, our SG&A was up 60 basis points in the quarter on a percent of sales basis, driven by a 50 basis point increase in advertising to sales, as our advertising spending was up 6% year-over-year on an absolute basis, and by an increase in logistics cost as we work to meet heightened demand due to COVID-19.  Excluding logistics, our overheads were down slightly as a percent of sales, despite the FX headwinds in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 7% year-over-year, while it was up 2% on a base business basis. Our ATS was up 9% on a GAAP basis and up 3% on a base business basis.  We delivered strong free cash flow growth in the quarter, up 67% year-over-year, due primarily to favorable working capital performance, particularly in accounts receivable, net income growth and the timing of income tax payments. Year-to-date, our free cash flow was up almost 50%.  A few comments on our divisional performance now. North America delivered strong growth in the quarter, bated by increased demand across toothpaste, personal care and home care. As with Q1, growth was led by those categories, where we believe we have seen sustained changes in consumer behavior. Liquid hand soaps, hand dish soap and household cleaners.  The performance of Optic White Renewal helped drive strong growth in tootpaste in the quarter with share improvement for the Optic White franchise.  Latin America net sales were down 13.5% in the quarter, as strong pricing growth was offset by significant foreign exchange headwinds and a mid-single-digit volume decline. Our team in Latin America has responded well to the crisis, working to keep our teams safe, despite rising cases of COVID-19 in many markets, implementing pricing to offset foreign exchange movements and adapting promotional programs.  While we were pleased with our pricing performance, and the gross profit margin expansion has helped deliver, our volumes were down. We expect the balance will improve in the second half of the year driven by innovation, increased marketing spending, and a return to a more normalized promotional cadence.  Organic sales growth was strong in Brazil, despite a very difficult operating environment. Europe delivered mid-single-digit net sales growth in the quarter, as the inclusion of Filorga, more than offset the impact of foreign exchange and a modest organic volume decline. Consumers in Europe began their pantry destocking during the quarter and this led to category softness across many of our categories although liquid hand soap, dish soap and bleach remained buoyant.  We planned for this weakness in Q2 and have shifted our marketing plan to take advantage of what we expect to be improved category growth in the second half of the year as we believe consumers are well along in this destocking process.  Net sales were down 3% in Asia Pacific with volume declines in negative foreign exchange, partially offset by higher pricing as the division returned to modest organic sales growth in the quarter. China returned to growth in the second quarter and continues to improve as e-commerce drives significant growth.  While our net sales and organic sales in India were down in the quarter, trends have improved since the nationwide shutdown that negatively impacted March and April. There is still some disruption to the retail networks consistent with what you have heard from other companies.  In Africa and Eurasia, net sales were down in the quarter, as foreign exchange more than offset low-single-digit organic sales growth with strong performance in South Africa which was driven by volume growth. We took pricing in many markets including Russia to offset the foreign exchange headwind.  Growth at Hill\u2019s remain strong, driven by a combination of underlying category growth, market share gains due to the Hill Science Diet relaunch, ecommerce strength and a rebuild of retail inventories following a very strong first quarter. Once again, Hill\u2019s ecommerce business grew more than 50% in the quarter.  As we said in the press release, due to the continued uncertainties surrounding the potential business impacts from COVID-19, and the related macroeconomic volatility, we are not providing guidance. However, as we did on the first quarter call, we want to provide some context around certain factors that you should consider as you work on your models for 2020.  We believe the consumption for certain of our categories, like liquid hand soap, dish soap, bar soap and household cleaners remains elevated and that this should continue going forward. In other categories like toothpaste and pet nutrition, we believe that consumption rates are stable and that some of the first half growth that resulted in increased pantry inventory, mainly to reverse in certain geographies in the back half of the year.  As we mentioned in the press release, we still expect foreign exchange to have a negative mid-single-digit impact on net sales for the full year. Based on current spot rates, we would expect the impact to be at the low-end of that range.  We continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% on a GAAP basis. On a base business basis, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. We continue to plan for less benefit from share repurchase in the year as we focus more of our cash flow on reducing the debt on the Filorga and Hello transactions. While we pause share repurchases under our repurchase program in the second quarter, our full year share repurchase plans have not changed.  And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Noel. \nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy despite the challenging circumstances. I thought I\u2019d start off by giving a couple of thoughts on the quarter and then I\u2019ll provide you a quick update on where we stand relative to the focus areas that we laid out on the Q1 call.  So, good quarter. We continue to deliver and what I would say a very difficult operating environment in the second quarter, despite the uncertainty around COVID which is quite substantial, particularly including the accelerated case rates that we are seeing in many of our largest markets and the impact as John mentioned, the economic activity that we are seeing around the world, we delivered very strong organic sales growth above our long-term target of 3% to 5%.  Importantly, strong gross margin expansion and you saw that obviously delivered through strong funding in the growth and productivity measures and really good pricing that we are broad based across our categories and geographies. That allowed us to increase advertising which has been a consistent theme for us over the last couple quarters and importantly expand our operating margins in the end.  And again, and that\u2019s despite dealing with significant headwinds on foreign exchange particularly in Latin America, you saw the foreign exchange hit, that was around 6%. Unfortunately the headwinds from the crisis, we see them continuing and the rising number of COVID cases, particularly in some of our key markets means that the possibility of a larger disruption will continue to exist where there would be why the virus is felt or what we\u2019ve seen in some markets, government actions to defend the virus and those continue to be quite elevated and that remains our number one concern as we look at the back half of the year.  That said, underlying demand for our products remains solid, particularly in certain categories like liquid hand soap and dish, bar and cleaners, those with the health and hygiene orientation film where we compete quite successfully across the world.  We are delivering premium innovation in the quarter as well. You will hear me talk a little bit about the success of Optic White Renewal which is our highest price point toothpaste here in the U.S. have been a great success. We continue to focus on high growth channels. We\u2019ve had substantive growth in our ecommerce business and some of our discounted and club business as well.  And we are obviously dealing with a digital environment where consumers aren\u2019t leaving homes and quite successful in how we are delivering content in our advertising. That\u2019s consistent with the strategy that we\u2019ve been discussing for the last 18 months. That strategy was focusing on our core business, that\u2019s strategy is focused on adjacencies, particularly in the premium side of the business and the strategy that\u2019s focused on truly elevating our participation in fast-growing growth channels like ecommerce.  And that was enabling us as you\u2019ve seen to deliver consistent top-line growth which the necessary \u2013 absolutely necessary for the long-term health of our business and we are delivering net growth which is broad based across our categories and broad based across geographies and we need to do that with volume and pricing consistently throughout the year.  If that broad based organic sales growth will balance us to expand the gross margin, we\u2019ve been particularly focused on that this quarter. Doing that despite the significant headwinds that we\u2019ve seen from foreign exchange and the headwinds we\u2019ve seen from mix, particularly the mix of some of the categories that are elevated in the quarter.  That\u2019s allowed us to expand our gross profit pool and has allowed us to both fund the increases in marketing spending and capabilities and deliver the marketing \u2013 excuse me - the operating margin expansion to drive the EPS growth. So that\u2019s the quarter. So I thought I\u2019d now spend the rest of my opening comments around the balance of 2020 and looking a bit more into 2021.  So let me come back to the three focus areas we discussed in the first quarter call. And they were, staying true to our values and purpose which is going to help us navigate through this environment. How we as a company are adapting a strategy that we have been consistently deploying for the better part of 18 months and how we are executing that strategy with more agility and that\u2019s been a capability that we have integrated across the company and how we are managing through the crisis with an eye, importantly towards the future and I am mostly, quite frankly with how the company is dealing with the short-term issues that come weekly around the crisis, but more importantly, very focused on ensuring that the long-term health of the business and how we deploy our strategy over the next year to two is being executed.  So let me start with how we are staying true to our values and how that\u2019s helping us navigate through the challenges of this environment. Our number one priority, as you\u2019ve heard continues to be the health and safety of Colgate people and their families all around the world. We continue to enforce home policies across the board where possible, although some of our offices have began to open up.  Our global supply chain team has delivered remarkably well given the volatility they\u2019ve seen and spikes of demand for our products and the challenges with the suppliers all over the world. We are sustaining our manufacturing capacity in many cases elevating that and we are dealing with increased demand of products that have been excessive in certain categories and doing that exceedingly well.  And importantly, coming back to values and purposes is making sure that we are giving back to the communities that we serve through our #SafeHands program that we talked about in the first quarter, our partnership with the World Health Organization. We\u2019ve distributed three bars of hand soap to over 28 different countries now to promote hand washing techniques which is obviously the first line in defense in fighting COVID-19 and our teams are extraordinarily proud of the efforts that we put in place in that regard.  The second focus area is how we are adapting our strategy and executing with agility. The current strategy I\u2019ve outlined is working core adjacencies, faster growth channels. We\u2019ve been seeing consistent performance across our categories and geographies against that strategy, but we realize in the current environment that we need to continue to be agile and we need to adapt our marketing strategies where necessary.  For example, you\u2019ve seen the continued success we\u2019ve had on our Hill\u2019s business. We\u2019ve been partnering with some of our lead pet specialty retailers were moving money from in-store promotions to digital content to help elevate not only the brand itself across all ecommerce platforms, but to drive foot traffic back into their stores. That\u2019s helped us obviously drive shares during the quarter and continue to have very successful growth on the ecommerce business for the Hill\u2019s category.  As we look at the back half, we are obviously getting much more data as we build our digital capabilities. We are using that to supplement our RGM efforts. You saw significant pricing in the quarter and I am very pleased with how the team has really brought on RGM tactics using data analytics to drive pricing.  We\u2019ll use that as we think about redeploying more money in the back half into a promotion environment that will likely be more competitive. So, all consistent with the strategy that we talked about and enabling us to obviously deliver the balanced growth that you see.  So, let me move on to the third area of focus, managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. Obviously, we want to emerge from this stronger than we went in. So we will continue to invest quite aggressively in the back half of this year. We\u2019ve got strong plans both on above the line advertising, as well as in-store promotions in the back half that will complement a good innovation grid that we\u2019ve adjusted to deal with the current behaviors that we are seeing in the market. \nin that RE but driving: And as I mentioned on the last quarter, productivity will continue to be key for us. Our funding the growth overdelivered in the quarter for us. We continue to offset some of the incremental cost we\u2019ve seen from COVID. So, so far, so good. But productivity is a never ending journey for us and will continue to be a key focus as we move forward.  So, those are our priorities and although there is tremendous amount of uncertainty right now, I am confident that we have the right priorities and the right strategies and most importantly, an incredibly engaged organization deploying and executing the strategy to navigate through this crisis and ultimately emerge stronger on the other side.  So, with that, I\u2019ll open up to questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian : Hi guys. Hope all is well. Pricing number really accelerated in the quarter to 3.5% level which the best we\u2019ve seen in recent history. Was that more related to sustainable price increases or the RGM efforts that you guys mentioned that have been put in place, particularly in emerging markets which look like it drove the corporate pricing, but was there more variances specific to the quarter such as promotional spending except for that you guys mentioned.  And how sustainable are the drivers behind this pricing shrink in the quarter as you look going forward? Then perhaps you can just talk about demand elasticity in emerging markets from that pricing? Thanks. \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Darren. So, obviously, as we were coming out of the first quarter, we talked about the significant headwinds we were facing around foreign exchange particularly in some of the emerging markets and as you\u2019ve seen consistently over the years, our teams on the ground look to recover the transactional impact of those foreign exchange very, very quickly and get that pricing into the P&L.  You saw it obviously manifest itself through the pricing across the company largely driven by emerging markets, where we saw most of the foreign exchange headwinds. So, really pleased with the fact that teams got ahead of this in the quarter and the strength.  So that we now have the ability to use that pricing that we have in the P&L to obviously continue to drive gross margins moving forward, but it\u2019s necessary to invest in the business in the back half and that gives us maximum flexibility which is what we were looking for going into the third quarter.  There was some pullback in promotions in the quarter. Obviously, we were very disciplined whereas foot traffic was down in certain REs around the world [Technical Difficulty] lockdowns in some markets. We naturally pulled back with a discipline to ensure that we can move that money into the back half of the year of those promotional slots to elevate the volume that we are looking for in the back half.  So, we believe it\u2019s sustainable. We obviously took the pricing early. That gives us the most \u2013 the best ability to control that moving forward and we intend to obviously, as I said, spend in the back half. But we are comfortable with where we are in terms of our ability to manage some of the foreign exchange positivity that we have seen. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead. \nWendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about gross margin? But I don\u2019t know you called that out as a specific area of focus in the second quarter. But I am trying to get a sense of how much of the improvement \u2013 you just mentioned the reduction in promotional spending, how much of that was sort of structural funding to growth cost savings that we should think are here to say versus on a short-term crisis management type benefits? Thanks. \nNoel Wallace: Sure. Well, we obviously saw significant transaction moving through and despite that, we were able to recover that with strong pricing in the quarter. And again, we saw elevated foreign exchange headwinds coming out of the first quarter and very much elevated as we went into April and that allowed us to take the pricing early in the quarter and get the full benefit of the pricing as we went through the quarter.  Likewise, our funding to growth and productivity efforts have been very, very strong. I think certainly as we step back and manage the complexities associated with the disruptions we\u2019ve seen on the supply chain, some of the portfolio changes we\u2019ve made, obviously the leverage that we are seeing coming through the P&L, all of that has assisted us to drive more efficiency through our plans and get that delivered on the gross margin line.  So, overall, we felt very good about where the gross profit was. Obviously the pricing early in the quarter helped and the funding to growth that came through the balance of the quarter likewise helped. But again, as I mentioned, there are, Wendy, we obviously we are very selective in where we were spending money at the promotional line in the quarter.  We did pull back in some areas as we didn\u2019t see the ROI there that would have expected given the foot traffic down \u2013 it was down. As we see foot traffic come back in the back half of the year, we have full intentions to ensure that we are competitive and we continue to drive volume in the year to go. \nOperator: And next we will hear from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira : Yes. I think you and hope all is well. Noel, if you can comment a bit on the supply chain in terms of like of your capacity could increase over the quarter? And then the stock out on shelves that you are now being able to \u2013 sit to consumption, can you take us around the world? That would be great. Thank you. \nNoel Wallace: Sure. In general, obviously, as I had in my upfront comment, the supply chain has performed extremely well. The demand in some of our categories has been significant at levels that we\u2019ve never seen before. That forced our teams very early on to look at how we simplify and optimize our portfolios in order to drive throughput in our factories.  I think that\u2019s been well received by our trade partners in order to ensure that we improve \u2013 we improve our case bill numbers with them. That being said, we still have some categories where we are not meeting demand. Liquid hand soap would be one of those. The demand is in excess of our capacity. We brought on capacity through contractors.  Obviously, we saw some of the impact of that in the U.S. at the margin line, but that\u2019s allowed us to deliver against the service levels that our retail partners are expecting. We are in the midst of obviously looking at how we put more capital into certain of our facilities, because we see some of these categories will have elevated demand.  We\u2019ve done some very innovative things relative to our packaging that has allowed us to use other lines for specific categories that were not used before that will allow different types of packaging to move through the category that also elevated our demand right now.  So, on a top-line basis we are meeting pretty much all of our demand except couple categories, liquid hand soap would be one, dish soap will be another where we are still trying to catch up and we anticipate that we will see that come to fruition in the back half of this year as we bring on more capacity and deal more efficiently with some of our contractors. \nAndrea Teixeira : All right. Thank you. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nOlivia Tong : Thanks. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning. Hope everyone is well. Two questions, first, if you could just talk through growth across the categories rather than divisions if you would put a little bit of numbers behind that.  And then, one topic more specific to emerging market trend, particularly Latin America\u2019s recession, because obviously the volume numbers have come in, but pricing has gone up pretty dramatically. So if you could just talk about what you think your categories are growing at underlying and your ability to manage to any potential downshift in the macros. Thanks so much. \nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So, broad based categories are in aggregate are up versus the year ago. Obviously, to provide a significant demand of some of the health and hygiene products in the categories in which we compete. We\u2019ve seen real gyrations in the categories, so to speak, as we\u2019ve gone through the years. Some categories we saw the pantry loading in the first quarter.  Things like oral care where we saw significant spikes that have come out in the second quarter and we anticipate will continue to come out in the back half of the year. But overall, if we take it on a year-to-date basis, most of the categories continued to be obviously up. We\u2019ve seen elevated demand in the categories that we highlight, the liquid hand soap, bar soap, cleaners and dish.  And we anticipate that most of that demand will continue quite frankly as behaviors change and people work from home which obviously aids in the consumption of our products, we\u2019ll continue to see that through the back half of the year. Relative to specifically oral care across the board, we\u2019ve seen good numbers on oral care in an aggregate basis, again, largely driven by the first quarter, slowed in the second quarter, particularly driven by LATAM.  And some of the pricing that we took, but we see that starting to improve as we went through the quarter and anticipate with the activity that we are bringing to the market particularly in tooth paste in the back half that we will continue to see good demand.  Relative to LATAM specifically, we\u2019ve gone through many, many recessions in LATAM. Our teams are very well prepared for this. Some of the models we viewed that get upfront with pricing which we\u2019ve done in the quarter. That gives us the maximum flexibility as we move in through a tougher environment. We have, as you know, a very competitive portfolio of products where we innovate across price points.  Particularly, in LATAM if you take \u2013 if you break our toothpaste business down between premium, mid-price and value, we do 50% of our business in mid-price and 25% in value and as we talk, we have real opportunities in the premium and particularly the super premium side, but as consumers move into a recession, we are very well positioned for that environment given the view of our portfolio.  So, and as we mentioned, inherent to our strategy is continuing to innovate behind our big core businesses. And we have some big core innovations coming in the next 12 months. So we think we are well prepared to handle the recession and we\u2019ll see how deep it is.  Obviously, the circumstances that we are dealing with around the spread of the virus, particularly in LATAM is concerning and gives us pause, relative to being cautious as we see the categories evolve over the next six to twelve months. So we will watch that very carefully. But we are prepared to deal with it as it comes. \nOperator: And next we will hear from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nJason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Congratulations on strong results. \nNoel Wallace: Thanks. \nJason English : Noel, I think your response to last question, I heard you mentioned that throughout the quarter\u2019s trend that we saw in toothpaste or oral care in Latin America were improving. But I was hoping you could put a little more cheese on that comment. Where we should go with some quantification or specificity on how your overall business was performing in Latin America, month-on-month and maybe how it\u2019s tracking? And as you exit the quarter or so far in July? And if possible, love to hear the same type of figures for your developing markets overall? \nNoel Wallace: Right. I am not sure I understood the first, Jason. I think it was around the volume comment, pricing comment for LATAM. Let me just talk in broad strokes, LATAM for the quarter and hopefully I\u2019ll address most of your questions. By and large, a really good quarter for LATAM despite the fact that they faced significant issues and disruptions and when I say disruptions, you had a large part of the mom and pop trade in certain countries to completely shutdown big department stores, traffic was shutdown.  And so, as a result of that, you saw the shopping occasions decline in the quarter and despite that the team delivered across the board, shares were good across our categories in which we compete. As I mentioned earlier, they got the pricing. The pricing was significant in the quarter and there is no question when you take that level of the pricing and you couple that with the disruptions you are seeing in the marketplace relative to retail environment being closed.  You are going to see some volume falloff and that\u2019s exactly what happened. And as we moved through the quarter, we started to see a bit more traffic coming back into the stores and we anticipate that we\u2019ll start to continue to see that in the back half of the year. That being said, you read the same press that we read that obviously the virus \u2013 the rates of infection continue to accelerate, particularly in big markets like Brazil.  So we need to be very mindful on the implications and the decisions governments may take to continue to contain that moving forward and that usually involves mobility and availability of people to get back into stores. So, overall, LATAM shares good.  Volume little soft, but understandably given the issues that we saw around mobility and stores and likewise strong pricing that we took, but we will see strong investment in LATAM in the back half of the year, both on the advertising line to support a good innovation grid. And likewise, discipline on the promotion line to ensure that we are getting the right return on investment there. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nSteve Powers : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe going back to some of the topics you are discussing with there, may be at the start, but coming out with a slightly different perspective. If I step back and just look at the composition of your P&L for the first half, it\u2019s very healthy despite all the volatility, gross margins solidly above 60% with A&P is running at about 11.5% of sales.  Can you talk about some of the key enablers there? And is there any notable reason to think that that general composition changes meaningfully in the back half, because let\u2019s say, so far I am not sure I see one, but I just want to test my thinking on it. \nNoel Wallace: Sure. Again, let\u2019s come back to the strategy that we\u2019ve been deploying focusing on core innovation, that\u2019s big part of our portfolio and as we focus on core innovation, we take pricing. That\u2019s obviously you see that translating through the P&L. We have been quite disciplined in getting out ahead of foreign exchange particularly in some big markets that obviously delivered in the quarter through the gross margin expansion that we\u2019ve seen.  The channel expansion that we\u2019ve seen has been significant. I mean, we\u2019ve had significant growth both on ecommerce and some of the untracked channels that we don\u2019t talk a lot about, clubs and discounters.  And that again is consistent with the strategy that we\u2019ve been deploying for the last 18 months. And quite frankly, the whole challenge behind COVID-19 has been a catalyst for executing our strategy and we talk about adjacencies being the third vertical for us and we\u2019ve been aggressive in getting adjacencies into the market very quickly throughout the crisis and it\u2019s all behavior change.  We put more antibacterial products in the market. We put more health-oriented and hygiene-oriented products into the market. And again, I think that level of agility that we\u2019ve demonstrated all of that is between core adjacencies and channels helped obviously prop up the organic growth and get more consistent balanced growth, volume and pricing, as well as delivering the gross margin which allows to invest in the categories.  That being said, we do anticipate the back half to be competitive, I think as more and more markets slowly open up and again, I say that with the caveat that things can change very quickly there, but as they open up, I anticipate that we\u2019ll see more investments going back in stores and hence the reason why we wanted to get out in front of that with pricing in the quarter.  And as John mentioned in his upfront comments, we have increased advertising in the back half to deal with that and to continue to build momentum. So that\u2019s how we are looking at things. But it\u2019s challenging to be sure.  The uncertainty that we see coming out of some of the large markets, the volatility that we see in categories, and the immediacy that governments are taking sometimes to contain the virus has implications and we have to deal with those. So we remain cautious, as well relative to how we see things unfolding. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nLauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, I wanted to talk a little bit about cost beyond you talked a bit about the productivity. In general, last year talking more about executing with agility and so on and we talked about quite a bit on the revenue side.  But I was wondering, as you\u2019ve navigated the first few months of this crisis, and things that maybe you have uncovered in the way that you operate, the way you are structured where cost resides in the P&L and the new organization, outside of T&E, but are there areas that you are finding that maybe are right for \u2013 to further efficiency and so that the kind of stronger applies to cost structure not just top-line. Thanks. \nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Couple areas. Obviously, we\u2019ve been talking productivity beyond just the success we\u2019ve had with funding to growth over the years and as an organization, quarterly we\u2019ve really opened all line items now to think about productivity very differently. And so, beyond just the typical cost structure of our products which we do extremely well, we are now interrogating all areas of the business.  And quite frankly, as we have come into the crisis, it opened our eyes to opportunities that we can go after and inefficiencies that we have throughout the income statement. So, let me talk about a couple of those. Now obvious ones you would expect obviously our travel budgets with operating 200 countries around the world were significant.  And the digital transformation that we\u2019ve been under and in connecting everyone digitally and our ability to day one moved to a virtual workforce have allowed us to obviously save, substantive amount of money on the travel side and there is no question that behavior and from what we\u2019ve learned will to continue to deliver savings for us moving forward and we will how we think about that.  There is no better way than to learn the polls of a business and being on the ground and that\u2019s the big part of who are as a company, but we\u2019ve learned to use virtual tools in a very different way whether it\u2019s technology that we have in our plants, where we don\u2019t have to spend maintenance people to the plants anymore that they can work through different systems to see actually at what point on in a plant virtually and address issues from thousands of miles away versus getting on an airplane to having business review meetings with teams. So we are getting better and better of that and I think that behavior will continue.  Portfolio, obviously, going into this, we always have a long tail and we\u2019ve had this strategy that we\u2019ve been executing for the last couple of years and grow the head and cut the tail and as we went into the crisis, obviously cutting the tail became essential in order to meet the demand and that has allowed our \u2013 out in the throughput and the efficiencies and to case fill on our plants to grow quite significantly.  And there is a lot of learning there. Now we have cut some SKUs that have very select and unique consumers that we need to look to how we ultimately optimize moving forward. But I do not anticipate that we\u2019ll get back to the full breadth of the portfolio that we had before, as we work with the trade to really optimize it.  And then secondly, I think, what we\u2019ve learned a lot is how do you manage on omni-channel environment and do that in an effective way that it allows us to map the consumer journey, understand where those unique consumers are and if they are unique and they are shopping online, perhaps we expand the tail online versus doing it through the brick and mortar shelf and we\u2019ve learned to leverage that more effectively as we move forward.  And the other area would certainly be on \u2013 and looking at the overall cost structures of our offices and what we are doing around the world and making sure that we think about them differently in the long-term to ensure that we maximize effectiveness of our teams on the ground and we are looking at the cost in a way that we have an opportunity to potentially generate some savings there.  And then the last is obviously, elevating funding to growth. And as we look at our products and our innovation strategy, we are looking at more platform ideas, Lauren, across the board, where we are getting more synergies with respect to our formulation development and using that more successfully on a global platform.  The last would be a strategy that is now underway being led by our supply chain, which is really looking at its segmentation of our facilities little bit differently and that\u2019s taking big facilities and making them even more efficient in the long run and looking at how we use other facilities that will become far more agile and flexible to deal with smaller runs, to deal with innovation very differently, to deal with direct-to-consumer brands that we maybe incubating and do that in a very cost-effective way and complementing that, excuse me \u2013 with a \u2013 manufacturers whereas they might be more efficient.  So, a multitude of things on the productivity side, Lauren and I think you will continue to hear more about that as we move forward. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nKevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. And congratulations on the strong results. Noel, I wanted to pick up on Jason English\u2019s line of questioning around the decision, specifically around Latin America, but mine is really around the decision not to reinstitute guidance and the takeaway here for investors.  So, understanding that LATAM is a bigger portion of your portfolio relative to the peer set, I know it\u2019s not lost from you guys that, we\u2019ve seen Kimberly Clark and Procter and Church and Dwight this morning reinstitute the practice that Procter is looking out in the entire fiscal year with their guidance.  John gave a number of directional guidance points, if you will, strong organic sales growth in the first half of the year, but basically through July. I think the tone on the call here has been pretty positive and it sounds like you guys are going to be resuming share repurchases. So, that\u2019s all a big wind up here. How much do you guys deliberate on this?  What are you seeing in July, specifically? And is the message here, really this is more about conservatism related to the pandemic and probably specifically Latin America as opposed to any sort of sequential weakness in July that the market should be concerned about? Thanks. \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Let me start with July. We are going to avoid getting into a precedent despite the fact that I am very sensitive and understand in the absence of guidance that externally everyone is looking for more and more information. But what we don\u2019t want to do is get into every earnings call talking about the current month that we are in. I will say that July is coming in as planned.  Relative to guidance again, not much to add versus what you have in the print. Specifically, the unknowns of the unknowns, I mean, we\u2019ve seen anything versus where we were in the first quarter, we\u2019ve seen the virus unfortunately expand. We\u2019ve seen case counts accelerate, particularly in some of our larger markets. We see increasingly more disruptions in some of those markets relative to retail closures.  At least temporary closures. We\u2019ve seen consumer behavior modify, which has manifested its way through a significant volatility from week-to-week in the categories which makes it very difficult to predict and plan effectively. So, with that as the backdrop, we continued to hold our position in that regard.  And we understand moving forward that we would prefer to provide guidance and as we get more and more information and get more confidence, in terms of the way we see things moving, we will certainly come back and have that discussion again. \nOperator: And next we will hear from Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. \nKeaton Green: Hi. This is Green on for Bill. Thanks for taking my question. I had one on Hill\u2019s and specifically the volume growth hoping you guys could kind of break that out a little bit more. Is it more consumers coming into the franchise from, perhaps a different brand? Are you seeing more consumers adding dogs to defending their households and they have increased consumption at home?  And then kind of looking out going forward, how do you see that growth playing out over the kind of remainder of the year, the next few years when you step up investment and kind of the momentum that you have going right now. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Great. Thanks, Bill. So, Hill\u2019s, another very strong quarter and again, let\u2019s come back to the fundamentals. Great core innovation behind the Science Diet relaunch which continues to perform extremely well. And is now at the tail end of its global roll out and getting significantly stepped up advertising support behind that.  We\u2019ve seen the adjacencies as we moved into fast-growing segments, particularly the West segment which has been quite buoyant around the world. And obviously the channel expansion strategy that we\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve executed across the Colgate business was in very much - was led by the learning that we have coming out of the Hill\u2019s business, their ecommerce business is up another 50%, shares are up.  We are getting better and better at understanding that channel, particularly around the digital complements that come behind that. You saw a significant step-up in advertising investment in the quarter. We will see that level of spending continue in the back half of the year, specifically behind the following fundamentals.  This brand continues to have very, very low brand awareness, 3% as an example in the U.S. So our ability to continue to drive awareness behind the premium aspects of the brand and the science and the biology-based nutrition is a significant growth opportunity for the business. And we\u2019ve done that. The advertisement has allowed us to expand \u2013 get more distribution in our portfolio.  Obviously, look at other rapidly growing channels and drive distribution there and continuing to premierize and take pricing where we can. So the volume growth has been a function of obviously the share growth that we\u2019ve seen, the cannel growth that we\u2019ve seen, the premiumization, which obviously comes through more on pricing.  And likewise, you did see a little bit of pantry loading in the first quarter as consumers were facing a potential lockdown, particularly in North America, we did see some elevated purchases that we saw start to come out, In the second quarter, anticipate that we\u2019ll see a little bit more of that come out in the second half.  But by and large, the business is pretty solid. Looking longer term, obviously continued strong innovation, particularly behind our prescription diet business, looking at new digital platforms that we\u2019ve talked about the Hill\u2019s is a home idea which is allowing that to provide their pet owners with supply of our product delivered directly to their home.  So, looking through different innovation ideas, where there is using digital platforms or innovating across our prescription diet business in the back half and moving into 2021, that will be the key focus for that business moving forward. So, again, strong fundamentals behind that business. Pet ownership, you\u2019ve seen the pet adoption accelerate significantly in the first half of the year.  Our estimation is that will slow quite a bit in the back half, but there is no question there are more dogs to be fed and that we are going to do everything we can to ensure that they are feeding them Hill\u2019s. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead. \nMark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks. And good morning everybody. I wanted to ask a related question on the guidance and then kind of a related equally from that. So, I just I am still struggling a little bit with why you are not providing guidance, I obviously get \u2013 what\u2019s going on in the world, but what is different that you are seeing?  Or what is more difficult in terms of looking out that gives you pause to the seven months for the year as your \u2013 kind of how we see it and sort of related to that, maybe one of the thesis that we hear from folks most often on the stocking. The story is your market share continues to underperform. So, are those two somewhat related?  Do you have some sort of visibility on the market share begins to improve. I guess some of that has to do with translation on foreign exchange that should \u2013 in theory now start to look better as $1 million with where it is.  So maybe, kind of first comment to the second point and really kind of how do you think about the market share trends progressing as we move over the next kind of six to twelve months as much as you can provide, that would be helpful? \nNoel Wallace: Thanks, Mark. Let me come back again on the guidance question. Not much more to add there. But, let me assure the team, there is tremendous complexity and volatility week-to-week based on what\u2019s happening with COVID. And you get decisions made in countries, whether it\u2019s shutting down borders, you have an incredibly complex supply chain.  Second and third order derivative effects of implications in one market to another. You\u2019ve obviously seen the escalation of case counts in big markets for us, mainly Brazil, India and Mexico. And all of those are very difficult to predict and they are all kind of intertwined. And when you get the triangulation of those, it creates significant uncertainty relative to how things can unfold.  That being said, we are executing against it very well, but I assure you there is a lot of work that goes behind the day-to-day in making sure that we continue to operate and deal with the circumstances that confront us. And those circumstances make it very difficult to predict exactly which ways things are going to go. So, not much more to add on the guidance question.  On market share, overall market shares, we are okay in the quarter, but we are not that pleased quite frankly. Yes, you mentioned the translation impact. That was a big impact on our total shares, obviously with LATAM having such strong shares.  Their shares were actually up half a share point in the year-to-date basis, but given the translation impact of those currencies on a global basis, we saw our shares come down. U.S., a little soft in the quarter. I talked a little bit about pulling back on some promotions. Now we feel comfortable with where we are relative to the promotional environment.  There was some \u2013 still surprising me some aggressive couponing going on that we quite frankly didn\u2019t follow and that we would like to try to avoid in the future as we don\u2019t think that\u2019s an effective use of money. But we have the right promotions generated through our revenue management efforts that we see ready to go in the back half, but coupled with strong innovation.  I would say that the launch of Optic White Renewal in the U.S. has been very, very successful. I mentioned earlier that\u2019s our first $7 price point, hit a two share, 50% of that incremental. It\u2019s been the most successful new product launch in the category since the launch of Optic White ten years ago.  So again, I think we are getting great confidence in our ability to premiumize the category and as we move into a more recessionary environment as we discussed earlier, we\u2019ll have a strong base business and a strong core innovation of plan to address that. If you look across the other categories, by and large pretty good share performance.  Many of those categories quite frankly driven \u2013 share driven by demand and the ability to supply the shelves, whether it would be liquid hand soap, or dish which we have not necessarily met the demand at this stage and share has suffered a little. But where we are focused and where we are spending our money, we are getting some share growth.  We are not pleased quite frankly with some of the share performance in the U.S. But again, we believe that was somewhat circumstantial and we got strong plans and investment in the back half to change that. \nOperator: And our final question will come from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead. \nRob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. I am wondering if we can kind of dial back to some of the pre-COVID priorities that you had, just to kind of get a sense of how you are doing on those as the world changed and specifically, some of the premiumization efforts outside of the U.S., the competition against local natural brands in China and India, the expansion of the Elmex, Meridol basically, if you could give us a rundown of those initiatives and have you maintained kind of the foot on the pedal on those?  How are you doing? And are they still as relevant as before? \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Rob. And then, good morning. So, again, I talked about, we expect the strategy that we had put in place 18 months ago, quite frankly as we went to the crisis and interrogated that we felt it was perfectly suited for the behaviors and the dynamics we were seeing in the category. I mean, we needed to continue and they are behind the core business.  The adjacencies were there and that allows us to rethink some of our core businesses and how we get into rapidly growing segments. Take floor cleaners where we\u2019ve expanded the portfolio into more hygiene anti-bacterial related product. And likewise, the focus we were on for quite some time to truly elevate our digital commerce business and you\u2019ve seen consistent growth both from a top-line performance, as well as share performance in ecommerce.  And a lot of that capability is being driven by the success we\u2019ve had in Hill\u2019s and obviously ramping up capabilities across the company both in the digital area as well as the ecommerce space and that we\u2019ve done that through developing our internal talent, as well as bringing in outside talent that we think has been a real boost for the organization to help us think a little bit differently.  So, strategy working and nothing that we feel we need to change, continue to be agile as we move forward. I think some of the learning we\u2019ve had on the agility side as it we can innovate much, much faster than we have in the past. And that we intend to systemize that as we move forward to make sure that we capture that learning on an ongoing basis.  Premiumization has been a big part. I mentioned earlier in the call, we do roughly 50% of our toothpaste business in mid-price and another 25% in value and the balance in premium. And if you take the premium, the fastest growing part of the market has been the ultra-premium where we have not competed. The launch of Optic While Renewal is an example at $7 taking that bundle and moving that around the world is an opportunity for us.  And I think it has certainly given us confidence, notwithstanding the fact that it is tough to launch premium bundle successful, but given us confidence we have now a lot of the capabilities necessary to push more aggressively on premium. And we\u2019ve learned throughout the history and particularly with the last recession, 2008, 2009, you may recall Rob that one of the most successful launches during that period was Optic White.  And that was an affordable luxury and we understand that there still is a segment of the market looking for premium, value-oriented bundles that provide a significant point of difference and Renewal is one. And so, we will balance that very carefully as we move into a more challenged macro environment and we\u2019ll do that with super premium innovation in the right markets, as well as continuing to focus on our core.  On naturals, to your question there, we are excited about our natural strategy. Tom\u2019s has got some terrific plans ahead of it with Craig and Dubitsky and Lauri and the team from Hello are doing an outstanding job opening our eyes the opportunities in naturals across the category. The Hello brand continue to expand in the U.S. and is delivering nice growth and I think that category we know long-term will be very, very beneficial.  Consumers continue to be extremely interested in purpose-driven brands, particularly brands with a strong sustainability profile and while the short-term in the crisis we saw a fall-off of natural brands. We\u2019ve seen that category start to rebound and we expect longer term, it will continue to be a healthy growth opportunity for us.  Your last comment I think was on the Elmex expansion. Again, as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve been very selective with that strategy and where we move Elmex and Meridol into markets with high pharmacy retail environments and we are doing that very successfully. Brazil was the early launch, Great results coming out of that through the pharmacy expansion plan we have there.  This is not a short-term volume strategy. We want to build a long-term therapeutic business in the pharmacy channel and doing that with strong therapeutic brands like Elmex and Meridol and you are going to see that continue to unfold as we increase investment and continue to build a long-term sustainable business for the markets where we extend it. That will have a couple more to expand in as we move into 2021. So, hopefully, that answers your question, Rob.  And I guess, that brings us to the end. So let me just sum it up. I think overall, a quality quarter, but we all recognize, we\u2019ve got more work to do and a lot of challenges still in front of us. I want to thank 36,000 Colgate people around the world who continue to be extraordinarily resilient, well-focused on executing our strategy, building new capabilities across the organization and winning on the ground and the success of the quarter goes out to them.  So, thanks everyone and we look forward to catching up with everyone soon. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy despite the challenging circumstances. I thought I'd start off by giving a couple of thoughts on the quarter and then I'll provide you a quick update on where we stand relative to the focus areas that we laid out on the Q1 call.  So, good quarter. We continue to deliver and what I would say a very difficult operating environment in the second quarter, despite the uncertainty around COVID which is quite substantial, particularly including the accelerated case rates that we are seeing in many of our largest markets and the impact as John mentioned, the economic activity that we are seeing around the world, we delivered very strong organic sales growth above our long-term target of 3% to 5%.  Importantly, strong gross margin expansion and you saw that obviously delivered through strong funding in the growth and productivity measures and really good pricing that we are broad based across our categories and geographies. That allowed us to increase advertising which has been a consistent theme for us over the last couple quarters and importantly expand our operating margins in the end.  And again, and that's despite dealing with significant headwinds on foreign exchange particularly in Latin America, you saw the foreign exchange hit, that was around 6%. Unfortunately the headwinds from the crisis, we see them continuing and the rising number of COVID cases, particularly in some of our key markets means that the possibility of a larger disruption will continue to exist where there would be why the virus is felt or what we've seen in some markets, government actions to defend the virus and those continue to be quite elevated and that remains our number one concern as we look at the back half of the year.  That said, underlying demand for our products remains solid, particularly in certain categories like liquid hand soap and dish, bar and cleaners, those with the health and hygiene orientation film where we compete quite successfully across the world.  We are delivering premium innovation in the quarter as well. You will hear me talk a little bit about the success of Optic White Renewal which is our highest price point toothpaste here in the U.S. have been a great success. We continue to focus on high growth channels. We've had substantive growth in our ecommerce business and some of our discounted and club business as well.  And we are obviously dealing with a digital environment where consumers aren't leaving homes and quite successful in how we are delivering content in our advertising. That's consistent with the strategy that we've been discussing for the last 18 months. That strategy was focusing on our core business, that's strategy is focused on adjacencies, particularly in the premium side of the business and the strategy that's focused on truly elevating our participation in fast-growing growth channels like ecommerce.  And that was enabling us as you've seen to deliver consistent top-line growth which the necessary \u2013 absolutely necessary for the long-term health of our business and we are delivering net growth which is broad based across our categories and broad based across geographies and we need to do that with volume and pricing consistently throughout the year.  If that broad based organic sales growth will balance us to expand the gross margin, we've been particularly focused on that this quarter. Doing that despite the significant headwinds that we've seen from foreign exchange and the headwinds we've seen from mix, particularly the mix of some of the categories that are elevated in the quarter.  That's allowed us to expand our gross profit pool and has allowed us to both fund the increases in marketing spending and capabilities and deliver the marketing \u2013 excuse me - the operating margin expansion to drive the EPS growth. So that's the quarter. So I thought I'd now spend the rest of my opening comments around the balance of 2020 and looking a bit more into 2021.  So let me come back to the three focus areas we discussed in the first quarter call. And they were, staying true to our values and purpose which is going to help us navigate through this environment. How we as a company are adapting a strategy that we have been consistently deploying for the better part of 18 months and how we are executing that strategy with more agility and that's been a capability that we have integrated across the company and how we are managing through the crisis with an eye, importantly towards the future and I am mostly, quite frankly with how the company is dealing with the short-term issues that come weekly around the crisis, but more importantly, very focused on ensuring that the long-term health of the business and how we deploy our strategy over the next year to two is being executed.  So let me start with how we are staying true to our values and how that's helping us navigate through the challenges of this environment. Our number one priority, as you've heard continues to be the health and safety of Colgate people and their families all around the world. We continue to enforce home policies across the board where possible, although some of our offices have began to open up.  Our global supply chain team has delivered remarkably well given the volatility they've seen and spikes of demand for our products and the challenges with the suppliers all over the world. We are sustaining our manufacturing capacity in many cases elevating that and we are dealing with increased demand of products that have been excessive in certain categories and doing that exceedingly well.  And importantly, coming back to values and purposes is making sure that we are giving back to the communities that we serve through our #SafeHands program that we talked about in the first quarter, our partnership with the World Health Organization. We've distributed three bars of hand soap to over 28 different countries now to promote hand washing techniques which is obviously the first line in defense in fighting COVID-19 and our teams are extraordinarily proud of the efforts that we put in place in that regard.  The second focus area is how we are adapting our strategy and executing with agility. The current strategy I've outlined is working core adjacencies, faster growth channels. We've been seeing consistent performance across our categories and geographies against that strategy, but we realize in the current environment that we need to continue to be agile and we need to adapt our marketing strategies where necessary.  For example, you've seen the continued success we've had on our Hill's business. We've been partnering with some of our lead pet specialty retailers were moving money from in-store promotions to digital content to help elevate not only the brand itself across all ecommerce platforms, but to drive foot traffic back into their stores. That's helped us obviously drive shares during the quarter and continue to have very successful growth on the ecommerce business for the Hill's category.  As we look at the back half, we are obviously getting much more data as we build our digital capabilities. We are using that to supplement our RGM efforts. You saw significant pricing in the quarter and I am very pleased with how the team has really brought on RGM tactics using data analytics to drive pricing.  We'll use that as we think about redeploying more money in the back half into a promotion environment that will likely be more competitive. So, all consistent with the strategy that we talked about and enabling us to obviously deliver the balanced growth that you see.  So, let me move on to the third area of focus, managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. Obviously, we want to emerge from this stronger than we went in. So we will continue to invest quite aggressively in the back half of this year. We've got strong plans both on above the line advertising, as well as in-store promotions in the back half that will complement a good innovation grid that we've adjusted to deal with the current behaviors that we are seeing in the market. Yes. Thanks, Darren. So, obviously, as we were coming out of the first quarter, we talked about the significant headwinds we were facing around foreign exchange particularly in some of the emerging markets and as you've seen consistently over the years, our teams on the ground look to recover the transactional impact of those foreign exchange very, very quickly and get that pricing into the P&L.  You saw it obviously manifest itself through the pricing across the company largely driven by emerging markets, where we saw most of the foreign exchange headwinds. So, really pleased with the fact that teams got ahead of this in the quarter and the strength.  So that we now have the ability to use that pricing that we have in the P&L to obviously continue to drive gross margins moving forward, but it's necessary to invest in the business in the back half and that gives us maximum flexibility which is what we were looking for going into the third quarter.  There was some pullback in promotions in the quarter. Obviously, we were very disciplined whereas foot traffic was down in certain REs around the world [Technical Difficulty] lockdowns in some markets. We naturally pulled back with a discipline to ensure that we can move that money into the back half of the year of those promotional slots to elevate the volume that we are looking for in the back half.  So, we believe it's sustainable. We obviously took the pricing early. That gives us the most \u2013 the best ability to control that moving forward and we intend to obviously, as I said, spend in the back half. But we are comfortable with where we are in terms of our ability to manage some of the foreign exchange positivity that we have seen. Sure. Well, we obviously saw significant transaction moving through and despite that, we were able to recover that with strong pricing in the quarter. And again, we saw elevated foreign exchange headwinds coming out of the first quarter and very much elevated as we went into April and that allowed us to take the pricing early in the quarter and get the full benefit of the pricing as we went through the quarter.  Likewise, our funding to growth and productivity efforts have been very, very strong. I think certainly as we step back and manage the complexities associated with the disruptions we've seen on the supply chain, some of the portfolio changes we've made, obviously the leverage that we are seeing coming through the P&L, all of that has assisted us to drive more efficiency through our plans and get that delivered on the gross margin line.  So, overall, we felt very good about where the gross profit was. Obviously the pricing early in the quarter helped and the funding to growth that came through the balance of the quarter likewise helped. But again, as I mentioned, there are, Wendy, we obviously we are very selective in where we were spending money at the promotional line in the quarter.  We did pull back in some areas as we didn't see the ROI there that would have expected given the foot traffic down \u2013 it was down. As we see foot traffic come back in the back half of the year, we have full intentions to ensure that we are competitive and we continue to drive volume in the year to go. Sure. In general, obviously, as I had in my upfront comment, the supply chain has performed extremely well. The demand in some of our categories has been significant at levels that we've never seen before. That forced our teams very early on to look at how we simplify and optimize our portfolios in order to drive throughput in our factories.  I think that's been well received by our trade partners in order to ensure that we improve \u2013 we improve our case bill numbers with them. That being said, we still have some categories where we are not meeting demand. Liquid hand soap would be one of those. The demand is in excess of our capacity. We brought on capacity through contractors.  Obviously, we saw some of the impact of that in the U.S. at the margin line, but that's allowed us to deliver against the service levels that our retail partners are expecting. We are in the midst of obviously looking at how we put more capital into certain of our facilities, because we see some of these categories will have elevated demand.  We've done some very innovative things relative to our packaging that has allowed us to use other lines for specific categories that were not used before that will allow different types of packaging to move through the category that also elevated our demand right now.  So, on a top-line basis we are meeting pretty much all of our demand except couple categories, liquid hand soap would be one, dish soap will be another where we are still trying to catch up and we anticipate that we will see that come to fruition in the back half of this year as we bring on more capacity and deal more efficiently with some of our contractors. Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So, broad based categories are in aggregate are up versus the year ago. Obviously, to provide a significant demand of some of the health and hygiene products in the categories in which we compete. We've seen real gyrations in the categories, so to speak, as we've gone through the years. Some categories we saw the pantry loading in the first quarter.  Things like oral care where we saw significant spikes that have come out in the second quarter and we anticipate will continue to come out in the back half of the year. But overall, if we take it on a year-to-date basis, most of the categories continued to be obviously up. We've seen elevated demand in the categories that we highlight, the liquid hand soap, bar soap, cleaners and dish.  And we anticipate that most of that demand will continue quite frankly as behaviors change and people work from home which obviously aids in the consumption of our products, we'll continue to see that through the back half of the year. Relative to specifically oral care across the board, we've seen good numbers on oral care in an aggregate basis, again, largely driven by the first quarter, slowed in the second quarter, particularly driven by LATAM.  And some of the pricing that we took, but we see that starting to improve as we went through the quarter and anticipate with the activity that we are bringing to the market particularly in tooth paste in the back half that we will continue to see good demand.  Relative to LATAM specifically, we've gone through many, many recessions in LATAM. Our teams are very well prepared for this. Some of the models we viewed that get upfront with pricing which we've done in the quarter. That gives us the maximum flexibility as we move in through a tougher environment. We have, as you know, a very competitive portfolio of products where we innovate across price points.  Particularly, in LATAM if you take \u2013 if you break our toothpaste business down between premium, mid-price and value, we do 50% of our business in mid-price and 25% in value and as we talk, we have real opportunities in the premium and particularly the super premium side, but as consumers move into a recession, we are very well positioned for that environment given the view of our portfolio.  So, and as we mentioned, inherent to our strategy is continuing to innovate behind our big core businesses. And we have some big core innovations coming in the next 12 months. So we think we are well prepared to handle the recession and we'll see how deep it is.  Obviously, the circumstances that we are dealing with around the spread of the virus, particularly in LATAM is concerning and gives us pause, relative to being cautious as we see the categories evolve over the next six to twelve months. So we will watch that very carefully. But we are prepared to deal with it as it comes. Thanks. Right. I am not sure I understood the first, Jason. I think it was around the volume comment, pricing comment for LATAM. Let me just talk in broad strokes, LATAM for the quarter and hopefully I'll address most of your questions. By and large, a really good quarter for LATAM despite the fact that they faced significant issues and disruptions and when I say disruptions, you had a large part of the mom and pop trade in certain countries to completely shutdown big department stores, traffic was shutdown.  And so, as a result of that, you saw the shopping occasions decline in the quarter and despite that the team delivered across the board, shares were good across our categories in which we compete. As I mentioned earlier, they got the pricing. The pricing was significant in the quarter and there is no question when you take that level of the pricing and you couple that with the disruptions you are seeing in the marketplace relative to retail environment being closed.  You are going to see some volume falloff and that's exactly what happened. And as we moved through the quarter, we started to see a bit more traffic coming back into the stores and we anticipate that we'll start to continue to see that in the back half of the year. That being said, you read the same press that we read that obviously the virus \u2013 the rates of infection continue to accelerate, particularly in big markets like Brazil.  So we need to be very mindful on the implications and the decisions governments may take to continue to contain that moving forward and that usually involves mobility and availability of people to get back into stores. So, overall, LATAM shares good.  Volume little soft, but understandably given the issues that we saw around mobility and stores and likewise strong pricing that we took, but we will see strong investment in LATAM in the back half of the year, both on the advertising line to support a good innovation grid. And likewise, discipline on the promotion line to ensure that we are getting the right return on investment there. Sure. Again, let's come back to the strategy that we've been deploying focusing on core innovation, that's big part of our portfolio and as we focus on core innovation, we take pricing. That's obviously you see that translating through the P&L. We have been quite disciplined in getting out ahead of foreign exchange particularly in some big markets that obviously delivered in the quarter through the gross margin expansion that we've seen.  The channel expansion that we've seen has been significant. I mean, we've had significant growth both on ecommerce and some of the untracked channels that we don't talk a lot about, clubs and discounters.  And that again is consistent with the strategy that we've been deploying for the last 18 months. And quite frankly, the whole challenge behind COVID-19 has been a catalyst for executing our strategy and we talk about adjacencies being the third vertical for us and we've been aggressive in getting adjacencies into the market very quickly throughout the crisis and it's all behavior change.  We put more antibacterial products in the market. We put more health-oriented and hygiene-oriented products into the market. And again, I think that level of agility that we've demonstrated all of that is between core adjacencies and channels helped obviously prop up the organic growth and get more consistent balanced growth, volume and pricing, as well as delivering the gross margin which allows to invest in the categories.  That being said, we do anticipate the back half to be competitive, I think as more and more markets slowly open up and again, I say that with the caveat that things can change very quickly there, but as they open up, I anticipate that we'll see more investments going back in stores and hence the reason why we wanted to get out in front of that with pricing in the quarter.  And as John mentioned in his upfront comments, we have increased advertising in the back half to deal with that and to continue to build momentum. So that's how we are looking at things. But it's challenging to be sure.  The uncertainty that we see coming out of some of the large markets, the volatility that we see in categories, and the immediacy that governments are taking sometimes to contain the virus has implications and we have to deal with those. So we remain cautious, as well relative to how we see things unfolding. Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Couple areas. Obviously, we've been talking productivity beyond just the success we've had with funding to growth over the years and as an organization, quarterly we've really opened all line items now to think about productivity very differently. And so, beyond just the typical cost structure of our products which we do extremely well, we are now interrogating all areas of the business.  And quite frankly, as we have come into the crisis, it opened our eyes to opportunities that we can go after and inefficiencies that we have throughout the income statement. So, let me talk about a couple of those. Now obvious ones you would expect obviously our travel budgets with operating 200 countries around the world were significant.  And the digital transformation that we've been under and in connecting everyone digitally and our ability to day one moved to a virtual workforce have allowed us to obviously save, substantive amount of money on the travel side and there is no question that behavior and from what we've learned will to continue to deliver savings for us moving forward and we will how we think about that.  There is no better way than to learn the polls of a business and being on the ground and that's the big part of who are as a company, but we've learned to use virtual tools in a very different way whether it's technology that we have in our plants, where we don't have to spend maintenance people to the plants anymore that they can work through different systems to see actually at what point on in a plant virtually and address issues from thousands of miles away versus getting on an airplane to having business review meetings with teams. So we are getting better and better of that and I think that behavior will continue.  Portfolio, obviously, going into this, we always have a long tail and we've had this strategy that we've been executing for the last couple of years and grow the head and cut the tail and as we went into the crisis, obviously cutting the tail became essential in order to meet the demand and that has allowed our \u2013 out in the throughput and the efficiencies and to case fill on our plants to grow quite significantly.  And there is a lot of learning there. Now we have cut some SKUs that have very select and unique consumers that we need to look to how we ultimately optimize moving forward. But I do not anticipate that we'll get back to the full breadth of the portfolio that we had before, as we work with the trade to really optimize it.  And then secondly, I think, what we've learned a lot is how do you manage on omni-channel environment and do that in an effective way that it allows us to map the consumer journey, understand where those unique consumers are and if they are unique and they are shopping online, perhaps we expand the tail online versus doing it through the brick and mortar shelf and we've learned to leverage that more effectively as we move forward.  And the other area would certainly be on \u2013 and looking at the overall cost structures of our offices and what we are doing around the world and making sure that we think about them differently in the long-term to ensure that we maximize effectiveness of our teams on the ground and we are looking at the cost in a way that we have an opportunity to potentially generate some savings there.  And then the last is obviously, elevating funding to growth. And as we look at our products and our innovation strategy, we are looking at more platform ideas, Lauren, across the board, where we are getting more synergies with respect to our formulation development and using that more successfully on a global platform.  The last would be a strategy that is now underway being led by our supply chain, which is really looking at its segmentation of our facilities little bit differently and that's taking big facilities and making them even more efficient in the long run and looking at how we use other facilities that will become far more agile and flexible to deal with smaller runs, to deal with innovation very differently, to deal with direct-to-consumer brands that we maybe incubating and do that in a very cost-effective way and complementing that, excuse me \u2013 with a \u2013 manufacturers whereas they might be more efficient.  So, a multitude of things on the productivity side, Lauren and I think you will continue to hear more about that as we move forward. Yes. Thanks, Kevin. Let me start with July. We are going to avoid getting into a precedent despite the fact that I am very sensitive and understand in the absence of guidance that externally everyone is looking for more and more information. But what we don't want to do is get into every earnings call talking about the current month that we are in. I will say that July is coming in as planned.  Relative to guidance again, not much to add versus what you have in the print. Specifically, the unknowns of the unknowns, I mean, we've seen anything versus where we were in the first quarter, we've seen the virus unfortunately expand. We've seen case counts accelerate, particularly in some of our larger markets. We see increasingly more disruptions in some of those markets relative to retail closures.  At least temporary closures. We've seen consumer behavior modify, which has manifested its way through a significant volatility from week-to-week in the categories which makes it very difficult to predict and plan effectively. So, with that as the backdrop, we continued to hold our position in that regard.  And we understand moving forward that we would prefer to provide guidance and as we get more and more information and get more confidence, in terms of the way we see things moving, we will certainly come back and have that discussion again. Great. Thanks, Bill. So, Hill's, another very strong quarter and again, let's come back to the fundamentals. Great core innovation behind the Science Diet relaunch which continues to perform extremely well. And is now at the tail end of its global roll out and getting significantly stepped up advertising support behind that.  We've seen the adjacencies as we moved into fast-growing segments, particularly the West segment which has been quite buoyant around the world. And obviously the channel expansion strategy that we've seen that we've executed across the Colgate business was in very much - was led by the learning that we have coming out of the Hill's business, their ecommerce business is up another 50%, shares are up.  We are getting better and better at understanding that channel, particularly around the digital complements that come behind that. You saw a significant step-up in advertising investment in the quarter. We will see that level of spending continue in the back half of the year, specifically behind the following fundamentals.  This brand continues to have very, very low brand awareness, 3% as an example in the U.S. So our ability to continue to drive awareness behind the premium aspects of the brand and the science and the biology-based nutrition is a significant growth opportunity for the business. And we've done that. The advertisement has allowed us to expand \u2013 get more distribution in our portfolio.  Obviously, look at other rapidly growing channels and drive distribution there and continuing to premierize and take pricing where we can. So the volume growth has been a function of obviously the share growth that we've seen, the cannel growth that we've seen, the premiumization, which obviously comes through more on pricing.  And likewise, you did see a little bit of pantry loading in the first quarter as consumers were facing a potential lockdown, particularly in North America, we did see some elevated purchases that we saw start to come out, In the second quarter, anticipate that we'll see a little bit more of that come out in the second half.  But by and large, the business is pretty solid. Looking longer term, obviously continued strong innovation, particularly behind our prescription diet business, looking at new digital platforms that we've talked about the Hill's is a home idea which is allowing that to provide their pet owners with supply of our product delivered directly to their home.  So, looking through different innovation ideas, where there is using digital platforms or innovating across our prescription diet business in the back half and moving into 2021, that will be the key focus for that business moving forward. So, again, strong fundamentals behind that business. Pet ownership, you've seen the pet adoption accelerate significantly in the first half of the year.  Our estimation is that will slow quite a bit in the back half, but there is no question there are more dogs to be fed and that we are going to do everything we can to ensure that they are feeding them Hill's. Thanks, Mark. Let me come back again on the guidance question. Not much more to add there. But, let me assure the team, there is tremendous complexity and volatility week-to-week based on what's happening with COVID. And you get decisions made in countries, whether it's shutting down borders, you have an incredibly complex supply chain.  Second and third order derivative effects of implications in one market to another. You've obviously seen the escalation of case counts in big markets for us, mainly Brazil, India and Mexico. And all of those are very difficult to predict and they are all kind of intertwined. And when you get the triangulation of those, it creates significant uncertainty relative to how things can unfold.  That being said, we are executing against it very well, but I assure you there is a lot of work that goes behind the day-to-day in making sure that we continue to operate and deal with the circumstances that confront us. And those circumstances make it very difficult to predict exactly which ways things are going to go. So, not much more to add on the guidance question.  On market share, overall market shares, we are okay in the quarter, but we are not that pleased quite frankly. Yes, you mentioned the translation impact. That was a big impact on our total shares, obviously with LATAM having such strong shares.  Their shares were actually up half a share point in the year-to-date basis, but given the translation impact of those currencies on a global basis, we saw our shares come down. U.S., a little soft in the quarter. I talked a little bit about pulling back on some promotions. Now we feel comfortable with where we are relative to the promotional environment.  There was some \u2013 still surprising me some aggressive couponing going on that we quite frankly didn't follow and that we would like to try to avoid in the future as we don't think that's an effective use of money. But we have the right promotions generated through our revenue management efforts that we see ready to go in the back half, but coupled with strong innovation.  I would say that the launch of Optic White Renewal in the U.S. has been very, very successful. I mentioned earlier that's our first $7 price point, hit a two share, 50% of that incremental. It's been the most successful new product launch in the category since the launch of Optic White ten years ago.  So again, I think we are getting great confidence in our ability to premiumize the category and as we move into a more recessionary environment as we discussed earlier, we'll have a strong base business and a strong core innovation of plan to address that. If you look across the other categories, by and large pretty good share performance.  Many of those categories quite frankly driven \u2013 share driven by demand and the ability to supply the shelves, whether it would be liquid hand soap, or dish which we have not necessarily met the demand at this stage and share has suffered a little. But where we are focused and where we are spending our money, we are getting some share growth.  We are not pleased quite frankly with some of the share performance in the U.S. But again, we believe that was somewhat circumstantial and we got strong plans and investment in the back half to change that. Yes. Thanks, Rob. And then, good morning. So, again, I talked about, we expect the strategy that we had put in place 18 months ago, quite frankly as we went to the crisis and interrogated that we felt it was perfectly suited for the behaviors and the dynamics we were seeing in the category. I mean, we needed to continue and they are behind the core business.  The adjacencies were there and that allows us to rethink some of our core businesses and how we get into rapidly growing segments. Take floor cleaners where we've expanded the portfolio into more hygiene anti-bacterial related product. And likewise, the focus we were on for quite some time to truly elevate our digital commerce business and you've seen consistent growth both from a top-line performance, as well as share performance in ecommerce.  And a lot of that capability is being driven by the success we've had in Hill's and obviously ramping up capabilities across the company both in the digital area as well as the ecommerce space and that we've done that through developing our internal talent, as well as bringing in outside talent that we think has been a real boost for the organization to help us think a little bit differently.  So, strategy working and nothing that we feel we need to change, continue to be agile as we move forward. I think some of the learning we've had on the agility side as it we can innovate much, much faster than we have in the past. And that we intend to systemize that as we move forward to make sure that we capture that learning on an ongoing basis.  Premiumization has been a big part. I mentioned earlier in the call, we do roughly 50% of our toothpaste business in mid-price and another 25% in value and the balance in premium. And if you take the premium, the fastest growing part of the market has been the ultra-premium where we have not competed. The launch of Optic While Renewal is an example at $7 taking that bundle and moving that around the world is an opportunity for us.  And I think it has certainly given us confidence, notwithstanding the fact that it is tough to launch premium bundle successful, but given us confidence we have now a lot of the capabilities necessary to push more aggressively on premium. And we've learned throughout the history and particularly with the last recession, 2008, 2009, you may recall Rob that one of the most successful launches during that period was Optic White.  And that was an affordable luxury and we understand that there still is a segment of the market looking for premium, value-oriented bundles that provide a significant point of difference and Renewal is one. And so, we will balance that very carefully as we move into a more challenged macro environment and we'll do that with super premium innovation in the right markets, as well as continuing to focus on our core.  On naturals, to your question there, we are excited about our natural strategy. Tom's has got some terrific plans ahead of it with Craig and Dubitsky and Lauri and the team from Hello are doing an outstanding job opening our eyes the opportunities in naturals across the category. The Hello brand continue to expand in the U.S. and is delivering nice growth and I think that category we know long-term will be very, very beneficial.  Consumers continue to be extremely interested in purpose-driven brands, particularly brands with a strong sustainability profile and while the short-term in the crisis we saw a fall-off of natural brands. We've seen that category start to rebound and we expect longer term, it will continue to be a healthy growth opportunity for us.  Your last comment I think was on the Elmex expansion. Again, as we've talked about, we've been very selective with that strategy and where we move Elmex and Meridol into markets with high pharmacy retail environments and we are doing that very successfully. Brazil was the early launch, Great results coming out of that through the pharmacy expansion plan we have there.  This is not a short-term volume strategy. We want to build a long-term therapeutic business in the pharmacy channel and doing that with strong therapeutic brands like Elmex and Meridol and you are going to see that continue to unfold as we increase investment and continue to build a long-term sustainable business for the markets where we extend it. That will have a couple more to expand in as we move into 2021. So, hopefully, that answers your question, Rob.  And I guess, that brings us to the end. So let me just sum it up. I think overall, a quality quarter, but we all recognize, we've got more work to do and a lot of challenges still in front of us. I want to thank 36,000 Colgate people around the world who continue to be extraordinarily resilient, well-focused on executing our strategy, building new capabilities across the organization and winning on the ground and the success of the quarter goes out to them.  So, thanks everyone and we look forward to catching up with everyone soon."

Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in table six of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Please note that starting today in both the press release and the conference call, we are now using the term Base Business to refer to non-GAAP measures that exclude certain items in both the current and year ago periods.  Joining me on the call this morning from their homes are; Noel Wallace, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Henning Jakobsen, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will start off with his thoughts on the current operating environment, and how we are adapting to the uncertainty about COVID-19 and the economy. I will then discuss our Q1 performance and provide some context around 2020 before opening it up for Q&A. Given the busy conference calls scheduled today, we request that you limit yourselves to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask the question. If you have further questions, you are welcomed to re-enter the queue. Now, I'll turn it over to Noel.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. First, I hope that you and your families are safe and well during these unprecedented times. Obviously, we're operating in a difficult environment, and we expect things to stay difficult for some time. But there's one thing you should know about Colgate-Palmolive and the 34,000 people at the heart of our company, we're at our best when times are difficult. I want to thank all of the Colgate people around the world, many of whom are listening to this call, who have scaled enormous obstacles to keep our business running and to deliver the results that we reported today. We thrive in difficult times because we are at the heart, a local company with global brands and strategies and best-in-class execution. Our locally based operating model, financial discipline and sound balance sheet helped to position Colgate to emerge from this crisis an even stronger company. We produce and sell products that people rely on every single day to keep themselves and their families, including their pets, safe and healthy. Our responsibility to our employees, our customers, our consumers and our communities has never been greater. We treat this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and intend to do our best for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. That said, and despite strong Q1 results, we have chosen to withdraw our annual guidance for 2020. This was not an easy decision for us. However, given the combined uncertainty surrounding the future impact to COVID-19 and government actions to stem the spread of the virus, we believe this is the correct choice. The second and third order effects of this crisis through economic stress to our supply chain, retail partners and consumers are difficult to predict at this point, particularly as they're intertwined. As we proceed through the year, we hope to provide you with updated guidance when it proves feasible. In that light, I want to focus on what we are -- how we are managing through the crisis to give you the context for what we're facing, but also some confidence in how we are meeting this head on. I'll discuss three topics; how staying true to our values and purpose is helping us navigate this environment, how we're adapting our strategies and executing with agility and how we are managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. Staying true to our values and purpose is vital in the current environment as it impacts both our people and our brands. Our number one priority around the world is the health and safety of our Colgate people and their families. In order to deliver on that, we have to implement many policies and procedures to enhance health and safety standards within the company. We have advanced our safety and screening protocols and made adjustments to our work processes to support social distancing. Where possible, we're expanding these policies to our third-party partners. Additionally, we are expanding our health and wellness programs for our people, including counseling, paid time off to care for family members and flexible schedules to adapt to changing family circumstances. We have talked to you a lot over the past years about brand purpose and consumers' preference for brands to give them something to buy into. The results we have seen in the marketplace show that consumers are responding to this crisis by focusing on trusted brands. Our marketing teams have created new programs and adapting existing ones to lean into our brand purpose. At the beginning of the year, we began to roll out a new equity campaign for Colgate Toothpaste based on the inherent optimism of the brand. The central idea is powerful, using Colgate Toothpaste gives people the confidence to smile on regardless of the challenges or questions they face. We've adapted this campaign in digital settings to highlight how important smiles are in a world where we can't be with the people most important to us. So these days, you just smile, whether on Google Hangouts, Zoom or FaceTime, that lets people know that you feel -- well, lets people know how you feel about them. We know handwashing is a first-line of defense against the coronavirus, and we're very proud of our work with the World Health Organization to promote handwashing by distributing 25 million free bars of soap. We initiated this program to support WHO's #SafeHands campaign and are partnering with Save the Children in care to distribute the product, particularly in emerging markets where the need is most acute. We're also donating $20 million worth of health and hygiene products to help consumers in hard hit areas. In New York City, our hometown, we've been donating product to health care workers and first responders all over the city. The second topic is executing our strategy with even greater agility. The strategy that we have discussed with you over the past two years is working as evidenced by our reacceleration in organic sales growth during that time. But we know that simply executing our existing plans isn't enough. We need to be even more agile in this new world. We are still focused on our core brands, innovation in faster-growth segments and expansion in high-growth channels and markets. While we will make some shifts in priorities and timings, our key focus areas do not need to change. Delivering on our core brands will be vital over the foreseeable future. Consumers want to know that the products they are buying are effective and provide good value. This aligns with our portfolio as our core brands are often at base and mainstream price points, which we expect to become bigger focus areas for retailers and consumers as the economic pressures have increased unemployment mount. Our core innovation strategy will bring news to these big segments and is intended to bring added value in a period where price increases may be difficult to take. We will also continue to focus on innovation in faster-growth segments. Our plans for 2020 and 2021 will still include significant premium innovation as it is often innovation that drives store traffic. As part of our efforts to expand our business in faster-growth channels, we have focused even more aggressively on e-commerce and direct-to-consumer. This was the learning that we took from our experiences in China in the first quarter, which helped us to shift resources towards channels that will benefit from disruption in our markets. We saw significant e-commerce share gains in toothpaste in the US in the first quarter behind the launch of Optic White Renewal. And Hill's worked with their brick-and-mortar partners to accelerate their e-commerce offerings in order to offset lost store traffic. Overall, our e-commerce business was up more than 50% in the first quarter. And our North American division e-commerce sales more than doubled in the quarter versus prior year. Our professional teams have learned new ways to engage their customers in a socially distant world. Similar to what we do with Hill's to Home, PCA Skin is helping their spa customers by having them book orders for direct-to-consumer shipments so they can still drive revenue. But agility isn't just executing our strategy the same way we had planned. In this current environment, it requires streamlining our processes and making decisions more quickly so that we can get better respond to our customers and consumers' needs. There's no better example of this than our global supply chain. As the crisis hit, we mobilized our supply chain teams to offset lost production in China to increase manufacturing elsewhere. We established strict safety procedures in China, which allowed us to reopen our factories in a safe and efficient manner. Now, we are operating at over 100% of our expected capacity in many of our Chinese plants, which is helping to alleviate pressure in countries where COVID is still a developing problem. By taking these procedures around the globe, we helped our Anzio, Italy plant stay open throughout the crisis, delivering 40% more volume in March than initially anticipated. After realizing the scale of the increased demand for many of our health and hygiene products, our marketing and customer development teams worked with our retail partners to develop streamlined product offerings that allow our supply chain to produce fewer SKUs for longer runs, which increased capacity to meet consumer demand. We also identified alternative formulas, materials, packaging designs and product artwork to give us flexibility as we prepare for further disruption in our networks. We have also become more digitally oriented by transitioning 10,000 people to work outside the office. Thanks to the resilience of our global networks, our quarterly closing process is one of the smoothest in memory despite the fact that all of our shared service centers in Mexico City, Warsaw and Mumbai, all working 100% remotely. And all of this happened in just nine weeks since I presented to you at the CAGNY conference. This great work has helped us deliver the results that we reported today. This proven capacity for agility will continue as we encounter ongoing impacts from the crisis, economic uncertainty and foreign exchange headwinds. Our third priority is balancing how we manage to get through the crisis, ensuring that we can win when it's over. We have established our -- we have re-established our top line momentum over the past two years. We need to sustain that momentum and adapt our financial plans to deliver in a very difficult 2020, while leaving ourselves well positioned for growth when markets normalize. We will continue to support our brands through impactful marketing programs. We know that compelling advertising behind strong brands is crucial to maintaining long-term organic sales growth, which is the key value driver for our company. We also need to further invest in the capabilities that are driving growth: digital, e-commerce and analytics. We will not fall behind in building the skills needed for when the economy comes back. Productivity is always a priority for us. And these times, we work even harder to take costs out of the P&L to help offset some of the additional pressure that will come from COVID mitigation, foreign exchange and the weakening economy. Our Funding the Growth initiatives, are ramping up to take out discretionary costs that may be unnecessary given the current business environment. We're using analytics to identify and eliminate promotional programs that are not generating value given the consumer environment we find ourselves in. I will finish up by reminding you of our strategies surrounding cash flow and liquidity, which remain unchanged. We have historically generated significant amounts of free cash flow, a trend that continued in the first quarter. Our priorities for uses of cash include capital investments for productivity and future growth; paying dividends to our shareholders, which we have done consistently for 124 straight years; and acquisitions to accelerate growth. We generally allocate the balance of our cash flow to share repurchase. Consistent with prior comments, we have moderated our share repurchase activity as we focus more of our cash flow on reducing the debt from the Filorga and Hello transactions. Turning to liquidity, we've been issuing commercial paper throughout the crisis. We remain committed to our AA minus debt rating. And as of the end of the first quarter, we have cash and cash equivalents on hand that are more than three times our long-term debt maturities over the next 12 months. We also have access to lines of credit should we need them. So those are our priorities. Although there is tremendous amount of uncertainty right now, I am confident that we have the right priorities, the right strategies and most of all, the right people, Colgate people to navigate through the crisis -- emerge stronger on the other side. And now I'll turn it over to John to discuss our Q1 results and provide some context on our full 2020.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Noel. We delivered strong -- operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow in Q1 2020 as we responded aggressively to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe. We delivered a combination of volume and pricing growth, with organic sales growth across all four categories and in every division except for Asia Pacific, where China and India were negatively impacted by the pandemic. While pantry loading due to COVID-19 obviously, provided the benefit to the quarter, our sales and profit trends were strong through January and February. As Noel mentioned, our underlying growth strategies are working, and we believe they will continue to benefit us going forward even as we adapt to a new reality. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was 60.2%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. On a base business basis, our gross profit margin for the quarter was 60.3%, which was up 110 basis points. Our gross profit margin was up in every division in the quarter. For the first quarter, pricing was 70 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 130 basis point headwind, including the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity added 150 basis points. Mix was a 20 basis point benefit in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, our SG&A ratio was up 90 basis points as a percent to sales. On a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 100 basis points in the quarter driven by an increase in advertising to sales as our advertising spending was up 13% year-over-year. Excluding advertising, our SG&A was up slightly year-over-year driven by an increase in logistics costs as we work to meet heightened demand. On a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 8% year-over-year, while it was up 6% on a base business basis. Our EPS was up 28% on a GAAP basis and up 12% on a base business basis. As Noel mentioned, we delivered strong cash flow growth in the quarter, up 28% year-over-year due to net income growth, favorable working capital performance, lower tax payments and the lapping of a voluntary pension contribution in the year ago period. North America delivered strong growth in the quarter, aided by increased consumer demand across all categories, particularly liquid hand soap and dish soap and household cleaners. As Noel mentioned, we're particularly pleased with the performance of Colgate Optic White Renewal toothpaste, which is driving share gains for the Optic White franchise, both online and in brick-and-mortar. Latin America net sales were flat in the quarter as strong volume and pricing growth were offset by significant foreign exchange headwinds. All three categories delivered strong organic sales growth in the first quarter, led by Oral Care. Both Mexico and Brazil delivered a good mix of volume and pricing growth. Colgate Total delivered strong growth in the quarter, helping to drive our premium portfolio. Our digital marketing campaign that Noel mentioned has reached over 135 million users across multiple platforms with engagement and view-through rates well above CPG norms. Europe's double-digit net sales growth in the quarter was driven by 8% organic volume growth, the inclusion of Filorga, minus 1.5% pricing and negative foreign exchange. Europe's high single-digit organic volume growth was driven across all categories and every hub. Palmolive liquid hand soap and Ajax cleaning products drove strong sales growth across the division, while Sanex Body Wash reached peak market shares. In the U.K., our premium Toothpaste business behind Colgate Total and Colgate Max White Ultimate drove organic sales growth and market share gains for the Colgate brand. The first quarter was a difficult one for the Asia Pacific division. We saw a significant impact on China from the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the quarter, while India was impacted by a country-wide shut down that began in late March. In China, we have begun to see the country open back up. And trends are improving in Q2, but we caution that the country still is not back to pre-crisis levels. We continue to focus on innovation, particularly at premium price points in the e-commerce channel. Our Colgate Miracle Repair toothpaste with concentrated amino acid is the biggest driver of growth for Colgate's e-commerce business and has helped drive a more than 20% increase in average selling price for our e-commerce business in China. In India, we are still experiencing disruptions to both our supply chain and our retail network, consistent with what you have heard from other companies. Trends have started to improve, and our plants are beginning to ramp back up. But we still expect an impact from the crisis in the second quarter. In Africa Eurasia, our strong net sales and organic sales growth was driven by volume growth across every hub. Our focus on faster-growth channels continues to pay dividends, particularly in terms of discounters in Russia and Turkey. We saw a continued improvement in our South African business. Our Protex brand, which delivers anti-bacterial and anti-derm benefits, is uniquely positioned for the current environment and drove significant growth in Q1 in South Africa and many other markets around the world. And I'll finish off with Hill, which continues to deliver excellent results. Those remain an example of how execution of a consistent strategy around brand purpose, core innovation and a focus on faster-growth channels can deliver growth in any markets. Sales growth was led by North America, where continued double-digit growth before the pandemic was augmented by consumer pantry loading late in the quarter. The e-commerce business was up by more than 50% as we drove strong growth across all platforms. In Europe, Hill's delivered it\u2019s fastest net sales growth and organic sales growth in many years, with growth in advance of the impact of the crisis. Prescription diet drove the growth in the quarter, and we are beginning to see the benefit from the Science Plan relaunch. While we are not providing guidance, we want to provide some context around certain factors that you should consider as you work on your models for 2020. Our organic sales momentum continued into April, although foreign exchange continued to worsen as we benefited from the rebuilding of retail inventories and increased demand in certain categories, offset by weakness in some emerging markets. As we mentioned in the press release, based on current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a mid-single-digit negative impact on net sales for the full year. We now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% on a GAAP basis, while on a base business basis, we now expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. Also, as Noel mentioned, we continue to plan for less benefit from share repurchase in the year as we focus more of our cash flow on reducing the debt from the Filorga and Hello transactions. And with that, Mary, can you open it up for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. Good morning. Hope you\u2019re all well. So you mentioned a potential negative impact on forward category growth in this new environment. Noel, I was just hoping you could be a bit more specific on your expectations in some of the key emerging markets countries. Are we looking at potential magnitude that's significant in your minds or more modest, and perhaps you can compare and contrast the situation we saw in the last recession a little more than a decade ago. And then also from a revenue perspective, one of the unique aspects of Colgate is the professional recommendations, whether it\u2019d be dentists, veterinarians or dermatologists now. So, can you just help us understand how much of an impact the lack of office visits you think could have going forward on market share and ultimately, revenue? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning, Dara. Let me start with taking a step back on, as you referenced, 2008, 2009 and reaffirm some of the strengths that allowed us to emerge through that crisis stronger. The portfolio of our business is very strong in recessions, as you well know. We have price points across the full continuum, particularly our core businesses. Playing on your comment around the professional endorsements that historically played very well for us and will continue to play very well for us during this crisis, particularly given the scientific nature of our products, and the efficacy of our products, and I wouldn't expect given that some people will not be visiting the profession, the strength of the brand will be altered in any way during that period. The brand continues to be very, very strong, and our endorsements from the professional all over the world continue to be strong. So I don't anticipate that we'll have any issues certainly some of our business moving through the profession will be impacted in the short-term, but long-term the brand strength will continue to prevail in this in this period of time. Moving on to the category, listen, we've seen a lot of volatility in the categories. Hence, one of the reasons that we pulled guidance. There's a lot of uncertainties as things jump up and down. But rest assured people are still brushing their teeth. And as you've seen, people are still taking a lot of showers and washing their hands. In some categories, we expect the behavior change to be quite consistent over the next couple months. Liquid hand soap bar soap, bar cleaners, we've seen a real acceleration in consumption in those categories. And our anticipation is those will continue. Oral Care has been negative as some of the pipeline comes out from February and March and April. But we expect that category will come back, particularly as economies start to loosen up and you get more and more traffic coming back in the stores. As you've seen, we've had tremendous growth in e-commerce. That was what we discussed at the CAGNY, a big, big focus area for us over the last nine months. We put a lot of resources into that space. We're really learning. Obviously, the Hill's business is best-in-class. We're transferring those learnings around the world. So we're getting consumption in the categories that you're seeing quite weak in brick-and-mortar coming through in e-commerce now. And certainly, that will play well for us longer term. So overall, categories will come back, a lot of volatility right now in emerging markets. I was on the phone this morning with our Asia team, and they're seeing things come back quite nicely. We're about 75% of where they were pre-crisis, but that has stepped up meaningfully over the last six weeks or so. And so overall, we'll see categories come back, but it's about getting store traffic back and getting some of the economy solution. But overall, looking okay.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning, and hope all is well. So you sounded very positive to Dara's question on consumption trend, especially soap. So Noel, I was hoping if you can comment a little bit of consumption and what's happening in April. Are you still working on replenishing the shelves? Or did you benefit from stockpiling, primarily, I would say, probably in North America and Western Europe? Or are you seeing trends reaccelerate as you go? And how much production capacity are you being able to keep up to your comments about Asia and other parts of the world? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Andrea. So let's take North America first. Obviously, significant spikes in March relative to consumption, a lot of the panic buying, but more importantly, some of the trends I articulated earlier around how we're seeing consumption increase in certain categories like bar soap, like liquid hand soap, like floor cleaners. And that has continued through April, as John said. We've seen strong category growth in those specific areas. Obviously, some of the momentum that we're seeing in April is replenishing inventories that were at very low levels coming out of March, particularly in those high-demand categories. Conversely, in categories where we saw pantry loading like Oral Care, we've seen the categories come down in consumption as you would expect, given the pantry load that was in March, and no specific reason why consumers would be brushing their teeth more. So it would be what you expect. Categories where consumers are using them more, good consumption and categories that were driven by some of the panic buying has slowed down, and in fact, are negative in April. And that would be consistent for both Europe and the U.S.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Wendy Nicholson of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. Just one housekeeping issue. On Hill's, can you remind us what percentage of that business is e-comm? And I know you said the whole business, the whole company on e-comm was up 50% for the quarter, but can you tell us a sense of how much Hills' e-comm business was up. But then my real question is more structurally, actually on China, where I know you've had some market share challenges over the last couple of years. I'm just curious, because I know that's a very fragmented market. There's so many local brands in the Oral Care category. Do you think you've done anything structural in that category, so that you're going to emerge from the COVID crisis with a stronger market share position? I'm just wondering if the crisis has sort of helped wash out maybe some of that local competition. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Wendy. Let me take Hill's. Obviously, as John mentioned, the Hill's success, once again, in the quarter was extraordinary. And I think it really points to the underlying strength of that business: one, great core innovation; two, great efficacious scientific brands that play really well in the marketplace; and three, an incredibly adept organization around winning digitally and winning online. Specifically online, to your question, their business was up in excess of the company growth, which was around 54%, 55% for total Colgate. Hill's was up 57% in the quarter and saw good progress across particularly some of the key initiatives they implemented with some of the brick-and-mortar retailers, which was unusual, given some of the struggles that, that retail environment had. But overall, great growth on Hill's. It's a high -- it's in the teens in terms of percent of sales. It continues to grow, obviously, and the success we've had with some of the Science Diet relaunch, particularly in some of the pure-play retailers has been quite notable. Moving on to China, all the strategies, Wendy, that we put in place that we've talked about over the last 18 months or so, repositioning the portfolio, moving significant structural changes relative to moving from brick-and-mortar to online, both in resource and capabilities, all of that is playing out really well for us. We've stepped up our innovation, particularly in the online space. You heard John talk about Miracle Repair. I did get some good news this morning that the Darlie franchise has returned to the number one share of market brand in the country. We had lost share market to Yunnan Baiyao, the local player. We have returned to leadership in March, which is terrific. Shares are up for both Colgate and Darlie in March. We're seeing good progression there, particularly in the online space. More work to do on Colgate. However, the significant repositioning of the portfolio will happen in the back half of this year. But structurally, we've made all the changes that we think are necessary to win. And as I mentioned earlier, I think big brands are going to win in this environment, whether it's in Asia or anywhere around the world, the proven efficacy positioning the scientific knowledge that we have and how we communicate that in our brand purpose, particularly around our core businesses, will bode well moving forward.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nSteve Powers: Great. Thanks. Noel, maybe just to build on that. You've spoken about what you're seeing today on the ground generally in emerging markets. But can we get a little more insight into how you're thinking about the go forward? Just comparing what you just said there about China to what you expect over time in India versus Eastern Europe versus Brazil and Latin America. And I guess, whether in terms of the shape of consumer demand, the competition and market share outlook. And specific to Latin America, your confidence in your ability to realize pricing where those FX transaction cost pressures are probably going to be most acute over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Historically, we handle these crisis is quite well in emerging markets, given the pricing power that we have. So, let's talk a little bit about our strategy right now, which we think will modify slightly as we see some of the recessionary pressures come. Obviously, a lot of opportunity for us in the premium side of the business. We've been discussing that with you for the last 18 months or so, how much upside we have on premium innovation. That will continue to happen as I mentioned. But we will dial up more of our core innovation, particularly given the price points that we have and the size of those businesses in emerging markets. And those tend to be the opening price points in many big markets, whether it's Mexico, Brazil or India. So you'll see more innovation coming in that space, and we're doing a lot of things very, very quickly to adapt to some of the consumer behavior changes we've seen, particularly around the importance of health and hygiene and how that plays out with some of our products. Interesting, as we've gone through the last couple of months, our focus on the Total relaunch, particularly the antibacterial positioning and long-lasting antibacterial benefit that product provides has benefited us greatly in the last six weeks. We've seen some of our big markets, whether it be Brazil, Mexico, U.K., we've seen the premium innovation on Total working. So moving forward a little bit more on core, continue to focus on premium side, but we think we're positioned well for the emerging markets. Now obviously, we can't anticipate how much unemployment will be in some of these markets or potential lockdowns that we'll see coming from COVID, but the portfolio, at least how we're positioning it, we'll be well positioned for the emerging trends that we'll see there. Likewise, the same in India and Eastern Europe, there will be no change. The strategy will be consistently executed around the world, locally adapted as necessary. But we don't see that changing based on any of the markets. China would be perhaps the exception, given some of the portfolio strategies that we'll be adopting in the back half and the specific needs of that market. Your second question around LatAm pricing, again, it's -- obviously, the devaluation has been significant. So we've got a couple of things that we're looking at. Obviously, we've taken pricing. You saw that in the first quarter. We will continue to take pricing, but it will get a little bit more difficult, particularly in the current environment. We've had opportunities to dial back on promotions in some of those markets as we see, obviously, store traffic down. So we've been quite prudent. On how we're thinking about promotional spend, a lot of work on revenue growth management and price pack architecture, particularly now as we move into a recessionary environment. So, we'll see more of that happening. And a little bit more benign pricing environment -- excuse me, material pricing environment moving forward, we think the combination of all of that will allow us to continue to maintain the integrity of the LatAm P&L and maintain the investment, which is still important for us to emerge stronger coming out of this.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just want to talk about shifts in your view in terms of innovation rollout, given, obviously, there's a lot of stock up already, recession coming. And then just marketing around that. Marketing was particularly strong this quarter. So the support is still pretty high. But just wondering as you think about the rest of the year and where consumer pantries -- positions of consumer pantries, how you think about innovation and marketing? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So as I just mentioned, we're -- we've been doubling down on innovation for the better part of 18 months now. And it's interesting as a management team, as we've gone into this, we've obviously been looking specifically at what innovation is right for the current environment. We will be moving some things around as necessary. We're dialing up some areas. We've orchestrated a series of teams internally to work specifically around some of the common truth that we're seeing, particularly in the health and hygiene spaces: one, how we adopt our portfolio; and two, how we accelerate innovation moving into this. What's interesting is we have just a long history of great clinical studies and claims and science behind our products that we think we can pull out of the jaws and use in this current environment, great formulations with great science and claims that will play into health and hygiene. So we think very appropriate for us to look at our innovation and modify it as necessary moving forward. And the key focus for us here is agility and doing this really, really quickly. So you'll start to see some of that innovation come to the market in the back half of this year already that wasn't necessarily there before. Some of the bigger premium innovations, as I mentioned, will stay. We will alter those based on some of the spacing, whether it's moving out later in the third quarter, so to speak, versus earlier to allow some normalization, particularly in some of our key markets where we see store traffic down quite considerably right now. So that will happen. Continuing to support the business, we've always done that during tough times, and we've come out of it stronger as a result. The brands have emerged stronger. We see competition spending quite a bit, at least on the media side, a lot more movement for us in the digital and e-commerce space, which we're putting a lot more money in. And I think you can see the results that we generated in the first quarter. Certainly, that shift of resources and spending in e-commerce is paid out for. So marketing spending will be prudent and thoughtful moving forward to be sure. But we'll continue to support our brands, which we believe is in the best interest of generating the long-term growth that we want to deliver.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nKevin Grundy: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And I hope you are doing well. Noel, question on consumption trends and specifically, those increases in consumption that are more transitory in the current environment versus those that you see as more lasting, given changes in consumer behavior. So we're already seeing a move towards greater working from home. I think there's every expectation that's going to persist, heightened emphasis on health and wellness, accelerated shift to e-commerce, just to name a few. But as you think about your portfolio across Oral Care, Home Care, Personal Care and Pet, can you discuss whether you see a change in consumption trends longer term that are more lasting? If so, do you see this as a net positive for your portfolio? Thank you. \nNoel Wallace: Sure, Kevin. And -- the obvious is we have a very large soap business globally, one of our bigger categories. We obviously have a large liquid hand soap business, particularly in Europe and the U.S. We don't talk a lot about our Home Care business, but we have a very strong Home Care business in Latin America as well as in Europe and growing really quickly in North America. All those businesses, we're seeing behavior changes that we think will stick moving forward. I mean, consumers will wash their hands more, people staying at home will be cleaning their floors more. Obviously, people are washing their clothing more. So our fabric softener business will benefit from that. So categories where we see behavior change, we compete in quite a few of them. Obviously, people aren't going to stop brushing their teeth. And that will continue to be obviously a growth opportunity moving forward for us, but we don't see any sizable changes there. We'll see more volatility in the Oral Care space, I think, because you probably see more pantry loading in terms of how people are buying products coming in and out of the category less frequently. So obviously, as we think about innovation, we'll have to time that innovation quite carefully and be quite prudent on that. So overall, our categories are positioned quite well. Obviously, skin health is an area where we've seen quite a bit of disruption in, whether it be travel retail or some of our pharmacy business in Europe as well as our derm business here in the U.S. And we're working very closely with those teams, particularly in the area of telehealth, working on opportunities to continue to engage those communities so they can serve their customers with product online. We talked about the Hill's to Home model that we've been driving over the last year, which has done very, very well for Hill's. We're expanding that into our skin health business in order to stimulate demand at both institutions and spas as well as derms. So, overall, we'll see that category go through a bumpy road, we think, over the next couple months, six months or so. But if you go back to 2008 and 2009, you know, it took more or less nine months to 12 months for that category to come back. The basic fundamentals for skin health long term are still really, really good. It's a highly profitable category. So long-term, we're very comfortable with where we are, but we'll make the necessary changes in the short-term in skin health.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Please go ahead.\nBill Chappell: Thanks. Good morning. And again, hope you and your family are well.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks Bill.\nBill Chappell: Just a kind of question on the supply chain. I mean, certainly remarkable, as I'm sure you're aware, that you and your peers can kind of have manufacturing plants running at 80%, 90% capacity on a regular basis, all of a sudden, takes the surge of the business and really have pretty limited out of stocks. And so I'm just trying to understand what near term, is that margin-accretive business as you're going even faster? Or do you have to have incremental costs that will ease as you go forward? And then longer term, what does that tell you about your supply chain that you can handle that much more capacity when you thought they were already at 80% to 90% utilization?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Bill. So again, as I mentioned in my prepared commentary, it's been inspiring to watch our supply chain around the world deal with this. And we have discussions internally how important some of the crisis management meetings that we have throughout the year to deal with contingency planning and risk mitigation. And all of that really prevailed during these difficult times. It's the global supply chain and the standardization that we have and how we operate it, while globally is still very local, we're able to shift resources very, very quickly. So as I mentioned, right out of the gate, when China started to struggle, we shifted resources into Europe immediately. And we're able to supply everywhere that China was supplying out of Europe. Likewise, as Europe started to be challenged or Latin America or US started to be challenged, we were able to shift back to Asia. So there's a lot of flexibility in our supply chain and the credit to the team. A lot of work goes into that, to be sure. Some of the incremental volumes that we've seen, obviously, we pushed to contractors, that comes out of the lower margin. But moving forward, as we work on some of these standardization opportunities that I mentioned, for instance, working with some of our key trade partners to simplify our portfolios, that will allow us to reduce the SKUs that we're producing and bring some of that production back in-house, where we can elevate capacity based on the simplification efforts that come through that. Obviously, strategically, we're also looking at investing in some of these categories to expand capacity as required moving forward to ensure that we can meet the demand that we see ongoing. So, short-term, we anticipate that there's some margin implications with the costs associated with COVID, whether it's logistics or some of the contract that we have longer term or we'll bring that back in-house and find ways to continue to deliver the margin that's accretive to the business.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Steve Strycula of UBS. Please go ahead.\nSteve Strycula: Hi, good morning, Noel and John.\nNoel Wallace: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Strycula: Question on the incentive structure back to 2019 when, Noel, when you took over as CEO, it seems like there's a greater index waiting to organic sales emphasis and market share performance. So within that, how do we think about there is visible pockets of opportunity over the next two, three years? And specifically, how can Colgate use the volatility in the current marketplace and kind of lean in with investments to emerge stronger during this period of time. And John, quick clarification for the FX implication to sales, how should we think about the multiplier factors, what that could be to EBIT dollars or EPS? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: So, Steve, as I mentioned, these -- we've been around for a long, long time. Colgate, we've dealt with a lot of crisis and depressions and even pandemics at one point in time. So, this is obviously very unusual, and there's a lot of unpredictability, which is, obviously, you've heard in the print throughout the last two weeks, but we continue to focus on the fundamentals, which we've been building for the last two years to strengthen our business. So, it's building `brands with purpose, and that's the reason why we will continue to invest behind our brands. We've always found that our ability to innovate and invest in difficult times allows us to emerge with strong brands and strong income statements as we come out of this. And we'll continue to do that. We've stepped up our productivity measures as you've heard me talk about quite often. We're using digital very differently across the company, the collaboration tools that we put in place going into this based on the Google suite of tools has been, just quite frankly, extraordinary to get 10,000 people working day one virtually was, I think, a testament to our IT organization and what we've been able to do there, likewise, using technology to drive more productivity in our closings, so all of that will continue to dial up as we go through this. Relative to the incentive structure, we'll continue to be focused on organic sales and obviously, bottom line profitability. That continues to be the focus for the company. You've seen the reacceleration of our business over the last six quarters. Even with some of the pantry, we accelerated our organic sales in the quarter, both from a Hill's standpoint and from a Colgate standpoint. So, the underlying fundamentals for the business, we believe, are quite strong. And continuing to invest in them, continuing to build capabilities, as I mentioned earlier, in spaces like digital, e-commerce and analytics, we believe will position us extremely well coming out of this.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Hey Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: I wanted to talk a little bit more -- we've talked about Latin America quite a bit. But what we have been thinking about is the degree to which some of the strategies that you'd outlined as part of your longer-term plan around premium innovation and pursuing new channels. But part of this is about kind of accelerated category growth in the region as maybe some of the household penetration or daily usage trends have kind of plateaued at some level if there is an opportunity, but the pace of development on those factors has been a little bit less. So, if we go into a severe recession in those regions, does sort of the growth of the market flow or go -- the efforts you were trying to leverage to accelerate the growth, is that just a bit less effective in the near term or intermediate term? Or am I missing something in terms of there's more opportunity on household penetration or usage that can keep market growth rates healthier.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Lauren. It really depends on the category. I mean, obviously, some of the ones I mentioned earlier like liquid hand soap and bar soap, we will expect in emerging markets, for instance, liquid hand soap penetration to grow. Those are fundamentally bar soap markets. But the efficiency and hygiene nature of liquid hand soap may lend itself to increase band penetration. Products like spray cleaners and wipes, we'll see more penetration grow, and we're expanding those as well. So there are certain categories where we see certainly the opportunity to grow penetration, particularly ones that are -- provide an efficiency or an added value, and that will be our focus. Consumption in those categories, likewise, will probably offset some of the pricing pressures that you'll see in some of those markets. We typically found not significant trade down in recessions, but you do get some for sure. And we've been able to deal with that with revenue growth management, obviously, a focus on innovating behind the core, which is, as I mentioned earlier, usually at opening price points. And that allows us to take pricing in those categories. Price pack architecture and recessions has always worked quite effectively for us. So it really depends on the category and the market. Overall, we'll probably see a little slowness or a reduction in terms of value growth. Volumes, as I mentioned, people don't stop brushing their teeth. And in categories, which we mentioned, we in fact, think we'll see an increase in consumption moving through this.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks, and good morning everybody.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Mark.\nMark Astrachan: A quick follow-up. So one, just on Latin America in terms of how are you thinking about pricing in a market, especially some of the bigger countries where inflation is actually below recent historical levels. I mean, I recall more pricing to inflation as opposed to FX, so maybe just some thoughts there. And then secondly, just a reminder on input costs and the ties to oil kind of directionally, and how we should think about that potentially being offset by some of the higher costs that you mentioned before on manufacturing, other things you're doing around COVID?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Nothing -- on the pricing front, obviously, in some of the emerging markets, we're going to be quite prudent and cautious on how we're looking at pricing. Although historically, we have been quite aggressive in taking -- we took pricing in the first quarter. That will obviously translate through the balance of the year. We have plans to continue to look at pricing, and we'll do that quite creatively, either through managing our gross to net much more efficiently, particularly given store traffic being down. We'll do that through some of our channel focus as well. We'll do that through some of our innovation in terms of price points, innovation at different price points. So, we have different mechanisms that we'll be using. We obviously will gauge what competitors are doing. But given some of our leadership positions in most of the emerging markets, our intent will be to lead pricing. And we've always done that, but we'll be mindful of how we do that, particularly given the sensitivity in the current environment. On the cost side, we see, obviously, costs being a little less of a headwind than they were in the year-ago period. We've seen resins obviously come down. But on the flip side, prices have gone up, ag prices have gone up. But net-net, we'll see less headwinds than we saw in the back half of last year. And we'll watch it all very carefully. As you've heard most others talk about, there's typically a six to nine month lag between the drop of oil prices and where we see the benefit moving through, through the P&L. But by and large, we'll see a better environment in the back half of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll start to see some of those costs from COVID subside, particularly as we bring some of that production in-house and some of the panic buying becomes a little bit more predictable. Difficult at this stage to say that, but we expect it to become a little bit more predictable, which allow us to get a better line of sight on how we want to handle capacity planning for our facilities and our contractors. And bear in mind, Mark, one other point is, obviously, some of the logistics costs associated with this, we're doing everything we can to deliver the customer service that our partners or customers are looking for and there will be some added logistics costs that will come in the year-ago period as well associated with this.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore Investment Bank. Please go ahead. \nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much, guys. Noel, John, I want to call you guys out a little bit. The press release is very conservative. You're withdrawing guidance, but kind of everything I hear on this call is very positive. April is strong. You're raising advertising 13%. You're going to dial up marketing. You're crushing it in e-commerce. China's getting better. You're getting significant -- what you see as ongoing increases in your cleaning and sanitary products. You're getting pretty good volume in pricing in Mexico, Brazil. And your cost outlook in the second half of the year, you say, is very encouraging. So I'm a little confused in terms of the caution in the press release and taking away guidance, all things considered. And obviously, very, very tough environment out there, but the commentary so far has been so positive. I'm confused.\nNoel Wallace: So listen, it's straight to what we said in the commentary. The unpredictability of what we're seeing across the world is at a level that we've never seen before. Obviously, India, we didn't anticipate would shut down like it shut down. We had plants and distribution channels shut down for almost two weeks. They're obviously coming back online as we speak, but that had a significant impact at the back end of the quarter and has had a significant impact in April. And we can't predict exactly where it's going to happen. Obviously, we've seen things creep up in terms of the number of incidences in Brazil. So, what happens there going forward. So again, it's the unpredictability of what we're seeing all around the world. And you combine that with the continued strengthening of the dollar around the world and the foreign exchange headwinds that -- gives us pause. And we've seen, obviously, a lot of volatility, likewise, in some of the consumption numbers that we've been talking about throughout the call. They're jumping all over the place right now. And so it's very difficult to get a line of sight on how things are going to ultimately unfold. Yes, the fundamentals of our categories are good long-term, but the uncertainty with government regulations and disruptions moving forward, we think it's the prudent thing to hold our guidance at this stage. And we'll come back to you as soon as we can when we have a little bit more confidence on where things are headed.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nJason English: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for signing me in. Hope everyone is well and congrats to you and your firm for navigating the situation as well as you have so far. I want to come back to the last question because I thought it was a great question. I mean you responded to the part about why pull the guidance, I get it. But I think Rob and I had the same reaction to the press release and the same conflicting interpretation of this call so far. I want to zoom in on one line in the press release that maybe I read too much into. But in there, you say you expect government actions, consumer behavior related to COVID-19 and economic uncertainty to reduce category growth in many markets. I read that, and I interpret that as unequivocal deceleration on the forward. Maybe you were just simply referring to the exceptional growth in the first quarter. But when I listened to you walk through your expectations of each category and market, I hear lots of puts and takes. Skin care, a little softer, maybe a little bit of trade down in Oral Care, but all this is going to be offset by personal and home sanitization and cleaning. Is that the right interpretation? It's going to be choppy and slower in the first quarter, but as you think about underlying growth rates, while there's a lot of uncertainty, you don't really have a reason to think that your category is going to be materially slower going forward.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, Jason, listen, if you look at the weeklies, the monthlies on the categories all around the world, and I've got them here in front of me, they're all over the place on categories like Oral Care. Obviously, you've seen more consistency in categories like liquid hand soap and bar soap and cleaners. The biggest unknown force, in our view, is the degree of the recession that we're going to see all around the world. And you combine that with the foreign exchange headwinds that we're faced with right now and ability to take pricing, which has always been a challenge in an environment like this, although we've had great success there, this is unique and a bit different. So it's really the uncertainty that we're seeing and the disruptions that we're seeing. So again, if big markets start to get -- have more lockdowns, that creates a significant headwind for us. It creates a significant headwind for the category. If we see unemployment jump 10%, 15% in certain markets, we've not dealt with that in the past. That will have some impact on the value orientation of our categories as well. So all in all, there's uncertainty moving forward. We're trying to position ourselves as well as we can. We've got good experience on this, but there is significant unpredictability based on what I've outlined earlier.\nOperator: And we have no further questions over the phone at this time. I would like to conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now hand it back to your speakers for any closing or additional remarks.\nNoel Wallace: Well, thanks, everyone. Obviously, unusual and unprecedented times, I want to once again thank all the Colgate people. It's inspiring to work with such an incredibly talented organization. We're greatly benefited by having a management team that has dealt with this level of uncertainty, but obviously, working hard to continue to deliver the results. And we look forward to having more discussions with everyone moving forward. Thanks, everyone. Be safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. First, I hope that you and your families are safe and well during these unprecedented times. Obviously, we're operating in a difficult environment, and we expect things to stay difficult for some time. But there's one thing you should know about Colgate-Palmolive and the 34,000 people at the heart of our company, we're at our best when times are difficult. I want to thank all of the Colgate people around the world, many of whom are listening to this call, who have scaled enormous obstacles to keep our business running and to deliver the results that we reported today. We thrive in difficult times because we are at the heart, a local company with global brands and strategies and best-in-class execution. Our locally based operating model, financial discipline and sound balance sheet helped to position Colgate to emerge from this crisis an even stronger company. We produce and sell products that people rely on every single day to keep themselves and their families, including their pets, safe and healthy. Our responsibility to our employees, our customers, our consumers and our communities has never been greater. We treat this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and intend to do our best for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. That said, and despite strong Q1 results, we have chosen to withdraw our annual guidance for 2020. This was not an easy decision for us. However, given the combined uncertainty surrounding the future impact to COVID-19 and government actions to stem the spread of the virus, we believe this is the correct choice. The second and third order effects of this crisis through economic stress to our supply chain, retail partners and consumers are difficult to predict at this point, particularly as they're intertwined. As we proceed through the year, we hope to provide you with updated guidance when it proves feasible. In that light, I want to focus on what we are -- how we are managing through the crisis to give you the context for what we're facing, but also some confidence in how we are meeting this head on. I'll discuss three topics; how staying true to our values and purpose is helping us navigate this environment, how we're adapting our strategies and executing with agility and how we are managing through the crisis with an eye towards the future. Staying true to our values and purpose is vital in the current environment as it impacts both our people and our brands. Our number one priority around the world is the health and safety of our Colgate people and their families. In order to deliver on that, we have to implement many policies and procedures to enhance health and safety standards within the company. We have advanced our safety and screening protocols and made adjustments to our work processes to support social distancing. Where possible, we're expanding these policies to our third-party partners. Additionally, we are expanding our health and wellness programs for our people, including counseling, paid time off to care for family members and flexible schedules to adapt to changing family circumstances. We have talked to you a lot over the past years about brand purpose and consumers' preference for brands to give them something to buy into. The results we have seen in the marketplace show that consumers are responding to this crisis by focusing on trusted brands. Our marketing teams have created new programs and adapting existing ones to lean into our brand purpose. At the beginning of the year, we began to roll out a new equity campaign for Colgate Toothpaste based on the inherent optimism of the brand. The central idea is powerful, using Colgate Toothpaste gives people the confidence to smile on regardless of the challenges or questions they face. We've adapted this campaign in digital settings to highlight how important smiles are in a world where we can't be with the people most important to us. So these days, you just smile, whether on Google Hangouts, Zoom or FaceTime, that lets people know that you feel -- well, lets people know how you feel about them. We know handwashing is a first-line of defense against the coronavirus, and we're very proud of our work with the World Health Organization to promote handwashing by distributing 25 million free bars of soap. We initiated this program to support WHO's #SafeHands campaign and are partnering with Save the Children in care to distribute the product, particularly in emerging markets where the need is most acute. We're also donating $20 million worth of health and hygiene products to help consumers in hard hit areas. In New York City, our hometown, we've been donating product to health care workers and first responders all over the city. The second topic is executing our strategy with even greater agility. The strategy that we have discussed with you over the past two years is working as evidenced by our reacceleration in organic sales growth during that time. But we know that simply executing our existing plans isn't enough. We need to be even more agile in this new world. We are still focused on our core brands, innovation in faster-growth segments and expansion in high-growth channels and markets. While we will make some shifts in priorities and timings, our key focus areas do not need to change. Delivering on our core brands will be vital over the foreseeable future. Consumers want to know that the products they are buying are effective and provide good value. This aligns with our portfolio as our core brands are often at base and mainstream price points, which we expect to become bigger focus areas for retailers and consumers as the economic pressures have increased unemployment mount. Our core innovation strategy will bring news to these big segments and is intended to bring added value in a period where price increases may be difficult to take. We will also continue to focus on innovation in faster-growth segments. Our plans for 2020 and 2021 will still include significant premium innovation as it is often innovation that drives store traffic. As part of our efforts to expand our business in faster-growth channels, we have focused even more aggressively on e-commerce and direct-to-consumer. This was the learning that we took from our experiences in China in the first quarter, which helped us to shift resources towards channels that will benefit from disruption in our markets. We saw significant e-commerce share gains in toothpaste in the US in the first quarter behind the launch of Optic White Renewal. And Hill's worked with their brick-and-mortar partners to accelerate their e-commerce offerings in order to offset lost store traffic. Overall, our e-commerce business was up more than 50% in the first quarter. And our North American division e-commerce sales more than doubled in the quarter versus prior year. Our professional teams have learned new ways to engage their customers in a socially distant world. Similar to what we do with Hill's to Home, PCA Skin is helping their spa customers by having them book orders for direct-to-consumer shipments so they can still drive revenue. But agility isn't just executing our strategy the same way we had planned. In this current environment, it requires streamlining our processes and making decisions more quickly so that we can get better respond to our customers and consumers' needs. There's no better example of this than our global supply chain. As the crisis hit, we mobilized our supply chain teams to offset lost production in China to increase manufacturing elsewhere. We established strict safety procedures in China, which allowed us to reopen our factories in a safe and efficient manner. Now, we are operating at over 100% of our expected capacity in many of our Chinese plants, which is helping to alleviate pressure in countries where COVID is still a developing problem. By taking these procedures around the globe, we helped our Anzio, Italy plant stay open throughout the crisis, delivering 40% more volume in March than initially anticipated. After realizing the scale of the increased demand for many of our health and hygiene products, our marketing and customer development teams worked with our retail partners to develop streamlined product offerings that allow our supply chain to produce fewer SKUs for longer runs, which increased capacity to meet consumer demand. We also identified alternative formulas, materials, packaging designs and product artwork to give us flexibility as we prepare for further disruption in our networks. We have also become more digitally oriented by transitioning 10,000 people to work outside the office. Thanks to the resilience of our global networks, our quarterly closing process is one of the smoothest in memory despite the fact that all of our shared service centers in Mexico City, Warsaw and Mumbai, all working 100% remotely. And all of this happened in just nine weeks since I presented to you at the CAGNY conference. This great work has helped us deliver the results that we reported today. This proven capacity for agility will continue as we encounter ongoing impacts from the crisis, economic uncertainty and foreign exchange headwinds. Our third priority is balancing how we manage to get through the crisis, ensuring that we can win when it's over. We have established our -- we have re-established our top line momentum over the past two years. We need to sustain that momentum and adapt our financial plans to deliver in a very difficult 2020, while leaving ourselves well positioned for growth when markets normalize. We will continue to support our brands through impactful marketing programs. We know that compelling advertising behind strong brands is crucial to maintaining long-term organic sales growth, which is the key value driver for our company. We also need to further invest in the capabilities that are driving growth: digital, e-commerce and analytics. We will not fall behind in building the skills needed for when the economy comes back. Productivity is always a priority for us. And these times, we work even harder to take costs out of the P&L to help offset some of the additional pressure that will come from COVID mitigation, foreign exchange and the weakening economy. Our Funding the Growth initiatives, are ramping up to take out discretionary costs that may be unnecessary given the current business environment. We're using analytics to identify and eliminate promotional programs that are not generating value given the consumer environment we find ourselves in. I will finish up by reminding you of our strategies surrounding cash flow and liquidity, which remain unchanged. We have historically generated significant amounts of free cash flow, a trend that continued in the first quarter. Our priorities for uses of cash include capital investments for productivity and future growth; paying dividends to our shareholders, which we have done consistently for 124 straight years; and acquisitions to accelerate growth. We generally allocate the balance of our cash flow to share repurchase. Consistent with prior comments, we have moderated our share repurchase activity as we focus more of our cash flow on reducing the debt from the Filorga and Hello transactions. Turning to liquidity, we've been issuing commercial paper throughout the crisis. We remain committed to our AA minus debt rating. And as of the end of the first quarter, we have cash and cash equivalents on hand that are more than three times our long-term debt maturities over the next 12 months. We also have access to lines of credit should we need them. So those are our priorities. Although there is tremendous amount of uncertainty right now, I am confident that we have the right priorities, the right strategies and most of all, the right people, Colgate people to navigate through the crisis -- emerge stronger on the other side. And now I'll turn it over to John to discuss our Q1 results and provide some context on our full 2020. Good morning, Dara. Let me start with taking a step back on, as you referenced, 2008, 2009 and reaffirm some of the strengths that allowed us to emerge through that crisis stronger. The portfolio of our business is very strong in recessions, as you well know. We have price points across the full continuum, particularly our core businesses. Playing on your comment around the professional endorsements that historically played very well for us and will continue to play very well for us during this crisis, particularly given the scientific nature of our products, and the efficacy of our products, and I wouldn't expect given that some people will not be visiting the profession, the strength of the brand will be altered in any way during that period. The brand continues to be very, very strong, and our endorsements from the professional all over the world continue to be strong. So I don't anticipate that we'll have any issues certainly some of our business moving through the profession will be impacted in the short-term, but long-term the brand strength will continue to prevail in this in this period of time. Moving on to the category, listen, we've seen a lot of volatility in the categories. Hence, one of the reasons that we pulled guidance. There's a lot of uncertainties as things jump up and down. But rest assured people are still brushing their teeth. And as you've seen, people are still taking a lot of showers and washing their hands. In some categories, we expect the behavior change to be quite consistent over the next couple months. Liquid hand soap bar soap, bar cleaners, we've seen a real acceleration in consumption in those categories. And our anticipation is those will continue. Oral Care has been negative as some of the pipeline comes out from February and March and April. But we expect that category will come back, particularly as economies start to loosen up and you get more and more traffic coming back in the stores. As you've seen, we've had tremendous growth in e-commerce. That was what we discussed at the CAGNY, a big, big focus area for us over the last nine months. We put a lot of resources into that space. We're really learning. Obviously, the Hill's business is best-in-class. We're transferring those learnings around the world. So we're getting consumption in the categories that you're seeing quite weak in brick-and-mortar coming through in e-commerce now. And certainly, that will play well for us longer term. So overall, categories will come back, a lot of volatility right now in emerging markets. I was on the phone this morning with our Asia team, and they're seeing things come back quite nicely. We're about 75% of where they were pre-crisis, but that has stepped up meaningfully over the last six weeks or so. And so overall, we'll see categories come back, but it's about getting store traffic back and getting some of the economy solution. But overall, looking okay. Sure. Thanks, Andrea. So let's take North America first. Obviously, significant spikes in March relative to consumption, a lot of the panic buying, but more importantly, some of the trends I articulated earlier around how we're seeing consumption increase in certain categories like bar soap, like liquid hand soap, like floor cleaners. And that has continued through April, as John said. We've seen strong category growth in those specific areas. Obviously, some of the momentum that we're seeing in April is replenishing inventories that were at very low levels coming out of March, particularly in those high-demand categories. Conversely, in categories where we saw pantry loading like Oral Care, we've seen the categories come down in consumption as you would expect, given the pantry load that was in March, and no specific reason why consumers would be brushing their teeth more. So it would be what you expect. Categories where consumers are using them more, good consumption and categories that were driven by some of the panic buying has slowed down, and in fact, are negative in April. And that would be consistent for both Europe and the U.S. Sure. Thanks, Wendy. Let me take Hill's. Obviously, as John mentioned, the Hill's success, once again, in the quarter was extraordinary. And I think it really points to the underlying strength of that business: one, great core innovation; two, great efficacious scientific brands that play really well in the marketplace; and three, an incredibly adept organization around winning digitally and winning online. Specifically online, to your question, their business was up in excess of the company growth, which was around 54%, 55% for total Colgate. Hill's was up 57% in the quarter and saw good progress across particularly some of the key initiatives they implemented with some of the brick-and-mortar retailers, which was unusual, given some of the struggles that, that retail environment had. But overall, great growth on Hill's. It's a high -- it's in the teens in terms of percent of sales. It continues to grow, obviously, and the success we've had with some of the Science Diet relaunch, particularly in some of the pure-play retailers has been quite notable. Moving on to China, all the strategies, Wendy, that we put in place that we've talked about over the last 18 months or so, repositioning the portfolio, moving significant structural changes relative to moving from brick-and-mortar to online, both in resource and capabilities, all of that is playing out really well for us. We've stepped up our innovation, particularly in the online space. You heard John talk about Miracle Repair. I did get some good news this morning that the Darlie franchise has returned to the number one share of market brand in the country. We had lost share market to Yunnan Baiyao, the local player. We have returned to leadership in March, which is terrific. Shares are up for both Colgate and Darlie in March. We're seeing good progression there, particularly in the online space. More work to do on Colgate. However, the significant repositioning of the portfolio will happen in the back half of this year. But structurally, we've made all the changes that we think are necessary to win. And as I mentioned earlier, I think big brands are going to win in this environment, whether it's in Asia or anywhere around the world, the proven efficacy positioning the scientific knowledge that we have and how we communicate that in our brand purpose, particularly around our core businesses, will bode well moving forward. Sure. Historically, we handle these crisis is quite well in emerging markets, given the pricing power that we have. So, let's talk a little bit about our strategy right now, which we think will modify slightly as we see some of the recessionary pressures come. Obviously, a lot of opportunity for us in the premium side of the business. We've been discussing that with you for the last 18 months or so, how much upside we have on premium innovation. That will continue to happen as I mentioned. But we will dial up more of our core innovation, particularly given the price points that we have and the size of those businesses in emerging markets. And those tend to be the opening price points in many big markets, whether it's Mexico, Brazil or India. So you'll see more innovation coming in that space, and we're doing a lot of things very, very quickly to adapt to some of the consumer behavior changes we've seen, particularly around the importance of health and hygiene and how that plays out with some of our products. Interesting, as we've gone through the last couple of months, our focus on the Total relaunch, particularly the antibacterial positioning and long-lasting antibacterial benefit that product provides has benefited us greatly in the last six weeks. We've seen some of our big markets, whether it be Brazil, Mexico, U.K., we've seen the premium innovation on Total working. So moving forward a little bit more on core, continue to focus on premium side, but we think we're positioned well for the emerging markets. Now obviously, we can't anticipate how much unemployment will be in some of these markets or potential lockdowns that we'll see coming from COVID, but the portfolio, at least how we're positioning it, we'll be well positioned for the emerging trends that we'll see there. Likewise, the same in India and Eastern Europe, there will be no change. The strategy will be consistently executed around the world, locally adapted as necessary. But we don't see that changing based on any of the markets. China would be perhaps the exception, given some of the portfolio strategies that we'll be adopting in the back half and the specific needs of that market. Your second question around LatAm pricing, again, it's -- obviously, the devaluation has been significant. So we've got a couple of things that we're looking at. Obviously, we've taken pricing. You saw that in the first quarter. We will continue to take pricing, but it will get a little bit more difficult, particularly in the current environment. We've had opportunities to dial back on promotions in some of those markets as we see, obviously, store traffic down. So we've been quite prudent. On how we're thinking about promotional spend, a lot of work on revenue growth management and price pack architecture, particularly now as we move into a recessionary environment. So, we'll see more of that happening. And a little bit more benign pricing environment -- excuse me, material pricing environment moving forward, we think the combination of all of that will allow us to continue to maintain the integrity of the LatAm P&L and maintain the investment, which is still important for us to emerge stronger coming out of this. Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So as I just mentioned, we're -- we've been doubling down on innovation for the better part of 18 months now. And it's interesting as a management team, as we've gone into this, we've obviously been looking specifically at what innovation is right for the current environment. We will be moving some things around as necessary. We're dialing up some areas. We've orchestrated a series of teams internally to work specifically around some of the common truth that we're seeing, particularly in the health and hygiene spaces: one, how we adopt our portfolio; and two, how we accelerate innovation moving into this. What's interesting is we have just a long history of great clinical studies and claims and science behind our products that we think we can pull out of the jaws and use in this current environment, great formulations with great science and claims that will play into health and hygiene. So we think very appropriate for us to look at our innovation and modify it as necessary moving forward. And the key focus for us here is agility and doing this really, really quickly. So you'll start to see some of that innovation come to the market in the back half of this year already that wasn't necessarily there before. Some of the bigger premium innovations, as I mentioned, will stay. We will alter those based on some of the spacing, whether it's moving out later in the third quarter, so to speak, versus earlier to allow some normalization, particularly in some of our key markets where we see store traffic down quite considerably right now. So that will happen. Continuing to support the business, we've always done that during tough times, and we've come out of it stronger as a result. The brands have emerged stronger. We see competition spending quite a bit, at least on the media side, a lot more movement for us in the digital and e-commerce space, which we're putting a lot more money in. And I think you can see the results that we generated in the first quarter. Certainly, that shift of resources and spending in e-commerce is paid out for. So marketing spending will be prudent and thoughtful moving forward to be sure. But we'll continue to support our brands, which we believe is in the best interest of generating the long-term growth that we want to deliver. Sure, Kevin. And -- the obvious is we have a very large soap business globally, one of our bigger categories. We obviously have a large liquid hand soap business, particularly in Europe and the U.S. We don't talk a lot about our Home Care business, but we have a very strong Home Care business in Latin America as well as in Europe and growing really quickly in North America. All those businesses, we're seeing behavior changes that we think will stick moving forward. I mean, consumers will wash their hands more, people staying at home will be cleaning their floors more. Obviously, people are washing their clothing more. So our fabric softener business will benefit from that. So categories where we see behavior change, we compete in quite a few of them. Obviously, people aren't going to stop brushing their teeth. And that will continue to be obviously a growth opportunity moving forward for us, but we don't see any sizable changes there. We'll see more volatility in the Oral Care space, I think, because you probably see more pantry loading in terms of how people are buying products coming in and out of the category less frequently. So obviously, as we think about innovation, we'll have to time that innovation quite carefully and be quite prudent on that. So overall, our categories are positioned quite well. Obviously, skin health is an area where we've seen quite a bit of disruption in, whether it be travel retail or some of our pharmacy business in Europe as well as our derm business here in the U.S. And we're working very closely with those teams, particularly in the area of telehealth, working on opportunities to continue to engage those communities so they can serve their customers with product online. We talked about the Hill's to Home model that we've been driving over the last year, which has done very, very well for Hill's. We're expanding that into our skin health business in order to stimulate demand at both institutions and spas as well as derms. So, overall, we'll see that category go through a bumpy road, we think, over the next couple months, six months or so. But if you go back to 2008 and 2009, you know, it took more or less nine months to 12 months for that category to come back. The basic fundamentals for skin health long term are still really, really good. It's a highly profitable category. So long-term, we're very comfortable with where we are, but we'll make the necessary changes in the short-term in skin health. Thanks Bill. Yes. Thanks, Bill. So again, as I mentioned in my prepared commentary, it's been inspiring to watch our supply chain around the world deal with this. And we have discussions internally how important some of the crisis management meetings that we have throughout the year to deal with contingency planning and risk mitigation. And all of that really prevailed during these difficult times. It's the global supply chain and the standardization that we have and how we operate it, while globally is still very local, we're able to shift resources very, very quickly. So as I mentioned, right out of the gate, when China started to struggle, we shifted resources into Europe immediately. And we're able to supply everywhere that China was supplying out of Europe. Likewise, as Europe started to be challenged or Latin America or US started to be challenged, we were able to shift back to Asia. So there's a lot of flexibility in our supply chain and the credit to the team. A lot of work goes into that, to be sure. Some of the incremental volumes that we've seen, obviously, we pushed to contractors, that comes out of the lower margin. But moving forward, as we work on some of these standardization opportunities that I mentioned, for instance, working with some of our key trade partners to simplify our portfolios, that will allow us to reduce the SKUs that we're producing and bring some of that production back in-house, where we can elevate capacity based on the simplification efforts that come through that. Obviously, strategically, we're also looking at investing in some of these categories to expand capacity as required moving forward to ensure that we can meet the demand that we see ongoing. So, short-term, we anticipate that there's some margin implications with the costs associated with COVID, whether it's logistics or some of the contract that we have longer term or we'll bring that back in-house and find ways to continue to deliver the margin that's accretive to the business. Hey, Steve. So, Steve, as I mentioned, these -- we've been around for a long, long time. Colgate, we've dealt with a lot of crisis and depressions and even pandemics at one point in time. So, this is obviously very unusual, and there's a lot of unpredictability, which is, obviously, you've heard in the print throughout the last two weeks, but we continue to focus on the fundamentals, which we've been building for the last two years to strengthen our business. So, it's building `brands with purpose, and that's the reason why we will continue to invest behind our brands. We've always found that our ability to innovate and invest in difficult times allows us to emerge with strong brands and strong income statements as we come out of this. And we'll continue to do that. We've stepped up our productivity measures as you've heard me talk about quite often. We're using digital very differently across the company, the collaboration tools that we put in place going into this based on the Google suite of tools has been, just quite frankly, extraordinary to get 10,000 people working day one virtually was, I think, a testament to our IT organization and what we've been able to do there, likewise, using technology to drive more productivity in our closings, so all of that will continue to dial up as we go through this. Relative to the incentive structure, we'll continue to be focused on organic sales and obviously, bottom line profitability. That continues to be the focus for the company. You've seen the reacceleration of our business over the last six quarters. Even with some of the pantry, we accelerated our organic sales in the quarter, both from a Hill's standpoint and from a Colgate standpoint. So, the underlying fundamentals for the business, we believe, are quite strong. And continuing to invest in them, continuing to build capabilities, as I mentioned earlier, in spaces like digital, e-commerce and analytics, we believe will position us extremely well coming out of this. Hey Lauren. Yes. Thanks, Lauren. It really depends on the category. I mean, obviously, some of the ones I mentioned earlier like liquid hand soap and bar soap, we will expect in emerging markets, for instance, liquid hand soap penetration to grow. Those are fundamentally bar soap markets. But the efficiency and hygiene nature of liquid hand soap may lend itself to increase band penetration. Products like spray cleaners and wipes, we'll see more penetration grow, and we're expanding those as well. So there are certain categories where we see certainly the opportunity to grow penetration, particularly ones that are -- provide an efficiency or an added value, and that will be our focus. Consumption in those categories, likewise, will probably offset some of the pricing pressures that you'll see in some of those markets. We typically found not significant trade down in recessions, but you do get some for sure. And we've been able to deal with that with revenue growth management, obviously, a focus on innovating behind the core, which is, as I mentioned earlier, usually at opening price points. And that allows us to take pricing in those categories. Price pack architecture and recessions has always worked quite effectively for us. So it really depends on the category and the market. Overall, we'll probably see a little slowness or a reduction in terms of value growth. Volumes, as I mentioned, people don't stop brushing their teeth. And in categories, which we mentioned, we in fact, think we'll see an increase in consumption moving through this. Hi, Mark. Sure. Nothing -- on the pricing front, obviously, in some of the emerging markets, we're going to be quite prudent and cautious on how we're looking at pricing. Although historically, we have been quite aggressive in taking -- we took pricing in the first quarter. That will obviously translate through the balance of the year. We have plans to continue to look at pricing, and we'll do that quite creatively, either through managing our gross to net much more efficiently, particularly given store traffic being down. We'll do that through some of our channel focus as well. We'll do that through some of our innovation in terms of price points, innovation at different price points. So, we have different mechanisms that we'll be using. We obviously will gauge what competitors are doing. But given some of our leadership positions in most of the emerging markets, our intent will be to lead pricing. And we've always done that, but we'll be mindful of how we do that, particularly given the sensitivity in the current environment. On the cost side, we see, obviously, costs being a little less of a headwind than they were in the year-ago period. We've seen resins obviously come down. But on the flip side, prices have gone up, ag prices have gone up. But net-net, we'll see less headwinds than we saw in the back half of last year. And we'll watch it all very carefully. As you've heard most others talk about, there's typically a six to nine month lag between the drop of oil prices and where we see the benefit moving through, through the P&L. But by and large, we'll see a better environment in the back half of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll start to see some of those costs from COVID subside, particularly as we bring some of that production in-house and some of the panic buying becomes a little bit more predictable. Difficult at this stage to say that, but we expect it to become a little bit more predictable, which allow us to get a better line of sight on how we want to handle capacity planning for our facilities and our contractors. And bear in mind, Mark, one other point is, obviously, some of the logistics costs associated with this, we're doing everything we can to deliver the customer service that our partners or customers are looking for and there will be some added logistics costs that will come in the year-ago period as well associated with this. So listen, it's straight to what we said in the commentary. The unpredictability of what we're seeing across the world is at a level that we've never seen before. Obviously, India, we didn't anticipate would shut down like it shut down. We had plants and distribution channels shut down for almost two weeks. They're obviously coming back online as we speak, but that had a significant impact at the back end of the quarter and has had a significant impact in April. And we can't predict exactly where it's going to happen. Obviously, we've seen things creep up in terms of the number of incidences in Brazil. So, what happens there going forward. So again, it's the unpredictability of what we're seeing all around the world. And you combine that with the continued strengthening of the dollar around the world and the foreign exchange headwinds that -- gives us pause. And we've seen, obviously, a lot of volatility, likewise, in some of the consumption numbers that we've been talking about throughout the call. They're jumping all over the place right now. And so it's very difficult to get a line of sight on how things are going to ultimately unfold. Yes, the fundamentals of our categories are good long-term, but the uncertainty with government regulations and disruptions moving forward, we think it's the prudent thing to hold our guidance at this stage. And we'll come back to you as soon as we can when we have a little bit more confidence on where things are headed. Yes, Jason, listen, if you look at the weeklies, the monthlies on the categories all around the world, and I've got them here in front of me, they're all over the place on categories like Oral Care. Obviously, you've seen more consistency in categories like liquid hand soap and bar soap and cleaners. The biggest unknown force, in our view, is the degree of the recession that we're going to see all around the world. And you combine that with the foreign exchange headwinds that we're faced with right now and ability to take pricing, which has always been a challenge in an environment like this, although we've had great success there, this is unique and a bit different. So it's really the uncertainty that we're seeing and the disruptions that we're seeing. So again, if big markets start to get -- have more lockdowns, that creates a significant headwind for us. It creates a significant headwind for the category. If we see unemployment jump 10%, 15% in certain markets, we've not dealt with that in the past. That will have some impact on the value orientation of our categories as well. So all in all, there's uncertainty moving forward. We're trying to position ourselves as well as we can. We've got good experience on this, but there is significant unpredictability based on what I've outlined earlier. Well, thanks, everyone. Obviously, unusual and unprecedented times, I want to once again thank all the Colgate people. It's inspiring to work with such an incredibly talented organization. We're greatly benefited by having a management team that has dealt with this level of uncertainty, but obviously, working hard to continue to deliver the results. And we look forward to having more discussions with everyone moving forward. Thanks, everyone. Be safe."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Orlando. Good morning, and welcome to our 2021 full year and fourth quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our full year and Q4 performance as well as our outlook for 2022 before turning it over to Noel for his comments. We will then open it up for Q&A. We delivered solid results in 2021 despite a very challenging operating environment, which we believe provides further proof that our strategy is working. For the full year, we grew net sales 6%, adding nearly $1 billion in revenue. We grew organic sales 4.5% at the higher end of our 3% to 5% 2021 guidance range despite difficult comparisons. Importantly, our organic sales growth this year was led by our two most important categories: Oral Care, which delivered organic sales growth at the high end of mid single-digits; and Pet Nutrition, which delivered organic sales growth in the teens, our second consecutive year with double-digit organic sales growth for Hill\u2019s. Both of these categories saw an acceleration in organic sales growth in 2021, which we think bodes well for 2022. Personal Care and Home Care organic sales growth were both down in the year as they lapped very difficult comparisons driven by COVID-related demand, but we anticipate both categories will return to growth in 2022. But on a compounded basis, over the past three years, we have delivered organic sales growth across every division and every category with growth in both volume and price. And we are confident that our growth will continue into 2022. Our innovation pipeline is strong as we continue to shift our focus to more breakthrough and transformational innovation. We have raised our level of brand support, including increased advertising spending that is driving improved brand equity. Our digital transformation is paying off with e-commerce market shares growing in key markets and strong e-commerce sales growth across all of our categories, including Pet Nutrition and within Personal Care, premium skin. That said, the operating environment remains volatile, with COVID still very much impacting our business, unprecedented raw material inflation and supply chain disruptions. As Noel will discuss, we believe our 2022 plans and our long-term strategic choices will allow us to continue to grow and improve our profitability as we move through the year. This includes significant pricing, increased advertising, breakthrough and transformational innovation and stepped up productivity. Our net sales grew 2% in the quarter, driven by 3% organic sales growth and a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. Our organic sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by Pet Nutrition and Oral Care, while Personal Care was down slightly and Home Care was flat due to COVID-19 comparisons. Organic sales growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by the factory closures related to COVID-19 lockdowns we mentioned on the third quarter call. As you have seen across many companies and industries, raw material pressure worsened in the fourth quarter, putting further pressure on our gross margins. Our gross margin was down 300 basis points in the quarter on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. Pricing was a 120 basis point benefit to gross margin, while raw materials were a 670 basis point headwind. Productivity was favorable by 250 basis points. On a GAAP and Base Business basis, our SG&A was down 150 basis points on a percent of sales basis, driven by lower advertising spending, lapping record levels in the year ago quarter as well as lower overheads, excluding logistics. Our combination of net sales growth and productivity drove our overheads, excluding logistics, down meaningfully, which helped us offset a large increase in logistics costs both on a dollar basis and a percent of sales basis. For the fourth quarter, on a GAAP basis, we delivered earnings per share of $0.18. Our GAAP earnings per share, includes a $518 million after-tax charge for impairment on our Filorga Skin Health business. We completed the Filorga transaction right before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a significant impact on key channels in which Filorga competes, including travel retail and Duty Free in China and pharmacies in Europe. While we have been unable to offset the continued weakness in these channels versus our projections when we announced the acquisition, we have full confidence in the Filorga brand and are forecasting double-digit growth going forward. Our two other skin health brands, PCA Skin and EltaMD, are performing well and should continue to deliver strong growth. On a Base Business basis, our earnings per share was $0.79 for the quarter, up 3%. Our full year Base Business earnings per share was within our 2021 guidance range of up mid to high single digits. In order to accelerate changes to our operating structure that will allow us to reallocate resources to our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses and channels, drive efficiencies in the company\u2019s operations and streamline our supply chain to reduce structural costs. This morning, we also announced the global productivity initiative. We intend to execute the majority of the productivity program in the current calendar year. And once the projects are implemented and finalized, it is expected to result in cumulative pre-tax charges totaling between $200 million and $240 million in annualized pre-tax savings in the range of $90 million to $110 million. We would expect the benefits to begin to flow through in the second half of 2022 and then accelerate into 2023. We returned $3 billion to shareholders in 2021 with our net share repurchase up almost 50% year-over-year. A few comments on our divisional performance. North America net sales declined 1% in the fourth quarter, with organic sales down 1.5% as the division lapped high single-digit growth in the year ago period, with liquid hand soap providing a greater than 3 percentage point headwind in the quarter. In toothpaste, our consumption was ahead of shipments, as our all-outlet market share was up 50 basis points in the quarter. We have announced significant pricing across all of our categories in North America, which will be implemented throughout Q1 and into Q2. Latin America net sales were up 3.5%, with 6% organic sales growth. Oral Care grew high single digits, while Personal Care and Home Care grew mid single digits. Brazil led the growth in the quarter behind strong pricing and premium innovation across whitening and naturals. Europe net sales declined 6% in the quarter, with organic sales minus 3.5%, lapping 4.5% growth in the year ago quarter and a 2.5% foreign exchange headwind. While the pricing environment in Europe is normally very difficult, we expect to see pricing across the portfolio. We gained market share in Europe in Q4, with particular strength behind Elmex and we have significant innovation planned for 2022. Asia-Pacific net sales grew 0.5% and organic sales grew 1.5% in the quarter, with volume and pricing up slightly and a modest negative impact from foreign exchange. Our Asia e-commerce business continued its strong growth in Q4 and for the year. We gained nearly 400 basis points of toothpaste market share in e-commerce in China in 2021, combined on our Colgate and H&H businesses. Africa/Eurasia net sales grew 2% in the quarter, as organic sales growth of 3% was partially offset by negative foreign exchange. The organic sales growth was driven by Oral Care despite impacts from the supply chain disruption from COVID-19 restrictions I mentioned previously. Volumes were also negatively impacted by political volatility in Eurasia. Hill\u2019s finished another great year with a strong fourth quarter. Net sales grew 12% and organic sales grew 13% for the quarter. The U.S. continued to lead Hill\u2019s growth performance, with strength across the gamut of brick-and-mortar and e-commerce retail partners. We expect another strong year for Hill\u2019s in 2022, with strong levels of advertising support, best-in-class e-commerce execution, innovation and pricing growth.  And now for guidance, we expect organic sales growth for the year to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range, driven primarily by continued growth in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit headwind to revenues, operating profit and earnings growth for the year. All-in, we expect net sales to be up 1% to 4%. We expect gross margin to be up for the year, but we highlight that, just as we saw in 2021, there will be significant swings in year-over-year performance as we go through the year. The biggest raw material headwinds year-over-year are in the first quarter and we expect that they will moderate as we go through the year. On top of the productivity program I mentioned above, we will continue to take additional steps to mitigate the impact of logistics and raw material cost headwinds, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG were available and many others. Advertising is expected to be up on both a dollar basis and a percent of sales basis. Given the issues surrounding logistics networks on a global basis, our logistics costs will continue to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S. and Africa/Eurasia. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23% and 24% for 2022 on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. At this point, we have not incorporated any proposed changes to U.S. corporate tax rates. We expect double-digit earnings per share growth on a GAAP basis. On a Base Business basis, we expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid single-digits. There are a few factors that will determine where we fall in that range. We have budgeted modest sequential declines in some raw material prices as we go through the year. If those raw materials stay at current levels, this will be above what we are currently budgeting. Foreign exchange. The dollar has been trending higher recently. If that continues, it will be an additional headwind. We assume that raw materials and logistics cost increases are not unique to us and our plans do not include significant manufacturing downtime due to COVID-related lockdowns. And with that, I will turn it over to Noel.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John and good morning everyone. Before I get into my remarks, I want to wish all of you a safe and happy new year. Of course, I will be speaking to you all again just a few weeks for CAGNY and I am very much looking forward to that. Over the last 3 years, we have revitalized our core businesses, innovative and adjacent categories and expanded our availability in faster growth markets and channels. All these efforts have helped us deliver 3 straight years of organic sales growth in or above our long-term targeted range of 3% to 5%. I believe our company is well-positioned to continue our momentum and drive shareholder value in this year and beyond despite the difficult operating environment. We compete in growing categories with high purchase frequency, daily usage and high levels of brand loyalty and we have strong brands that are well-positioned to take advantage of these category dynamics. Colgate is the most penetrated consumer brand in the world, with strength across emerging and developed markets. Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet and Hill\u2019s Science Diet have strong health credentials with vets and pet parents. Elmex and Meridol are leading premium brands and therapeutics in the markets in which they compete. And other brands like Irish Spring, Protex, Suavitel and Fabuloso, all delivered tremendous value to consumers and our retail partners. This also includes our skin health businesses, EltaMD, PCA Skin and Filorga. John discussed the impact of COVID-19 on Filorga, which resulted in performance below our targets. We have plans in place to revitalize our Filorga business in those key channels, along with building out distribution and other growth channels and accelerating innovation. We are confident that Filorga will be a strong contributor to future top and bottom line growth. Trends on EltaMD and PCA Skin remained very strong. We have and are building capabilities that will allow us to compete in all types of markets and channels. Our global operating model, including our supply chain, allows us to operate effectively and profitably in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Our transition to our new innovation strategy has enabled us to deliver a better mixture of global and local innovation, including increased levels of breakthrough and transformational innovation. This has had a direct impact on accelerating our growth, particularly in Oral Care, our rebound in China e-commerce, for example and accelerated growth in Pet Nutrition. Our digital transformation, which will be an important topic when we present to you at CAGNY, has allowed us to accelerate our e-commerce efforts across all of our markets. We delivered another year of robust e-commerce growth and grew share in all 6 of our largest e-commerce toothpaste markets in 2021. And we are truly integrating ESG into our business strategy in ways that drive value. Bright Smiles, Bright Futures not only teaches children in underserved markets how to brush their teeth, but also help drive per capita consumption over time. And our recyclable toothpaste 2, which we shared the technology with our competitors, is helping to drive the entire category to be more sustainable, which is a requirement for any category to deliver growth in the future. We also issued our first sustainability bond in the fourth quarter. We will use the funds to invest in our sustainability and social impact strategies while benefiting from a lower interest rate. So, I firmly believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth to our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. But we also need to balance managing through the teeth of a very difficult operating environment while still delivering on that long-term strategy. We stay committed to our strategy. We will emerge from the next few quarters with sustained organic sales growth and a structurally more efficient company that will allow us to grow profits, while still investing in our brands. Obviously, you all know about the headwinds that companies are facing in today\u2019s operating environment in terms of raw materials. COVID and higher costs are putting significant pressure on supply chains, including unprecedented impacts on logistics, both in terms of efficiency and costs. And recently, the dollar has strengthened. The key for us to deliver against our targets in the shorter term is to continue to execute on pricing and revenue growth management. We have already taken pricing in many markets and we will have further significant pricing plan for the first half of this year, including moving some pricing that we anticipated for later in the year in 2022 into the first half. You all know our funding the growth is well-ingrained and a key component of offsetting rising raw material costs. We have put together new cross-functional teams that are focused on ensuring we are bringing additional opportunities to our funding the growth and that we are executing them as rapidly as possible. So, we are accelerating short-term actions to drive improved profitability, but we know the key to shareholder value creation is to remain committed to the long-term. To that end, we will continue to invest in brand building. As I said a few minutes ago, it all starts with strong brands. We have turned our growth trajectory around over the past few years and a key component of this has been additional advertising spend. Our guidance for 2022 includes an increase in advertising to make sure we are able to sustain volume growth as we exit a period of very strong pricing. At CAGNY, you will hear even more about how we have increased the return on marketing spend through our digital transformation. We will continue to focus on innovation, providing added value to our consumers through innovation that supports increased pricing. Our innovation pipeline is very strong for the year and heading into next. We have innovation across our categories with a particular focus on premium innovation that brings new benefits and forms to our brands. We are also investing in capacity. Our CapEx rose in 2021, primarily because we are investing in incremental capacity for growth, along with investments to advance our sustainability efforts. Our need to build capacity across the business, mostly in Pet Nutrition, shows that the rebound in organic sales growth is real and when we expect to continue. This investment won\u2019t preclude us from continuing to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And finally today, we announced a productivity initiative that is focused on aligning our costs and investments with our long-term strategies. This program is designed to deliver savings that can both be reinvested for growth and apply to the bottom line. Importantly, this program, along with the pricing and funding the growth, should allow us to exit this inflationary cycle with more levers to drive growth and profitability and keep our strategy on track. So, 2022 will be another volatile year with all the headwinds you heard me described, but we intend to execute to deliver growth and drive shareholder value, all with delivering against our long-term strategies, which makes me very excited about the future for our company. And with that, I will open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Good morning, guys.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So I was just hoping for an update on the Oral Care business. The full year is often a good time to take stock of where you stand. So can you discuss your market share performance in Oral Care in 2021? Trends as you progress through the year, probably most productive to talk about it on a regional basis? But as we look forward, Noel after the strategic changes under your leadership the last few years, are you satisfied with where you stand? And how do you think that business is positioned for 2022? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Dara. So as you heard in some of the prepared comments, Oral Care accelerated in 2021. In fact, it was double the growth rate that we had in 2020. Our consumption exceeded shipments in most markets, and that was a function of some of the supply chain challenges that we incurred, particularly here in North America as well as in Asia. So if I walk around the world, really strong back half performance in Europe. In fact, we\u2019re at record shares on the toothpaste business exiting the fourth quarter there. You heard John mentioned the strong growth we\u2019re seeing in China, which was obviously a key market for us to get turned around in the last couple of years. Our e-commerce shares are up very, very strongly. They are close to 400 basis points and the fastest consumer brand in the market. Our brick-and-mortar shares are holding. So overall, we\u2019re delivering share growth there. Latin America Holding, as we talked about, we\u2019ve been very much on driving revenue growth management in those markets and have some great success, particularly in markets like Brazil. And we\u2019re trying to resist just chasing some of the promotional volume at the lower end of the market, which has lost some of our volume share. But overall, we feel very good about where we are, particularly around the premiumization. North America, while we exited strong, we\u2019re still not satisfied with the performance there. Clearly, we believe we have significant opportunities there. The innovation plans we have in place for 2022 reflect our commitment to that market as well as the increased advertising support, particularly around the premiumization strategy and we expect to see shares rebuild nicely in 2022. But satisfied at least that the fourth quarter and some of the back half activities that we put in place to be more competitive, have certainly stabilized the share, and now it\u2019s about growing. As we mentioned, some of our untracked channels continue to perform very well in Oral Care, in the U.S., particularly the club channel as well as e-commerce. We don\u2019t talk a lot about toothbrushes, but that business had a really good year for our share growth is up in toothpaste \u2013 excuse me, in toothbrushes across most markets, and some good innovation likewise coming on that. That will be coupled obviously with strong pricing. I\u2019m sure we will get into a lot of discussion on that, but we have taken pricing in emerging markets. We are rolling aggressive pricing in developed markets, and that will continue to bolster share and our ability to support the brand moving forward. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with Oral Care, Dara.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good morning, guys.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Peter.\nPeter Grom: So I just wanted to ask around the guidance for gross margin expansion, just in the context of what we\u2019re seeing right now. Can you maybe help us understand some of the underlying drivers behind that? And I know John mentioned it embeds some moderation in raw material costs. So could you maybe provide more detail there or maybe where you expect that moderation? And then maybe just more broadly, like how should we think about the phasing of gross margin expansion? And ultimately, how that impacts earnings cadence as we move through the year? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. So let \u2013 I guess to start with raw materials there. Obviously, we saw a significant acceleration in raw material prices following the first quarter in 2021. That continued to escalate as we went through the year. And certainly, based on where we thought we were in the third quarter, we saw significant increases moving into the fourth quarter. In fact, resins up more or less 50%, our tablet price is up 30% to 40% in the fourth quarter. So all of that is now built into how we\u2019re thinking about \u201822, and we expect raw materials, quite frankly, to peak in the first quarter. We have developed our plans based on spot rates today, and we expect the spot rates to hold and begin to moderate towards the back half of 2022. So you see raw materials potentially peak in the first quarter and then stabilize and begin to potentially moderate in the back half. You layer on top of that our pricing strategies for the year. We took some pricing in the fourth quarter in emerging markets. We took more pricing in the developed markets in the first quarter, which will mostly take effect as we exit the first quarter into second quarter. We\u2019ve got, obviously, the additional productivity programs that we talked about this morning, that will be very back half weighted more in the end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter and into \u201823. So we won\u2019t see much benefit this year, particularly in the first half. So \u2013 and you combine that likewise with an innovation plan that is weighted more towards the premium side, particularly in North America in the first quarter. And all of that will help us lead to growing margins as we go through the year and exiting the year with margins up.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: Hey, I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the restructuring, because I feel like it\u2019s rare to see a program that only 1 year in nature. So kind of are these projects or programs that would have been on the to-do list, but were accelerated? Are they opportunities that you proactively sought out and look for ways to accelerate what would typically be funding the growth because of the environment? And then also, I feel like in the last 12-plus months, there have been a couple of things that have come up regionally with sort of operating surprises, whether it\u2019s a supply chain hiccup in one market or another. So to what degree also does this program may be look at factors that impacted some of that less consistent operating performance that you\u2019ve had over the last year or so? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Lauren. I think the key word you use is really trying to be proactive. I mean we came into this year after the first quarter, noticing, obviously, an environment that was becoming more challenging, particularly around COVID and disruptions associated with that as it then obviously led into a significant inflationary environment and we got out ahead of this as quickly as we could to start thinking about our 2025 strategy and ultimately, what we were trying to achieve and how we wanted to accelerate. We\u2019ve seen a lot of great progress in our digital transformation. We\u2019ve seen a lot of great progress as we\u2019ve restructured our innovation groups around the world towards breakthrough and transformational innovation and the benefits we\u2019re seeing coming out of that. And we decided we really wanted to accelerate that transformation and make sure that we get that savings into the business as quickly as possible as well as the benefits of how we structure ourselves to be more agile and faster to market, the benefits we get out of increased resources in the digital space as well as the innovation. Now bear in mind, as you heard from John, we had a really good year around controlling our overheads, and we have been constantly looking at ways to mitigate the inflationary pricing we\u2019re seeing in the market. Our overheads were down on the year, down considerably in the fourth quarter. And I think that\u2019s just good business. We\u2019re constantly looking for ways to optimize how we operate. On top of that, we want to look at how we structure ourselves to really continue to accelerate the growth momentum that we have. So as we move throughout the year, we will exit this program. As you said, it\u2019s a one-year program with the savings really falling into the back half of 2022 and into the first half of \u201823. It allowed us to really fine-tune where we wanted to focus and allowed us to do that in the 12-month period, and we think that\u2019s ultimately right for the business to ensure that we don\u2019t have ongoing distractions across the organization, and we get on with trying to accomplish what we\u2019ve set out to do for the year and into \u201823. On the regional point that you were mentioning, Lauren, listen, as you\u2019ve heard from everyone, the supply chain challenges everyone faces are quite significant. And it really, to a certain extent, depends on the structure and composition of your supply chain. We have had, as you know, one of the most efficient supply chains in the world in terms of how we\u2019ve optimized our global sourcing all around the world and how we put capital into ensuring that we have extremely low-cost plants. We will benefit from that long-term to be sure. In the short-term, given some of the disruptions that we\u2019ve seen both in Asia as well as here in North America, we\u2019ve had to deal with that. And that has brought some additional costs and obviously, as you heard, some disruption to the top line of the business as well, likewise, no question into the market share. So we\u2019re moving to get through those as we go into \u201822, and we feel very confident in where we are with our supply chain and the changes that we\u2019re making, particularly in the productivity initiative to continue to optimize that moving forward.\nOperator: And up next, we will hear from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Thanks very much and good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Powers: Maybe \u2013 Good morning. So maybe rounding out Dara\u2019s initial question. Just could you talk a little bit about how Oral Care performed globally in the fourth quarter from an organic growth perspective? And then looking ahead, I guess I\u2019m wondering if you can provide just some more detail around the composition of the 3% to 5% growth you\u2019ve called for \u201822 both by product segment, Oral Care versus Pet and presumably some normalization in Home and Personal Care, but also by price versus volume because obviously, you\u2019re putting in a lot of price. So I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s going to be mostly price-led. But I guess I was a little surprised in the quarter to see Latin American volumes dipped negative in response to the sequential acceleration in price there. So just curious as to how \u2013 you\u2019re thinking about that and thinking about elasticity as \u201822 progresses? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. So let me talk a little bit about Oral Care. Obviously, in the prepared remarks, you saw that the fourth quarter was driven by Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. So overall, quite pleased. And that was despite some disruptions that we saw in the quarter. The shutdowns that we talked about in the third quarter had a more material impact in the fourth quarter. That was about 60 basis points of growth to the total company in the fourth quarter, and all of that would have been in Oral Care, so to speak. So we\u2019re moving behind those. We see a little bit more disruption in the first quarter but we have a pretty good line of sight that by the second quarter and throughout the balance of the year, we will be back to where we need to get to be on that. So overall, Oral Care was good. I mentioned the strong exiting the market shares in Europe, which were very, very strong. We stabilized the shares in North America and actually saw some all outlet growth in the fourth quarter, driven by untracked channels, which was terrific. And we\u2019re particularly pleased with the reception to our new products in 2022 that we\u2019ve introduced as well as the acceptance of the pricing across North America. So we\u2019re quite confident in terms of where we\u2019re \u2013 how we\u2019re setting ourselves up for continued growth in \u201822. You had a question on price volume, and I\u2019ll address the Latin America question within that. Obviously, there is going to be more price in our organic growth in \u201822 versus volume given the significant increases that we\u2019re taking across the world. And as I mentioned, we began taking pricing at the end of the fourth quarter. We have implemented and announced pricing across the emerging markets here in the first quarter, which will take effect, as I mentioned earlier, in the early part of the second quarter. But no question, given the size of the pricing that we\u2019re taking around the world, and you\u2019re seeing that from ourselves as well as competitors in other categories, you will see a falloff in volume. And we\u2019re accustomed to that. Relative to how we think about our promotional cadence and how we think about our innovation plans as well to ensure that we continue to build volume through the balance of the year. So the makeup of the organic growth this year, no question will be driven more by price than by volume, which is a little bit different than what we\u2019ve seen in historical years. I\u2019ll say that all boats rise in this environment in the sense that everyone is impacted by the inflationary environment. So as a result, you\u2019re going to see pricing up pretty consistently across all categories. That plays, as you\u2019ve heard from others, into elasticity that you\u2019re not seeing one competitor move, you\u2019re seeing the category move. So elasticity tends to be a little bit less. We will see. It\u2019s early days now. But our experience, as you well know, Steve, of taking pricing quite significantly to offset foreign exchange in markets around the world. We have been able to balance that elasticity impact with good innovation and good promotional cadence, understanding how to ensure we\u2019re innovating across the price tiers and making sure that we\u2019re protecting the consumer and the category growth at the same time. Latin America had a really strong quarter. Bear in mind, they had a strong comp that they were dealing with. So the 2-year stack looks terrific. I think it was about 16%, if I remember correctly and obviously, 6% on top of 11% a year ago and largely driven by pricing. So, a little bit soft in the volume line as we took some pricing but we fully expect that that will recover itself. Categories continue to be quite healthy in Latin America, mid single-digit growth and the consumer seems to be responding to at least in the short-term, but we will watch that carefully as we move through \u201822.\nOperator: And up next, we will take a question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I guess you mentioned consumption has been greater than shipments. Can you update us on the service level in the U.S., where I understand that you\u2019re still reviewing inventory? And you mentioned that in the fourth \u2013 the first quarter is still going to be impacted by that \u2013 by some of the disruptions. So can you elaborate on that? And then on the Latin American comment that you answered to achieve just now, I was just wondering if \u2013 when you think about the volume shortfall, is it coming from mostly from Oral Care or is it coming from Home Care or even some of the Personal Care items that were \u2013 that had a lot of strong demand last year? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Andrea, let me take your second question first because I think, to a certain extent, it addresses some of the earlier commentary on the quarter. Bear in mind that we had strong growth in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. We were lapping significant category growth in Personal Care and Home Care that obviously paralleled our growth last year, given some of the impacts of COVID. Liquid hand soap, as a category in \u201821 was down roughly 25%. Likewise, you saw that level of growth as a category in the fourth quarter as well. Some of our home products \u2013 our cleaning products were down 15% to 20% as a category as well. So no question that had an impact in the quarter. But we\u2019ve seen that kind of starting to stabilize and our sense is as we move into \u201822, those categories have hopefully bottomed out relative to consumption. John mentioned that we shipped above \u2013 consumption was above shipments, and that was due to a certain extent to the continued constraints around logistics, the challenge of getting trailers not only around the country, but across borders, either from Mexico or otherwise. Some of the challenges that we had and the shutdowns and plants across Asia that we mentioned earlier, that obviously had an impact on the North America number as well. But as I said, we\u2019re moving through those. We think we will be out of that by the end of the quarter. We\u2019re taking the necessary steps, as I mentioned earlier, to ensure that our supply chain continues to operate as efficiently as possible. We will make a couple of changes relative to sourcing. That has obviously created a little headwind in terms of cost. But overall, we feel good about at least the plan in place, to address some of the short-term issues that we face. We will see the benefit of that as we refill the pipeline to a certain extent moving through the back half of the year.\nOperator: And next, we will take a question from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi, good morning. Question, I suppose, on inflation\u2019s impact on the consumer. Most of what we\u2019ve heard so far, particularly in developed markets as we haven\u2019t seen a lot of impact. I guess you guys have probably a better sense than most given how much inflation you\u2019ve dealt with around the world and how this is likely to unfold. So if you could just talk about maybe the state of the consumer today where you expect it to be in developed markets as it relates to how they might be impacted by inflation?\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks. Early days. Obviously, as you mentioned, we\u2019ve had a lot of experience taking quite significant price increases around the world, particularly as we went through periods of significant foreign exchange headwinds. As I mentioned earlier, I think the big difference here is that the price increases are coming across the entire market in all categories. And as a result, you tend to see a little less elasticity when that happens. But we\u2019re very prepared for that. As I mentioned earlier, very cognizant of our promotional cadence in terms of how to balance that, very cognizant of our need to bring value to our innovations to ensure that the pricing is executed successfully. But we feel pretty good about at least what we\u2019ve seen in early days again, relative to elasticity, time will tell. But my sense is we will be able to weather this quite well given the whole market is moving, and we have a strong innovation and promotional strategy in place to continue to ensure the consumer is valued.\nOperator: Up next, we will take a question from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. Can you just expand a bit on the pricing actions in North America? I know it\u2019s been asked, but perhaps in the context of the margin for the business in the quarter, obviously remains under pressure. And maybe loop into there how the productivity program for 2022 can potentially help that business. Do you think that with pricing coming with productivity coming with expectations around inflation getting a little bit better in the back half of the year that, that division from a margin standpoint can also improve along with the organic sales as some of the comps that have normalized and pricing builds?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. So, we announced pricing in some of our Personal Care categories late last year, which took effect in the middle of this quarter. The balance of our categories have been announced and will take effect as we move into the second quarter. So, that\u2019s clearly the cadence that we see relative to pricing. Funding the growth relative to the North American business is typically pretty directional across every quarter. As I mentioned, we have mobilized specific teams in North America and in other regions to accelerate some of our funding the growth initiatives. Bear in mind that as we are dealing with the challenges around the supply chain that we want to ensure that we are finding time dedicated time to deliver funding the growth. When we produce against the demand that we have, we obviously don\u2019t want to shut our lines down to test funding the growth initiatives so we are finding alternative ways to do that. On top of that, as you mentioned, the productivity initiative, which will be a global initiative, will impact across more regions. There is not one specific region that we are targeting specifically on that. All the regions will be contributing based on the opportunities that we have identified. So, you will see pricing move through in the second quarter, funding the growth consistent across the year. And we believe quite confident that margins will begin to accelerate as we move into the back half of \u201822.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hey, good morning folks. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Hi Jason.\nJason English: Congrats on your success as you are accelerating Oral Care and delivering another rock solid year in Pet Care. Based on results and what we see in the market and where we hear you spend your time and energy on calls like this, it feels like you may be neglecting the Palmolive side of the Colgate-Palmolive business. Well, P&G is out there clearly spending a lot on advertising, they are innovating a lot and they seem to be executing quite well. First, do you think I am being too harsh here, or do you see some truth in this? And second, and I guess either way, can you share some of your initiatives and investments you have got planned for this business this year? And how they may compare or contrast to what you have been doing in the last couple of years? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Jason. So listen, we had, obviously, really strong performance in \u201821 \u2013 excuse me, in \u201820 across our liquid hand soap, our Personal Care categories, which include Palmolive overseas as well as our Home Care categories here in North America. Obviously, that \u2013 those categories, as I mentioned earlier, are falling off quite significantly, but we believe have stabilized and will provide more continuity as we move forward. We had some challenges, obviously, getting some of the innovation executed what we wanted to do. Obviously, that\u2019s had a short-term impact. But we feel very good about the plans we have in place in terms of not only getting the pricing through the category, but making sure that we continue to deliver an entrepreneurial approach to these businesses because we have isolated pockets of strength, North America being one, Latin America being another, where we find the opportunities on the ground that we can execute against. So overall, we feel good about it. We know some of our competitors are spending significant money in these categories. As we talked about earlier, we have increased advertising in the \u201822 plan. That will support all of our key priorities mainly Oral Care as well as Hill\u2019s, but we will look selectively in some of our core markets to ensure that we have competitive spending levels to address some of the softness that we saw this year coming out of a very robust 2020.\nOperator: Up next, we will take a question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I have a follow-up question on pricing. Two areas, please. On the elasticities, which I think Steve spoke to and then on pricing ladder specifically. So, number one, on elasticities, just to drill down a little bit because I think the general view would be that the elasticities have been better than expected, at least so far. So, if we do see a mean reversion on elasticities, could that represent downside potentially to your outlook, or have you already sort of reflected that? So, I think additional commentary there would be helpful. And then also to an earlier question, just on the state of consumer. My question is on sort of your pricing ladders, I guess at this point and the potential for consumer trade down to mid-tier value brands or even private label. Have you included some elements of that or not really and that\u2019s just something that the company will have to react to and could potentially result in some negative mix implications whether this is around lower-priced brands or additional promo, etcetera? So, just maybe drilling down on those two areas would be helpful. Thank you for that.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, Kevin. So again, let\u2019s talk to pricing elasticity. It\u2019s early days right now, as I mentioned. But we expect that we will not see as much pricing elasticity in our business, specifically our own business, as we have seen in the past, given that everyone is taking pricing, it seems pretty consistently across all of our categories and across the world. Time will tell on that, clearly. The elasticity assumptions that we built into the P&L are quite conservative. I mean we wanted to be very careful there to ensure that we were able to adjust and have enough flex in the P&L based on how we saw the consumers react. So, my sense is we are covered there, but we shall watch this carefully to ensure that our assumptions are accurate. And we will pivot as necessary as we see what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. As I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s not only just taking pricing, it\u2019s how we go about executing that in the market relative to our promotional cadence, relative to our new product cadence. And that really fits into the second part of your question, which is the pricing ladder. One of the aspects of our business that we feel very good about is how we have clear distinction at price tiers and value add across the multiple price tiers in which we compete. And we have innovation planned across all those price tiers. Innovation that will not only get us pricing, but brings value add to the consumer should there be any temptation to trade down, particularly in the premium side of the business. But the important piece there is that we are looking to innovate across all of our price tiers to ensure that we continue to bring value to those consumers as they address obviously, a significant headwind around inflation in their markets.\nOperator: We will now hear from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. I wanted to go back and revisit the productivity initiative a little bit. Kind of just taking a bigger step back, I know obviously, when you came in as CEO, there was a little bit of a margin reset as you decided you needed to reinvest in the business, and that\u2019s worked really well because the top line has come in for the last few years in line with your goals. But we have seen margins under pressure, and I know there is COVID and currency and obviously commodities and logistics and all of that. But just kind of longer term, I guess my question is, how do you feel about the kind of 22%, 23% operating margin level for the company? Is that the right level? How much of the global productivity initiative savings this year are going to be reinvested versus drop to the bottom line? And give us the margin expansion and kind of all related to that, and I am sorry for the long question, again, back to Laurence\u2019s point, it\u2019s really unusual for us to see just a 1-year initiative. And I think that\u2019s probably good news because it\u2019s not that disruptive to the organization. But bad news if you have to have multiple of these. And so I am wondering, is this really just a one-off, or do you sort of say, \u201cOh, we might have more in \u201823. We might have more in \u201824.\u201d Just a little bit more color to sort of say, what\u2019s the goal here? Is this margin expansion, or is this cost of business has gone up and we just need to keep reinvesting? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Wendy. It\u2019s kind of all of the above. But let me take a step back for a moment. Obviously, we came out of a pretty significant restructuring program that ended in 2019, the better part of 5 years to 6 years of that. And as we have obviously started to think about our 2025 strategic plan, it\u2019s only good business to continue to look for ways to optimize. We have made a lot of changes in the organization around our structure around innovation, our digital transformation, our back-office centers, how we are thinking about SAP S/4HANA, how we are thinking about our manufacturing footprint and our manufacturing strategy moving forward. All of those are the right things to do to continue to drive efficiency across the business and ensure that we continue to execute against our strategies. So, this is a very focused program. We believe \u2013 I mean it was in response to what we needed to deliver for our 2025 plan to get ahead of this even faster. I mentioned earlier, our overhead structure is pretty well managed right now. You saw overheads down, our fixed costs down in 2021. You saw them down quite considerably in the fourth quarter. That bodes well for us as we move into \u201822, but we need to continue to optimize and reallocate resources into the key growth priorities we have across the company. And you have seen some of those growth priorities. Obviously, the advertising piece has been a key driver of our top line sustained momentum. And our intention, as we laid out in \u201822, is to accelerate that advertising, not only across Oral Care and Pet Nutrition business, but our skin health and some of the other categories that I mentioned earlier in the discussion. So again, we intend to reinvest most of this money, but we want to have levers available to us as we go through the year. We brought Stan in. A big purpose of bringing Stan in was not only his technology background to help us with our transformation, but to help us think about where we can optimize our structure going forward. So, why don\u2019t I turn it over to Stan, and let him share a couple of his thoughts on this.\nStan Sutula: Wendy, first of all, thanks for the question. As we look at gross profit, last year, certainly a great year benefited from COVID-driven categories. But where we landed in 2021 on a full year, I think it\u2019s important for a little bit of context, that\u2019s equal to where we were pre-pandemic. So, it hasn\u2019t fallen off from those levels. There is obviously a big mix impact from the categories that drive that. But this productivity program will help us accelerate our actions through our 2025 strategy. We think they are in the right places. Again, there will be timing here, these will start to benefit us in the back half of the year. And on annualized rate, $90 million to $110 million is a meaningful number. Now behind that, on the split of what goes to the bottom line versus what goes back into the business, we have some flexibility there. But part of this is going to get invested back into the business. As we have said, we want to continue to drive the long-term health of these categories and the long-term health of the business. So, the margin as we went through the year, obviously, wrapped on a very difficult compare, but we are confident in our ability to drive margin expansion in 2022.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks Wendy.\nOperator: Up next, we will take a question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. I wanted to follow up on that question. Can you hear me?\nNoel Wallace: Yes, I can. Go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Sorry. So, I wanted to follow-up on that question and just think about it on a longer-term basis. What is the right level of EBIT margin for the business over time? If you take a look, over the last decade, it\u2019s roughly flat, I guess the puts and takes on input costs, FX, etcetera. But in absolute, investors expected to increase over time, given what you said about increasing investment. There is less balanced growth, especially if you look this year with pet driving majority of growth. You cut ad spend in the fourth quarter as an example. And obviously, we see increasing competition coming from standalone consumer healthcare companies like GSK and J&J. So, just conceptually, how do we think about this, or how do you think about it? If we look out to your 2025 targets, obviously, not having specific targets there, but can EBIT margins grow over time? And how should we all think about that?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Listen, ultimately, our goal is to continue to drive EBIT margins up. And if you think about what we are trying to execute and what we have executed over the last couple of years, notwithstanding obviously some of the setbacks related to COVID, it\u2019s accelerating our priority categories. It\u2019s the Oral Care acceleration. We will grow EBIT margins over time. Accelerating Pet Care, Premium Pet Nutrition, likewise. The Skin Health businesses, we continue to be very committed to those. All margin accretive to the bottom line of the company. So obviously, driving an improved mix in getting those three categories continuing to drive the top line of the company will ultimately deliver more EBIT margin. But we have to be proactive. I mean we are proactive in taking, obviously, the pricing we just discussed. We have to be proactive in ensuring that we have the resources internally to optimize our media spend. We will talk a little bit about that at CAGNY, some of the great work that we are doing around driving ROI more efficiently across our advertising spend. Now that may allow us to spend more against some of the opportunities we see or optimize our spending as we move forward. Likewise, as we talked about earlier \u2013 most of the call today is the pricing aspect of this. And we will continue to be bold and ambitious with our pricing because we believe getting the gross margin in the P&L, ultimately, the EBIT up is the way to continue to fuel the investment that we need to sustain the top line growth. So ultimately, the goal is to drive EBIT margins. Obviously, some challenges in the short-term that we have seen. But we think as we execute against our 2025 strategy, the category that we compete in today, the pricing, the innovation that we have in place, all will contribute to that. The program that we announced is all part of that, obviously, looking at ways to optimize our structure to ensure that we find ways to improve the profitability through the income statement.\nOperator: And our last question today comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. First, just a couple of follow-ups and then my real question. So, just on the U.S. Oral Care business, can you talk \u2013 can you dimensionalize kind of what the gap was between shipments and retail? And what that impact was maybe as a percentage? And then I guess related, maybe give us a sense of how much the U.S. Oral Care market grew in 2021? And then can you also may be put a little finer point on terms of the magnitude of the U.S. pricing that you are putting in. A lot of adjectives around it, but are we talking mid-single digit, healthy mid-single digit, high-single digit, double digit, just kind of a little bit of sense on that. So, those are just the follow-ups. And then the real question is really can you go into China a little bit. We haven\u2019t talked about that much today. In prior calls, there was some discussion of some disruptions that happened in some of the distribution tiers. I would love to understand a little bit how that developed in the quarter. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Okay. Thanks, Rob and good morning. Listen, on the pricing, I can\u2019t be really any more specific than what I provided you earlier. Obviously, we have announced pricing in some categories in the fourth quarter in North America. We are taking the bulk of our categories were announced and will be effective in the second quarter and consistent with where we see inflation and our needs to continue to grow gross margins that really dictates the level of pricing that we take and where we think we can take it with list prices, and how we do it through our revenue growth management initiatives and how do we do it through our innovation strategy. So, it\u2019s a well thought through approach to ensuring that we are getting the right pricing across the price tiers, able to drive value to the consumer through our innovation, and making sure that we balance that with our promotional cadence. And ultimately, we will see we have \u2013 we do the opposite kind of visibility to where our competitors are taking pricing. We do this in isolation. And we do it based on what we think is right for our business. And we adjust accordingly, moving forward. On China specifically, great success in China, in fact and I think we are still in the early days of that. We saw the Colgate business respond really nicely to a very distinct change in our strategy in that market, not only our go-to-market approach, but more importantly, our innovation approach to really go after the premium side of the market. In e-commerce, e-commerce is now 25% to 30% of the category. And we are the fastest growing brand in e-commerce right now. And that is all at a index of about 2.5x to the market average. So, it really is premium innovation that\u2019s driving our success there. We have got more work to do. We have got some opportunities in the brick-and-mortar environment. We have seen that share stabilize. And so the incremental growth has mainly come through online. And we see as we think about our distribution model moving forward some ways to optimize that. We are taking an important step with our Hawley & Hazel brand in 2022 with Hawley. We have got good innovation and good support levels for that business, to continue to accelerate that. So, we feel pretty good about China. Now, China obviously, the category has been quite sluggish. I mean the brick-and-mortar category was actually down, whereas e-commerce was up. This was really driven by the lack of mobility in the marketplace that we have seen over the last year and the lockdowns that we have seen across that market in different provinces. And that has certainly had an impact on consumption. So, things have slowed a bit. But I think as we move into \u201822 and knock on wood that COVID continues to moderate. We will see obviously, that category rebound nicely and where we believe in a much stronger position to capitalize on that and we were before.\nOperator: And that\u2019s all the questions we have in the queue. I will turn the conference back to the speakers for additional or closing remarks.\nNoel Wallace: Well, thanks everyone. So, let me close by extending my deepest gratitude to all the Colgate people that are listening today and those that aren\u2019t their resilience and their care and managing through just an extraordinary environment in 2021, which was obviously continue to be disrupted by the challenges of COVID are nothing, but impressive. For staying so focused on the innovation, our revenue growth management initiatives, as well as the brand building plans had accelerated and sustained top line growth for the company and continued to deliver strong results, so my gratitude and appreciation to all the Colgate people and thanks everyone. I will see you at CAGNY.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning everyone. Before I get into my remarks, I want to wish all of you a safe and happy new year. Of course, I will be speaking to you all again just a few weeks for CAGNY and I am very much looking forward to that. Over the last 3 years, we have revitalized our core businesses, innovative and adjacent categories and expanded our availability in faster growth markets and channels. All these efforts have helped us deliver 3 straight years of organic sales growth in or above our long-term targeted range of 3% to 5%. I believe our company is well-positioned to continue our momentum and drive shareholder value in this year and beyond despite the difficult operating environment. We compete in growing categories with high purchase frequency, daily usage and high levels of brand loyalty and we have strong brands that are well-positioned to take advantage of these category dynamics. Colgate is the most penetrated consumer brand in the world, with strength across emerging and developed markets. Hill's Prescription Diet and Hill's Science Diet have strong health credentials with vets and pet parents. Elmex and Meridol are leading premium brands and therapeutics in the markets in which they compete. And other brands like Irish Spring, Protex, Suavitel and Fabuloso, all delivered tremendous value to consumers and our retail partners. This also includes our skin health businesses, EltaMD, PCA Skin and Filorga. John discussed the impact of COVID-19 on Filorga, which resulted in performance below our targets. We have plans in place to revitalize our Filorga business in those key channels, along with building out distribution and other growth channels and accelerating innovation. We are confident that Filorga will be a strong contributor to future top and bottom line growth. Trends on EltaMD and PCA Skin remained very strong. We have and are building capabilities that will allow us to compete in all types of markets and channels. Our global operating model, including our supply chain, allows us to operate effectively and profitably in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Our transition to our new innovation strategy has enabled us to deliver a better mixture of global and local innovation, including increased levels of breakthrough and transformational innovation. This has had a direct impact on accelerating our growth, particularly in Oral Care, our rebound in China e-commerce, for example and accelerated growth in Pet Nutrition. Our digital transformation, which will be an important topic when we present to you at CAGNY, has allowed us to accelerate our e-commerce efforts across all of our markets. We delivered another year of robust e-commerce growth and grew share in all 6 of our largest e-commerce toothpaste markets in 2021. And we are truly integrating ESG into our business strategy in ways that drive value. Bright Smiles, Bright Futures not only teaches children in underserved markets how to brush their teeth, but also help drive per capita consumption over time. And our recyclable toothpaste 2, which we shared the technology with our competitors, is helping to drive the entire category to be more sustainable, which is a requirement for any category to deliver growth in the future. We also issued our first sustainability bond in the fourth quarter. We will use the funds to invest in our sustainability and social impact strategies while benefiting from a lower interest rate. So, I firmly believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth to our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. But we also need to balance managing through the teeth of a very difficult operating environment while still delivering on that long-term strategy. We stay committed to our strategy. We will emerge from the next few quarters with sustained organic sales growth and a structurally more efficient company that will allow us to grow profits, while still investing in our brands. Obviously, you all know about the headwinds that companies are facing in today's operating environment in terms of raw materials. COVID and higher costs are putting significant pressure on supply chains, including unprecedented impacts on logistics, both in terms of efficiency and costs. And recently, the dollar has strengthened. The key for us to deliver against our targets in the shorter term is to continue to execute on pricing and revenue growth management. We have already taken pricing in many markets and we will have further significant pricing plan for the first half of this year, including moving some pricing that we anticipated for later in the year in 2022 into the first half. You all know our funding the growth is well-ingrained and a key component of offsetting rising raw material costs. We have put together new cross-functional teams that are focused on ensuring we are bringing additional opportunities to our funding the growth and that we are executing them as rapidly as possible. So, we are accelerating short-term actions to drive improved profitability, but we know the key to shareholder value creation is to remain committed to the long-term. To that end, we will continue to invest in brand building. As I said a few minutes ago, it all starts with strong brands. We have turned our growth trajectory around over the past few years and a key component of this has been additional advertising spend. Our guidance for 2022 includes an increase in advertising to make sure we are able to sustain volume growth as we exit a period of very strong pricing. At CAGNY, you will hear even more about how we have increased the return on marketing spend through our digital transformation. We will continue to focus on innovation, providing added value to our consumers through innovation that supports increased pricing. Our innovation pipeline is very strong for the year and heading into next. We have innovation across our categories with a particular focus on premium innovation that brings new benefits and forms to our brands. We are also investing in capacity. Our CapEx rose in 2021, primarily because we are investing in incremental capacity for growth, along with investments to advance our sustainability efforts. Our need to build capacity across the business, mostly in Pet Nutrition, shows that the rebound in organic sales growth is real and when we expect to continue. This investment won't preclude us from continuing to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And finally today, we announced a productivity initiative that is focused on aligning our costs and investments with our long-term strategies. This program is designed to deliver savings that can both be reinvested for growth and apply to the bottom line. Importantly, this program, along with the pricing and funding the growth, should allow us to exit this inflationary cycle with more levers to drive growth and profitability and keep our strategy on track. So, 2022 will be another volatile year with all the headwinds you heard me described, but we intend to execute to deliver growth and drive shareholder value, all with delivering against our long-term strategies, which makes me very excited about the future for our company. And with that, I will open it up to your questions. Good morning, Dara. Yes. Thanks, Dara. So as you heard in some of the prepared comments, Oral Care accelerated in 2021. In fact, it was double the growth rate that we had in 2020. Our consumption exceeded shipments in most markets, and that was a function of some of the supply chain challenges that we incurred, particularly here in North America as well as in Asia. So if I walk around the world, really strong back half performance in Europe. In fact, we're at record shares on the toothpaste business exiting the fourth quarter there. You heard John mentioned the strong growth we're seeing in China, which was obviously a key market for us to get turned around in the last couple of years. Our e-commerce shares are up very, very strongly. They are close to 400 basis points and the fastest consumer brand in the market. Our brick-and-mortar shares are holding. So overall, we're delivering share growth there. Latin America Holding, as we talked about, we've been very much on driving revenue growth management in those markets and have some great success, particularly in markets like Brazil. And we're trying to resist just chasing some of the promotional volume at the lower end of the market, which has lost some of our volume share. But overall, we feel very good about where we are, particularly around the premiumization. North America, while we exited strong, we're still not satisfied with the performance there. Clearly, we believe we have significant opportunities there. The innovation plans we have in place for 2022 reflect our commitment to that market as well as the increased advertising support, particularly around the premiumization strategy and we expect to see shares rebuild nicely in 2022. But satisfied at least that the fourth quarter and some of the back half activities that we put in place to be more competitive, have certainly stabilized the share, and now it's about growing. As we mentioned, some of our untracked channels continue to perform very well in Oral Care, in the U.S., particularly the club channel as well as e-commerce. We don't talk a lot about toothbrushes, but that business had a really good year for our share growth is up in toothpaste \u2013 excuse me, in toothbrushes across most markets, and some good innovation likewise coming on that. That will be coupled obviously with strong pricing. I'm sure we will get into a lot of discussion on that, but we have taken pricing in emerging markets. We are rolling aggressive pricing in developed markets, and that will continue to bolster share and our ability to support the brand moving forward. So overall, we're pleased with Oral Care, Dara. Hi, Peter. Sure. So let \u2013 I guess to start with raw materials there. Obviously, we saw a significant acceleration in raw material prices following the first quarter in 2021. That continued to escalate as we went through the year. And certainly, based on where we thought we were in the third quarter, we saw significant increases moving into the fourth quarter. In fact, resins up more or less 50%, our tablet price is up 30% to 40% in the fourth quarter. So all of that is now built into how we're thinking about \u201822, and we expect raw materials, quite frankly, to peak in the first quarter. We have developed our plans based on spot rates today, and we expect the spot rates to hold and begin to moderate towards the back half of 2022. So you see raw materials potentially peak in the first quarter and then stabilize and begin to potentially moderate in the back half. You layer on top of that our pricing strategies for the year. We took some pricing in the fourth quarter in emerging markets. We took more pricing in the developed markets in the first quarter, which will mostly take effect as we exit the first quarter into second quarter. We've got, obviously, the additional productivity programs that we talked about this morning, that will be very back half weighted more in the end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter and into \u201823. So we won't see much benefit this year, particularly in the first half. So \u2013 and you combine that likewise with an innovation plan that is weighted more towards the premium side, particularly in North America in the first quarter. And all of that will help us lead to growing margins as we go through the year and exiting the year with margins up. Hi, Lauren. Yes. Thanks, Lauren. I think the key word you use is really trying to be proactive. I mean we came into this year after the first quarter, noticing, obviously, an environment that was becoming more challenging, particularly around COVID and disruptions associated with that as it then obviously led into a significant inflationary environment and we got out ahead of this as quickly as we could to start thinking about our 2025 strategy and ultimately, what we were trying to achieve and how we wanted to accelerate. We've seen a lot of great progress in our digital transformation. We've seen a lot of great progress as we've restructured our innovation groups around the world towards breakthrough and transformational innovation and the benefits we're seeing coming out of that. And we decided we really wanted to accelerate that transformation and make sure that we get that savings into the business as quickly as possible as well as the benefits of how we structure ourselves to be more agile and faster to market, the benefits we get out of increased resources in the digital space as well as the innovation. Now bear in mind, as you heard from John, we had a really good year around controlling our overheads, and we have been constantly looking at ways to mitigate the inflationary pricing we're seeing in the market. Our overheads were down on the year, down considerably in the fourth quarter. And I think that's just good business. We're constantly looking for ways to optimize how we operate. On top of that, we want to look at how we structure ourselves to really continue to accelerate the growth momentum that we have. So as we move throughout the year, we will exit this program. As you said, it's a one-year program with the savings really falling into the back half of 2022 and into the first half of \u201823. It allowed us to really fine-tune where we wanted to focus and allowed us to do that in the 12-month period, and we think that's ultimately right for the business to ensure that we don't have ongoing distractions across the organization, and we get on with trying to accomplish what we've set out to do for the year and into \u201823. On the regional point that you were mentioning, Lauren, listen, as you've heard from everyone, the supply chain challenges everyone faces are quite significant. And it really, to a certain extent, depends on the structure and composition of your supply chain. We have had, as you know, one of the most efficient supply chains in the world in terms of how we've optimized our global sourcing all around the world and how we put capital into ensuring that we have extremely low-cost plants. We will benefit from that long-term to be sure. In the short-term, given some of the disruptions that we've seen both in Asia as well as here in North America, we've had to deal with that. And that has brought some additional costs and obviously, as you heard, some disruption to the top line of the business as well, likewise, no question into the market share. So we're moving to get through those as we go into \u201822, and we feel very confident in where we are with our supply chain and the changes that we're making, particularly in the productivity initiative to continue to optimize that moving forward. Good morning, Steve. Sure. So let me talk a little bit about Oral Care. Obviously, in the prepared remarks, you saw that the fourth quarter was driven by Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. So overall, quite pleased. And that was despite some disruptions that we saw in the quarter. The shutdowns that we talked about in the third quarter had a more material impact in the fourth quarter. That was about 60 basis points of growth to the total company in the fourth quarter, and all of that would have been in Oral Care, so to speak. So we're moving behind those. We see a little bit more disruption in the first quarter but we have a pretty good line of sight that by the second quarter and throughout the balance of the year, we will be back to where we need to get to be on that. So overall, Oral Care was good. I mentioned the strong exiting the market shares in Europe, which were very, very strong. We stabilized the shares in North America and actually saw some all outlet growth in the fourth quarter, driven by untracked channels, which was terrific. And we're particularly pleased with the reception to our new products in 2022 that we've introduced as well as the acceptance of the pricing across North America. So we're quite confident in terms of where we're \u2013 how we're setting ourselves up for continued growth in \u201822. You had a question on price volume, and I'll address the Latin America question within that. Obviously, there is going to be more price in our organic growth in \u201822 versus volume given the significant increases that we're taking across the world. And as I mentioned, we began taking pricing at the end of the fourth quarter. We have implemented and announced pricing across the emerging markets here in the first quarter, which will take effect, as I mentioned earlier, in the early part of the second quarter. But no question, given the size of the pricing that we're taking around the world, and you're seeing that from ourselves as well as competitors in other categories, you will see a falloff in volume. And we're accustomed to that. Relative to how we think about our promotional cadence and how we think about our innovation plans as well to ensure that we continue to build volume through the balance of the year. So the makeup of the organic growth this year, no question will be driven more by price than by volume, which is a little bit different than what we've seen in historical years. I'll say that all boats rise in this environment in the sense that everyone is impacted by the inflationary environment. So as a result, you're going to see pricing up pretty consistently across all categories. That plays, as you've heard from others, into elasticity that you're not seeing one competitor move, you're seeing the category move. So elasticity tends to be a little bit less. We will see. It's early days now. But our experience, as you well know, Steve, of taking pricing quite significantly to offset foreign exchange in markets around the world. We have been able to balance that elasticity impact with good innovation and good promotional cadence, understanding how to ensure we're innovating across the price tiers and making sure that we're protecting the consumer and the category growth at the same time. Latin America had a really strong quarter. Bear in mind, they had a strong comp that they were dealing with. So the 2-year stack looks terrific. I think it was about 16%, if I remember correctly and obviously, 6% on top of 11% a year ago and largely driven by pricing. So, a little bit soft in the volume line as we took some pricing but we fully expect that that will recover itself. Categories continue to be quite healthy in Latin America, mid single-digit growth and the consumer seems to be responding to at least in the short-term, but we will watch that carefully as we move through \u201822. Sure. Andrea, let me take your second question first because I think, to a certain extent, it addresses some of the earlier commentary on the quarter. Bear in mind that we had strong growth in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. We were lapping significant category growth in Personal Care and Home Care that obviously paralleled our growth last year, given some of the impacts of COVID. Liquid hand soap, as a category in \u201821 was down roughly 25%. Likewise, you saw that level of growth as a category in the fourth quarter as well. Some of our home products \u2013 our cleaning products were down 15% to 20% as a category as well. So no question that had an impact in the quarter. But we've seen that kind of starting to stabilize and our sense is as we move into \u201822, those categories have hopefully bottomed out relative to consumption. John mentioned that we shipped above \u2013 consumption was above shipments, and that was due to a certain extent to the continued constraints around logistics, the challenge of getting trailers not only around the country, but across borders, either from Mexico or otherwise. Some of the challenges that we had and the shutdowns and plants across Asia that we mentioned earlier, that obviously had an impact on the North America number as well. But as I said, we're moving through those. We think we will be out of that by the end of the quarter. We're taking the necessary steps, as I mentioned earlier, to ensure that our supply chain continues to operate as efficiently as possible. We will make a couple of changes relative to sourcing. That has obviously created a little headwind in terms of cost. But overall, we feel good about at least the plan in place, to address some of the short-term issues that we face. We will see the benefit of that as we refill the pipeline to a certain extent moving through the back half of the year. Yes, thanks. Early days. Obviously, as you mentioned, we've had a lot of experience taking quite significant price increases around the world, particularly as we went through periods of significant foreign exchange headwinds. As I mentioned earlier, I think the big difference here is that the price increases are coming across the entire market in all categories. And as a result, you tend to see a little less elasticity when that happens. But we're very prepared for that. As I mentioned earlier, very cognizant of our promotional cadence in terms of how to balance that, very cognizant of our need to bring value to our innovations to ensure that the pricing is executed successfully. But we feel pretty good about at least what we've seen in early days again, relative to elasticity, time will tell. But my sense is we will be able to weather this quite well given the whole market is moving, and we have a strong innovation and promotional strategy in place to continue to ensure the consumer is valued. Sure. So, we announced pricing in some of our Personal Care categories late last year, which took effect in the middle of this quarter. The balance of our categories have been announced and will take effect as we move into the second quarter. So, that's clearly the cadence that we see relative to pricing. Funding the growth relative to the North American business is typically pretty directional across every quarter. As I mentioned, we have mobilized specific teams in North America and in other regions to accelerate some of our funding the growth initiatives. Bear in mind that as we are dealing with the challenges around the supply chain that we want to ensure that we are finding time dedicated time to deliver funding the growth. When we produce against the demand that we have, we obviously don't want to shut our lines down to test funding the growth initiatives so we are finding alternative ways to do that. On top of that, as you mentioned, the productivity initiative, which will be a global initiative, will impact across more regions. There is not one specific region that we are targeting specifically on that. All the regions will be contributing based on the opportunities that we have identified. So, you will see pricing move through in the second quarter, funding the growth consistent across the year. And we believe quite confident that margins will begin to accelerate as we move into the back half of \u201822. Hi Jason. Yes. Thanks, Jason. So listen, we had, obviously, really strong performance in \u201821 \u2013 excuse me, in \u201820 across our liquid hand soap, our Personal Care categories, which include Palmolive overseas as well as our Home Care categories here in North America. Obviously, that \u2013 those categories, as I mentioned earlier, are falling off quite significantly, but we believe have stabilized and will provide more continuity as we move forward. We had some challenges, obviously, getting some of the innovation executed what we wanted to do. Obviously, that's had a short-term impact. But we feel very good about the plans we have in place in terms of not only getting the pricing through the category, but making sure that we continue to deliver an entrepreneurial approach to these businesses because we have isolated pockets of strength, North America being one, Latin America being another, where we find the opportunities on the ground that we can execute against. So overall, we feel good about it. We know some of our competitors are spending significant money in these categories. As we talked about earlier, we have increased advertising in the \u201822 plan. That will support all of our key priorities mainly Oral Care as well as Hill's, but we will look selectively in some of our core markets to ensure that we have competitive spending levels to address some of the softness that we saw this year coming out of a very robust 2020. Sure, Kevin. So again, let's talk to pricing elasticity. It's early days right now, as I mentioned. But we expect that we will not see as much pricing elasticity in our business, specifically our own business, as we have seen in the past, given that everyone is taking pricing, it seems pretty consistently across all of our categories and across the world. Time will tell on that, clearly. The elasticity assumptions that we built into the P&L are quite conservative. I mean we wanted to be very careful there to ensure that we were able to adjust and have enough flex in the P&L based on how we saw the consumers react. So, my sense is we are covered there, but we shall watch this carefully to ensure that our assumptions are accurate. And we will pivot as necessary as we see what's happening in the marketplace. As I mentioned earlier, it's not only just taking pricing, it's how we go about executing that in the market relative to our promotional cadence, relative to our new product cadence. And that really fits into the second part of your question, which is the pricing ladder. One of the aspects of our business that we feel very good about is how we have clear distinction at price tiers and value add across the multiple price tiers in which we compete. And we have innovation planned across all those price tiers. Innovation that will not only get us pricing, but brings value add to the consumer should there be any temptation to trade down, particularly in the premium side of the business. But the important piece there is that we are looking to innovate across all of our price tiers to ensure that we continue to bring value to those consumers as they address obviously, a significant headwind around inflation in their markets. Sure. Thanks, Wendy. It's kind of all of the above. But let me take a step back for a moment. Obviously, we came out of a pretty significant restructuring program that ended in 2019, the better part of 5 years to 6 years of that. And as we have obviously started to think about our 2025 strategic plan, it's only good business to continue to look for ways to optimize. We have made a lot of changes in the organization around our structure around innovation, our digital transformation, our back-office centers, how we are thinking about SAP S/4HANA, how we are thinking about our manufacturing footprint and our manufacturing strategy moving forward. All of those are the right things to do to continue to drive efficiency across the business and ensure that we continue to execute against our strategies. So, this is a very focused program. We believe \u2013 I mean it was in response to what we needed to deliver for our 2025 plan to get ahead of this even faster. I mentioned earlier, our overhead structure is pretty well managed right now. You saw overheads down, our fixed costs down in 2021. You saw them down quite considerably in the fourth quarter. That bodes well for us as we move into \u201822, but we need to continue to optimize and reallocate resources into the key growth priorities we have across the company. And you have seen some of those growth priorities. Obviously, the advertising piece has been a key driver of our top line sustained momentum. And our intention, as we laid out in \u201822, is to accelerate that advertising, not only across Oral Care and Pet Nutrition business, but our skin health and some of the other categories that I mentioned earlier in the discussion. So again, we intend to reinvest most of this money, but we want to have levers available to us as we go through the year. We brought Stan in. A big purpose of bringing Stan in was not only his technology background to help us with our transformation, but to help us think about where we can optimize our structure going forward. So, why don't I turn it over to Stan, and let him share a couple of his thoughts on this. Thanks Wendy. Yes, I can. Go ahead. Yes. Listen, ultimately, our goal is to continue to drive EBIT margins up. And if you think about what we are trying to execute and what we have executed over the last couple of years, notwithstanding obviously some of the setbacks related to COVID, it's accelerating our priority categories. It's the Oral Care acceleration. We will grow EBIT margins over time. Accelerating Pet Care, Premium Pet Nutrition, likewise. The Skin Health businesses, we continue to be very committed to those. All margin accretive to the bottom line of the company. So obviously, driving an improved mix in getting those three categories continuing to drive the top line of the company will ultimately deliver more EBIT margin. But we have to be proactive. I mean we are proactive in taking, obviously, the pricing we just discussed. We have to be proactive in ensuring that we have the resources internally to optimize our media spend. We will talk a little bit about that at CAGNY, some of the great work that we are doing around driving ROI more efficiently across our advertising spend. Now that may allow us to spend more against some of the opportunities we see or optimize our spending as we move forward. Likewise, as we talked about earlier \u2013 most of the call today is the pricing aspect of this. And we will continue to be bold and ambitious with our pricing because we believe getting the gross margin in the P&L, ultimately, the EBIT up is the way to continue to fuel the investment that we need to sustain the top line growth. So ultimately, the goal is to drive EBIT margins. Obviously, some challenges in the short-term that we have seen. But we think as we execute against our 2025 strategy, the category that we compete in today, the pricing, the innovation that we have in place, all will contribute to that. The program that we announced is all part of that, obviously, looking at ways to optimize our structure to ensure that we find ways to improve the profitability through the income statement. Okay. Thanks, Rob and good morning. Listen, on the pricing, I can't be really any more specific than what I provided you earlier. Obviously, we have announced pricing in some categories in the fourth quarter in North America. We are taking the bulk of our categories were announced and will be effective in the second quarter and consistent with where we see inflation and our needs to continue to grow gross margins that really dictates the level of pricing that we take and where we think we can take it with list prices, and how we do it through our revenue growth management initiatives and how do we do it through our innovation strategy. So, it's a well thought through approach to ensuring that we are getting the right pricing across the price tiers, able to drive value to the consumer through our innovation, and making sure that we balance that with our promotional cadence. And ultimately, we will see we have \u2013 we do the opposite kind of visibility to where our competitors are taking pricing. We do this in isolation. And we do it based on what we think is right for our business. And we adjust accordingly, moving forward. On China specifically, great success in China, in fact and I think we are still in the early days of that. We saw the Colgate business respond really nicely to a very distinct change in our strategy in that market, not only our go-to-market approach, but more importantly, our innovation approach to really go after the premium side of the market. In e-commerce, e-commerce is now 25% to 30% of the category. And we are the fastest growing brand in e-commerce right now. And that is all at a index of about 2.5x to the market average. So, it really is premium innovation that's driving our success there. We have got more work to do. We have got some opportunities in the brick-and-mortar environment. We have seen that share stabilize. And so the incremental growth has mainly come through online. And we see as we think about our distribution model moving forward some ways to optimize that. We are taking an important step with our Hawley & Hazel brand in 2022 with Hawley. We have got good innovation and good support levels for that business, to continue to accelerate that. So, we feel pretty good about China. Now, China obviously, the category has been quite sluggish. I mean the brick-and-mortar category was actually down, whereas e-commerce was up. This was really driven by the lack of mobility in the marketplace that we have seen over the last year and the lockdowns that we have seen across that market in different provinces. And that has certainly had an impact on consumption. So, things have slowed a bit. But I think as we move into \u201822 and knock on wood that COVID continues to moderate. We will see obviously, that category rebound nicely and where we believe in a much stronger position to capitalize on that and we were before. Well, thanks everyone. So, let me close by extending my deepest gratitude to all the Colgate people that are listening today and those that aren't their resilience and their care and managing through just an extraordinary environment in 2021, which was obviously continue to be disrupted by the challenges of COVID are nothing, but impressive. For staying so focused on the innovation, our revenue growth management initiatives, as well as the brand building plans had accelerated and sustained top line growth for the company and continued to deliver strong results, so my gratitude and appreciation to all the Colgate people and thanks everyone. I will see you at CAGNY."

            "content": "Wendy, first of all, thanks for the question. As we look at gross profit, last year, certainly a great year benefited from COVID-driven categories. But where we landed in 2021 on a full year, I think it's important for a little bit of context, that's equal to where we were pre-pandemic. So, it hasn't fallen off from those levels. There is obviously a big mix impact from the categories that drive that. But this productivity program will help us accelerate our actions through our 2025 strategy. We think they are in the right places. Again, there will be timing here, these will start to benefit us in the back half of the year. And on annualized rate, $90 million to $110 million is a meaningful number. Now behind that, on the split of what goes to the bottom line versus what goes back into the business, we have some flexibility there. But part of this is going to get invested back into the business. As we have said, we want to continue to drive the long-term health of these categories and the long-term health of the business. So, the margin as we went through the year, obviously, wrapped on a very difficult compare, but we are confident in our ability to drive margin expansion in 2022."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, and welcome to our 2021 third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.  This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q3 performance, as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance, before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory. We will then open it up for Q&A.  As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question, so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to reenter the queue. Our focus on innovation, premiumization, pricing, and productivity allowed us to deliver solid Q3 and year-to-date results, despite a very difficult operating environment. We continue to deliver against our targets because we are executing consistently on the strategy Noel laid out at CAGNY back in 2019. We are focused on delivering consistent, sustainable, profitable growth, both volume and pricing growth, growth in all of our categories, growth in all of our divisions emerging and developed markets. And this has enabled us to deliver 11 straight quarters with organic sales growth in line with, or above our long-term target of 3% to 5%. This is, despite very difficult comparisons, and a challenging operating environment. The current operating environment is challenging in many different ways. Consumer mobility is limited in many markets, particularly in Asia, due to government restrictions to stop the spread of COVID-19, which is having a negative impact on category growth. These restrictions have also led to temporary closure of manufacturing facilities across many industries as you have heard in the news and from other companies. We are not immune to these restrictions, although given the essential nature of our categories, we produce products that people and their pets use on a daily basis to lead healthier lives.  We have been able to resume production throughout our network, although sometimes at a lower-than-normal level. This did have a slight impact on sales in the third quarter. And we expect a modest impact in the fourth quarter, as we ramp production back up. We are fortunate to have a flexible and resilient global supply chain that has helped us to offset some of the effects of the supply chain challenges, albeit sometimes with additional logistics costs. Speaking of logistics, the stress on global logistics networks is creating shortages of raw materials, lengthening shipment times, increasing costs, and adding additional uncertainty. All of this is on top of the significant increases in raw material costs and continued movement in foreign exchange. These challenges will continue into next year, but we will continue to meet them head on. Our net sales grew 6.5% in the quarter, driven by 4.5% organic sales growth and a 2% benefit from foreign exchange. Our organic sales growth in the third quarter was led by Oral Care, where we were up mid-single digits, and Pet Nutrition, where we were up double digits. We delivered organic sales growth in Homecare despite a difficult comparison, which puts our homecare business at double-digit growth on a two-year stack.  As expected, organic sales in Personal Care declined mid-single digits as we lap the COVID-related growth in liquid hand soap in the year-ago period, but sales remain above 2019 levels. We grew volume 1.5% in the quarter. Pricing grew 3% in the quarter up sequentially from Q2, despite a more difficult 4.5% comparison as we continue to layer in new pricing to try to offset accelerating raw materials costs. Pricing was up in every category and every division. Raw materials continue to increase in Q3, putting further pressure on our gross margins, despite additional pricing and productivity efforts.  Our gross margin was down 180 basis points in the quarter. Pricing was a 110 basis point benefit to gross margin, while raw materials were a 510 basis point headwind, despite a slight benefit from transactional foreign exchange. Productivity was favorable by 220 basis points. On a GAAP and base business basis, our SG&A was up 50 basis points on a percent of sales, driven by significant increase in logistics costs as advertising was up on a dollar basis, but flat on a percent of sales basis. Excluding logistics and advertising, our overheads were down slightly on a dollar basis and down nicely on a percent of sales basis. We continue to increase our investments in capabilities like digital, e-commerce, and data and analytics, but this was more than offset by sales leverage and tight expense controls. For the third quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was down 5% year-over-year, while it was down 3% on a base business basis. Our EPS was down 7% on a GAAP basis, and up 3% on a base business basis. A few comments on our divisional performance. Net sales in North America grew 1% in the third quarter, with organic sales growth of 0.5% and 50 basis points of favorable foreign exchange. Volumes were flat in the quarter, despite a negative nearly 400 basis points impact from lower liquid hand soap volumes.  While pricing was slightly favorable. We made significant progress on our North American business in the quarter with solid Oral Care growth driven by mid-single-digit growth in toothpaste, which led to improved toothpaste market share performance through the quarter.  Personal Care and Homecare were both down, as we lapped COVID benefits in the year-ago period although EltaMD and PCA skin delivered strong growth in the quarter. North America operating margins were negatively impacted by raw materials and higher logistics costs. The impact of plant closures on our global supply chain required us to incur additional airfreight charges to fulfill customer orders in the quarter. We also incurred some additional manufacturing costs in the quarter that should help improve the long-term profitability of the division.  Latin America net sales were up 11%, with 8% organic sales growth and a 300 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. All three categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter, with Oral Care organic sales growth in the high single digits. Volume was plus 2.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 5.5%. Brazil and Mexico led the growth in the quarter, while Columbia delivered double-digit growth following last quarter's political unrest. The natural segment continues to be a key driver of growth for us across Latin America, particularly Colgate Natural Extracts Charcoal. And we recently launched Colgate Zero Toothpaste in Brazil. Our strong Latin America pricing growth highlights the success of our Revenue Growth Management program with a combination of less price increases, premium innovation, and trade promo adjustments. Europe net sales grew 1% in the quarter, with organic sales minus 1%, and foreign exchange adding 2%. Volume was down 1%, and pricing was flat. Oral Care organic sales grew high single digits, while Personal Care organic sales were down sharply, driven by difficult liquid hand soap comparisons due to COVID-related consumption in the year-ago period and a decline in Florida Duty free sales. Colgate elixir toothpaste continued to drive growth in the quarter, along with strong contributions from Elmex and Meridol.  Asia-Pacific net sales grew 1% and organic sales declined 0.5% in the quarter, with volume down slightly and pricing and foreign exchange both slightly positive. Oral Care saw low-single digit organic sales growth in the quarter while Personal care, and Home Care were down due to difficult COVID comparisons. We did see government imposed mobility restrictions negatively impacting category volumes in several markets, including many in Southeast Asia. India and the Colgate China business both delivered strong volume growth behind robust innovation in the ayurvedic segment in India and an e-commerce in China.  Our Hawley & Hazel JV saw significantly improved performance in Q3 versus Q2, with trends also improving sequentially through the quarter. Africa, Eurasia net sales grew 1% in the quarter, with organic -- with an organic sales decline of 1%, lapping double-digit organic growth in the year-ago period, more than offset by a 2% positive impact from foreign exchange. Volumes were minus 4.5%, while pricing was plus 3.5%, The organic sales growth decline in the quarter was driven by personal care as we lapped double-digit growth in the year-ago period due to COVID-related demand and pricing. Oral Care organic sales in the quarter were flat as disruptions in the global supply chain had a negative impact on product availability. Fill strong growth continued in the third quarter with 20% net sales growth and 19% organic sales growth. With strong growth in both emerging and developed markets. Organic sales growth was driven by double-digit volume growth and high single-digit pricing through list price increases and our premiumization strategies. Our focus on the microbiome, which [Indiscernible] talked about during our CAGNY presentation this year, continues to pay dividends with the active biome plus technology. Including in Hill's Prescription Diet gastrointestinal [Indiscernible] and Hill's Science Diet Perfect Digestion Both of which are driving sales growth and share in this important segment. And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth for the year to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. As I mentioned previously, we have seen an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID-19, including reduced consumer mobility and supply chain interruptions. We are managing through these issues, but we would expect modest headwinds from this to continue in the fourth quarter. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, others slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in July. Please note that at current spot rates, foreign exchange will have a negative impact on Q4. All-in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. given the continued pressures from raw materials, we are projecting a greater decline in gross margin than when we last gave guidance in July. Fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be roughly in line with the third quarter although the raw material situation remains very difficult. We continue to take additional steps to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG where available, and many others.  We are focused on recouping the gross margin we have lost due to cost inflation over time, and are planning to take the actions necessary to do so. Advertising is still expected to be up on a dollar basis, but flat on a percent of sales basis. Given the issues surrounding logistics networks on a global basis, our logistics costs will continue to be a headwind, particularly in the U.S. and Africa/Eurasia. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 22% and 23% for the year on both a GAAP and base business basis. On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings-per-share growth in the low-to-mid single-digits, and as we said on the second quarter call, towards the lower end of that range.  On a base business basis, we continue to expect earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single-digits. Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range. And with that, I will turn it over to Noel.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So what I take away from our performance, I guess both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, is that we continue to make good progress on our strict strategic and operational journey despite the significant volatility we're encountering across our entire business. At the heart of this is our strategy to deliver broad-based, sustainable, profitable growth. Every division, every category, both volume and pricing, that's our aspiration. And over the past few years, we have changed our mindset about how we drive growth. We're more proactive in attacking the opportunities for growth. Think core, premium [indiscernible] faster alternative channels and markets. And of course, we talked a lot about building capabilities. Think digital, data, e-commerce, innovation. All of these are helping us mine these important areas of growth. While lapping our most difficult comparisons in over a decade, we've delivered organic sales growth at the high end of our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. And on a 2-year basis, both pricing and volume growth increased sequentially in the quarter. Importantly, this growth is being driven by our two most important categories: oral care and pet nutrition. Oral care organic sales were up mid-single-digits in Q3 against the mid-single-digit comparison enter up high single-digits year-to-date. We're driving this growth through more impactful innovation, Sure growth and faster growth channels like e-commerce and pharmacies, and hire more efficient marketing spending. Our premiumization strategy is paying off with our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, changing how we interact with the people who use our products. A great example of this is how we've changed our approach to whitening. In U.S, you're familiar with Optic White renewal, which has done incredibly well. Outside the U.S., the story needs to be more about just hydrogen peroxide levels. In China, it's about enzyme-based whitening.  In other markets, we have whitening products targeted towards consumers who had loved tea or coffee, or consumers who love wine or tobacco. We're targeting the whitening opportunity much more broadly with new technologies, formulations, and delivery systems, expanding our growth potential. Pet Nutrition organic sales growth was up 19% in the quarter against an 11% comparison, and is now up 14% year-to-date through quarter 3. This growth is driven by Hill's science-based equity messaging behind our core. It's driven by meaningful premium innovation and the continued expertise of our digital and e-commerce teams.  The launch of Prescription Diet Derm complete those breakthrough therapeutic nutrition for both food and environmental sensitivities has lead to share gains in the category and is being rolled out internationally over the next few quarters. Hills goal of MD pet obesity where study show over 50% of pets are overweight is the impetus for our Hills master brand campaign. This campaign has been rolled out globally, and has driven growth in both our therapeutic, and wellness anti-obesity products. In this type of environment, we couldn't deliver the results without -- this year without the amazing work done by Colgate people every day.  Our customer development organization is reacting quickly to the changing cost environment so we can take pricing as part of the revenue growth management initiative. Marketing in R&D of working together to accelerate the launch of premium innovation to drive mix and profitability. And most importantly, our global supply chain team has delivered these results despite freight and logistics disruptions, plant closures, congested ports, and supplier outages. Importantly, all the efforts we have put into building capabilities over the past few years is not just about driving growth.  It's also about creating an organization that can respond more rapidly to all these challenges we face around the world. For example, our focus on data and analytics is helping our Revenue Growth Management Program pinpoint the best opportunities for incremental pricing as costs continue to rise. We are getting this pricing out in the market more quickly and the data that drives this process gives our people on the ground more confidence in their decisions. Our investment in e-commerce and digital marketing continues to pay off. In our six largest e-commerce market for Oral Care, we finished the third quarter with year-to-date net sales already ahead of 22 net sales -- 2020 net sales and toothpaste share growth in five of the six markets. We've implemented new media buying strategy to drive efficiencies both online and offline, and launched a four-tier training program to enable 14,000 of our employees to help drive our digital strategy. But as I've said, the key through all of this is that we recognize that the strategy is working. And while we address the pressing issues of raw materials, logistics, and supply chain, we can't lose sight of our long-term areas of focus. Our innovation calendar for 2022 will show an increase in the percentage of innovation that is breakthrough and transformational. We've announced our new sustainability and social impact strategy this year, Which includes 11 new targets and actions in areas like Zero Waste, climate change, using less plastic, as well as bright smiles, bright futures, and our diversity equity and inclusion efforts. And we will continue to build our people and capabilities through new ways of working that are truly changing how Colgate people do their jobs. 2021 has been very challenging year for us, and many of these challenges will continue in 2022, but I'm confident of the changes the Colgate people put in place over the past several years which will allow us to continue to deliver our goal of sustainable, profitable growth. And now I'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys.\nNoel Wallace: Hey, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So, Noel, can you review your Oral Care market share performance globally, maybe compare and contrast some of the regions that are performing better versus laggards? And if you take a step back, looking at the strategies you laid out at CAGNY a few years ago, which strategies have sort of taken hold in Oral Care are working? Maybe what are some of the areas where you might need some more work? And if I can just slip in a related second part, can you also update us on the competitive and the pricing environment in Oral Care in light of the higher cost environment here? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Dara. So overall, we're pleased with the progress that we're making on Oral Care, particularly in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. If you take our shares on a constant currency basis, they're relatively flat, which is better than where we had then. When you start to go around the world, particularly as you look at new channels, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in e-commerce and pharmacy. So let's just bounce around the world a bit. North America still has been a little bit soft, but we've seen the shares bounce back nicely in the last 13 weeks and where our shares are actually flat now. And all outlet basis if you take e-commerce and all the untracked channels, our estimation is our shares are back to flat and U.S slightly up, which is good progress, particularly as we've seen the acceleration of some of the premium SKUs that we've launched in the market, particularly whitening over the last 13 weeks. And likewise, our e-commerce shares continue to be good, not as good - strong as our general market, but progressing in North America.  Europe, the shares have been strong. Our Elmex and our strategy behind Elmex and Meridol has been very successful in pushing those businesses across all of our core markets. Our shares continue to be up across that region and we continue to see the shift toward our premium bundles, which was again part of the strategy change that we outlined back at CAGNY that we were going to focus on underserved channels like pharmacy with some of our premium therapeutic equities, like Meridol and Elmex. Latin America, the shares continue to be very strong, flat in the quarter, slightly down as a result of some of the promotional volume that we've given up in Mexico, which has been quite significant, but Brazil shares continue to be pretty good and trending nicely, particularly behind strong revenue growth management initiatives that have characterized the Brazilian subsidiary for so long, but overall pretty good.  Africa, pretty good. Good shares in South Africa, better shares in Russia as we move to a premiumization strategy there, so we're pleased with that aspect as well. China has been a terrific performance in the quarter for us, Dara. We've seen our e-commerce shares across both the Hawley & Hazel joint venture as well as the Colgate franchise be the fastest-growing SKUs in the market. We are the fastest-growing manufacturer in the market. Our shares on the Colgate business in China now are up after many years of declines when you combine both brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. So overall, very pleased, then again, I think that's a testament to the strategy and the strategic changes we made with our portfolio.  Remember that our big focus in China was getting the premiumization part of the portfolio fixed. The growth in e-commerce has all been premium SKUs, which priced at about 300 index to the general market. So again, I think good innovation at that end of the market is helping to drive our business. And you heard in the upfront comments, obviously, e-commerce across the world, once again is driving a nice shares for us, particularly in Oral Care, where we've had a lot of focus. Coming back to the question around the strategy on Oral Care, again, the focus was premium, innovation and new channels. And if you take our pharmacy growth across the world in toothpaste, very strong, particularly in key markets where we really focused, which have been in Africa, Europe and Latin America, particularly Brazil. You see our pharmacy shares continuing to grow and we've got a good pipeline of innovation coming in 2022 that's going to be specifically tailored towards pharmacy growth. And likewise, e-commerce being the other fast-growth channel and obviously just articulated the success we're having there. Therapeutic was the other big focus that we had in CAGNY in terms of where we're going to push the Oral Care business, particularly toothpaste. We've expanded meridol and elmex strategically in the core markets where we see big pharmacy classes of trade and where we see the therapeutic segment growing. And our success has been quite notable, particularly in those markets, whether you look at Brazil specifically, whether you look at the Middle East, where we've been quite successful as well. So again, I think that strategy seems to be taking hold. Naturals has quite frankly been a little bit soft, and I think that's coming out of the COVID period, where consumers traded to more therapeutic efficacious brand so to speak and the natural segment was softer than we would expect it. So hello, here in North America, shares are stable but not growing as much as we anticipated. We did indicate that we're rolling that out selectively into some core markets around the world. And that will unfold in the balance of this quarter and into the first quarter of next year.  So overall, I think the strategy that we outlined are working certainly as you've seen from the results there, mid-single digits in the quarter and high single on the year for Oral Care, which has been absolutely terrific and consistent, and that is on top of a marketplace that quite frankly is growing considerably below that right now. So again, we think we're driving share globally when you look at it on all outlet basis, particularly given the organic growth sequential improvements that we're seeing.\nOperator: We'll go next to Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing well. So, I was hoping to get your perspective on kind of what you're seeing in the current environment and how that informs your view on the growth trajectory as we look ahead to '22, right? So the top line momentum is strong, and as you mentioned, the inflation and FX headwinds are expected to continue. And I don't expect guidance, but I would just love to get your perspective on how we should think about margin progression looking out beyond Q4.\nNoel Wallace: Well, listen, Peter. You've heard it, I think throughout the earnings season so far, that obviously, cost inflation is significant for all fast-moving consumer goods. And we're certainly not immune to that. And -- but what we are very good at is pricing, and you've seen that consistently over time and time over the years, whether it's foreign exchange inflation or raw and packing material inflation, we have found ways over time to recover that in our margin line. And that is certainly the focus right now in the business. The good news is when you have an inflationary environment that's indexed around raw materials, you tend to have everyone looking to take pricing in the market, and that makes it more conducive certainly from a category standpoint and making sure that everyone takes pricing that the volume continues to go along with that. So we're pleased that we've seen pricing in the marketplace, we've been leading that across the board, quite frankly, particularly in emerging markets where we've taken pricing quite aggressively throughout the first half and very much into the third quarter and we've laid out pricing for the fourth quarter and into early 2022. So we'll see the margins begin to recover. Now, the environment you've heard around raw materials and logistics continues to be extremely volatile. And we anticipate that we'll continue to see some headwinds in that space. The team understands that and is putting the strategies in to place in order to recover margins as we move forward. We will also be heightening our focus around Revenue Growth Management. That discipline is going to be really embedded much more so given the fact that we've now put some analytical processes in place to help the teams, as I outlined, which we think is terrific. It will give the teams a lot more confidence on the pricing that we're taking to ensure that we're working with our trade partners to grow category at the same time as we take pricing to recover cost, so we're pleased with that.  Likewise, had a lot of discussions over the last couple of months on our grids our new product grids relative to premium innovation, and making sure that we continue to focus on that area of the business, whereas historically we've under-indexed and we've seen good progress against that, particularly, as you look at some of the premium businesses that we have around the world, whether it'd be Elmex, Meridol or some of the prices we've taken on our therapeutic bundles within the Colgate portfolio. So overall, a tough raw material environment will continue to be very choppy but we're very focused in terms of taking pricing and ensuring that we push our premium innovation moving forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk about your supply chain? And I know you mentioned the issues in China, but I think 2 parts to this question: A. What is happening globally? Do you see mostly things sequentially improving, or it's still very tough to service clients and customers globally. And B. I think you said there was an impact in the third quarter and it's going to linger in China in the fourth. I'm assuming this is not material, but just wondering if you can quantify. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: [Indiscernible] You've come to know Colgate in the fact that we consider our supply chain a competitive advantage for us and that is the fact that we operate globally with some of the most efficient facilities around the world. And the benefit of that is obviously translated into the strong gross margin progression that we've seen over the years. That being said, when you operated global supply chain, you're not immune to decisions taken in locally that will impact that. And obviously in Asia, where we have seen our government's taking actions to stop the spread of COVID, whether it'd be bad or obviously impacting some of our suppliers and our third-party contractors, we've seen disruption in the supply chain. And as a result of that, we have the contingencies in place to move that production elsewhere, which the team has done just a tremendous job in servicing the sales needs of the business. And you've seen that, obviously, in the acceleration or the continuous good topline growth that we've had.  And that's a function of our supply chain ensuring that we meet the demand of our products and our retailers. And we move production around the world to do that. That comes with a cost that certainly we incurred in the quarter. Some of the disruption specifically related to what we referred to in our commentary, we're moving through those very quickly. We have moved behind one that was quite significant and we're back to where we needed to be in terms of output and we're back to pretty close on some of the other ones.  We expect that to be fully back in capacity by the end of the quarter of this quarter, but that being said, the environment is very unpredictable. And we'll continue to try to anticipate some of these things moving forward as we've done, but one can never be for sure when a government decides to come in, and shut down a province, or an area based on their needs. Likewise, this has a big impact obviously on the rest of the supply chain, whether it'd be raw material sourcing, whether it'd be our contractors.  You heard in John's commentary, we did take some decisions, particularly in North America, around some of the contractors that we use in order to clean that up and move into a supply chain strategy that allows us to exit some of those and get more efficiencies moving forward. We're taking all the right decisions moving through the issues that we had in the third quarter but we are not immune to the unpredictability of the supply chain that environment that everyone's faced with today.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yes. Good morning, everyone. No. I was hoping you can talk about -- I was hoping you can talk about pet. It's been a remarkable turnaround over the last few years obviously, improvements in market share but also category growth. So I just wanted to see if you can unpack some of the drivers that you see for the business, and how long do you think that higher pet adoption phenomenon that we've seen during COVID will continue to be an incremental tailwind?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Listen, the pet business has been terrific, obviously. I think a lot of the change in strategies that we deployed a couple of years ago, which again are based foundationally on exactly all the stuff we're trying to deploy across the world, really working on the core of our business, looking at premium innovation and continuing to really dial up our focus on high-growth channels. And that's exactly what's unfolded over the last couple of years and that strategy is continuing obviously to get sharper and sharper, as we executed more broadly across the Hills network around the world. A lot of that growth has come out in North America which has been terrific, the double-digit growth compounding each other. U.S. had another outstanding quarter in the third quarter. Again, we're benefiting from a quite buoyant category, but the important part that you called out is we're growing share quite consistently, not only across our wellness products are our core products, but also our therapeutic products and Prescription Diet. We're seeing obviously Vetenerians open back up. That is certainly improving the consumption of our Prescription Diet. We talked at length about the innovation process we had behind Hills, which I think is second to none in the category right now, bringing real science and real therapeutic benefits to pet owners. And we're seeing that translate into obviously more penetration and growing share. We continue to talk about the low awareness of Hills, both in North America and around the world that affords us a significant opportunities We continue to build that brand consistently all over the world and we're continued to invest behind that business. Despite the fact that raw materials are a headwind, we're not going to jeopardize the health of the brand by cutting back on our investment. We will continue to invest to grow awareness And that ultimately is growing penetration in the category, so we feel very good about where we are. Obviously the comparisons continue to get tough, but those have been tough, and we continue to see good progress on the strategy, our ability to take pricing, and our ability to bring in new consumers to the franchise.\nOperator: So the next to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Morning.\nChris Carey: I wanted to get a bit more context in North America. You said that you had incurred some extra manufacturing costs in the quarter. I think you just noted there were efficiencies with contract manufacturers, but the comment was in the prepared remarks, I believe to improve the long-term profitability of that business. And I was wondering if you could just expand on that. Do you think a lack of scale or efficiency or something else in the manufacturing base has been a cause of the margin compression in that business, and if they have opportunities to offset that? Am I reading that wrong? I guess just overall in the context of the pressure on margins and the commentary around some of the actions you're taking above, a bit more perspective.\nNoel Wallace: Sure.\nChris Carey: So thanks so much.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Yeah, let me jump into that in a little bit more detail. Obviously, it was somewhat of a perfect storm in the third quarter for us as we looked at the business in North America, significant inflation in raw materials, obviously, that came through in the quarter. Logistics was probably the most significant headwind we had in the last couple of months versus where we were previously. Obviously, you're not -- you're clearly aware of the logistics industry and whatever -- what's going on. Tighter capacity, tighter labor, higher costs obviously, which have obviously fueled significant increases in rates internally within North America, not to mention the fact that there's a lot of congestion going on, and a lot of delays in getting product to and from where it needs to be. As a result, we've been very focused on working with our retailers to ensure that we can continue to improve upon that. The other areas I mentioned earlier, we have this incredibly efficient global supply chain, but we do source product from different parts of the world. And you've seen obviously ocean freight increases -- increase dramatically over the last 3 months or 4 months. We have not been immune to that North America, quite frankly, brings quite a bit of its product from overseas. While we have very substantial manufacturing presence in North America, we do bring product from overseas, which has obviously been a victim of those price increases we've seen in ocean freights. The other one is we have seen increased demand, particularly in some of our Oral Care products and we want to continue to service that as we always have consistently and reliably to our trade partners. And as a result of that, we made decisions to airfreight product in to ensure that we had sufficient supply for our retailers. That airfreight did not come without a significant cost. We will move through that clearly as we move through this year and into next year and so we'll see those costs come out. And as you alluded to in your question, we did take some important strategic decisions on how we look at our network and our supply chain, both from a contractor standpoint, as well as what we source internally within our facilities. And made some decisions in the quarter, that will allow us to rework some of those contracts, and hopefully drive more profitability in the long term. So overall, we're pleased. Good oral care growth, which is obviously where we want to see that business continue to grow.  The business is looking at, obviously, a pricing environment is becoming more conducive to take pricing historically, which has not been the case. And they're very focused on their new product grids around premium innovation, which is a strong plan for 2022 and a resurgence of focus around Revenue Growth Management, given how important it is that we offset some of that compression we're seeing at the margin line. So overall, we were -- a difficult quarter for North America, but they've got the plans in place. And we think some of the things that we were working through in the quarter will be behind us as we move forward into 2022.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi, good morning. You guys have such huge market shares in some of your categories in emerging markets. I wondered if you could take a step back and just comment on what you're seeing. I mean, we don't really have a sense for has consumer behavior changed in some of those markets. Is there a lag effect from COVID, either the consumer stockpile our has their free sensitivity changed just in some of your bigger markets. I figured you guys are a good Company to ask about what you're seeing on the ground, you had 3.5% growth in emerging markets on the volume side, which is good but not great. And I'm just wondering if there's something other than just tough comps, if there's a change in the way consumer shop or how much they have to spend from a high-level big picture perspective? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Let me just address the 3.5% quickly, Wendy. Obviously, that was drawn down by some of the shutdowns we saw across Asia. And the lack of mobility of Southeast Asia, in fact, very little mobility. We saw categories fall off quite dramatically across Southeast Asia and that's certainly had an impact on volume in the quarter. And as you heard John mentioned, if you really want to dimensionalize a lot of the volume softness in the quarter, was liquid hand soap, which was a headwind of 400 basis points in the North America business alone. But let me step back to your broader question on what's going on around the world, coming out of COVID and what we're seeing in terms of category behaviors.  Oral Care was not a COVID beneficiary, and obviously, it was not in the same camp as we saw from some of our personal care businesses which saw significant acceleration in consumption and a more systemic behavior change across the world. Oral care -- as mobility comes back into the market, we continue to see the oral care categories growing, and that's good for us long term, obviously, getting more and more consumers back into stores will allow more consumption, and more category-driven initiatives to take place.  And so we think, over the longer term, we are going to see oral care continue to accelerate. Personal care and homecare were obviously quite significant beneficiaries during COVID. While the liquid hand soap has taken a significant drop-off this year, it still remains above the 2019 levels. And as you rightfully said, we're the number 1 liquid hand soap player certainly in North America and around the world. And that we'll see that behavior, at least, stay with the consumer above the '19 levels, but certainly not anywhere close to where they were in 2020. Hygiene products that we're very focused on in our homecare business, Whether it be dish liquids or floor cleaners, I think we'll continue to see nice growth in those categories. You heard John mentioned the Home Care growth that we've seen as more and more consumers stay home. Obviously, there's more dishes being cleaned and more floor being cleaned and that has allowed that category to continue to be quite robust. But as consumers move back and mobility comes back into markets, are people return to work?  You may see a little bit softness in those longer-term, but overall, we think we're positioned well, particularly in the Oral Care space. If you go to pet food, obviously the significant adoptions that we've seen over the last two years during COVID and the fact that we're now executing much, much better against our strategy. We feel very good about where things are moving there. And there has been a behavior change unquestionably in that category, where consumers have returned to science and nutrition, and very focused on that space which we are obviously very driven by right now.\nOperator: [Indiscernible] with Jefferies.\nKevin: Great. Thanks, Good morning, everyone. Question, I want to come back to the pricing strategy and implications on gross margin over the next 12 months. So, specifically with all the pricing that's going into place, you guys have done a fantastic job at funding the growth for decades. My question, is the intention as you sit here today with all the volatility in the environment that you can fully offset the input cost pressure and everything you're dealing with supply chain perspective with pricing and productivity. Is that a realistic ambition? Is that a realistic goal as you're sitting here from a risk management perspective?  Is that something you think you can do, or is the cost, inflation, and supply chain pressures just too great at this point? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how you guys are thinking about it, how you're pricing, and how you're thinking about productivity. And then if I could just sneak in one related question. A lot of interest around demand elasticity, which has been relatively low, I think, across many categories. just observed and which I understand is going to vary by category, by geography, by channel, just some broader observations there. And Noel, what you're seeing so far with the pricing in place for your business would be helpful. So thank you for all that.\nNoel Wallace: Sure [indiscernible] you're obviously watch this closely and price is always been a key driver of our organic growth given how we look at the markets around the world and we've consistently look for quick ways to get pricing in the market and not only to drive category growth, but obviously to protect the margin which ultimately allows us to protect the advertising. It's worth mentioning that obviously on a two-year stack that this was the highest pricing number we've seen in many years for us. Again, I think it reflects a consistent discipline we have across the board of taking pricing quickly in the markets.   You heard me talk a little bit about how we're using data and revenue growth management now to get that information on the ground quickly to the teams, so they can do what they need to do to analyze, to take pricing across the board. But it's not just going to be pricing. We will look at, obviously, premium innovation and getting our mix improved, not only within our portfolios, but channel mix as well. I talked a little bit about the importance of driving pharmacy growth around the world, which is a growth opportunity for the Company, particularly in Oral Care. That typically trades with a much better margin for the Company given the therapeutic profile of those bundles.  We're obviously going to continue to embed significant revenue growth management initiatives all over the world not just in some of the key inflationary markets. And as we talked about earlier, we're deploying some pretty nice strategies around the emerging markets right now to ensure that we get pricing up beyond just list prices. The other piece of this is productivity. Historically, you've seen us do a really good job around funding the growth. This quarter was no exception, adding 220 basis points to the margin line. But we're really dialing that up, not just simply from a cost standpoint, but really looking at efficiencies across the organization. And going into 2022, looking at how we look to find optimized ways to run our business more efficiently, And we'll continue to do that as we historically have done, and find ways to pull costs out of the system. John mentioned it in his commentary, our overheads were actually down very nicely in the quarter on a percent of sales. And again, I think that's part of the cost focus that we have. And looking at our business and making sure that we're finding ways to optimize. So it's going to be a multitude of different things. And we'll continue to see that evolve. It will take some time to be sure. These things don't move in a straight line. We're taking pricing where we can, as quickly as we can. We're obviously watching the competitiveness of the market. But as I mentioned earlier, this is an environment that everyone is facing right now, which tends to allow everyone to find ways to take pricing up in the category.  So we don't feel we will be in an anti-competitive position, but we will be very close to watch that market to ensure that we continue to remain competitive. The other piece of this -- we haven't really mentioned is the advertising. And we continue to focus on being -- building our brands and being competitive in the marketplace. And that is a key driver of the consistent topline growth you're seeing in the Company right now. And we'll continue to do everything we can to protect that advertising line, and obviously working through the middle of the P&L will be critical in that regard.\nOperator: For the next [indiscernible] Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey folks, good morning. I guess I want to pick up on Mr. Graham's question around margin progression, but zooming in a bit more just in North America. And if we step back, I know it's a tough year with cost and logistics, etc. But if we step back and just look over the last 5 years, year on track to lost 1300, 1400 basis points of profit margins in North America. I think you're also on track to actually have market share lower than you were five-years ago over that duration.  So Noel can you just give us some context around what's happening with the investment plan in North America with tech and lose strategy there. And do you think you've got the right investment posture, the right innovation plan to compete effectively in the market? Is this just a low point on margins? Can we bounce back from here as a slick during point just any context you can give us around the profitability in the performance in that market. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Jason. So we talked about Oral Care, obviously a big focus for us in the North American business. That was strong again in the quarter up mid single-digits. I won't repeat what I talked about in terms of share growth, particularly last 13 weeks. We are more competitive in the U.S. market. We were not competitive in the first half. We've dialed up our competitiveness and we're seeing the benefits of that translate into better share progression, particularly across some of our premium bundles. We continue to support the business quite well. We think we're in a good place where we need to be, but obviously as any marketer would say, more support is always better. We're looking for increased efficiencies in that business as we move forward in order to accelerate gross margins. As I mentioned earlier, North America was disproportionately hit with raw material, inflation, logistics, and we took decisions very deliberately in the quarter to address demand that obviously had an effect in that quarter. So we anticipate that we'll start to come out as we move through the fourth quarter and certainly as we move into the first half of 2022. That being said, the raw material environment continues to be very volatile and unpredictable. And we'll take the decisions that we need to take to remain competitive. We are very focused on growing the North America business. It is a priority for the Company. We are ensuring that we give them what they need in order to address the challenges and the competitiveness of that marketplace, and we expect that we'll continue to see good gross margin expansion over time. I do think this is a low for us, but I say that in the context of an environment that's quite unpredictable. But given what we saw go through in the third quarter, we anticipate that things will get better as we move forward.\nOperator: Next to Kamil Jagrulla with Credit Suisse.\nKamil Jagrulla : Thank you, good morning everybody. I'll follow-up a little bit on the second question on price elasticity. And maybe just linked to price elasticity if you could also just maybe comment on the consumer condition, various areas around -- around the world.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Listen, we've historically led pricing in so many of our markets. And in the emerging markets, you tend to see a little bit more elasticity early on, but we are focused on ensuring that our innovation process is across multiple price tiers. And so when you combine pricing with innovation at the same time, we find that we can rebuild consumption quite quickly. Elasticity tends to dissipate over time certainly as we get the new innovation in the market and communicate that. So we're quite confident in where we are in emerging markets. Developed markets tend to be a little bit more difficult. Historically taking pricing in Europe and North America has been a challenge. We have certainly shifted a lot of our focus to now relaunching brands, relaunching the core, bringing more premium innovation in the market in order to drive pricing and typically then as you bring value-added consumer oriented benefits to the category, you can take pricing and therefore the elasticity is in its dramatics. So we will see it over time. I think there is everyone is raising pricing fundamentally in the categories that we compete in. That tends to reduce the elasticity as well. One might ask, where Is private label in this environment? Private label shares were down in every single category in which we compete fundamentally so the news is, big brands are winning and I think as long as you bring good quality innovation, you continue to support that innovation with good content that's personalized and targeted, we think we can offset some of the elasticity. But that being said, the raw material environment is significant and pricing will be significant over the next few quarters in order to offset that moving forward But we want to do that to make sure we protect our advertising line.\nOperator: The next to Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks, and good morning. Noel --\nNoel Wallace: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Powers: -- I guess maybe to summarize a lot of what we've talked about so far and just try to cut through the -- some of the noise around manufacturing, closings, and mobility restrictions, and bottle supply chain, bottlenecks, etc. I guess I'm trying to get a better sense for how you're seeing Colgate's momentum trending, particularly on the oral home and personal care businesses. As I look at it, I think I see directional improvements. They are evident this quarter, sequentially, but at the same time, in most regions, I think overall performance came in lighter than many of us had hoped on the outside. So again, can you maybe just summarize the sequential momentum as you see it on a global basis, maybe how you expect things to progress in fourth quarter X Hill's, and what the early setup is heading into the new fiscal year in terms of building that momentum further r? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, Steve. We're very pleased with momentum. I mentioned in my comments, up sequentially or 2-year stack on volume and pricing in this environment, we think is a terrific result driven by our core focus areas, which is Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. Oral Care continues to drive good sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, we talked about at mid singles in the quarter, high singles on the year. Obviously, the pet nutrition business in double-digits, comping double-digit. So again, I think some terrific progress there. Personal care significantly impacted by COVID driven categories.  And liquid hand soap, which is a very big business for us in North America and around the world, obviously, we saw a significant fall-off in the category. The category was down 28%, to give you some context on that, and as John mentioned, that was a 400 basis point headwind. So some of the COVID categories were certainly stabilized as we moved forward and we lap those moving into 2022. But the essence of your question is, where are we with the momentum on Oil-Chem? We feel good about it. We feel good about our 22 plans. We feel good about the pricing we're taking. We feel good about the segments we're competing in.  We feel good about the channel strategy that we've had where we're growing share in the fastest growth channels which are typically e-commerce discounters and pharmacy. And the strategies that were put in place in the portfolio execution of that is delivering against it. So we feel, overall, we're pleased with the underlying momentum on Oral Care, Personal Care as we lapped some of the COVID will improve moving forward. We had some good discussions particularly in North America and Europe around some of the innovation that we need to continue to drive it.  Our market share, interesting now, just as a data point on market share on liquid hand soap in the U.S. was actually up two points in the quarter given the fact that it was still down 400 basis points versus where it was last year on a volume standpoint. So again, we think we're taking the right decisions on portfolio and innovation in order to drive share and continue to recover some of the softness that we saw that was temporarily driven by the COVID expansion last year.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Lauren. I think you're on mute.\nOperator: At this time there is no response so next to Brian Moynihan with Bank of America.\nBrian Moynihan: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Brian.\nBrian Moynihan: I wanted to ask just a question around free cash flow and want to understand if -- with the inflation and just all of the noise, I guess, in supply chain, if it's having an effect at all on free cash conversion? And I ask because last year, you over-delivered relative to the 90% conversion target. Looks like this year, at least year-to-date, running a little bit below that. And so really just wanted to understand if there's -- if the effect that it's having on the P&L is also having an effect on free cash flow, and if that's something we should consider as we're looking into '22?\nNoel Wallace: Yes, I'll throw this to understand. But let me just provide a couple of topline comments. Overall, if you go back historically where we are, it compares quite consistently with our historical numbers, that there were some benefits that we certainly had last year on a comp basis around working capital, but let me turn it over to Stan. Will give you a little bit more color on that, Stan?\nStanley Sutula: Yes. Thanks. We continue to cycle favorable working capital performance versus last year and there's really an anomaly when you look at 2020. First of all, 2020 cash flow, driven by the unique environment, was up significantly. While we're down year-to-year, I think if you look back and compare to '18 and ' 19, you'll see that it's more in -- more in line. Higher raw materials pricing certainly put upward pressure on our inventories. But I think important to note as you mentioned, free cash flow, as you'll see the investment we're making in the business and capex.  So capex up roughly a $120 million, that's really an investment, as Noel talked about earlier, in the long-term help our business and what we're looking to grow. So that investment has an impact on free cash flow. But we think, it's incredibly important for the long term. So you step back and look at cash flow where we are today. We're not concerned about the positioning. We think we are confident in our ability to generate that cash. We're confident in our ability to invest in the future of the Company through capex, so we're comfortable with the current positioning on free cash flow.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah, I would only add that particularly around capex which has been quite consistent for us over the years, We found -- we see ourselves with some real opportunities to invest in growth areas of the business. And that's certainly what is elevated the capex in the quarter which we think only good news for the long term.\nOperator: We'll go next to Javier Escalante with Evercore.\nJavier Escalante: Hi, good morning, everyone. And another question on pricing, so basically we heard from both your competitors, Proctor and Unilever taking pricing either in Q3 or announcing price increases, but if you could talk about the big local players that China, in India, is there something in the supply chain that is different that they can drag on pricing? Is this a concern? And this is something that contributed to the weakness in Q3 both in China and India, that will be very helpful. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, Javier. Thanks. I think the answer is everyone is -- no one is immune to the inflation that we're seeing across the market, both from a raw material standpoint or from a logistics standpoint. Obviously, they may have had different constituents. They look at their business differently than public companies or big multinational companies. But in any case, no one is immune to it. And XIVE had discussions and been able to get out and travel a bit and talk to retailers.  I mean, retailers are recognizing even on their own private label brands, they are going to have to take pricing to offset the significant inflation that's being absorbed in the market right now. So I expect that you'll see all boats rise, so to speak. In this environment, that pricing will go up. There will be certainly some delay with local players as they tend to try to search out a bit more volume as the big players take pricing. But again, I think if you can combine the pricing with the right innovation, which we're very focused on delivering, and adding value to the consumer, the local brands have to react to that in some form or fashion, either with their own innovation or with their own price increases in order to stay competitive from a support standpoint.  So I don't anticipate it's going to be a significant issue, Javier, you know, our business. It's really well, you know, that we innovate across all price points and we have significant focus. It's very deliberate in markets, and looking at shares, and our innovation process across each of the key price segments that we compete in. And that will certainly be the case as we move forward.\nOperator: To Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask just specifically on the ad spend. Are you guys getting the right returns on the absolute dollars that you're spending? If you take a look at that category, that column, the increase is somewhere north of 200 basis points over the last few years as a percentage of sales. Obviously, there's a lot of discussions on the call talking about market share challenges, Oral Care, household prior to the pandemic. Just maybe holistically kind of talk about how you think about that.  Does that number needs to move higher from here? Can it stay the same, but can you kind of work in a different way? And then how does that all kind of tie into market share and profitable growth for the business going forward. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Well, listen. Let's step back and look at what's happened over the last two years. And I think it's very clear that we have re-accelerated the topline of the Company. And that has been a core focus for everyone in the organization. It's just growth mindset that talks about elevating our core, our adjancencies, and faster growth channels and doing that across all categories and all geographies. And if you take a basis of two years ago, that's exactly what we were delivering against right now. The investment we believe is fueling that growth. Obviously the strategies, and the execution are big part of it, but we feel very strongly that the acceleration that we've had in investment, both on the oral care side, as well as the nutrition side, have clearly delivered top-line growth. Now we would like to see it reflected in some of the Nielsen based share readings. But the market is very complex now. The go-to-market strategies in the path to purchase for consumers is much more complex than it ever was in the past, and consumers moving between channels, and obviously the emergence of our [Indiscernible] which is quite significant. And in some markets like China has become a very significant part of the category. And we're seeing very strong [Indiscernible] there. Overall, we feel the top-lines moving in the right direction. The investment is supporting that. That being said, we are very focused on making sure that we deliver ROI against every dollar in the P&L. And we have brought in resources from the outside and amplified our capacity around the world, working with WPP, our partner, to get much more granular and much more analytical about how we're investing, particularly our digital spend to make sure it's targeted and we're getting ROI for that spend and we're getting much, much better at that. So as we look at our advertising, will continue to be competitive in terms of what's needed in the marketplace, continue to ensure the health of our brands are protected. But we're very focused from a productivity and efficiency's standpoint looking at that bucket as spend, and making it work harder for us. And that's exactly what we'll expect to see in 2022 as well.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nNoel Wallace: Hey, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: So, can you hear me this time?\nNoel Wallace: Yes, I can. We can hear you just fine.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, cool, because I don't what happened. I just was curious about Mexico, which is it was kind of called out in the context of Latin America and shares being a little softer. So I just wanted a little bit of detail on that. Thanks so much. I know this has gone on for a long time.\nNoel Wallace: No. Mexico, again, high single-digit performance in the quarter. And obviously a difficult environment, particularly given the aggressive pricing that we've been taking in the marketplace. And that pricing certainly had a little bit of impact on volume shares in the quarter. But nothing that's terribly concerning to us. It's what we consider not real profitable volume, given that we're losing to the lower end of the market. Some of our competitors have been highly aggressive with their promotional -- there promotional levels and we've decided to protect the margin in the P&L, and continue to invest in building the brand. Interesting if you look at some of our equity measures in that marketplace, particularly given that we focus now on really supporting the equity as well as innovation. I was -- attended their budget review just recently and they look terrific. Again, I think -- we feel like we've got a very strong position in that market. We sacrificed a little bit of the promotional share, but that is not unusual when we take pricing and lead the market and will continue to ramp up innovation and ensure that we remain competitive, but nothing to be concerned of. Brazil, likewise, which you didn't ask about, but I'll mention that shares are flat there and doing very, very well, particularly as we see great growth in the pharmacy channel. So the balance of our portfolio has gotten much more therapeutic, which is obviously more profitable for us in the long term. So we're pleased with some of our 2 big markets. And you heard John mentioned Colombia is back on track given the political disruptions we saw last quarter and driving some nice growth for us. Across Latin America, good. Not concerned about Mexico at this point.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. Thanks. We continue to cycle favorable working capital performance versus last year and there's really an anomaly when you look at 2020. First of all, 2020 cash flow, driven by the unique environment, was up significantly. While we're down year-to-year, I think if you look back and compare to '18 and ' 19, you'll see that it's more in -- more in line. Higher raw materials pricing certainly put upward pressure on our inventories. But I think important to note as you mentioned, free cash flow, as you'll see the investment we're making in the business and capex.  So capex up roughly a $120 million, that's really an investment, as Noel talked about earlier, in the long-term help our business and what we're looking to grow. So that investment has an impact on free cash flow. But we think, it's incredibly important for the long term. So you step back and look at cash flow where we are today. We're not concerned about the positioning. We think we are confident in our ability to generate that cash. We're confident in our ability to invest in the future of the Company through capex, so we're comfortable with the current positioning on free cash flow."

            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So what I take away from our performance, I guess both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, is that we continue to make good progress on our strict strategic and operational journey despite the significant volatility we're encountering across our entire business. At the heart of this is our strategy to deliver broad-based, sustainable, profitable growth. Every division, every category, both volume and pricing, that's our aspiration. And over the past few years, we have changed our mindset about how we drive growth. We're more proactive in attacking the opportunities for growth. Think core, premium [indiscernible] faster alternative channels and markets. And of course, we talked a lot about building capabilities. Think digital, data, e-commerce, innovation. All of these are helping us mine these important areas of growth. While lapping our most difficult comparisons in over a decade, we've delivered organic sales growth at the high end of our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. And on a 2-year basis, both pricing and volume growth increased sequentially in the quarter. Importantly, this growth is being driven by our two most important categories: oral care and pet nutrition. Oral care organic sales were up mid-single-digits in Q3 against the mid-single-digit comparison enter up high single-digits year-to-date. We're driving this growth through more impactful innovation, Sure growth and faster growth channels like e-commerce and pharmacies, and hire more efficient marketing spending. Our premiumization strategy is paying off with our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, changing how we interact with the people who use our products. A great example of this is how we've changed our approach to whitening. In U.S, you're familiar with Optic White renewal, which has done incredibly well. Outside the U.S., the story needs to be more about just hydrogen peroxide levels. In China, it's about enzyme-based whitening.  In other markets, we have whitening products targeted towards consumers who had loved tea or coffee, or consumers who love wine or tobacco. We're targeting the whitening opportunity much more broadly with new technologies, formulations, and delivery systems, expanding our growth potential. Pet Nutrition organic sales growth was up 19% in the quarter against an 11% comparison, and is now up 14% year-to-date through quarter 3. This growth is driven by Hill's science-based equity messaging behind our core. It's driven by meaningful premium innovation and the continued expertise of our digital and e-commerce teams.  The launch of Prescription Diet Derm complete those breakthrough therapeutic nutrition for both food and environmental sensitivities has lead to share gains in the category and is being rolled out internationally over the next few quarters. Hills goal of MD pet obesity where study show over 50% of pets are overweight is the impetus for our Hills master brand campaign. This campaign has been rolled out globally, and has driven growth in both our therapeutic, and wellness anti-obesity products. In this type of environment, we couldn't deliver the results without -- this year without the amazing work done by Colgate people every day.  Our customer development organization is reacting quickly to the changing cost environment so we can take pricing as part of the revenue growth management initiative. Marketing in R&D of working together to accelerate the launch of premium innovation to drive mix and profitability. And most importantly, our global supply chain team has delivered these results despite freight and logistics disruptions, plant closures, congested ports, and supplier outages. Importantly, all the efforts we have put into building capabilities over the past few years is not just about driving growth.  It's also about creating an organization that can respond more rapidly to all these challenges we face around the world. For example, our focus on data and analytics is helping our Revenue Growth Management Program pinpoint the best opportunities for incremental pricing as costs continue to rise. We are getting this pricing out in the market more quickly and the data that drives this process gives our people on the ground more confidence in their decisions. Our investment in e-commerce and digital marketing continues to pay off. In our six largest e-commerce market for Oral Care, we finished the third quarter with year-to-date net sales already ahead of 22 net sales -- 2020 net sales and toothpaste share growth in five of the six markets. We've implemented new media buying strategy to drive efficiencies both online and offline, and launched a four-tier training program to enable 14,000 of our employees to help drive our digital strategy. But as I've said, the key through all of this is that we recognize that the strategy is working. And while we address the pressing issues of raw materials, logistics, and supply chain, we can't lose sight of our long-term areas of focus. Our innovation calendar for 2022 will show an increase in the percentage of innovation that is breakthrough and transformational. We've announced our new sustainability and social impact strategy this year, Which includes 11 new targets and actions in areas like Zero Waste, climate change, using less plastic, as well as bright smiles, bright futures, and our diversity equity and inclusion efforts. And we will continue to build our people and capabilities through new ways of working that are truly changing how Colgate people do their jobs. 2021 has been very challenging year for us, and many of these challenges will continue in 2022, but I'm confident of the changes the Colgate people put in place over the past several years which will allow us to continue to deliver our goal of sustainable, profitable growth. And now I'll open it up for questions. Hey, Dara. Sure. Thanks, Dara. So overall, we're pleased with the progress that we're making on Oral Care, particularly in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes. If you take our shares on a constant currency basis, they're relatively flat, which is better than where we had then. When you start to go around the world, particularly as you look at new channels, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in e-commerce and pharmacy. So let's just bounce around the world a bit. North America still has been a little bit soft, but we've seen the shares bounce back nicely in the last 13 weeks and where our shares are actually flat now. And all outlet basis if you take e-commerce and all the untracked channels, our estimation is our shares are back to flat and U.S slightly up, which is good progress, particularly as we've seen the acceleration of some of the premium SKUs that we've launched in the market, particularly whitening over the last 13 weeks. And likewise, our e-commerce shares continue to be good, not as good - strong as our general market, but progressing in North America.  Europe, the shares have been strong. Our Elmex and our strategy behind Elmex and Meridol has been very successful in pushing those businesses across all of our core markets. Our shares continue to be up across that region and we continue to see the shift toward our premium bundles, which was again part of the strategy change that we outlined back at CAGNY that we were going to focus on underserved channels like pharmacy with some of our premium therapeutic equities, like Meridol and Elmex. Latin America, the shares continue to be very strong, flat in the quarter, slightly down as a result of some of the promotional volume that we've given up in Mexico, which has been quite significant, but Brazil shares continue to be pretty good and trending nicely, particularly behind strong revenue growth management initiatives that have characterized the Brazilian subsidiary for so long, but overall pretty good.  Africa, pretty good. Good shares in South Africa, better shares in Russia as we move to a premiumization strategy there, so we're pleased with that aspect as well. China has been a terrific performance in the quarter for us, Dara. We've seen our e-commerce shares across both the Hawley & Hazel joint venture as well as the Colgate franchise be the fastest-growing SKUs in the market. We are the fastest-growing manufacturer in the market. Our shares on the Colgate business in China now are up after many years of declines when you combine both brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce. So overall, very pleased, then again, I think that's a testament to the strategy and the strategic changes we made with our portfolio.  Remember that our big focus in China was getting the premiumization part of the portfolio fixed. The growth in e-commerce has all been premium SKUs, which priced at about 300 index to the general market. So again, I think good innovation at that end of the market is helping to drive our business. And you heard in the upfront comments, obviously, e-commerce across the world, once again is driving a nice shares for us, particularly in Oral Care, where we've had a lot of focus. Coming back to the question around the strategy on Oral Care, again, the focus was premium, innovation and new channels. And if you take our pharmacy growth across the world in toothpaste, very strong, particularly in key markets where we really focused, which have been in Africa, Europe and Latin America, particularly Brazil. You see our pharmacy shares continuing to grow and we've got a good pipeline of innovation coming in 2022 that's going to be specifically tailored towards pharmacy growth. And likewise, e-commerce being the other fast-growth channel and obviously just articulated the success we're having there. Therapeutic was the other big focus that we had in CAGNY in terms of where we're going to push the Oral Care business, particularly toothpaste. We've expanded meridol and elmex strategically in the core markets where we see big pharmacy classes of trade and where we see the therapeutic segment growing. And our success has been quite notable, particularly in those markets, whether you look at Brazil specifically, whether you look at the Middle East, where we've been quite successful as well. So again, I think that strategy seems to be taking hold. Naturals has quite frankly been a little bit soft, and I think that's coming out of the COVID period, where consumers traded to more therapeutic efficacious brand so to speak and the natural segment was softer than we would expect it. So hello, here in North America, shares are stable but not growing as much as we anticipated. We did indicate that we're rolling that out selectively into some core markets around the world. And that will unfold in the balance of this quarter and into the first quarter of next year.  So overall, I think the strategy that we outlined are working certainly as you've seen from the results there, mid-single digits in the quarter and high single on the year for Oral Care, which has been absolutely terrific and consistent, and that is on top of a marketplace that quite frankly is growing considerably below that right now. So again, we think we're driving share globally when you look at it on all outlet basis, particularly given the organic growth sequential improvements that we're seeing. Well, listen, Peter. You've heard it, I think throughout the earnings season so far, that obviously, cost inflation is significant for all fast-moving consumer goods. And we're certainly not immune to that. And -- but what we are very good at is pricing, and you've seen that consistently over time and time over the years, whether it's foreign exchange inflation or raw and packing material inflation, we have found ways over time to recover that in our margin line. And that is certainly the focus right now in the business. The good news is when you have an inflationary environment that's indexed around raw materials, you tend to have everyone looking to take pricing in the market, and that makes it more conducive certainly from a category standpoint and making sure that everyone takes pricing that the volume continues to go along with that. So we're pleased that we've seen pricing in the marketplace, we've been leading that across the board, quite frankly, particularly in emerging markets where we've taken pricing quite aggressively throughout the first half and very much into the third quarter and we've laid out pricing for the fourth quarter and into early 2022. So we'll see the margins begin to recover. Now, the environment you've heard around raw materials and logistics continues to be extremely volatile. And we anticipate that we'll continue to see some headwinds in that space. The team understands that and is putting the strategies in to place in order to recover margins as we move forward. We will also be heightening our focus around Revenue Growth Management. That discipline is going to be really embedded much more so given the fact that we've now put some analytical processes in place to help the teams, as I outlined, which we think is terrific. It will give the teams a lot more confidence on the pricing that we're taking to ensure that we're working with our trade partners to grow category at the same time as we take pricing to recover cost, so we're pleased with that.  Likewise, had a lot of discussions over the last couple of months on our grids our new product grids relative to premium innovation, and making sure that we continue to focus on that area of the business, whereas historically we've under-indexed and we've seen good progress against that, particularly, as you look at some of the premium businesses that we have around the world, whether it'd be Elmex, Meridol or some of the prices we've taken on our therapeutic bundles within the Colgate portfolio. So overall, a tough raw material environment will continue to be very choppy but we're very focused in terms of taking pricing and ensuring that we push our premium innovation moving forward. [Indiscernible] You've come to know Colgate in the fact that we consider our supply chain a competitive advantage for us and that is the fact that we operate globally with some of the most efficient facilities around the world. And the benefit of that is obviously translated into the strong gross margin progression that we've seen over the years. That being said, when you operated global supply chain, you're not immune to decisions taken in locally that will impact that. And obviously in Asia, where we have seen our government's taking actions to stop the spread of COVID, whether it'd be bad or obviously impacting some of our suppliers and our third-party contractors, we've seen disruption in the supply chain. And as a result of that, we have the contingencies in place to move that production elsewhere, which the team has done just a tremendous job in servicing the sales needs of the business. And you've seen that, obviously, in the acceleration or the continuous good topline growth that we've had.  And that's a function of our supply chain ensuring that we meet the demand of our products and our retailers. And we move production around the world to do that. That comes with a cost that certainly we incurred in the quarter. Some of the disruption specifically related to what we referred to in our commentary, we're moving through those very quickly. We have moved behind one that was quite significant and we're back to where we needed to be in terms of output and we're back to pretty close on some of the other ones.  We expect that to be fully back in capacity by the end of the quarter of this quarter, but that being said, the environment is very unpredictable. And we'll continue to try to anticipate some of these things moving forward as we've done, but one can never be for sure when a government decides to come in, and shut down a province, or an area based on their needs. Likewise, this has a big impact obviously on the rest of the supply chain, whether it'd be raw material sourcing, whether it'd be our contractors.  You heard in John's commentary, we did take some decisions, particularly in North America, around some of the contractors that we use in order to clean that up and move into a supply chain strategy that allows us to exit some of those and get more efficiencies moving forward. We're taking all the right decisions moving through the issues that we had in the third quarter but we are not immune to the unpredictability of the supply chain that environment that everyone's faced with today. Sure. Listen, the pet business has been terrific, obviously. I think a lot of the change in strategies that we deployed a couple of years ago, which again are based foundationally on exactly all the stuff we're trying to deploy across the world, really working on the core of our business, looking at premium innovation and continuing to really dial up our focus on high-growth channels. And that's exactly what's unfolded over the last couple of years and that strategy is continuing obviously to get sharper and sharper, as we executed more broadly across the Hills network around the world. A lot of that growth has come out in North America which has been terrific, the double-digit growth compounding each other. U.S. had another outstanding quarter in the third quarter. Again, we're benefiting from a quite buoyant category, but the important part that you called out is we're growing share quite consistently, not only across our wellness products are our core products, but also our therapeutic products and Prescription Diet. We're seeing obviously Vetenerians open back up. That is certainly improving the consumption of our Prescription Diet. We talked at length about the innovation process we had behind Hills, which I think is second to none in the category right now, bringing real science and real therapeutic benefits to pet owners. And we're seeing that translate into obviously more penetration and growing share. We continue to talk about the low awareness of Hills, both in North America and around the world that affords us a significant opportunities We continue to build that brand consistently all over the world and we're continued to invest behind that business. Despite the fact that raw materials are a headwind, we're not going to jeopardize the health of the brand by cutting back on our investment. We will continue to invest to grow awareness And that ultimately is growing penetration in the category, so we feel very good about where we are. Obviously the comparisons continue to get tough, but those have been tough, and we continue to see good progress on the strategy, our ability to take pricing, and our ability to bring in new consumers to the franchise. Morning. Sure. Sure. Yeah, let me jump into that in a little bit more detail. Obviously, it was somewhat of a perfect storm in the third quarter for us as we looked at the business in North America, significant inflation in raw materials, obviously, that came through in the quarter. Logistics was probably the most significant headwind we had in the last couple of months versus where we were previously. Obviously, you're not -- you're clearly aware of the logistics industry and whatever -- what's going on. Tighter capacity, tighter labor, higher costs obviously, which have obviously fueled significant increases in rates internally within North America, not to mention the fact that there's a lot of congestion going on, and a lot of delays in getting product to and from where it needs to be. As a result, we've been very focused on working with our retailers to ensure that we can continue to improve upon that. The other areas I mentioned earlier, we have this incredibly efficient global supply chain, but we do source product from different parts of the world. And you've seen obviously ocean freight increases -- increase dramatically over the last 3 months or 4 months. We have not been immune to that North America, quite frankly, brings quite a bit of its product from overseas. While we have very substantial manufacturing presence in North America, we do bring product from overseas, which has obviously been a victim of those price increases we've seen in ocean freights. The other one is we have seen increased demand, particularly in some of our Oral Care products and we want to continue to service that as we always have consistently and reliably to our trade partners. And as a result of that, we made decisions to airfreight product in to ensure that we had sufficient supply for our retailers. That airfreight did not come without a significant cost. We will move through that clearly as we move through this year and into next year and so we'll see those costs come out. And as you alluded to in your question, we did take some important strategic decisions on how we look at our network and our supply chain, both from a contractor standpoint, as well as what we source internally within our facilities. And made some decisions in the quarter, that will allow us to rework some of those contracts, and hopefully drive more profitability in the long term. So overall, we're pleased. Good oral care growth, which is obviously where we want to see that business continue to grow.  The business is looking at, obviously, a pricing environment is becoming more conducive to take pricing historically, which has not been the case. And they're very focused on their new product grids around premium innovation, which is a strong plan for 2022 and a resurgence of focus around Revenue Growth Management, given how important it is that we offset some of that compression we're seeing at the margin line. So overall, we were -- a difficult quarter for North America, but they've got the plans in place. And we think some of the things that we were working through in the quarter will be behind us as we move forward into 2022. Sure. Let me just address the 3.5% quickly, Wendy. Obviously, that was drawn down by some of the shutdowns we saw across Asia. And the lack of mobility of Southeast Asia, in fact, very little mobility. We saw categories fall off quite dramatically across Southeast Asia and that's certainly had an impact on volume in the quarter. And as you heard John mentioned, if you really want to dimensionalize a lot of the volume softness in the quarter, was liquid hand soap, which was a headwind of 400 basis points in the North America business alone. But let me step back to your broader question on what's going on around the world, coming out of COVID and what we're seeing in terms of category behaviors.  Oral Care was not a COVID beneficiary, and obviously, it was not in the same camp as we saw from some of our personal care businesses which saw significant acceleration in consumption and a more systemic behavior change across the world. Oral care -- as mobility comes back into the market, we continue to see the oral care categories growing, and that's good for us long term, obviously, getting more and more consumers back into stores will allow more consumption, and more category-driven initiatives to take place.  And so we think, over the longer term, we are going to see oral care continue to accelerate. Personal care and homecare were obviously quite significant beneficiaries during COVID. While the liquid hand soap has taken a significant drop-off this year, it still remains above the 2019 levels. And as you rightfully said, we're the number 1 liquid hand soap player certainly in North America and around the world. And that we'll see that behavior, at least, stay with the consumer above the '19 levels, but certainly not anywhere close to where they were in 2020. Hygiene products that we're very focused on in our homecare business, Whether it be dish liquids or floor cleaners, I think we'll continue to see nice growth in those categories. You heard John mentioned the Home Care growth that we've seen as more and more consumers stay home. Obviously, there's more dishes being cleaned and more floor being cleaned and that has allowed that category to continue to be quite robust. But as consumers move back and mobility comes back into markets, are people return to work?  You may see a little bit softness in those longer-term, but overall, we think we're positioned well, particularly in the Oral Care space. If you go to pet food, obviously the significant adoptions that we've seen over the last two years during COVID and the fact that we're now executing much, much better against our strategy. We feel very good about where things are moving there. And there has been a behavior change unquestionably in that category, where consumers have returned to science and nutrition, and very focused on that space which we are obviously very driven by right now. Sure [indiscernible] you're obviously watch this closely and price is always been a key driver of our organic growth given how we look at the markets around the world and we've consistently look for quick ways to get pricing in the market and not only to drive category growth, but obviously to protect the margin which ultimately allows us to protect the advertising. It's worth mentioning that obviously on a two-year stack that this was the highest pricing number we've seen in many years for us. Again, I think it reflects a consistent discipline we have across the board of taking pricing quickly in the markets.   You heard me talk a little bit about how we're using data and revenue growth management now to get that information on the ground quickly to the teams, so they can do what they need to do to analyze, to take pricing across the board. But it's not just going to be pricing. We will look at, obviously, premium innovation and getting our mix improved, not only within our portfolios, but channel mix as well. I talked a little bit about the importance of driving pharmacy growth around the world, which is a growth opportunity for the Company, particularly in Oral Care. That typically trades with a much better margin for the Company given the therapeutic profile of those bundles.  We're obviously going to continue to embed significant revenue growth management initiatives all over the world not just in some of the key inflationary markets. And as we talked about earlier, we're deploying some pretty nice strategies around the emerging markets right now to ensure that we get pricing up beyond just list prices. The other piece of this is productivity. Historically, you've seen us do a really good job around funding the growth. This quarter was no exception, adding 220 basis points to the margin line. But we're really dialing that up, not just simply from a cost standpoint, but really looking at efficiencies across the organization. And going into 2022, looking at how we look to find optimized ways to run our business more efficiently, And we'll continue to do that as we historically have done, and find ways to pull costs out of the system. John mentioned it in his commentary, our overheads were actually down very nicely in the quarter on a percent of sales. And again, I think that's part of the cost focus that we have. And looking at our business and making sure that we're finding ways to optimize. So it's going to be a multitude of different things. And we'll continue to see that evolve. It will take some time to be sure. These things don't move in a straight line. We're taking pricing where we can, as quickly as we can. We're obviously watching the competitiveness of the market. But as I mentioned earlier, this is an environment that everyone is facing right now, which tends to allow everyone to find ways to take pricing up in the category.  So we don't feel we will be in an anti-competitive position, but we will be very close to watch that market to ensure that we continue to remain competitive. The other piece of this -- we haven't really mentioned is the advertising. And we continue to focus on being -- building our brands and being competitive in the marketplace. And that is a key driver of the consistent topline growth you're seeing in the Company right now. And we'll continue to do everything we can to protect that advertising line, and obviously working through the middle of the P&L will be critical in that regard. Sure. Thanks, Jason. So we talked about Oral Care, obviously a big focus for us in the North American business. That was strong again in the quarter up mid single-digits. I won't repeat what I talked about in terms of share growth, particularly last 13 weeks. We are more competitive in the U.S. market. We were not competitive in the first half. We've dialed up our competitiveness and we're seeing the benefits of that translate into better share progression, particularly across some of our premium bundles. We continue to support the business quite well. We think we're in a good place where we need to be, but obviously as any marketer would say, more support is always better. We're looking for increased efficiencies in that business as we move forward in order to accelerate gross margins. As I mentioned earlier, North America was disproportionately hit with raw material, inflation, logistics, and we took decisions very deliberately in the quarter to address demand that obviously had an effect in that quarter. So we anticipate that we'll start to come out as we move through the fourth quarter and certainly as we move into the first half of 2022. That being said, the raw material environment continues to be very volatile and unpredictable. And we'll take the decisions that we need to take to remain competitive. We are very focused on growing the North America business. It is a priority for the Company. We are ensuring that we give them what they need in order to address the challenges and the competitiveness of that marketplace, and we expect that we'll continue to see good gross margin expansion over time. I do think this is a low for us, but I say that in the context of an environment that's quite unpredictable. But given what we saw go through in the third quarter, we anticipate that things will get better as we move forward. Sure. Listen, we've historically led pricing in so many of our markets. And in the emerging markets, you tend to see a little bit more elasticity early on, but we are focused on ensuring that our innovation process is across multiple price tiers. And so when you combine pricing with innovation at the same time, we find that we can rebuild consumption quite quickly. Elasticity tends to dissipate over time certainly as we get the new innovation in the market and communicate that. So we're quite confident in where we are in emerging markets. Developed markets tend to be a little bit more difficult. Historically taking pricing in Europe and North America has been a challenge. We have certainly shifted a lot of our focus to now relaunching brands, relaunching the core, bringing more premium innovation in the market in order to drive pricing and typically then as you bring value-added consumer oriented benefits to the category, you can take pricing and therefore the elasticity is in its dramatics. So we will see it over time. I think there is everyone is raising pricing fundamentally in the categories that we compete in. That tends to reduce the elasticity as well. One might ask, where Is private label in this environment? Private label shares were down in every single category in which we compete fundamentally so the news is, big brands are winning and I think as long as you bring good quality innovation, you continue to support that innovation with good content that's personalized and targeted, we think we can offset some of the elasticity. But that being said, the raw material environment is significant and pricing will be significant over the next few quarters in order to offset that moving forward But we want to do that to make sure we protect our advertising line. Hey, Steve. Yes, Steve. We're very pleased with momentum. I mentioned in my comments, up sequentially or 2-year stack on volume and pricing in this environment, we think is a terrific result driven by our core focus areas, which is Oral Care and Pet Nutrition. Oral Care continues to drive good sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, we talked about at mid singles in the quarter, high singles on the year. Obviously, the pet nutrition business in double-digits, comping double-digit. So again, I think some terrific progress there. Personal care significantly impacted by COVID driven categories.  And liquid hand soap, which is a very big business for us in North America and around the world, obviously, we saw a significant fall-off in the category. The category was down 28%, to give you some context on that, and as John mentioned, that was a 400 basis point headwind. So some of the COVID categories were certainly stabilized as we moved forward and we lap those moving into 2022. But the essence of your question is, where are we with the momentum on Oil-Chem? We feel good about it. We feel good about our 22 plans. We feel good about the pricing we're taking. We feel good about the segments we're competing in.  We feel good about the channel strategy that we've had where we're growing share in the fastest growth channels which are typically e-commerce discounters and pharmacy. And the strategies that were put in place in the portfolio execution of that is delivering against it. So we feel, overall, we're pleased with the underlying momentum on Oral Care, Personal Care as we lapped some of the COVID will improve moving forward. We had some good discussions particularly in North America and Europe around some of the innovation that we need to continue to drive it.  Our market share, interesting now, just as a data point on market share on liquid hand soap in the U.S. was actually up two points in the quarter given the fact that it was still down 400 basis points versus where it was last year on a volume standpoint. So again, we think we're taking the right decisions on portfolio and innovation in order to drive share and continue to recover some of the softness that we saw that was temporarily driven by the COVID expansion last year. Hi, Lauren. I think you're on mute. Hi, Brian. Yes, I'll throw this to understand. But let me just provide a couple of topline comments. Overall, if you go back historically where we are, it compares quite consistently with our historical numbers, that there were some benefits that we certainly had last year on a comp basis around working capital, but let me turn it over to Stan. Will give you a little bit more color on that, Stan? Yeah, I would only add that particularly around capex which has been quite consistent for us over the years, We found -- we see ourselves with some real opportunities to invest in growth areas of the business. And that's certainly what is elevated the capex in the quarter which we think only good news for the long term. Sure, Javier. Thanks. I think the answer is everyone is -- no one is immune to the inflation that we're seeing across the market, both from a raw material standpoint or from a logistics standpoint. Obviously, they may have had different constituents. They look at their business differently than public companies or big multinational companies. But in any case, no one is immune to it. And XIVE had discussions and been able to get out and travel a bit and talk to retailers.  I mean, retailers are recognizing even on their own private label brands, they are going to have to take pricing to offset the significant inflation that's being absorbed in the market right now. So I expect that you'll see all boats rise, so to speak. In this environment, that pricing will go up. There will be certainly some delay with local players as they tend to try to search out a bit more volume as the big players take pricing. But again, I think if you can combine the pricing with the right innovation, which we're very focused on delivering, and adding value to the consumer, the local brands have to react to that in some form or fashion, either with their own innovation or with their own price increases in order to stay competitive from a support standpoint.  So I don't anticipate it's going to be a significant issue, Javier, you know, our business. It's really well, you know, that we innovate across all price points and we have significant focus. It's very deliberate in markets, and looking at shares, and our innovation process across each of the key price segments that we compete in. And that will certainly be the case as we move forward. Sure. Well, listen. Let's step back and look at what's happened over the last two years. And I think it's very clear that we have re-accelerated the topline of the Company. And that has been a core focus for everyone in the organization. It's just growth mindset that talks about elevating our core, our adjancencies, and faster growth channels and doing that across all categories and all geographies. And if you take a basis of two years ago, that's exactly what we were delivering against right now. The investment we believe is fueling that growth. Obviously the strategies, and the execution are big part of it, but we feel very strongly that the acceleration that we've had in investment, both on the oral care side, as well as the nutrition side, have clearly delivered top-line growth. Now we would like to see it reflected in some of the Nielsen based share readings. But the market is very complex now. The go-to-market strategies in the path to purchase for consumers is much more complex than it ever was in the past, and consumers moving between channels, and obviously the emergence of our [Indiscernible] which is quite significant. And in some markets like China has become a very significant part of the category. And we're seeing very strong [Indiscernible] there. Overall, we feel the top-lines moving in the right direction. The investment is supporting that. That being said, we are very focused on making sure that we deliver ROI against every dollar in the P&L. And we have brought in resources from the outside and amplified our capacity around the world, working with WPP, our partner, to get much more granular and much more analytical about how we're investing, particularly our digital spend to make sure it's targeted and we're getting ROI for that spend and we're getting much, much better at that. So as we look at our advertising, will continue to be competitive in terms of what's needed in the marketplace, continue to ensure the health of our brands are protected. But we're very focused from a productivity and efficiency's standpoint looking at that bucket as spend, and making it work harder for us. And that's exactly what we'll expect to see in 2022 as well. Hey, Lauren. Yes, I can. We can hear you just fine. No. Mexico, again, high single-digit performance in the quarter. And obviously a difficult environment, particularly given the aggressive pricing that we've been taking in the marketplace. And that pricing certainly had a little bit of impact on volume shares in the quarter. But nothing that's terribly concerning to us. It's what we consider not real profitable volume, given that we're losing to the lower end of the market. Some of our competitors have been highly aggressive with their promotional -- there promotional levels and we've decided to protect the margin in the P&L, and continue to invest in building the brand. Interesting if you look at some of our equity measures in that marketplace, particularly given that we focus now on really supporting the equity as well as innovation. I was -- attended their budget review just recently and they look terrific. Again, I think -- we feel like we've got a very strong position in that market. We sacrificed a little bit of the promotional share, but that is not unusual when we take pricing and lead the market and will continue to ramp up innovation and ensure that we remain competitive, but nothing to be concerned of. Brazil, likewise, which you didn't ask about, but I'll mention that shares are flat there and doing very, very well, particularly as we see great growth in the pharmacy channel. So the balance of our portfolio has gotten much more therapeutic, which is obviously more profitable for us in the long term. So we're pleased with some of our 2 big markets. And you heard John mentioned Colombia is back on track given the political disruptions we saw last quarter and driving some nice growth for us. Across Latin America, good. Not concerned about Mexico at this point."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Heidi. Good morning and welcome to our 2021 second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 8 and 9 six of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q2 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to provide his thoughts on the current operating environment and how we will continue to deliver on our growth trajectory. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to re-enter the queue. As we report results at the halfway point in 2021, we remain pleased, but not satisfied with our performance so far as we navigate through what can charitably be described as a complicated year. For both the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we delivered growth in organic sales, net sales, operating profit and net income. This is despite difficult comparisons, as we lack last year's strengthen in categories like liquid hand soap and dish soap. We are also dealing with the impact of COVID restrictions in several markets, economic and political uncertainty, strong competitive activity, and of course, significantly heightened raw material and logistics headwinds. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our business through the second half of this year. Because of that, we remain focused on delivering impactful innovation, leveraging our revenue growth management capabilities to deliver on pricing, and driving productivity up and down the income statement. All of these are crucial to deliver long-term sustainable growth. They will help us as we look to deliver TSR at the high-end of our peer group. We delivered 5% organic sales growth in the second quarter, which marked our 10th consecutive quarter delivering organic sales growth either in or above our targeted range of 3% to 5%. As we have discussed before, the key to delivering against our long-term target is delivering balanced growth, which we did once again in the quarter by delivering both volume and pricing growth. We delivered growth in both developed markets with 3% organic sales growth and emerging markets, which delivered 7% organic sales growth. We delivered organic sales growth in every division, but North America. Our largest category, Oral Care, delivered organic sales growth of nearly 10% with organic sales growth across toothpaste, manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrushes and organic sales growth in every division. Innovation continues to be a vital contributor to our Oral Care business as we benefit from new products across all of our divisions. Products like CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste, and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste are all delivering consumer desired benefits and premiumizing our portfolio. Pet nutrition delivered organic sales growth of 15%. Personal Care and Home Care declined on an organic sales basis year-over-year in the quarter as expected, but net sales remain above 2019 levels. Net sales increased 9.5% in the quarter, which was our highest net sales increase in almost 10 years. Foreign exchange was a 4.5% benefit to net sales as we lapped the peak of last year's COVID driven strength in the dollar. After strong gross margin performance in 2020 and in Q1, our gross margin declined in the second quarter due to the rapid acceleration of raw material costs across our business and the lapping of lower promotional levels in Q2 2020. We took additional pricing in the second quarter which will help offset raw material costs in the second half of the year, and we will continue to layer in additional pricing were possible. We expect raw material costs to remain elevated throughout 2021. But we do expect some sequential lessening of inflation as we get into the fourth quarter. Our efforts on premiumization and pricing along with our focus on productivity, like our funding the growth initiatives, will also help us as we look to improve our gross margin performance. In the second quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.0%, which was down 80 basis points year-over-year on both the GAAP basis and the Base Business basis. Year-to-date, our gross margin is 60.4%, down 10 basis points. Again, that is on a GAAP and Base Business basis. For the second quarter, pricing was 90 basis points favorable to gross margin, less than in the first quarter as we lapped lower promotional spending in the year-ago period, when many of our markets reacted to COVID restrictions by pulling back on promotional activity. Raw materials were 370 basis point headwind, as we continue to see significant pressure from resins, fats and oils and agriculture-related costs and many other materials. This includes a slightly favorable transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 200 basis point benefit. Our SG&A was up 100 basis points as a percent of sales for the second quarter on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. This was primarily driven by an increase in logistics costs, and also by a 30 basis point increase in advertising to sales. Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year as our net sales growth and savings programs drove leverage on our overheads. For the second quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 2.5% on a Base Business basis. Our EPS was up 12% on a GAAP basis, and up 8% on a Base Business basis. Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter as we continue to lap very strong working capital performance in the year-ago period. As we discussed previously, our capital expenditures are also up year-over-year as we invest behind growth, productivity and our sustainability strategy. A few comments on divisional performance. North America net sales declined 4% in the second quarter, with organic sales down 4.5% and a modest benefit from foreign exchange. Volumes were down 8.5% in the quarter, driven by Home Care and Personal Care, which saw strong growth in the year-ago period driven by COVID related demand. Pricing across Home Care and Personal Care was positive as we work to offset higher raw material costs. Oral Care organic sales grew mid single digits driven by innovation and pricing. I mentioned CO. by Colgate before, which is helping us further expand into the beauty and direct-to-consumer channels. We are pleased with the initial performance of the Colgate Keep manual toothbrush. It comes with an aluminum handle and by using our replaceable heads, consumers can use 80% less plastic compared to similarly sized Colgate toothbrushes. We're also excited about our Tom's of Maine relaunch, which is bringing new graphics and advertising to a historic natural segment brand. Our logistics issues that we discussed on the first quarter call continued to negatively impact our promotional timing, but service levels have improved and we expect our promotional cadence will normalize as we go through the third quarter. Latin American net sales were up 12.5% with 8.5% organic sales growth and a 400 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. All three categories delivered organic sales growth in the quarter with Oral Care organic sales growth in the high teens. Brazil and Mexico both grew organic and net sales double digits in the quarter. Our strong innovation performance was led by core innovation behind Colgate Total Reinforced Gums in Mexico, which apparently sounds much better in Spanish and Portuguese than English, and several charcoal variants in Brazil. Volume of plus 2.5% in the quarter, despite a sizable negative impact due to political unrest in Colombia, our third largest market in Latin America. We believe this disruption which negatively impacted our distribution network for some time is largely behind us. But political disruption will remain a risk not just in Colombia, but in several markets. Pricing was up 6% despite lapping lower promotional spending in Q2 2020 as well as some incremental pricing in the year-ago period as we look to offset foreign exchange. Europe net sales grew 15% in the quarter. Organic sales grew 5% driven by mid teens growth in Oral Care, offset by declines in Personal and Home Care as we lap COVID related demand in the year-ago period. Volume grew 7% in the quarter offset by a 2% decline in pricing as we lapped lower promotions in the year-ago period as store traffic declined in Q2 2020 due to COVID restrictions. I mentioned Colgate Elixir toothpaste before and we're very excited about this truly differentiated product. We designed it with more of a beauty aesthetic, including skincare inspired ingredients, a unique clear recyclable bottle and liquid glide technology that allows the pace to leave the bottle leaving no messy tube or cap. This product began rolling out across the division in Q2 with further launches this quarter. We delivered 7.5% net sales and 1% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific this quarter, with organic growth in Oral Care partially offset by a decline in Home Care. Volume growth of 3.5% was partially offset by negative pricing as we cycled lower promotional levels in the year-ago period given COVID related lockdowns across the region, with the biggest impact coming on our South Pacific business. We have additional pricing planned in the second half across the division to offset raw material cost inflation. Volume growth was led by India, despite the impact of COVID related disruption in May and Thailand, driven by Naturals innovation in the Colgate Vedshakti and Colgate Panjaved line as we lapped COVID related disruptions in the year-ago period. Our volume in China declined on growth on the Colgate business, which was more than offset by weakness in sales for our Hawley & Hazel joint venture, which is primarily related to inventory reductions in our distributor network. Afro-Eurasia continued its strong performance trends in the third quarter, with net sales growth of 15.5% as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division once again. Volume grew 9.5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 3.5%. Foreign exchange was a 2.5% benefit in the quarter. Oral Care delivered high teens organic sales growth, and we are relaunching several of our natural businesses with new packaging and flavors. Hill's strong growth continued in the second quarter with 18% net sales growth and 15% organic sales growth. Both developed and emerging markets delivered 10% volume growth as our increased investment around the globe is driving this highly differentiated brands. In particular, we are seeing good results from our Hill's Master brand campaign to end Pet obesity as well as our new campaign for Hill's Pet Essentials, our vet distributed wellness product in Europe. And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. There was no meaningful change in our category expectations at this point. The categories that benefited from COVID related demand are behaving in line with our expectations with sales below 2020 levels, but ahead of 2019 levels. Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in many of our markets, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread of COVID and other disruptions related to COVID and this is not in our guidance. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in April. All-in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. We have reduced our gross margin guidance for the year, and we now expect gross margin to be down year-over-year for the full year on both a GAAP and Base Business basis, given the additional cost inflation we have seen. We expect the gross margin percentage to improve sequentially in the second half, which would leave us down modestly for the year. As I mentioned above, we're taking many steps to mitigate the impact of these costs, including additional pricing, optimizing trade spending, accelerating FTG where available and many others. Advertising is still expected to be up on both $1 and a percent of sales basis. Logistics will continue to be a headwind, as costs also have risen faster than anticipated, particularly in the U.S. We still expect these costs to moderate somewhat as we go through the balance of the year. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 23% and 24% for the year on both a GAAP and Base Business basis. On a GAAP basis, we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid single digits, but most likely towards the lower end of that range. On a Base Business basis, we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid to high single digits. Again, we would expect to land at the lower end of that range. And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Hope you're all safe and well this morning. So the overriding message I want to leave with you today is that our strategy to reaccelerate profitable growth by focusing on our core adjacencies all over the world, new channels and markets is really working. As we'd like to say nothing moves in a straight line, but we now have 10 straight quarters of organic sales growth at or above our long-term target range. Year-to-date, we're at the high-end of the range despite difficult comparisons, and continued volatility in the business. We're making good progress on our journey, but we still have more work to do. And as I look back at my comments to you over the past 18 months that we've been dealing with the implications of COVID, there's one consistent theme that we keep coming back to, managing through this crisis with an eye on the future. This is still the appropriate theme, although obviously, some of the elements have changed. The prevalence of the vaccine in many developed markets gives us a sense of guarded optimism. But we've highlighted that many emerging markets which represent almost half of our revenues, the availability of the vaccine remains a very -- remains very low. Case rates are high, and governments continue to put in restrictions to help stop the spread of the virus. We remain hopeful that we will get to a post-COVID sooner rather than later, but we're not there yet. We will continue to manage to the retail and supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer behavior and government actions to stem the spread of the virus, all while doing our best to protect the health and safety of our employees, which remains our number one priority. But there are changing headwinds as well. Last year, we were faced with adverse foreign exchange movements, heightened consumer and customer demand, supply chain volatility, and uncertainty for our customers about changing business models and retail environments. This year, we're faced with unprecedented cost increases raw materials like resin, fats and oils and many others. Logistic networks are taxed, whether it's the trucking and warehousing here in the U.S., or ocean freight coming from Asia to the rest of the world. And we're seeing some political disruption in markets like Colombia and Myanmar. So 18 months into the COVID, many of the challenges are the same. Some have changed, but our approach remains we will manage through the crisis with an eye on the future. And so far, we feel we've done a pretty good job. But we know the markets look forward at our potential not backwards at our achievements. We know that to deliver top tier TSR we need to balance this organic sales growth with volume and pricing, all four of our categories and across all of our divisions. We've talked to you a lot about our changes in strategy that will enable us to continue delivering this balanced growth. First is our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation. John discussed many of these in his commentary, and this improved innovation is a direct result of the changes that Pat and I discussed during our CAGNY presentation. Our emphasis is on faster growing channels and markets continues to pay off to growth in e-commerce, direct-to-consumer, discounters, club stores and pharmacies. We are taking formerly regional brands like Tom's of Maine, Hello, Elmex and Meridol and launching them in select markets and channels to take the advantage of their strong brand equities, and ongoing consumer trends. We're supporting these efforts with increased focus on our digital media and emerging data and analytical capabilities. But we have to deliver gross margin expansion to fund our brand investment. While we know it -- while we now expect gross margin could be down modestly for 2021, it comes on the heels of strong gross margin expansion in 2020 and in the face of unprecedented increases in raw material prices. We will continue to leverage our robust revenue growth management program and drive productivity so we can return to gross margin expansion. We have made progress in our journey to improve our mix, but we have further upside potential on this given the benefits we provide to consumers and the fact that our brands under indexing pricing relative to the category across many geographies. We're working to accelerate our productivity programs like funding the growth wherever possible to try and create additional offsets. All this should help us in our drive to return to gross margin expansion. And while the raw material inflation is obviously negatively impacting our gross margin performance this year, we're optimistic that this raw material inflation could drive an improvement in emerging market fundamentals. Again, we need to first get through the difficulty surrounding COVID that on the back of our continued rebound in emerging market organic sales growth, particularly in Latin America, we have some optimism that we could choose some additional GDP growth and therefore higher category growth on the back end of this movement in commodities. We have seen some of the emerging market currency stabilize for the first time in what seems like several years, and they're optimistic this may be a first step. And since our last call, we have released our 2025 sustainability strategy. This comprehensive plan highlights the actions we're taking around climate, plastics, sourcing, diversity, equity and inclusion and all the other areas that are vital to the future not only of our company, but our communities and our planet. And with that, I'll open it up to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to ask around Latin America in the quarter. I know it's not all the same category and country exposure. But the read through from a lot of other companies that have reported thus far was that the region was really strong with most seeing better performance sequentially. So I know you mentioned Columbia, so is there any way to quantify how much of a headwind you think the disruptions they're causing the quarter? And then maybe just more broadly, can you provide an update on your performance versus the category in the region? And how you're thinking about growth in the back half of the year, just kind of on the heels of your positive GDP commentary there?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Peter. Overall, we're really, really happy with Latin America. You mentioned that, obviously, we saw significant headwinds from the Columbia disruption, which in many respects took almost a month of sales out of that specific country. And despite that, we obviously still delivered very strong top line growth. If you look at our two key markets, Mexico and Brazil, both delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. You've seen now Brazil deliver four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. So obviously, the market seems to be returning despite the fact that we're definitely not out of the woods relative to COVID. But we think as vaccinations improve, particularly in those markets that will continue to help categories. Categories are up on the year, which is good. Despite the fact that we still see limited mobility, we still see some disruptions in particularly the down trade around how retail environments are behaving. But overall, the categories are up, which is good. We had strong innovation in the quarter. We got some good innovation on our core business Colgate Total, which John mentioned, which is driving good share growth. We resist a little bit of the transactional couponing and deep discount in some of those markets. Overall, we've lost a little bit of promotional share, but our baseline shares look good. And the innovation process plans we have in place for the back half are strong as well. Likewise on pricing, we've always been a strong driver of pricing in those markets. We continue to obviously see a lot of headwinds on commodity prices, particularly on tallow prices coming out of Brazil. And we're ramping up for obviously a strong back half relative to how we see pricing evolving, and obviously continuing to drive the volume in the quarter. So overall, I think we're pleased despite the fact that Columbia was a significant headwind to the quarter. Bear in mind, if you look at the overall of Latin America, that region continues to perform exceptionally well on balance, 10.3 -- 10.6 in the fourth quarter, 9.5 in the first, and 8.5 now. So again, I think despite the headwinds, good consistent growth.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Noel, I'm wondering if you could go around the world and talk a little bit about your actual pricing power. I think we all understand less promos, and that was an effect on the reported pricing in Europe and Asia. Obviously, there's mixed effects. But if we kind of clear through all that, can you talk about actual headline pricing that you got in the quarter or that you expect to get later in the year? And to what extent you're able to do that given disposable income in the various markets and competitive activity. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, Rob. Thank you. So let me start macro. Obviously, if you look at developing markets versus developed, developing have obviously moved pricing a little faster than the developed world. And when I say developed, I'm referring to Europe and the U.S. We've seen good pricing movements in Latin America, good pricing movements in Africa. And we've seen competition likewise in those regions follows. Similarly, in Asia, John mentioned in the upfront comments that we took some pricing obviously in the fourth -- first quarter. We were lapping promotions from the second quarter last year, although we have pricing planned quite aggressively in the back half across the Asia region. If you take the developed world, U.S has been a little slow in terms of the market. I think everyone is focusing on promotions and couponings to drive pricing. We haven't seen a lot of list price changes in North America yet and I would say that particularly holds true for Europe as well. Our strategy continues to be as we've outlined, very disciplined approach to revenue growth management. We're taking list pricing where we see the opportunity. We're optimizing our promotional spend, we're looking at price tag architecture, we're looking at all the levers within in revenue growth management to drive pricing overall. The other point is, as you've heard, we're very focused on premium innovation. We continue to under index as I've mentioned, and that's a real opportunity for us to drive overall gross margin percent and dollars, as we look at the back half of the year. So I think the headline is pricing, is going to have to come up in the back half. Everyone is faced with the same challenges. And we anticipate that as we move into the back half, we'll see a little bit better environment around developed markets and continue to focus on our revenue growth management discipline across the world to do that with.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kamil Jagrulla with Credit Suisse.\nKamil Jagrulla: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. A couple questions on local competition. It wasn't really that long ago we were talking about market share gains from local competition in a very in a variety of your kind of major markets. Can you maybe talk about how that's evolved through the pandemic? What position were in -- you're in now, particularly maybe as it relates to pricing couponing promo right at a time where it's necessary to push the pricing through the market because of inflation?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Kamil, thanks for the question. We talked about, I think, throughout 2020 and perhaps touched on it a bit in the first quarter, the strength of our brands and the efficacy of our brands has certainly brought consumers back into the mainstream, so to speak. I mean, a lot of the local brands relative to the credibility they had in the market, which was questionable, we saw consumers returning to big brands and certainly trusted brands in the market. And that was very prevalent in market and categories, like Personal Care, like Home Care, like pet nutrition as well as Oral Care, quite frankly. And so that certainly has benefited us in terms of how we've seen the categories evolve. And I think that will continues particularly given the overarching issues around COVID around the world, consumers are still looking for big, trusted, efficacious brands. And we expect that to continue as we move through the balance of the year.\nJohn Faucher: Kamil, it's John. If I could add something to that, what I would say is, if you look at the success of the local brands over the last 5 or 6 years, it's been a lot of differentiated benefits. Naturals -- the way Naturals is expressed in a number of different markets, different types of packaging, different media strategies, and mostly at premium prices. So as I think as you look at our innovation strategy that Noel talked about, and you look at the type of innovation we're putting out, whether it's Elixir in Europe, or whether it's a Naturals relaunch in Afro-Eurasia, we have the ability to compete more effectively with some of these local brands, and we can drive that premiumization at the same time.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, everyone. It's actually [indiscernible] on for Andrea. Thanks for taking the question. So just at a high-level, can you maybe talk a little bit more about some of the specific actions that you plan to take to help reverse some of those share losses, particularly in the U.S., really in the core toothpaste and distribution categories?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Obviously, the North America performance was below our expectations. We had a lot of factors driving that. Obviously, the impact of logistics challenges that we alluded to in the first quarter, we continue to have some case fill [ph] issues in the second quarter, which obviously had an impact on our promotional ability to put promotions in the market and obviously therefore share. We're working those behind us. And as we move into the back half, those will be ideally gone. So we expect some of that to come back. We've pushed a lot of the premiumization. That market has become highly competitive. We saw increased activity in promotion and couponing in the second quarter. We have adjusted our plans for the back half of the year and our guidance reflects those plans for North America. Likewise in the dish business, we saw similar promotional activity, we've adjusted our promotional plans for the back half. So by and large, we saw obviously some logistics challenge and competitive activity. Obviously some of the comparisons that we had last year dealing with elevated categories, obviously softening the dish liquid and the liquid hand soap category in the second quarter, but we anticipate as we move through the back half things will set down, and we have strong innovation and promotion plans to rebuild the North America shares.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: Hi. Thanks so much for the question. I had a question specifically on China. I\u2019m conscious the margins were better in APAC than the rest of the world, but also on a pullback in marketing spending with China declining. Can you just provide any additional perspective on what you're seeing in that market, and maybe by category and the rationale behind the marketing and how you see that going forward? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. So as John alluded to in his comments, we did see some weakness in the China business from our Hawley & Hazel partner that was specifically driven by -- that's a business that heavily driven down trade. We have very strong distribution in CDE cities and as we've seen e-commerce continue to grow, our distributor network has been cautious on managing inventories as we've seen the brick-and-mortar categories, fundamentally flat not growing so far in the first half of the year. As e-commerce will potentially continue to accelerate and those inventories get drawn down, we expect that will sort of through in the back half of the year. Importantly, I think we're seeing terrific growth on our e-commerce business, as we talked about over the last couple quarters. In fact, our Colgate franchise and our Darlie franchise were two of the three fastest growing brands in e-commerce retail environment in the quarter. And obviously up significantly versus where we were in the first quarter from a share standpoint, which is really nice to see. That's driven behind a lot of good premium innovation that we've had in the quarter, the miracle repair continues to do well. We've launched a series of premium Enzyme toothpaste as well. So that continues to perform well. And the advertising is there in the back half to continue to grow that business as we go out the year. So we're comfortable with where we are from an advertising standpoint. Obviously, the comps versus a quarter last year where we had drawn down a bit of our advertising, we saw a little bit of elevation in Asia in the second quarter, but good plans in the back half to continue to drive share.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nChris Armes: Hey, everyone. Good morning. This is actually Chris Armes on for Mark. Just wanted to talk a little bit about Hill's growth, obviously very good. Maybe on the growth, if you could parse out how much is share gains versus just elevated category growth? Can you kind of talk also about growth by geography? And then also the growth from kind of new -- from expansion to new markets versus existing markets? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, Chris. Yes, overall, listen, Hill's had another fantastic quarter, 50% comping, obviously a really strong quarter last year where we did double-digit growth as well. So we're hitting on all cylinders on that business. Growth is across the world. We had all of our regions up with exception of Japan. Market share is up across the board typically and where we're gaining market share is mainly in the U.S., which is our largest market as you know. We saw a good share growth across most retail environments, both on the Base Business, the Science Diet business as well as the Prescription Diet business, that's behind a continued focus on the strategy, which is the core renovation, premium innovation, new channels, in this case continuing to grow online as well as farm and feed. And obviously continuing to see an increase in the Prescription Diet business, which has more and more pet owners return to their vets, we see the benefit of vet coming through as well. So across the board, very strong growth and we continue to obviously invest for growth in that business. And that continues to be the strategy moving into the back half of this year.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nNoel Wallace: Thank you. Obviously, an extremely volatile quarter. But again, I think we're continuing to execute our strategy. As we've talked about, for the last couple years, some real opportunities ahead and some challenges that will face as we have in the past. And so I'd simply want to extend my thanks to all the Colgate people listening for their incredible resilience during these difficult times and look forward to a good back half of the company. Thank you.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",

            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Hope you're all safe and well this morning. So the overriding message I want to leave with you today is that our strategy to reaccelerate profitable growth by focusing on our core adjacencies all over the world, new channels and markets is really working. As we'd like to say nothing moves in a straight line, but we now have 10 straight quarters of organic sales growth at or above our long-term target range. Year-to-date, we're at the high-end of the range despite difficult comparisons, and continued volatility in the business. We're making good progress on our journey, but we still have more work to do. And as I look back at my comments to you over the past 18 months that we've been dealing with the implications of COVID, there's one consistent theme that we keep coming back to, managing through this crisis with an eye on the future. This is still the appropriate theme, although obviously, some of the elements have changed. The prevalence of the vaccine in many developed markets gives us a sense of guarded optimism. But we've highlighted that many emerging markets which represent almost half of our revenues, the availability of the vaccine remains a very -- remains very low. Case rates are high, and governments continue to put in restrictions to help stop the spread of the virus. We remain hopeful that we will get to a post-COVID sooner rather than later, but we're not there yet. We will continue to manage to the retail and supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer behavior and government actions to stem the spread of the virus, all while doing our best to protect the health and safety of our employees, which remains our number one priority. But there are changing headwinds as well. Last year, we were faced with adverse foreign exchange movements, heightened consumer and customer demand, supply chain volatility, and uncertainty for our customers about changing business models and retail environments. This year, we're faced with unprecedented cost increases raw materials like resin, fats and oils and many others. Logistic networks are taxed, whether it's the trucking and warehousing here in the U.S., or ocean freight coming from Asia to the rest of the world. And we're seeing some political disruption in markets like Colombia and Myanmar. So 18 months into the COVID, many of the challenges are the same. Some have changed, but our approach remains we will manage through the crisis with an eye on the future. And so far, we feel we've done a pretty good job. But we know the markets look forward at our potential not backwards at our achievements. We know that to deliver top tier TSR we need to balance this organic sales growth with volume and pricing, all four of our categories and across all of our divisions. We've talked to you a lot about our changes in strategy that will enable us to continue delivering this balanced growth. First is our focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation. John discussed many of these in his commentary, and this improved innovation is a direct result of the changes that Pat and I discussed during our CAGNY presentation. Our emphasis is on faster growing channels and markets continues to pay off to growth in e-commerce, direct-to-consumer, discounters, club stores and pharmacies. We are taking formerly regional brands like Tom's of Maine, Hello, Elmex and Meridol and launching them in select markets and channels to take the advantage of their strong brand equities, and ongoing consumer trends. We're supporting these efforts with increased focus on our digital media and emerging data and analytical capabilities. But we have to deliver gross margin expansion to fund our brand investment. While we know it -- while we now expect gross margin could be down modestly for 2021, it comes on the heels of strong gross margin expansion in 2020 and in the face of unprecedented increases in raw material prices. We will continue to leverage our robust revenue growth management program and drive productivity so we can return to gross margin expansion. We have made progress in our journey to improve our mix, but we have further upside potential on this given the benefits we provide to consumers and the fact that our brands under indexing pricing relative to the category across many geographies. We're working to accelerate our productivity programs like funding the growth wherever possible to try and create additional offsets. All this should help us in our drive to return to gross margin expansion. And while the raw material inflation is obviously negatively impacting our gross margin performance this year, we're optimistic that this raw material inflation could drive an improvement in emerging market fundamentals. Again, we need to first get through the difficulty surrounding COVID that on the back of our continued rebound in emerging market organic sales growth, particularly in Latin America, we have some optimism that we could choose some additional GDP growth and therefore higher category growth on the back end of this movement in commodities. We have seen some of the emerging market currency stabilize for the first time in what seems like several years, and they're optimistic this may be a first step. And since our last call, we have released our 2025 sustainability strategy. This comprehensive plan highlights the actions we're taking around climate, plastics, sourcing, diversity, equity and inclusion and all the other areas that are vital to the future not only of our company, but our communities and our planet. And with that, I'll open it up to your questions. Sure. Thanks, Peter. Overall, we're really, really happy with Latin America. You mentioned that, obviously, we saw significant headwinds from the Columbia disruption, which in many respects took almost a month of sales out of that specific country. And despite that, we obviously still delivered very strong top line growth. If you look at our two key markets, Mexico and Brazil, both delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. You've seen now Brazil deliver four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. So obviously, the market seems to be returning despite the fact that we're definitely not out of the woods relative to COVID. But we think as vaccinations improve, particularly in those markets that will continue to help categories. Categories are up on the year, which is good. Despite the fact that we still see limited mobility, we still see some disruptions in particularly the down trade around how retail environments are behaving. But overall, the categories are up, which is good. We had strong innovation in the quarter. We got some good innovation on our core business Colgate Total, which John mentioned, which is driving good share growth. We resist a little bit of the transactional couponing and deep discount in some of those markets. Overall, we've lost a little bit of promotional share, but our baseline shares look good. And the innovation process plans we have in place for the back half are strong as well. Likewise on pricing, we've always been a strong driver of pricing in those markets. We continue to obviously see a lot of headwinds on commodity prices, particularly on tallow prices coming out of Brazil. And we're ramping up for obviously a strong back half relative to how we see pricing evolving, and obviously continuing to drive the volume in the quarter. So overall, I think we're pleased despite the fact that Columbia was a significant headwind to the quarter. Bear in mind, if you look at the overall of Latin America, that region continues to perform exceptionally well on balance, 10.3 -- 10.6 in the fourth quarter, 9.5 in the first, and 8.5 now. So again, I think despite the headwinds, good consistent growth. Sure, Rob. Thank you. So let me start macro. Obviously, if you look at developing markets versus developed, developing have obviously moved pricing a little faster than the developed world. And when I say developed, I'm referring to Europe and the U.S. We've seen good pricing movements in Latin America, good pricing movements in Africa. And we've seen competition likewise in those regions follows. Similarly, in Asia, John mentioned in the upfront comments that we took some pricing obviously in the fourth -- first quarter. We were lapping promotions from the second quarter last year, although we have pricing planned quite aggressively in the back half across the Asia region. If you take the developed world, U.S has been a little slow in terms of the market. I think everyone is focusing on promotions and couponings to drive pricing. We haven't seen a lot of list price changes in North America yet and I would say that particularly holds true for Europe as well. Our strategy continues to be as we've outlined, very disciplined approach to revenue growth management. We're taking list pricing where we see the opportunity. We're optimizing our promotional spend, we're looking at price tag architecture, we're looking at all the levers within in revenue growth management to drive pricing overall. The other point is, as you've heard, we're very focused on premium innovation. We continue to under index as I've mentioned, and that's a real opportunity for us to drive overall gross margin percent and dollars, as we look at the back half of the year. So I think the headline is pricing, is going to have to come up in the back half. Everyone is faced with the same challenges. And we anticipate that as we move into the back half, we'll see a little bit better environment around developed markets and continue to focus on our revenue growth management discipline across the world to do that with. Sure. Kamil, thanks for the question. We talked about, I think, throughout 2020 and perhaps touched on it a bit in the first quarter, the strength of our brands and the efficacy of our brands has certainly brought consumers back into the mainstream, so to speak. I mean, a lot of the local brands relative to the credibility they had in the market, which was questionable, we saw consumers returning to big brands and certainly trusted brands in the market.

Sure, Chris. Yes, overall, listen, Hill's had another fantastic quarter, 50% comping, obviously a really strong quarter last year where we did double-digit growth as well. So we're hitting on all cylinders on that business. Growth is across the world. We had all of our regions up with exception of Japan.

And obviously continuing to see an increase in the Prescription Diet business, which has more and more pet owners return to their vets, we see the benefit of vet coming through as well. So across the board, very strong growth and we continue to obviously invest for growth in that business. And that continues to be the strategy moving into the back half of this year. Thank you. Obviously, an extremely volatile quarter. But again, I think we're continuing to execute our strategy. As we've talked about, for the last couple years, some real opportunities ahead and some challenges that will face as we have in the past. And so I'd simply want to extend my thanks to all the Colgate people listening for their incredible resilience during these difficult times and look forward to a good back half of the company. Thank you."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. \nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Sarah. Good morning and welcome to our 2021 first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. including those identified in table six of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. I will provide commentary on our Q1 performance as well as our latest thoughts on 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel to discuss our 2021 priorities. We will then open it up for Q&A. As usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question. If you have further questions, you are welcome to re-enter the queue. We started 2021 in positive fashion with strong organic sales growth despite a very difficult comparison, which included some consumer pantry loading in March of last year. Our net sales grew 6% in the quarter. Organic sales growth of 5% was driven by 0.5% organic volume growth and a 4.5% increase in pricing. Foreign exchange was a 1% tailwind in the quarter. While the tough comparisons, particularly, impacted our trends in developed markets, which were flat on an organic sales basis in the quarter, we delivered double-digit organic sales growth in emerging markets with volume up 5.5% and pricing up 6%. We also delivered organic sales growth in three of our four categories: Oral Care, Home Care and Pet Nutrition, while Personal Care organic sales declined due to difficult comparisons. We believe our strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation, which Noel and Pat Verduin talked about at CAGNY is bearing fruit and we will continue to focus in this area to drive future growth. Our efforts on premiumization and pricing along with our focus on productivity like our funding the growth initiatives drove improvement year-over-year in our gross margin despite a worsening raw materials environment. This gross margin expansion was a key factor in allowing us to deliver base business earnings per share growth in line with our full year guidance despite higher logistics costs, incremental advertising spending and investment to build capabilities. In the first quarter, our gross profit margin was 60.7% on both a GAAP basis where we were up 50 basis points year-over-year and a base business basis where we were up 40 basis points. For the first quarter, pricing was 170 basis points favorable to gross margin, while raw materials were a 310 basis point headwind. This is a large impact for our first quarter and it was driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like resins, fats and oils, agriculture-related costs and the transactional impact from foreign exchange. Productivity was a 180 basis point benefit. Our SG&A was up 90 basis points as a percent of sales for the first quarter on both a GAAP and base business basis. This was primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation and e-commerce. Our SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily, in the US and investments behind innovation. Excluding advertising and logistics, our SG&A ratio declined year-over-year. For the first quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 5.5% year-over-year, while it was up 5% on a base business basis. Our EPS was down 4% on a GAAP basis and up 7% on a base business basis. Our free cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter against a very difficult comparison. The decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of accounts payable and other liabilities, which was mostly due to changes in the timing of payables and income tax payments. A few comments on our divisional performance. North America net sales were down 0.5% in Q1 with organic sales down 1.5%, a 50 basis point benefit from the Hello acquisition and a 50 basis point benefit from foreign exchange. Our volume declines in the quarter were primarily due to a combination of category deceleration in the face of difficult comparisons as we cycled last year's COVID pantry loading, logistics issues related to a warehouse transition on our US business that impacted our shelf availability and our market shares and the winter storms in February. The logistics issues lessened over the last month of the quarter as service levels improved, and we expect service levels to return to normal by the end of the second quarter. Pricing grew mid-single digits in the quarter, as our efforts in revenue growth management drove pricing growth across all our categories. The combination of higher raw materials costs, higher underlying logistics costs and costs related to remediating the company's specific logistics issues, pressured margins in the North America division. Despite these headwinds, we continue to invest in advertising, particularly behind premium innovation like Colgate Renewal and the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening Pen and behind the continued strength of Colgate Optic White Renewal. Latin America net sales were up 2%, as 9.5% organic sales growth was mostly offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. We continue to deliver broad-based organic sales growth in Latin America with organic sales growth in all three categories and in every hub. As we highlighted at CAGNY, our innovation in Latin America is driving growth in the premium segment of the toothpaste category. In Brazil, Colgate Total is gaining share behind Colgate Total anti-tartar and our natural extracts line is gaining share particularly behind Charcoal. Our toothpaste value share is flat year-to-date in Brazil in measured channels and is up year-over-year in e-coms. Europe net sales grew 6% in the quarter. Organic sales were down 2%. Volume declined 3.5% in the quarter, as we lapped strong shipments in the year ago period, which was driven by COVID-related demand in pantry loading. Pricing was plus 1.5%, as we took pricing across all categories to help offset raw material inflation. We're launching equity campaigns across our core Oral Care equity, Colgate, meridol, and elmex and we're excited about the launch of Sanex microbiome, which Pat talked about at CAGNY. We delivered 16.5% net sales and 11% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific led by volume growth across our biggest markets, Greater China, India and the Philippines. While China and India benefited from comparisons that included COVID-related shutdowns in 2020, our innovation continues to drive improved underlying performance, particularly in e-commerce. Over the next several quarters we will begin to roll out more premium innovation in brick-and-mortar in China, like our Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste, leveraging the success we have had online in transforming our portfolio. Africa/Euroasia net sales grew 8.5%, as we delivered strong organic sales growth throughout the division. Volume grew 5% in the quarter, while pricing was up 8%. Foreign exchange was a 4.5% headwind. This growth was led by our toothpaste and manual toothbrush businesses, although we also delivered organic sales growth in Personal and Home Care. Our business in Turkey delivered strong sales and market share performance and launched significant premium innovation in naturals, charcoal and white. Phil started the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth, despite lapping significant growth in the year ago period. Developed markets led the growth, particularly the US, Canada and Europe, led by e-commerce. Emerging markets grew organic sales greater than 20% in the quarter through a combination of volume and pricing growth. We're very excited about our Hill's equity campaign addressing pet obesity. This global campaign is leveraging digital, in-store, in-office and traditional media assets to drive growth in our weight control products across both our prescription and wellness businesses. And now for guidance. We still expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range. As we think about our current organic growth assumptions versus where we were three months ago, we're probably a little more cautious on developed markets. As you have seen from the scanner data, our categories moved negative more quickly than we had anticipated and we expect that to continue in the short term. Hopefully, this allows for some of the volatility to play itself out sooner in the year and we will see trends stabilize more quickly. Coming into this year in categories where consumption rose last year due to COVID, we expected 2021 consumption levels to be below 2020, but above the levels we saw in 2019. That is the case so far across our developed markets businesses, although year-to-date these categories are slightly weaker than expected. Categories like toothpaste, where usage did not spike in relation to COVID, should normalize more quickly, as we move past some of the aggressive pantry loading in March and April of last year, and we're beginning to see that happen and scale has returned to growth in the last several weeks. We are encouraged by how we started the year in emerging markets. We saw broad-based organic sales growth in our emerging markets across all the divisions and with a good balance of volume and pricing. Comps will get more difficult as we go through the year, but we believe we have solid momentum. Please note that given widespread COVID outbreaks in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and India, we could still see an impact from government actions to stem the spread at COVID and other disruptions related to COVID and this is not in our guidance. Using current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low-single-digit benefit for the year, although slightly less favorable than when we gave guidance in January. All in, we still expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%. Our gross margin guidance remains unchanged, as we expect our gross profit margin to be up year-over-year in 2021, on both the GAAP and base business basis. As we mentioned on our 2020 year-end call, raw materials began the year moving higher and faster than we had expected. This trajectory has continued through the first quarter as you all know. We are still laser-focused on driving our gross margin higher, but the significant increase in costs across our materials base obviously requires additional pricing and productivity. Advertising is still expected to be up on both a dollar and a percent of sales basis. Logistics also continues to be a headwind, particularly in the US, where costs also have risen faster than anticipated. We expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term but to moderate later in the year. Our tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% and 24.5%. We point out that our guidance does not account for any changes in US corporate tax rates, given the recent change in administration. On a GAAP basis we still expect earnings per share growth in the low to mid-single-digits. On a base business basis, we continue to expect earnings per share growth in the mid-to high-single-digits. The adverse moves in foreign exchange and raw materials have moved us slightly lower in that range over the past few months, but it is still early in the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Noel.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll keep my commentary brief since we've -- so we have plenty of time for the Q&A. I think the results for the quarter really speak for themselves. Obviously we're really pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite the significant volatility in headwinds, we delivered strong results around the world and up and down our P&L. While we've made progress in our strategic areas we've been discussing, we still have a lot to do in the balance of the year. Here are our key priorities for the remainder of 2021: Continue to drive broad-based growth. Our priorities here are the same as we've discussed for the past several years. We need to grow volume and pricing. We need organic sales growth in every category and in every division in both emerging and developed markets. In order to do this, we'll continue to ramp up our breakthrough and transformational premium innovation. We delivered high-single-digit growth in toothpaste in the first quarter, despite lapping solid growth in the year-ago period, which helped us drive high-single-digit growth in our Oral Care business. We're driving growth through innovation like Colgate Renewal in the US, Colgate Enzyme Whitening toothpaste in China and our natural extracts line and Colgate Total Anti-Tartar Line in Latin America. As Pat and I discussed at CAGNY, this is a marathon not a sprint, but we're making good progress, which will continue as we shift our resources, continue to build new skills and even adapt how we motivate our teams. Pricing is also an important element of growth. And behind our revenue growth management efforts, we continue to drive strong pricing as we look to increase our price index versus the market as well as offsetting rising costs. You're hearing about rising costs from every company this quarter and we're seeing inflation on pretty much every line of the P&L, but especially raw materials, warehousing and logistics. Naturally our pricing plans are focused. We just discussed, we're battling the cost inflation across the board. We are also driving savings through funding the growth and other efficiency initiatives, which helped to offset these headwinds an effort, Stan, our new CFO, is spearheading for us. We do not expect these headwinds to abate anytime soon, so we have to continue to invest in marketing and building capabilities for future growth while delivering on our earnings guidance. We know we need to be disciplined and efficient in this area. The third is maintaining our focus on building out the key pillars of our long-term strategy while simultaneously managing through all of the volatility. That includes building our capabilities on innovation, e-commerce, digital and data and analytics, progressing on ESG, including increasing our commitments on DE&I and advancing our 2025 sustainability targets, and then ultimately navigating to return to work for most of our office-based employees. We are building a team and a culture at Colgate that is focused on adapting and changing to this volatile world. We're embracing new strategies and new ways of working and it's paying off. We've had a good start to 2021 and we're looking to maintain our momentum through the rest of the year. So with that, why don't we open it up to questions?\nOperator: All right. Thank you so much. Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience. [Operator Instructions] Okay. We will take the first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning guys.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So can you give us an update on category growth rates in some of your key emerging markets as we cycle COVID? Obviously, there's a lot of volatility short-term but I'm thinking more looking out longer-term, just an update here on volume growth and per capita consumption development opportunity going forward as well as any thoughts on pricing mix and trade-up potential? Has anything changed here longer-term more structurally as we think about the consumer? And what are your strategy adjustments? And, obviously, it won't be a monolithic answer. So maybe you can compare and contrast some of the different emerging markets? And how that might be different? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks Dara. If you go back, obviously, it depends on the geography. And what we've talked about consistently I think is the volatility that we're seeing all over the world and highly dependent on how countries have treated and dealt with COVID and the rate of incidents in those countries. Obviously if you start with Asia, the categories are coming back, although still not back to where we were pre-COVID due to some of the store closures that we continue to see across Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia coming back in terms of a category development standpoint. And that's based on the fact that particularly in China, you see the COVID issues being put to rest and consumers returning to some level of normality. Thailand continues to be a challenge. You've heard I think consistently from others that that market highly dependent on tourism, so it's impacted that category. India, we won't talk a lot about India as we haven't announced yet, but suffice it to say that they had easy comps from last year from a category standpoint but you're starting to see those numbers come back quite nicely. Moving on to Latin America. Again surprisingly, we've seen a very resilient Latin America particularly our business there. In terms of where we see the categories playing out, toothpaste is starting to come back although it started off quite slowly but we've seen particularly in the recent readings, the category returning to growth, which is good. Africa continues I think to perform okay. I think Africa is a real uncertain environment right now relative to the rate of vaccinations in that geography. So that will have an impact. But if you take that holistically across emerging markets, I think the important area here is that, obviously, those markets were from a GDP standpoint severely impacted in 2020. As you see oil prices come back those tend to benefit emerging markets and that will play out in higher GDP, some inflation, obviously, allows us to continue to take pricing in those markets. And I think as you see the rate of vaccinations increase, those markets are likely to come back quite nicely particularly in the back half of this year. From a pricing standpoint, consistently across all emerging markets, we've been able to take strong pricing given the strength of our businesses and that really started back in 2020. And you've seen a competitive environment is, obviously, having to offset a lot of the raw material inflation that we've seen taking pricing, which has allowed the emerging markets to take a little bit more value in their categories. And clearly there from a per cap standpoint, we continue to be investing in our per capita programs particularly across Africa, parts of Asia and Latin America and that is consistent and I think that margin growth that we've had has allowed us to continue to invest in areas like per cap, which we think obviously bode well for the long-term.\nOperator: And we will take the next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was curious if\u2026\nStan Sutula: Hi Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: \u2026 I know pricing obviously is a key part of your strategy, Noel. But I was particularly intrigued by the pricing in Europe this quarter. I know it was discussed as in relation to cost inflation and maybe a little bit less on the side of the longer-term strategic revenue growth management initiatives. But I was just curious, because the ability to get pricing through in Europe even from a consumer from a competitor standpoint is pretty notable. And I believe, one of your -- a large HPC and food player as we've talked about, an actual a tougher pricing environment in Europe. So I'd love some more color on that if possible. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Two things, I think the pricing environment in Europe historically has been extremely difficult, as we all know. That being said, if you go back to a lot of the strategies that we've been putting in place around revenue of management which is a discipline that we're really trying to embed across -- broadly across our commercial organizations, we're finding ways to get pricing into the P&L particularly through how we manage gross to net. Also in Europe is the strength of the elmex brand, obviously Meridol and elmex being strong premium brands with a strong brand loyalty allow us to take more aggressive pricing in those markets. And we've been disciplined to do that on a pretty sequential basis, across that continent. So that has obviously played nicely through the P&L. So I'd say, a combination of revenue growth management discipline really taking hold more work to do to be sure. And some of the strength of our toothpaste equities in that region which have allowed us to take more pricing. And to a certain extent, as we saw more lockdowns early on in the year, the promotional environment was probably a little bit more benign. But we've anticipated that will continue to accelerate as store traffic increases in the back half of the year.\nOperator: All right. [Operator Instructions] We will take the next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I just want to go back to the pricing comment. I think what you said, obviously, you have been able to price to inflation in some of these countries. And in particular, you sounded -- Noel, you sounded very positive about LatAm. Do you think you can still pull those levers there? And to John's comment before like if you, have to take more pricing in some places is that like you're trying to price to inflation so that you can go into the guide, because the two other centers as at the end of the prepared remarks implied, as if you're not tracking to the high end of your guide, you're tracking more at this point in the low end. So what would take you to the high-end of the EPS guide?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah, two aspects to talk to, there's obviously -- there's two implications on, how we think about pricing. There's the foreign exchange aspect, which obviously moves through transactionally into the margin line. And we tend to try to offset that. And there's obviously then commodity inflation that we see locally in the markets and we obviously look to gauge our price increases based on where the market is and what the consumer will bear. But if you take a step back for a minute, it's the strength of our brands, I think in emerging markets that have really allowed us to do more on the pricing line. You talked about Latin America. If you go back last year in Latin America, we took 9.5% pricing in the third quarter 9.5% pricing in the fourth quarter. And I think -- and even if you look at it across emerging markets, it was getting ahead of some of the pricing environment that we've incurred the raw material pricing environment we've seen this year. So as you build that pricing into your P&L that really sets us up for strong growth on the pricing side in 2021. We've continued to take pricing as we've seen an elevated pricing -- inflation environment around raw and packed. And that's allowed us obviously to deliver the gross margins in the quarter. So again, we continue to look at the marketplace. So as I mentioned earlier, our competitors are facing the same level of inflation that we are. And as a result, that environment versus just foreign exchange creates a healthier environment to take pricing particularly in emerging markets.\nOperator: Okay. We will take the next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Jason. \nJason English: Hey. Thank you for slotting me in. So, I guess, I'll come after the gross margin question, since no one's really pushed into it yet. The inflation rate this quarter, 310 bips drag, it's almost 8% year-on-year COGS inflation. Is it safe to assume that that number should escalate as we progress through the year? And assuming that's the case, which I think seems to be a reasonable assumption, what are the offsets that will escalate in kind to try to help you still get gross margin expansion in this environment, which would truly be phenomenal? Are we looking for more productivity than is typical in the year? Price continuing to climb, or are there other offsets we should consider?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Jason. I think, we would anticipate, as we\u2019ve built into our guidance that costs will continue to remain inflated as we move through the year. And as we start to lap some of the increases that we saw later in the back half of last year, it will become a little bit more benign in that regard. A couple of things. Obviously, continuing to be highly disciplined about taking pricing and taking it quickly and that will continue to be the case. We've got to be courageous and bold in that regard. Obviously, we watch that carefully, based on what's happening in the local marketplace, but straight price increases will continue to be an important element, as we look at the back half of the year. The revenue growth management aspect we've referred to a couple of times that is an important discipline that we really need to embed across our organizations. And I think we've seen some fruits of that, at least, last year and coming into the first quarter this year. So that will continue to happen. The other important aspect to look at is, if you look at the mix of our business, last year we saw significant lifts from some of the lower-margin categories that were driven by COVID, so things like bar soap and liquid hand soap. As oral care begins to normalize and the category returns to historical trends, that will certainly help from a mix standpoint. Likewise, our professional health business, which obviously was significantly impacted by closures, although that business is starting to come back quite nicely, still not back to where it was from a store opening standpoint, as well as travel retail. And as that continues to unfold through the balance of the year, that will likewise help a bit. And obviously, as foreign exchange, we talked a little bit, not seeing the benefit we initially anticipated, but still somewhat of a benefit that will ultimately help through to the P&L. The other aspect, I'd say, Jason, is moving -- getting volume moving through the P&L in the back half. Obviously, taking pricing allows us to support the advertising and innovation, which is critically important. And we've always said, that's part of our strategy, make sure we get the margin to support the advertising and the investment and that will obviously bode well for the pricing that we see in the back half of -- excuse me, in the volume that we anticipate to improve in the back half of the year. \nOperator: And the next question is going to be from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Chris.\nChris Carey: Hi. Hey. Good morning. How are you? So if we're not mistaken, this is the best two-year stack in Hill's, I guess in like 20 years. And so, I want to understand, just how you view sustainability of consumption trends in the business today, whether you think there are incremental distribution opportunities, as pet ownership has increased, or if you're just gaining market share. Obviously, this one's a little bit harder for us to track, given the channels in which it fits, but basically the concept here is, there's quite a bit of momentum. And just want to get your thoughts on sustainabilities and what you see as the opportunities going forward. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Chris. And clearly, really, really happy with the progress, because it really underscores and gives us confidence in our strategy, 7% organic on 2020 -- comping 2020 last year is terrific. So a couple of aspects that excite us relative to the category. One, you mentioned that the pet ownership is up. That's an annuity, quite frankly, for the category. As you see pet ownership increase, obviously, those pets need to be fed and that will ultimately play back in the dynamics of the category moving forward. Second is, the aspects associated with our business, low penetrated business for Hill's, low brand awareness business for Hill's. So that, again, underscores and underpins the strategy that we have, continue to increase investment, continue to drive core innovation and continue to drive premium innovation on the prescription diet, particularly as we see consumers returning into the vet space or returning to visit their vets. That will, obviously, bode well for the Prescription Diet business. But again tough comps moving forward to be sure, but the business has real momentum not only in the US, which continues to perform exceptionally well, but emerging markets likewise had a terrific quarter and a lot of head space there for us. But we're being very methodical and thoughtful on how we generate this growth. We're looking for long-term sustainable profitable growth building the brands and markets and doing that the right way. And we have the momentum to do that and the flexibility in the P&L. Obviously, we've seen some rising prices on agricultural commodities and we need to take some pricing as we did. But overall, the health of the business underscored by pet ownership, the low brand awareness and penetration that we have gives us confidence that we can continue to drive this business forward.\nOperator: All right. And your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. Good morning. Just on the housekeeping. The plant in India, I think -- correct me, if I'm wrong, but I think that has a fair bit of export business throughout the rest of the region. So, just wondering, if you're worried about that, if you think there could be any disruption there, you should be getting people to the plan. I know, you don't want to comment on the operations. I'm just thinking about your business in the region, whether that plant is still a big deal from an export perspective, and if there could be any pressure from the outbreak right now? But then my other question is, you haven't talked much about the skin care business. And I'm just wondering, sort of big picture how are trends there? Again, apart from COVID, but I know you were going to distribute or expand distribution for example in China, how is that going? How are you feeling about the prestige skin care business, et cetera, et cetera? If you could just give an update there. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Sure. So obviously, we're concerned about India obviously, given what's going on with the case counts in the country. That being said, you've heard us talk time and time again for the last 15 months that, the health and safety of our employees remains number one. We have taken significant precautions across India to ensure that the health and safety of our employees is there. And with those efforts, we're pleased to say that, we continue to operate all of our plants in India with no disruption. Our most significant plant there, a good percentage of the employees have been vaccinated, which is terrific. And we're seeing obviously, the performance of that plant relative to not only India for the region, continue to deliver against expectations. That being said, we can't control, whatever the government decides to do in terms of further lockdowns. But at this stage, the plant is being run extremely well and the business across the region is benefiting from that capacity. Relative to professional skin obviously, a tough, tough year for professional skin, particularly given the channels that we're focused on whether it\u2019d be spas, dermatologists or travel retail. But all those businesses are slowly coming back. And we saw good performance of the skin health business in the first quarter. In fact, that business was up double digit. We're seeing a return to offices and the foot traffic going back into the professional space, increasing month in and month out, obviously not back to where we were pre-COVID, but the trends are positive, particularly across North America. The one outlier is obviously still the travel retail business in China. While travel retail has moved internal to China, the real travel retail historically which was a good part of the business has not returned. And we expect to start to see that loosen up a bit in the back half. But again, we spent a lot of time in 2020, building capabilities and really learning the business, getting the innovation profile right, to set us up for good growth in 2021.\nOperator: Okay. And your next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Noel, my question this morning relates to profitability in your North America business. Sales growth clearly under pressure, cycling some difficult year-over-year comparisons, so you had volume deleverage, higher commodities logistics and supply chain issues. But nevertheless it was a low watermark for segment margins in a very long time. So there have been a lot of discussion on pricing, but I wanted to at a more granular level talk about, what percentage of your portfolio in North America specifically in the US really, do you think that you can cover through pricing? What has already been announced to retailers? The environment here certainly seems a lot more amenable currently than it had been even just a few months ago for obvious reasons here in terms of retailer receptivity. And then just sort of rounding it out what should the market expect in terms of margin recovery here in the segment for the balance of the year? So, thanks for that.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. So, we kind of experienced a perfect storm in the US in the first quarter. Obviously, the category expectations that we had declined more than we anticipated faster and deeper quite frankly. On top of that, we obviously saw a significant increase in raw materials more than expected. Third and this was the biggest piece versus our expectations was logistics. Two issues there. Obviously, the capacity and cost of logistics broadly across the US have gone up quite significantly and that was exacerbated by a specific event that we had in a warehouse that we were opening up and had some transition issues associated with that that compounded our problems. So, with that those -- the warehouse issues are quickly moving behind us. Our service levels are quickly returning to where they were but it certainly had a short-term impact both from a sales standpoint a market share standpoint and importantly, from an operating margin standpoint. That being said, if I characterize a little bit about what's going on in the US, I mean the categories were quite concerning obviously moving through the March period where we saw significant declines more than we anticipated. But the silver lining here I think on North America is we've seen categories in the last two weeks come back nicely. In fact, particularly, around the toothpaste category, which is rebounding up double digits in the last two weeks, particularly as we see store traffic and foot traffic return to stores. We've got a good innovation pipeline planned and as you saw we've maintained our support which we think is extremely important to continue to obviously drive volume and share in the back half and we're laser-focused on logistics and raw material costs. Relative to pricing again revenue growth management we're not going to talk to our plans on price increases at this time, but it's a market where everyone is certainly looking at that aspect very, very closely. And I anticipate that you'll see more price increases across the sector given the headwinds that everyone has faced in this space. But again, we're focused on this. I think the team's got a good handle of what's going on get the service issue behind us which it is and we'll move forward. Q2 will continue to be a very difficult comp for the US. As you saw last year, we had significant growth in Q2 as well. And so that will be a difficult comp but it'll be dependent highly on where the categories end up as we move forward.\nOperator: All right. And we'll take the next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey thanks. So, we've talked a lot about pricing. You just mentioned again there Noel, I guess, I'm thinking about in the context of your underlying strategy the mix shift towards premium innovation. So, in light of the uncertainties that you called out on emerging markets and some of the volatility we've seen in developed market category trends and just the notion that there's inflationary pressure building on the consumer shopping basket not only in your categories, but more broadly, does that impact at all what you anticipate in terms of consumer appetite for that premium innovation that you're bringing to market, especially if the prices associated with it are going higher? Just curious how you're thinking about that? Whether those considerations vary at all by region or across categories and whether it's impacted at all how you're choosing to prioritize investments over the balance of the year. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks Steve. No, it has not distracted us from our strategy. Premiumization continues to be a very important element. We've talked a lot with you regarding our refocused orientation on innovation between H1, H2, and H3 very much focused on the aspects of H1 and H2, which are premium brands. And if you look at the growth of Oral Care in the first quarter, particularly, toothpaste a good percentage of that came from our premiumization strategy. I'll give you a good example. Good shares in Brazil holding shares despite a pretty competitive environment. Our premium business in Brazil alone was 27% of our business roughly I think in 2018. It's up to 30% of our business year-to-date and it's up 120 basis points versus last year. So, a good indication that the launch of the Colgate Tartar Control some of the natural extracts bundles, the launch of elmex in the market there, those are important initiatives to continue to close our index and we still have a ways to go to close the index that we've talked about. So premiumization will continue to play. And I don't think quite frankly, even though some of these markets will be under pressure economically, the fact that we have innovation across all of our price points and historically, we play very aggressively both in the opening as well as the mid-price, we think we have the ability to leverage our portfolio effectively as we see the economic circumstances change. But again premiumization will continue to be a focus.  You saw it in Asia, particularly where we're launching and leading with premium innovation in our online business in Asia. Our online business continues to grow. I think it was up over 200 basis points year-to-date. So again, supporting the fact that the premiumization strategy is working and will be agile relative to how we see the market evolve; and need be we will play more in the mid and opening should that be necessary.  I think what's importantly is we get more and more consumers back into stores, historically, that is where we have performed so well and our ability to generate more volume and pricing opportunities as consumers track back into the shopping environment bodes well. But that being said, I'll also say our e-commerce business continues to perform exceptionally well. That was a big growth driver for us and it's comping a difficult number last year. We continue to show strong growth and our shares are pretty consistently up across the board in the online environment. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. \nBill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. \nNoel Wallace: Good morning.\nBill Chappell : Just a question around kind of capital allocation and any thoughts there? For years, the company had a pretty steady share repurchase program that's kind of faded over the past two, three years. M&A activity seems to be really picking up within the industry as everybody is kind of looking for a new home as we get into 2021. Any kind of changes to the thought process over the next year? \nNoel Wallace: Actually, no. I mean our strategy continues to be very consistent with what we've articulated in the past, reinvesting in the business with the high ROIC that we have. We continue to see real opportunities to invest in capacity and cost-saving projects around the world and that is indeed exactly what we're doing. So that will continue to be our priority. Obviously, as M&A comes available we've been conservative in that regard. We'll be selective as we see some strategic gaps in our portfolio, we may look to bring those in.  But right now, we're very focused on what we have in the current portfolio. We think we've got significant opportunities still to expand and really build our skin health business out the way we want to. We've got the Hello acquisition coming in. And obviously, some of the challenges that the Natural segment experienced particularly in North America getting those behind us and moving forward with the expansion of that brand around the world. So we're focused on what we have.  And then obviously we'll continue to pay the dividend and we've increased share buybacks this year as we had outlined in our guidance coming out of 2020 when we were paying down the debt. So that comes back to historical numbers. So no real change there. We continue to be very flexible as we see opportunities and maintaining a strong balance sheet continues to be of paramount importance to us. \nOperator: And the next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks. And good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about ad spend and market share. So ad spend has grown ahead of sales since at least 2018. How long does that continue? And where does it normalize as a percentage of sales? And I guess related to that does market share factor into that thinking -- especially given the numbers that you disclosed in the release is around what has been sustained share loss in Oral Care especially now that FX is favorable as well as the commentary earlier in the call about the importance of the category to gross margin? So maybe if you could tie that into together that'd be helpful. \nNoel Wallace: Yes. We don't have a specific target in mind for advertising. There's so many inputs that go into thinking about how and where we spend money. We're being more strategic on where we spend our money. That is underscored by the innovation strategy that we've outlined relative -- particularly premiumization, which in our view requires the right level of advertising to seed it. And so as a result of that, there's not a specific number that we're looking at.  I think the most important aspect for us is continued sustainable profitable growth. And you've seen that now quite consistently over the previous couple of years. And that's the barometer we're holding ourselves to is to continue to drive that top line. We obviously now have the ability as we shift more and more money into digital to really assess the performance of that spend and that makes the economics and efficiency of our advertising that much better as we think about how we want to spend and where we want to spend. And so we -- as we see the opportunities unfold as we see the plethora of brands and innovation that we have to support we'll continue to put money in advertising as we're seeing a return on that investment. And I think you've seen that. It's all kind of obviously linked. We've got premium innovation driving gross margin That puts more dollar margin into the P&L and ultimately transfers into better advertising more advertising support more capabilities and more EPS. And so it's a balance across all of it. There's not one specific goal we're looking to achieve. And I think we're getting better at putting our advertising where we see the right returns and being selective both from a category and a geography standpoint on how we do that. Hill's is a great example of that. We've obviously deliberately and strategically put more money into that business and you've seen the payback on that quite clearly. \nOperator: And your next question is from Kamil Jagrulla with Credit Suisse. \nKamil Jagrulla: Noel you just mentioned there's a lot of inputs that go into where you spend your money. As you're kind of thinking about coming out of COVID and you think about your -- the various divisions the various pieces of your portfolio has anything changed in terms of where you want to deploy capital? And maybe specifically to talk about are you thinking about the cleaning side any differently? Maybe there's other parts of the business you might be thinking about differently like doubling down on Hill's for example. Can you maybe just talk about what has evolved a little bit now that we're on the other side of this or likely on the other side of this? \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Without getting into too much detail we've spent a significant amount of time looking at our 2025 strategic plan. And in that strategic plan I think what's very notable and different for us is making tough choices on where we're going to invest our money. And rather than being somewhat democratic in that process and as a result of that coming out of COVID we're going to continue to be laser-focused on executing against our strategy. And that involves us taking money and putting it where we think we're going to get the best return through the P&L on that. And it's building businesses and geographies that we believe will deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. It's building businesses that have the right demographics and category opportunity in terms of growth potential for them. And obviously making sure that the mix of our spending and the mix of our innovation continues to be premiumized which requires investment. And you couple that with obviously the need to continue to support a lot of that organic stuff that we do on the market. We talked about per capita consumption programs as a result of our focus on education and doing things of that nature. So all these aspects are critically important to driving the investment strategy so to speak. So again it's just built on I think a well thought through strategic plan. It's anchored against making good choices of where we want to spend. And certainly as we see the categories unfold in the back half of the year, we'll continue to allocate accordingly based on where we see the best growth opportunity. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. \nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just -- first just a kind of a detailed question. I'm sorry I missed it. Your corporate expenses were a good bit higher than, I think most people modeled. Was -- did that have to do with the warehousing issues that you referenced? And if so, how much of it was related to that, or what other sorts of investments are you doing there? And then second, you mentioned that in general you're gaining share in e-commerce. Can you just kind of give us a little bit more detail in terms of the percentage of the business that's in e-commerce maybe detail on the growth rates in the US, China Europe? Just a little bit more granularity would be terrific? Thank you. \nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks Rob. On the corporate side, actually when you look at the SG&A line that was driven by logistics and advertising. So if you strip out just our corporate fixed costs, our corporate fixed costs pleasingly were actually down in that equation. So I think a lot of the productivity initiatives that we're focused on across the P&L and managing cost actually delivered a fixed cost reduction in the quarter, which was terrific to see. Moving on to specifically e-commerce, I mean, obviously the growth numbers are terrific across the board relative to our focus there. And as you look at market share increases we've seen those in North America. We've seen those in Hill's. We're seeing those in Asia quite nicely. We're seeing those in Latin America. In fact, I got some India numbers that look outstanding. So again, where we're focusing time, and effort, and certainly putting the investment there we're seeing a good return on that. I think that bodes well as we continue to see the growth of e-commerce. We exited the year at double digit on e-commerce and that number has accelerated in the first quarter. So I think the focus and strategies we have in place continue to be well received in the marketplace. I'll give you one data point. We're up 260 basis points versus the first quarter last year on a percent of sales on our e-commerce business. So, again, I think it's growing quite nicely, and importantly driving market share of new users into the franchise.\nOperator: Thank you. Mr. Wallace, it appears there are no further questions at this time.\nNoel Wallace: Okay. Well, thanks everyone. So that obviously concludes our call. And again, we're really pleased on how we started the year. And we've got a lot to do. We're excited about what's ahead of us, but there's no question a lot of volatility and challenges. But we've got an incredible culture at Colgate and our entire team of 3,000, 4,000 people are deeply focused on delivering strong results, while ensuring that we continue to adapt to a rapidly changing environment and wining the future. So I just want to thank everyone for their continued support on our business, and look forward to talking to everyone very soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll keep my commentary brief since we've -- so we have plenty of time for the Q&A. I think the results for the quarter really speak for themselves. Obviously we're really pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Despite the significant volatility in headwinds, we delivered strong results around the world and up and down our P&L. While we've made progress in our strategic areas we've been discussing, we still have a lot to do in the balance of the year. Here are our key priorities for the remainder of 2021: Continue to drive broad-based growth. Our priorities here are the same as we've discussed for the past several years. We need to grow volume and pricing. We need organic sales growth in every category and in every division in both emerging and developed markets. In order to do this, we'll continue to ramp up our breakthrough and transformational premium innovation. We delivered high-single-digit growth in toothpaste in the first quarter, despite lapping solid growth in the year-ago period, which helped us drive high-single-digit growth in our Oral Care business. We're driving growth through innovation like Colgate Renewal in the US, Colgate Enzyme Whitening toothpaste in China and our natural extracts line and Colgate Total Anti-Tartar Line in Latin America. As Pat and I discussed at CAGNY, this is a marathon not a sprint, but we're making good progress, which will continue as we shift our resources, continue to build new skills and even adapt how we motivate our teams. Pricing is also an important element of growth. And behind our revenue growth management efforts, we continue to drive strong pricing as we look to increase our price index versus the market as well as offsetting rising costs. You're hearing about rising costs from every company this quarter and we're seeing inflation on pretty much every line of the P&L, but especially raw materials, warehousing and logistics. Naturally our pricing plans are focused. We just discussed, we're battling the cost inflation across the board. We are also driving savings through funding the growth and other efficiency initiatives, which helped to offset these headwinds an effort, Stan, our new CFO, is spearheading for us. We do not expect these headwinds to abate anytime soon, so we have to continue to invest in marketing and building capabilities for future growth while delivering on our earnings guidance. We know we need to be disciplined and efficient in this area. The third is maintaining our focus on building out the key pillars of our long-term strategy while simultaneously managing through all of the volatility. That includes building our capabilities on innovation, e-commerce, digital and data and analytics, progressing on ESG, including increasing our commitments on DE&I and advancing our 2025 sustainability targets, and then ultimately navigating to return to work for most of our office-based employees. We are building a team and a culture at Colgate that is focused on adapting and changing to this volatile world. We're embracing new strategies and new ways of working and it's paying off. We've had a good start to 2021 and we're looking to maintain our momentum through the rest of the year. So with that, why don't we open it up to questions? Hi, Dara. Yeah. Thanks Dara. If you go back, obviously, it depends on the geography. And what we've talked about consistently I think is the volatility that we're seeing all over the world and highly dependent on how countries have treated and dealt with COVID and the rate of incidents in those countries. Obviously if you start with Asia, the categories are coming back, although still not back to where we were pre-COVID due to some of the store closures that we continue to see across Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia coming back in terms of a category development standpoint. And that's based on the fact that particularly in China, you see the COVID issues being put to rest and consumers returning to some level of normality. Thailand continues to be a challenge. You've heard I think consistently from others that that market highly dependent on tourism, so it's impacted that category. India, we won't talk a lot about India as we haven't announced yet, but suffice it to say that they had easy comps from last year from a category standpoint but you're starting to see those numbers come back quite nicely. Moving on to Latin America. Again surprisingly, we've seen a very resilient Latin America particularly our business there. In terms of where we see the categories playing out, toothpaste is starting to come back although it started off quite slowly but we've seen particularly in the recent readings, the category returning to growth, which is good. Africa continues I think to perform okay. I think Africa is a real uncertain environment right now relative to the rate of vaccinations in that geography. So that will have an impact. But if you take that holistically across emerging markets, I think the important area here is that, obviously, those markets were from a GDP standpoint severely impacted in 2020. As you see oil prices come back those tend to benefit emerging markets and that will play out in higher GDP, some inflation, obviously, allows us to continue to take pricing in those markets. And I think as you see the rate of vaccinations increase, those markets are likely to come back quite nicely particularly in the back half of this year. From a pricing standpoint, consistently across all emerging markets, we've been able to take strong pricing given the strength of our businesses and that really started back in 2020. And you've seen a competitive environment is, obviously, having to offset a lot of the raw material inflation that we've seen taking pricing, which has allowed the emerging markets to take a little bit more value in their categories. And clearly there from a per cap standpoint, we continue to be investing in our per capita programs particularly across Africa, parts of Asia and Latin America and that is consistent and I think that margin growth that we've had has allowed us to continue to invest in areas like per cap, which we think obviously bode well for the long-term. Sure. Two things, I think the pricing environment in Europe historically has been extremely difficult, as we all know. That being said, if you go back to a lot of the strategies that we've been putting in place around revenue of management which is a discipline that we're really trying to embed across -- broadly across our commercial organizations, we're finding ways to get pricing into the P&L particularly through how we manage gross to net. Also in Europe is the strength of the elmex brand, obviously Meridol and elmex being strong premium brands with a strong brand loyalty allow us to take more aggressive pricing in those markets. And we've been disciplined to do that on a pretty sequential basis, across that continent. So that has obviously played nicely through the P&L. So I'd say, a combination of revenue growth management discipline really taking hold more work to do to be sure. And some of the strength of our toothpaste equities in that region which have allowed us to take more pricing. And to a certain extent, as we saw more lockdowns early on in the year, the promotional environment was probably a little bit more benign. But we've anticipated that will continue to accelerate as store traffic increases in the back half of the year. Yeah, two aspects to talk to, there's obviously -- there's two implications on, how we think about pricing. There's the foreign exchange aspect, which obviously moves through transactionally into the margin line. And we tend to try to offset that. And there's obviously then commodity inflation that we see locally in the markets and we obviously look to gauge our price increases based on where the market is and what the consumer will bear. But if you take a step back for a minute, it's the strength of our brands, I think in emerging markets that have really allowed us to do more on the pricing line. You talked about Latin America. If you go back last year in Latin America, we took 9.5% pricing in the third quarter 9.5% pricing in the fourth quarter. And I think -- and even if you look at it across emerging markets, it was getting ahead of some of the pricing environment that we've incurred the raw material pricing environment we've seen this year. So as you build that pricing into your P&L that really sets us up for strong growth on the pricing side in 2021. We've continued to take pricing as we've seen an elevated pricing -- inflation environment around raw and packed. And that's allowed us obviously to deliver the gross margins in the quarter. So again, we continue to look at the marketplace. So as I mentioned earlier, our competitors are facing the same level of inflation that we are. And as a result, that environment versus just foreign exchange creates a healthier environment to take pricing particularly in emerging markets. Hi, Jason. Yes. Thanks, Jason. I think, we would anticipate, as we've built into our guidance that costs will continue to remain inflated as we move through the year. And as we start to lap some of the increases that we saw later in the back half of last year, it will become a little bit more benign in that regard. A couple of things. Obviously, continuing to be highly disciplined about taking pricing and taking it quickly and that will continue to be the case. We've got to be courageous and bold in that regard. Obviously, we watch that carefully, based on what's happening in the local marketplace, but straight price increases will continue to be an important element, as we look at the back half of the year. The revenue growth management aspect we've referred to a couple of times that is an important discipline that we really need to embed across our organizations. And I think we've seen some fruits of that, at least, last year and coming into the first quarter this year. So that will continue to happen. The other important aspect to look at is, if you look at the mix of our business, last year we saw significant lifts from some of the lower-margin categories that were driven by COVID, so things like bar soap and liquid hand soap. As oral care begins to normalize and the category returns to historical trends, that will certainly help from a mix standpoint. Likewise, our professional health business, which obviously was significantly impacted by closures, although that business is starting to come back quite nicely, still not back to where it was from a store opening standpoint, as well as travel retail. And as that continues to unfold through the balance of the year, that will likewise help a bit. And obviously, as foreign exchange, we talked a little bit, not seeing the benefit we initially anticipated, but still somewhat of a benefit that will ultimately help through to the P&L. The other aspect, I'd say, Jason, is moving -- getting volume moving through the P&L in the back half. Obviously, taking pricing allows us to support the advertising and innovation, which is critically important. And we've always said, that's part of our strategy, make sure we get the margin to support the advertising and the investment and that will obviously bode well for the pricing that we see in the back half of -- excuse me, in the volume that we anticipate to improve in the back half of the year. Hi, Chris. Yes. Thanks, Chris. And clearly, really, really happy with the progress, because it really underscores and gives us confidence in our strategy, 7% organic on 2020 -- comping 2020 last year is terrific. So a couple of aspects that excite us relative to the category. One, you mentioned that the pet ownership is up. That's an annuity, quite frankly, for the category. As you see pet ownership increase, obviously, those pets need to be fed and that will ultimately play back in the dynamics of the category moving forward. Second is, the aspects associated with our business, low penetrated business for Hill's, low brand awareness business for Hill's. So that, again, underscores and underpins the strategy that we have, continue to increase investment, continue to drive core innovation and continue to drive premium innovation on the prescription diet, particularly as we see consumers returning into the vet space or returning to visit their vets. That will, obviously, bode well for the Prescription Diet business. But again tough comps moving forward to be sure, but the business has real momentum not only in the US, which continues to perform exceptionally well, but emerging markets likewise had a terrific quarter and a lot of head space there for us. But we're being very methodical and thoughtful on how we generate this growth. We're looking for long-term sustainable profitable growth building the brands and markets and doing that the right way. And we have the momentum to do that and the flexibility in the P&L. Obviously, we've seen some rising prices on agricultural commodities and we need to take some pricing as we did. But overall, the health of the business underscored by pet ownership, the low brand awareness and penetration that we have gives us confidence that we can continue to drive this business forward. Sure. Sure. So obviously, we're concerned about India obviously, given what's going on with the case counts in the country. That being said, you've heard us talk time and time again for the last 15 months that, the health and safety of our employees remains number one. We have taken significant precautions across India to ensure that the health and safety of our employees is there. And with those efforts, we're pleased to say that, we continue to operate all of our plants in India with no disruption. Our most significant plant there, a good percentage of the employees have been vaccinated, which is terrific. And we're seeing obviously, the performance of that plant relative to not only India for the region, continue to deliver against expectations. That being said, we can't control, whatever the government decides to do in terms of further lockdowns. But at this stage, the plant is being run extremely well and the business across the region is benefiting from that capacity. Relative to professional skin obviously, a tough, tough year for professional skin, particularly given the channels that we're focused on whether it'd be spas, dermatologists or travel retail. But all those businesses are slowly coming back. And we saw good performance of the skin health business in the first quarter. In fact, that business was up double digit. We're seeing a return to offices and the foot traffic going back into the professional space, increasing month in and month out, obviously not back to where we were pre-COVID, but the trends are positive, particularly across North America. The one outlier is obviously still the travel retail business in China. While travel retail has moved internal to China, the real travel retail historically which was a good part of the business has not returned. And we expect to start to see that loosen up a bit in the back half. But again, we spent a lot of time in 2020, building capabilities and really learning the business, getting the innovation profile right, to set us up for good growth in 2021. Sure. So, we kind of experienced a perfect storm in the US in the first quarter. Obviously, the category expectations that we had declined more than we anticipated faster and deeper quite frankly. On top of that, we obviously saw a significant increase in raw materials more than expected. Third and this was the biggest piece versus our expectations was logistics. Two issues there. Obviously, the capacity and cost of logistics broadly across the US have gone up quite significantly and that was exacerbated by a specific event that we had in a warehouse that we were opening up and had some transition issues associated with that that compounded our problems. So, with that those -- the warehouse issues are quickly moving behind us. Our service levels are quickly returning to where they were but it certainly had a short-term impact both from a sales standpoint a market share standpoint and importantly, from an operating margin standpoint. That being said, if I characterize a little bit about what's going on in the US, I mean the categories were quite concerning obviously moving through the March period where we saw significant declines more than we anticipated. But the silver lining here I think on North America is we've seen categories in the last two weeks come back nicely. In fact, particularly, around the toothpaste category, which is rebounding up double digits in the last two weeks, particularly as we see store traffic and foot traffic return to stores. We've got a good innovation pipeline planned and as you saw we've maintained our support which we think is extremely important to continue to obviously drive volume and share in the back half and we're laser-focused on logistics and raw material costs. Relative to pricing again revenue growth management we're not going to talk to our plans on price increases at this time, but it's a market where everyone is certainly looking at that aspect very, very closely. And I anticipate that you'll see more price increases across the sector given the headwinds that everyone has faced in this space. But again, we're focused on this. I think the team's got a good handle of what's going on get the service issue behind us which it is and we'll move forward. Q2 will continue to be a very difficult comp for the US. As you saw last year, we had significant growth in Q2 as well. And so that will be a difficult comp but it'll be dependent highly on where the categories end up as we move forward. Yes. Thanks Steve. No, it has not distracted us from our strategy. Premiumization continues to be a very important element. We've talked a lot with you regarding our refocused orientation on innovation between H1, H2, and H3 very much focused on the aspects of H1 and H2, which are premium brands. And if you look at the growth of Oral Care in the first quarter, particularly, toothpaste a good percentage of that came from our premiumization strategy. I'll give you a good example. Good shares in Brazil holding shares despite a pretty competitive environment. Our premium business in Brazil alone was 27% of our business roughly I think in 2018. It's up to 30% of our business year-to-date and it's up 120 basis points versus last year. So, a good indication that the launch of the Colgate Tartar Control some of the natural extracts bundles, the launch of elmex in the market there, those are important initiatives to continue to close our index and we still have a ways to go to close the index that we've talked about. So premiumization will continue to play. And I don't think quite frankly, even though some of these markets will be under pressure economically, the fact that we have innovation across all of our price points and historically, we play very aggressively both in the opening as well as the mid-price, we think we have the ability to leverage our portfolio effectively as we see the economic circumstances change. But again premiumization will continue to be a focus.  You saw it in Asia, particularly where we're launching and leading with premium innovation in our online business in Asia. Our online business continues to grow. I think it was up over 200 basis points year-to-date. So again, supporting the fact that the premiumization strategy is working and will be agile relative to how we see the market evolve; and need be we will play more in the mid and opening should that be necessary.  I think what's importantly is we get more and more consumers back into stores, historically, that is where we have performed so well and our ability to generate more volume and pricing opportunities as consumers track back into the shopping environment bodes well. But that being said, I'll also say our e-commerce business continues to perform exceptionally well. That was a big growth driver for us and it's comping a difficult number last year. We continue to show strong growth and our shares are pretty consistently up across the board in the online environment. Good morning. Actually, no. I mean our strategy continues to be very consistent with what we've articulated in the past, reinvesting in the business with the high ROIC that we have. We continue to see real opportunities to invest in capacity and cost-saving projects around the world and that is indeed exactly what we're doing. So that will continue to be our priority. Obviously, as M&A comes available we've been conservative in that regard. We'll be selective as we see some strategic gaps in our portfolio, we may look to bring those in.  But right now, we're very focused on what we have in the current portfolio. We think we've got significant opportunities still to expand and really build our skin health business out the way we want to. We've got the Hello acquisition coming in. And obviously, some of the challenges that the Natural segment experienced particularly in North America getting those behind us and moving forward with the expansion of that brand around the world. So we're focused on what we have.  And then obviously we'll continue to pay the dividend and we've increased share buybacks this year as we had outlined in our guidance coming out of 2020 when we were paying down the debt. So that comes back to historical numbers. So no real change there. We continue to be very flexible as we see opportunities and maintaining a strong balance sheet continues to be of paramount importance to us. Yes. We don't have a specific target in mind for advertising. There's so many inputs that go into thinking about how and where we spend money. We're being more strategic on where we spend our money. That is underscored by the innovation strategy that we've outlined relative -- particularly premiumization, which in our view requires the right level of advertising to seed it. And so as a result of that, there's not a specific number that we're looking at.  I think the most important aspect for us is continued sustainable profitable growth. And you've seen that now quite consistently over the previous couple of years. And that's the barometer we're holding ourselves to is to continue to drive that top line. We obviously now have the ability as we shift more and more money into digital to really assess the performance of that spend and that makes the economics and efficiency of our advertising that much better as we think about how we want to spend and where we want to spend. And so we -- as we see the opportunities unfold as we see the plethora of brands and innovation that we have to support we'll continue to put money in advertising as we're seeing a return on that investment. And I think you've seen that. It's all kind of obviously linked. We've got premium innovation driving gross margin That puts more dollar margin into the P&L and ultimately transfers into better advertising more advertising support more capabilities and more EPS. And so it's a balance across all of it. There's not one specific goal we're looking to achieve. And I think we're getting better at putting our advertising where we see the right returns and being selective both from a category and a geography standpoint on how we do that. Hill's is a great example of that. We've obviously deliberately and strategically put more money into that business and you've seen the payback on that quite clearly. Yes. Without getting into too much detail we've spent a significant amount of time looking at our 2025 strategic plan. And in that strategic plan I think what's very notable and different for us is making tough choices on where we're going to invest our money. And rather than being somewhat democratic in that process and as a result of that coming out of COVID we're going to continue to be laser-focused on executing against our strategy. And that involves us taking money and putting it where we think we're going to get the best return through the P&L on that. And it's building businesses and geographies that we believe will deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. It's building businesses that have the right demographics and category opportunity in terms of growth potential for them. And obviously making sure that the mix of our spending and the mix of our innovation continues to be premiumized which requires investment. And you couple that with obviously the need to continue to support a lot of that organic stuff that we do on the market. We talked about per capita consumption programs as a result of our focus on education and doing things of that nature. So all these aspects are critically important to driving the investment strategy so to speak. So again it's just built on I think a well thought through strategic plan. It's anchored against making good choices of where we want to spend. And certainly as we see the categories unfold in the back half of the year, we'll continue to allocate accordingly based on where we see the best growth opportunity. Sure. Thanks Rob. On the corporate side, actually when you look at the SG&A line that was driven by logistics and advertising. So if you strip out just our corporate fixed costs, our corporate fixed costs pleasingly were actually down in that equation. So I think a lot of the productivity initiatives that we're focused on across the P&L and managing cost actually delivered a fixed cost reduction in the quarter, which was terrific to see. Moving on to specifically e-commerce, I mean, obviously the growth numbers are terrific across the board relative to our focus there. And as you look at market share increases we've seen those in North America. We've seen those in Hill's. We're seeing those in Asia quite nicely. We're seeing those in Latin America. In fact, I got some India numbers that look outstanding. So again, where we're focusing time, and effort, and certainly putting the investment there we're seeing a good return on that. I think that bodes well as we continue to see the growth of e-commerce. We exited the year at double digit on e-commerce and that number has accelerated in the first quarter. So I think the focus and strategies we have in place continue to be well received in the marketplace. I'll give you one data point. We're up 260 basis points versus the first quarter last year on a percent of sales on our e-commerce business. So, again, I think it's growing quite nicely, and importantly driving market share of new users into the franchise. Okay. Well, thanks everyone. So that obviously concludes our call. And again, we're really pleased on how we started the year. And we've got a lot to do. We're excited about what's ahead of us, but there's no question a lot of volatility and challenges. But we've got an incredible culture at Colgate and our entire team of 3,000, 4,000 people are deeply focused on delivering strong results, while ensuring that we continue to adapt to a rapidly changing environment and wining the future. So I just want to thank everyone for their continued support on our business, and look forward to talking to everyone very soon. Thank you."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&A, John Faucher.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Allison. Good morning. And welcome to our 2022 fourth quarter and full year earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables eight and nine of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with his thoughts on our Q4 results and our 2023 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us this morning and I wish all of you a very Happy New Year. So I mostly wanted to focus on the year ahead today, as I think we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2023, even as we plan for a difficult macroeconomic environment and continued uncertainty. That said, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2022. We delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories, including double-digit organic sales growth in Pet Nutrition and high single-digit organic growth in Oral Care. 2022 was our fourth straight year of delivering organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our 3% to 5% long-term target range and we delivered within or ahead of that range in every quarter over that time period, 16 consecutive quarters in all. And is the continuing strengthening of our strategy that has allowed us to grow consistently through different operating environments, as each year has presented its own challenges and its opportunities. But if we stay focused on driving the core, leveraging our capabilities across our portfolio, innovating in faster growth adjacencies and tapping into faster growth channels and markets, we will continue to grow. And in 2023, as we continue to execute on our strategy, we expect to accelerate earnings growth and generate incremental cash flow to drive shareholder value. Why are we well positioned for this year despite all of the uncertainty in the world today? It starts with our portfolio. We operate in four highly focused categories. Growing categories that consumers use every day and where they look to trusted brands to help themselves and their pets lead healthier lives. The focus on healthier lives means these consumers are motivated by science-driven innovation with professional endorsement, which is an area of particular strength for us. And the importance of trust in our categories helps keep private label penetration relatively low and allows for premiumization behind differentiated benefits. And within these categories, we have strong market shares. With most of our revenues coming from brands that have a number one or number two market shares on a global basis. The second reason is our focus on building, sharing and scaling capabilities to drive growth. I will continue to talk about our digital transformation as it impacts everything we do. This year we benefited from continued efficiencies in our digital media spending through data-driven modeling. Our efforts on innovation need to deliver over the long-term, not just the launch year, and we have shifted our resources to deliver more breakthrough and transformational innovation. In our prepared commentary, we talked about the share gains we are seeing in the whitening segment of the toothpaste category. It\u2019s a long-term strategy of launching Optic White Renewal and then Optic White Pro Series in the U.S. or our new MPS whitening technology where we are launching around the world, which leverages our superior R&D capabilities to drive long-term share growth. And on top of that, we continue to launch at-home whitening and professional whitening products to enhance our credibility and expand our presence in the premium segment. And our focus on building revenue growth management capabilities, particularly through increased use of data and analytics is driving our pricing growth in ways beyond just list price increases. And the third reason is our strong balance sheet. Our combined financial resources provide us the flexibility to reinvest in our portfolio or pursue value-enhancing acquisitions like our pet food acquisitions, which enables us to drive faster growth. The final reason we are well positioned is the efforts we have put into offsetting the extraordinary cost increases we have seen over the past several years. We have driven consistent pricing and we look to take additional pricing in the first half of this year. Our Funding the Growth program delivered another strong year in 2022 and we expect even higher levels of savings in 2023. We announced our global productivity initiative one year ago and we began to see the benefits in our numbers in the second half of 2022. We expect even greater savings in 2023 to help fund investment and drive operating margin expansion. So we believe we are well prepared for 2023, but there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty in the world. The macroeconomic environment outlook remains volatile, which can impact consumer spending. China remains a question mark as the country emerges from COVID lockdowns. While raw materials and foreign exchange remain headwinds, they look less onerous now. But as we learned last year, that can change quickly. So we head into 2023 with topline momentum and a proven strategy, with the right brands, the right capabilities and the right efficiency drivers to deliver topline growth and improve our bottomline performance. And with that, I will turn it over to the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. I just wanted to touch on the organic sales growth guidance for next year coming off a strong Q4 result and the strong pricing we are seeing. I am assuming more than all of that perhaps is driven by pricing and volumes will be down slightly, A, maybe is that correct, and then B, it just be helpful to get a bit of commentary on each of those areas. What are you seeing from a competitive standpoint on the pricing front, and then B, as you think about volume and the demand elasticity you are seeing from a consumer standpoint to pricing, any changes sequentially at all and how are you feeling about that front heading into 2023 here? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Dara. Good morning. So, again, let\u2019s recap quickly, obviously, the strong topline growth or organic growth that we have seen across the business. We are very pleased, obviously, with finishing the year with strong momentum. Obviously, the pricing that we put into the P&L, particularly if you look on a two-year stack basis up to 15.5%, so sequentially up as we moved out of the quarter. So we have continued to take a lot of pricing and we will continue to see the benefits of that as we move into 2023. Volume continues to be a challenge across the world, as you have heard, I think, throughout the earnings season, categories have pulled back and that\u2019s expected given the magnitude of pricing that we have seen go into all geographies around the world. Our sense is will see continued pricing in the first half of this year, which we think will have a drag on volumes for the categories that we have seen particularly in the back half of this year, but that will begin to improve in the second half of the year. .  I think the other aspect on the organic guidance is really a question mark on the economic vibrance of the various markets around the world. We have seen Europe obviously under significant pressure with double-digit inflation. Categories have been soft. Elasticity is a little bit higher in Europe than the rest of the world. Obviously, China is a big question mark. Infection rates remain high. Yeah, a lot of euphoria about China reopening, but as you have seen in the fourth quarter, volumes have been very soft in China for the categories in which we compete, and we see that continuing, quite frankly, in the first quarter, that will improve as we move through the back half of the year to be sure. But that will bring, I think, a question mark to everyone in terms of uncertainty on where China goes and the impact that has. Pricing will need to continue to go through the categories in the first half of this year. As we announced in the prepared remarks, we will be taking more pricing and there\u2019s a real question mark, given the magnitude of the pricing that we have seen in the back half of 2022 and the pricing implementation in 2023, the impact that we will have on the consumer. So far, if I give an overarching comment to elasticities, they have been very much in line with where we have expected. So, overall, we think we feel good about the organic range. We feel very confident that we are within that range and if things continue to stay where they are and we continue to see the share growth that we are seeing across the world and the response to our innovation, hopefully we could be at the top end of that range or better.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you and Happy New Year to you too. So I have a broader question on volumes. On the minus 4% globally, which compares, I guess, favorably to some of your competitors that reported so far. What was the impact of retail destocking, if any, in Filorga. I mean I appreciate you put it in the prepared remarks, obviously impacted more Europe. So I was wondering if you can kind of breach that gap. And also a good segue from your last comments, Noel, on Europe, you have said obviously more pressured. What are the -- and I understand that it was mostly Personal Care and hand soap. Is there anything you can add to that in terms of like the exit rate and also the exit rate for China? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Andrea. Good morning. So let me talk a little bit about volume performance around the world and more sequentially as we went through the quarter. Volume improved in the fourth quarter versus third quarter and that volume improvement came despite obviously an incremental point of advertising, excuse me, of pricing, which you saw at 12.5%. So, overall, we are pretty pleased. Some of the drawbacks on volume, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, obviously, skin health had a challenging quarter from inventory reductions, particularly in the online world. We saw those inventory reductions, particularly here in the North America business, and obviously, a significant inventory and volume softness in China due to COVID on the Filorga business. So that really pulled down quite a bit of the volume. You obviously have the Russia impact, which we would quantify to roughly around 30 basis points. Elasticity, as I mentioned early on, were very much in line and consistent around the world, slightly higher elasticities in Europe, but that should be expected and consistent with history, but very much in line with where we expected. A little bit more inventory reduction in India than we expected, particularly in the rural as the rural business has not come back nearly as quickly as we anticipated in the fourth quarter. We expect that, though, to come back in 2023. So, overall, that was very much driven by some inventory reductions we saw on skin, a little bit in the drug classic [ph] trade in the U.S. Likewise, the softness that we saw -- a continued softness we saw in the China skincare business. But, overall, volumes improved versus the third quarter and to a certain extent, more or less where we expected. We did not expect a further deceleration of inventory pullback in the U.S. on the skin business. So in terms of exit rates for Europe, if I characterize Europe in general, a strong share growth across the Board and mid-to-high single-digit organic sales growth in Oral Care and in Home Care, which as you rightfully pointed out, was offset by the weakness in Personal Care, which was principally Filorga, China. But, overall, shares are strong in Europe. We seem to be getting our pricing through. Negotiations continue to go quite well. However, categories have been rather soft in Europe given the amount of pricing that, that market has experienced and the sheer inflation that the European economies are incurring today. So, overall, I feel pretty good about Europe. The good news is the shares are strong and we are getting the pricing through and we feel we are set up for a good year in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi. Good morning. On your commentary on shares\u2026\nNoel Wallace: Good morning, Kaumil.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi. On your commentary on share, you seem quite pleased with share trends. Can you maybe just dig into that a little bit volume versus value, are your shares -- do your shares look -- are you equally as happy with your share in volume terms as opposed to in value?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. I just characterized Europe, where we felt very good about where we ended up, particularly in Oral Care. North America, as you have seen the data, we are up or flat in eight to 12 categories. Importantly, good -- very strong Oral Care growth both in the year and in the quarter, so pretty good there. Latin America shares in general are flat and we feel good about where we are from a Latin America standpoint, given the sheer amount of pricing that we have taken. I think that\u2019s a representative of some of the strong innovation that we put into the market in the back half. Asia, I will characterize it as quite strong, particularly the e-commerce business, a little softness in the brick-and-mortar business. But, overall, e-commerce continues to perform very, very well and Africa, Middle East, strong as well. So, overall, we feel very good about the momentum we have had on market shares in value terms. Volume pretty much consistent with that, a little softer, particularly in Europe on the volume side in terms of our volume shares, and that\u2019s, I think, response to just the sheer amount of pricing that we have taken in that market. And as I mentioned earlier, obviously, a little softness in the Asian markets on volume, a lot of value going through those markets in general in the categories has been quite soft, but our volume shares in Asia seem to be holding up okay.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning.\nChris Carey: Noel, if I just take your comments around some incremental pricing, I think, you said, productivity is expected to accelerate, if I look at raw material outlook of several hundred million of inflation and Red Collar, the gross margin negative impact should be easing sequentially. I am coming up with potentially significant gross margin expansion and I realize reality is often so much different than what we can see in the models. But I wonder if you can just maybe help frame that a bit more for me, because it does imply maybe you are leaving some room for investment. But, again, perhaps, I am missing something in this -- in the development of the key drivers here and I wonder if you could just help clarify that a bit more for me? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Let me take the kind of strategically how we position the P&L particularly around growth and investment and then I will let Stan take you through some of the constructs on how we built internally gross margin and operating margins. As you rightly said, we are really pleased with the operating margin improvement that we are seeing moving through the P&L and that will continue allowing us to fund more advertisers. So as the prepared remarks indicated, we intend to continue to invest behind the business and we have seen great response to the strategy that we have executed over the last couple of years. Obviously, the core adjacencies and channels behind increased investment is driving very strong organic growth in the category and up 5% dollar in the quarter despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. We talked obviously through the back half of this year, the need to continue to invest in Hill\u2019s business once we had more capacity coming online, and that has obviously started to happen in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to obviously continue as we move into 2023. So we will continue to accelerate our investments in the Hill\u2019s business in order to reap the benefits of the incremental capacity that we have. Good momentum on Oral Care and strong innovation and a lot of pricing that we have taken across a broad section of categories and we want to ensure that we have the investment there to generate to get the pricing seated in the marketplace and continue to drive consumption growth for our retailers. So, overall, it will be another year of good investment, a good share growth we expected, and obviously, good topline growth coming through the P&L. Let me turn it over to Stan to kind of take you through how we bridged some of the aspects around gross margin and operating margin.\nStan Sutula: Sure. Thanks, Noel. And on gross profit margin, you started to see some progress, right? North America, Latin America and Africa, Eurasia, you saw improvements in the operating margin in the fourth quarter. As we look at gross profit, Noel, highlighted the pricing, that significant flow-through will help in 2022. The productivity will be a tailwind here and while material and Ranpak in particular will still be a headwind that moderates coming off of 2022. So, as you look at gross profit margin expansion, that\u2019s going to be a benefit. But keep in mind, as you work down, we are going to have investments in advertising. We expect to increase that on a dollars and percent of sales. But also keep in mind, as you go down the income statement that interest expense is going to be up year-to-year. That\u2019s driven predominantly by increase in rates and also by slightly increased debt levels as we carry Red Collar in for the full year. And also taxes, so taxes around the world, in particular in recessionary environments, potentially being out there, we expect our tax position will be slightly higher on a year-on-year basis. So, while the operating margin or EBIT margin we expect will be up nicely, that will be partially offset by interest and taxes, delivering low-to-mid single-digit EPS growth.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, Operator, and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to ask on the gross margin as well, which for the quarter was a bit of a surprise. So in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a number of key drivers as to why it came in below your expectations. But can you maybe unpack where the biggest variance was, whether it be sales mix, commodities versus some of these startup costs and manufacturing variances? And then just maybe following up on Chris\u2019 question, when we think about the path-forward, you mentioned several hundred million dollars of inflation for raw materials and packaging. Is there any way to kind of frame that, is that $300 million to $400 million, is it something higher? I just think it\u2019s kind of important to understand kind of the gross margin bridge as we think about next year? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. As you saw in the fourth quarter, obviously, a continued difficult environment in terms of raw material inflation, another 900 basis points on top of what we had in the third quarter in terms of a headwind on gross profit. A good percentage of that continues to be ag prices, which obviously, have continued to move south on us. And in fact, if you look at the first half versus second half, Peter, ag prices were up 25%. So, obviously, that continued to impact the Hill\u2019s business. On top of that, as we integrated the three Red Collar facilities and began transitioning some of the high capacity volume business that we had in our own plants. We obviously incurred some startup costs and some variances moving through the P&L that obviously impacted margin in the quarter as well. And then I\u2019d also characterize, as I mentioned, that obviously, the inventory reductions we saw in skin health and the drag from China on the skin health business likewise had a mix impact in the quarter. With that, let me turn it over to Stan to see if he has any more information in terms of how he wants -- we want to characterize how we are thinking about raw materials for next year.\nStan Sutula: Yeah. The raw materials continue, as Noel highlighted, to be a headwind for us and your range is probably in the right ballpark here as you think about that on a year-on-year basis. But I would emphasize, it has been volatile. So things have moved up and down pretty significantly here, and in particular, the agriculture and how that applies to Hill\u2019s, those have not moderated, up in the second half, as Noel talked about at 25%, and as we look ahead, we think that will continue to be the primary headwind in raw and pack. The other volatile one is natural gas. Now fortunately, that\u2019s been a benefit here in terms of moderating in the late second half and fourth quarter. But we expect that could be volatile as well heading into particularly the back half of 2023. So a combination of those two primarily we think are the drivers as you look at raw impact going into the year. Now we have laid out our pricing actions and are funding the growth savings that we look to drive, combined with our productivity. And I will just mention Red Collar will moderate, but it\u2019s still going to be an impact on a full year basis and it\u2019s important to realize that. So that will moderate through the year on a full year basis, it will still be an impact on overall gross margin.\nOperator: Our next question today is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question for Noel and then perhaps, John, you may want to jump in on this as well. Just with respect to the impairment charge on the skin care assets and just more broadly, how this may be informing the view around capital deployment. So we can all appreciate the noncash charge. Not hugely surprising, you guys have been pretty open about some of the challenges in the business also realized higher rates when you perform the impairment test so all that kind of makes sense. But I guess just given this dynamic, it sort of back to the question, does it give you any pause in terms of how you stress the assets that you may be looking at, broadly does it increase your bias towards internal investment and returning cash to shareholders versus M&A? And then maybe perhaps just from an M&A perspective, an update on any books broadly that you may be seeing and whether private market values have started to come in a bit given higher rates and what we see in the public markets? So thanks for all that.\nNoel Wallace: Sure and good morning, Kevin. I think you characterized that well. So let me just recap quickly a couple aspects of skin health and I will turn it over to Stan and John for the second part of your question. The impairment was obviously based on three issues. The biggest change is our outlook on growth in China. You have seen, I think, external numbers that the Beauty segment has taken a significant hit in the last three months to six months, in fact, imports were down 20%. And given the prolonged impact of COVID in China, particularly as it impacts travel retail, which were a significant portion of our businesses, we obviously then decided to rebase the outlook in years going forward and particularly 2023 in a much more conservative position to ensure that we can deliver on the growth aspects moving forward. Secondly, the situation in China regarding tourism around the world, as you followed our business on Filorga, it really went with Chinese travel, and as Chinese travel opens up potentially in the back half, we will see an improvement. But we assumed in the impairment that, that will continue to be a headwind for us as we move through at least the first six months of the year, slightly improving as we move through the back half of the year. And then as you well can understand the significant rise in interest rates has lowered the value in our discounted cash flow. But let me step back for a moment. Again, we continue to be very confident in our strategy around skin health. Obviously, the short-term impacts that we have had related to China, we believe ultimately, we will get behind us, but we have obviously been conservative in our assumptions on Filorga. We went into 2022, assuming China would open up and it didn\u2019t. But we feel good about where we are. We have seen some early signs, certainly in the early part of the year, particularly across our European business on Filorga to give us quite a bit of encouragement. Our U.S. business continues to be very, very strong, despite the inventory pullback that we saw in the fourth quarter. If I take our online business specifically, our share growth was up 300 basis points online in the back half of last year and on the year, which is terrific. Obviously, we incurred that share growth despite, obviously, inventories getting reduced. We do expect some of those inventories to come back slightly, but we are obviously assuming a considerable amount of conservatism there because we can\u2019t be sure that particularly the online retailers will take inventory up as quickly as they took it down. Our business overall continues to grow very, very nicely, particularly in the professional channel, which is the core part of our PCA and Elta business, and we have a good innovation plan coming on stream for 2023. So, overall, we still feel very good about the strategy behind skin health. Need China to turn and you have heard a lot of discussions about the uncertainty in China, but we think we have positioned the brand. So, obviously, as China comes back, we will be in a position to reap the benefits of that.\nJohn Faucher: The only thing I\u2019d add on, Filorga, is if you go back and look at the timing of when we purchased it late 2019, it\u2019s built off of very strong growth in China at the time and very strong growth in the travel retail, and then obviously, the pandemic hit, nobody had insight to that. The underlying brand is really strong. There\u2019s going to be new innovation. We have got the advertising to support it to bring it to market. We are still confident in the long-term success of this brand. So that\u2019s what I\u2019d add on Filorga.\nNoel Wallace: Kevin, the only thing I would say relative to M&A strategy and capital deployment is our preference is still to deploy capital internally to our projects, because we are a big believer in return on invested capital and that generates the highest incremental returns. And so if you look at the investment we are making at Hill\u2019s and capacity, if you look at the investment we are making on some of our sustainability projects, Red Collar honestly is a little bit of both, right? It\u2019s M&A, but it also is an investment in internal growth, because we think that Hill\u2019s is one of the best growth engines we have. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change in our capital allocation strategy, invest internally, we would like to pay a healthy dividend and the Board helps us develop the dividend strategy longer term. Then we will look at projects when the valuations are appropriate and we will see what happens with valuations in the market right now. I think the market is still somewhat influx from that standpoint.\nStan Sutula: And the capital allocation, I think, as we look at that return $2.9 billion to shareholders. We had $900 million of net share buyback. We have paid dividends since 1895 and 60 consecutive years of increasing it. So our capital allocation strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We think it\u2019s the right long-term strategy and we think our investment in M&A is appropriate when we don\u2019t have a better internal investment to do or to fill opportunities for us to fill out our model.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning, Olivia.\nOlivia Tong: My question is around Oral Care, because you have obviously made great improvements here, particularly on pricing or hearing on the portfolio. So could you give us a sense of how your game plan is pivoting as macros potentially get a bit more choppy and elasticity get a little bit more elastic. Obviously, high single-digit growth in Oral Care is fantastic, but what\u2019s your view on the state of the consumer in the U.S. and developed markets as a whole, and how that -- and how does that influence your view on potential trade-up versus trade-down in 2023? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Good morning, Olivia. Again, as I mentioned earlier, Oral Care had a really, really strong year, high single-digit growth across the year and the quarter and we were high single-digit in Oral Care on three of the last four quarters and toothbrushes specifically up double-digit three of the last four quarters. Some of that was some easier comps as we were lapping some of the supply chain challenges that we had last year. But the important aspect there is share growth up on the year for both Oral -- toothpaste and toothbrushes. Specifically around elasticity, I think, it comes back to the strategy that we talked about for a couple of years now, which is the flexibility in our portfolio. We continue to innovate across all price points and we cover a wide gamut of price points, from opening to now, obviously pushing a lot more of the super premium segment, which you saw some of the examples of the success we are having in the whitening segment in that regard. So, overall, our categories -- our portfolio is well positioned for this environment. We spend a lot of time as we work through the operations around the world to ensure that we have value-added benefits to every price point within our portfolio and we are flexing our portfolio in different ways over the last couple of years and we are seeing that certainly translate into improved performance. Elmex would be a great example. Taking Elmex very selectively in the pharmy channel -- pharmacy channel around the world has allowed us to grow incremental share in those businesses. The other aspect I\u2019d say is our core re-launches. We will have a significant core re-launch coming on the India business next year. We have re-launched our core business in some of our bigger markets around the world and that has helped some of the premium innovations come on incrementally to the franchise moving forward. So we feel pretty good about where we are with Oral Care. Elasticity is exactly where we expected and I think driven by a combination of the flexibility we have in our portfolio in addition to the innovation that we are bringing to the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNik Modi: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Noel, I was hoping\u2026\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Nik.\nNik Modi: \u2026 maybe you could provide some -- a little bit more context on what you are seeing on the ground in China right now. It\u2019s interesting you mentioned you think the recovery will happen in the back half, so I think there has been projections by other companies and just by looking at some of the mobility data that things might start improving around March to April and we are already starting to see kind of we track the metro activity in China and starting to see some real improvements there. So just curious on your thoughts there given how important that business is for the -- on the margin side given the skin care mix?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. As I mentioned, we had strong performance in China on the Colgate side of the business. Our Holly & Hazel business up nicely mid single digits, our Colgate business up nicely mid-to-high single digits. So, overall, we feel very good about the transformation that we put in place over the last couple of years across our China business. Our brick-and-mortar business is a little soft. But as I mentioned, that\u2019s, I think, characteristic with the lack of mobility around the country and as mobility improves, as you say, and if it improves earlier, by all means, we should benefit from that as we continue to expand our distribution in that marketplace. But it continues to be highly, highly uncertain. Obviously, the Chinese New Year, everyone is waiting very carefully to see the impacts of that. There\u2019s a lot of euphoria, but infection rates are still very, very high and things could change very, very quickly there. The comment I made about the back half is not only mobility within the country, which I think will probably, as you say, improve more quickly, but it\u2019s more external mobility in terms of more international travel, which would benefit the Filorga business. But again, we feel good from the success that we are having from a market share growth. Our -- as I mentioned earlier, our e-commerce business was up almost 300 basis points on the year this year and that is again a reflection of the strategy and some of the good innovation we brought into the market. If the markets improve, we shall -- certainly see the benefits of moving through our P&L earlier than we anticipated. But I would be quite cautious on China at this point. But over the long -- medium- and long-term, we are very optimistic about the growth opportunities there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning, folks.\nNoel Wallace: Hey, Jason.\nJason English: So Mr. Faucher talked about the healthy growth contribution from Hill\u2019s, and obviously, the topline lift has been really last few years. It\u2019s surprising, though, to see penny profit actually contracting this year. Can you unpack the drivers and I imagine within that, you are going to come back to some of the ag inflation. So, I guess, I will tag on to that. Ag -- the ag complex seems like it\u2019s one of the easiest ones to hedge out. I imagine you are hedged out, and therefore, have good visibility to it, assuming that part of the contribution is related to ag? What\u2019s impeded your ability to price that through? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. As you said, we have coming off of some of the challenging capacity issues that we had in the third quarter, we feel like we have certainly turned the corner on that business. Again, a double-digit growth in the quarter, that\u2019s 27% growth on a two-year stack basis and we have delivered double-digit growth on the Hill\u2019s business 10 to 12 quarters and we feel with the capacity improvements that we have and obviously the continued increased investments that we feel we are in a very good position to deliver sustained profitable growth moving forward. Now, as I mentioned, ag prices were just up 25% half-to-half. Now you take that on the year versus last year, that\u2019s significantly more. I will let Stan talk in a moment to our hedging strategy, which is very minimal around ag prices. So we don\u2019t get a lot of -- we don\u2019t do a lot of hedging there. But, overall, it\u2019s taking pricing. It\u2019s making sure that we continue to move through the transition aspects of incorp -- integrating three plants and moving capacity from our existing plants into those plants. So there\u2019s startup costs associated with that, obviously, we are building a new web plant, which should open up towards the back half of the year. We have the startup costs associated with that running through the P&L. But all of it is around building investment ability for the future for us and our ability to continue to sustain the strong topline and the strong investment structure that we have by investing in capacity and allowing us to do the things that we do so well in the marketplace. So we feel good about where the business is. Obviously, the ag prices will be where they are and we are taking pricing, as you have seen both in the fourth quarter and plan to take more pricing in the first half of this year. But, again, if ag prices come back, things will get better, but we at this point don\u2019t expect any short-term benefits for ag coming back.\nStan Sutula: Yeah. Thanks, Jason and Noel. So what I\u2019d add on to that is, we don\u2019t have a large hedging program against ag and that\u2019s a philosophy for us. So we look, we do partial hedges there in ag. We don\u2019t do that in most other categories. But just while we have highlighted ag, there are other areas here like chicken livers, other specialty products that come in as part of the diets that make us more complex, as well as all the amino acids and everything else. Those have all had inflation as well. So while agriculture products have had the most significant, we have also had those and things like the AVM flu do have a ripple effect into the availability of those products. So as we look, we have also integrated now four plants through acquisitions, one from Nutriamo earlier in the year and then the three from Red Collar. So we took those over on September 30th. That integration has gone well. But as you would expect, there are startup costs that go along with that. As we bring Tonganoxie online, that\u2019s our new wet plant in Kansas in the second half of the year. We are very excited about that plan. It has great automation. It\u2019s going to be, I think, a great addition to the portfolio. But that has startup costs in 2023, in particular, in the first half as we hire staffing, get the staffing right heading into or going live. So important here on Hill\u2019s, we see a great market opportunity, science-based, our research center really supports that. We are investing the advertising behind that to drive that capability and to drive that demand and we think that serves us well for the long-term. So we expect margin improvement heading into 2023 in Hill\u2019s. We are excited about that market opportunity and what it represents to the company. We also think it fits really well in our overall portfolio with a science based approach.\nNoel Wallace: Jason, I\u2019d throw one other point, which I think is relevant to not only Hills, but to other aspects or other questions that have come up this morning. And that is the foreign exchange impact in Europe in the quarter, obviously, the second largest business outside the U.S. for Hill\u2019s is Europe and Europe had 11% headwind in foreign exchange and that obviously moved through the Colgate side of the business as well. Now you have seen the significant pricing that we are taking, but obviously, the transactional impact as well as the translational impact of that foreign exchange moved through in the fourth quarter, and certainly, dampened a little bit of the penny profit that we would have expected.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey. Thank you. So picking up a little bit on what you were just talking about in terms of startup costs, but also the manufacturing variances and the negative mix that Noel you alluded to earlier with respect to the fourth quarter. I guess, a couple of questions related to that. One is, I assume that\u2019s lumped into the raw materials, the 920-basis-point negative impact of raw materials, I don\u2019t know where else it would go. So if that\u2019s the case, I guess, is there a way to quantify what those sort of to me, non-raw materials costs would have been or were in the quarter as a headwind, number one. Number two, how we think about those carrying over and phasing at least into the -- I presume the first half of 2023. And then just to clarify and round it out is, are those are those impacts embedded in the several hundred million dollar raw and packaging materials inflation outlook for next year, just because I think it\u2019s a little bit different than raw and packaging materials as sort of narrowly defined. That\u2019s really my -- those are my main questions. If you could also talk a little bit about how you are thinking about Red Collar phasing through the year, and just operationally, what that entails, if there are costs, whether cash costs or costs that are notable going to the P&L as you do transition the private label product over to Hill\u2019s, just that would be helpful to understand? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Steve, let me take a very topline kind of strategically how we are integrating Red Collar and deliberate plans that we have take -- we have taken to ensure a successful integration into the Colgate-Palmolive Company. First, it\u2019s three significant plants that we are obviously integrating. And as we have talked about for the better part of a year, all of our existing facilities on Hill\u2019s have been running full out, and obviously, that is a very inefficient way to run your supply chain. Now we have obviously been investing in improved capacity, obviously, with the plants in addition to the Tonganoxie in addition to the plant that we purchased in Italy. But again, integrating those into the system to ensure one quality mechanisms are where they need to be, ensuring the lines are capable of the flexibility and the formulations and the sophistication of our formulations, making sure that, obviously, the all aspects of the science driven approach that we have taken to our formulas is well understood and by the culture of the organizations that we are integrating into the company. All of that has been very, very methodical. We are not going -- given that we need the capacity, we are not going to rush ourselves into doing this too quickly. So we have been very careful to ensure long-term success as we built the plans to bring that volume into the Colgate business over time. So, with that, let me turn it over to Stan. He will take you through a little bit of how we planned for Red Collar and how we are thinking about the ongoing startup costs associated with that.\nStan Sutula: Yeah. So let\u2019s start with Red Collar first. So as Red Collar comes in and we cut over production over time and this will be over an elongated period of time. There are a few things that have to happen. One, and of course, I should start, all of this is baked into our guidance. So as we planned this out, this is all incorporated within our guidance. So first, as we take the Red Collar facilities and migrate those over to produce Hill\u2019s formulas, there is investment that has to go into that. We have incorporated that into our capital and we have incorporated any income statement impact into the numbers. And that really centers around what Red Collar was producing was much simpler formulas for us and for others, and our diets, our formulas are much more complex, in particular, in the prescription diet area, which is why I think they are such valuable to consumers. So that involves additional mixing, additional ability and testing, quality testing as we go in, and that will require capital investment into those facilities, all planned all on track. The variances that we have in total, so let me step back to there, the variances that we have in total go into gross profit so that as they are going through, we expect that those will get better. We expect that those will get better as we get some relief on the overall manufacturing as those Red Collar facilities come fully on board and produce more of Hill\u2019s formulas. That allows us to go in and do more efficiency planning within the existing facilities. So as we think about Tonganoxie, that\u2019s, again, the new wet food plant that will come online in the second half of 2023. In the beginning, we do have some startup costs there and those startup costs, again, are around things like bubble staffing as we bring the staff on board and get them trained and so we expect that, that will contribute in the second half, but it becomes a headwind in the first half around Hill\u2019s. So thinking about Red Collar, keep in mind that this was acquired and was in for the full quarter of Q4 of 2022. So we will wrap around from an impact here in Q4 of 2023. But as we go forward, you should think that the impact to margin is roughly in line with what we saw in fourth quarter. So it would be a benefit to the topline and given that the private label activity is at a much lower margin that will impact margin through the year but at a slightly decreasing rate.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. A couple of follow-up questions. One, you mentioned in the press release or the comments that there was an e-commerce inventory drawdown on skin health. Can you just clarify exactly what brands that was and why that would be happening? And then I\u2019d like to just kind of talk a little bit more about Hill\u2019s. One question that we are getting is, what was the effect of private label on the organic number. So if you took private label out, was the volume growth actually down 100 basis points, so a clarification on that. And then bigger picture, if we could kind of scope out and look at the whole pet food area in general, you guys are obviously premium and have been gaining share a long time. Can you talk about historically potential trade-down impact given a tougher consumer environment and how you may be adapting to that and what your volume assumptions are for pet in 2023? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Good morning, Rob. Thank you. Let me take the e-commerce question first. A good year for e-commerce, as I mentioned, it\u2019s up to 14% of our sales. We continue to see strong growth throughout the year, and importantly, in the most important markets around the world, we continue to see strong share growth. So, overall, we feel a lot of the work that we put into our digital transformation has paid out quite nicely in the consumption that we are seeing across the board, whether that\u2019s our skin business, whether that\u2019s our U.S. Oral Care business or our Hill\u2019s business, we are performing quite well. And we are sharing those capabilities very nicely across the enterprise, and as I have talked to you before in the past, obviously, Hill\u2019s was at the forefront of that and a lot of the skill sets that we built in our Hill\u2019s organization have certainly translated now across the enterprise and we are using those benefits to grow our e-commerce business, both on a share basis and a topline basis. The inventory drawdown was on PCA and Elta in the U.S. in the online channel, which is their number one retail channel. As you know, they sell through the profession and they sell online through the big online retailers. The big online retailers took significant inventory out of the system in the fourth quarter. These are very high priced items, as you are well aware, and they felt, I guess, managing their working capital that they were going to take those down in the fourth quarter. The good news, as I mentioned earlier, we didn\u2019t see a significant impact on our consumption. Our shares were actually up and the more important news is that we started to see that inventory rebuild itself slowly, I would say, in the first quarter of this year, particularly January. Now that\u2019s not to say that at the end of the quarter, we may see more draw downs. But in any case, the good news is we start to see some improvements there. But it was on the PCA and Elta business in the U.S. And likewise, on the Filorga business in China with the significant lockdowns that we saw across China in the fourth quarter and coming out of the third quarter, we saw significant inventory reductions in the online business there as well. Relative to private label, let me characterize, I guess, first Oral Care. So Oral Care private label in the U.S. is about 0.9 share and that share is roughly flat on the quarter -- in the fourth quarter and flat on the year. Oral Care private label shares in Europe are around 3.5%, and likewise, that share is flat. We are seeing a little bit of growth in private label businesses, particularly in Europe on some of the Home Care businesses. Obviously, cleaners dish, and to a certain extent, fabric softener, as we have seen about 1 point of growth in the private label business there, but consistent with where we expected. So nothing unusual, and importantly, we don\u2019t see, obviously, given the benign levels of shares we have seen in Oral Care, we haven\u2019t seen a significant turnaround there. On the Hill\u2019s trade-down, we have not seen trade-down thus far. If you go back to 2007, 2008, which we spent a lot of time looking at the premiumization of the category during that period. We did not see consumers pulling back on scientific -- scientifically proven Pet Nutrition. And we feel that given the strength of our innovation, and obviously, the strength of the investment that we are putting in the market, that we will be able to continue to manage that quite well.\nStan Sutula: So, thanks, Noel. Rob, let me just pick up on the on the Hill\u2019s organic and private label and how we are showing that. If you look at the press release, you stated, you saw net sales were up 20%, organic sales were up 14%. There is no private label in the organic sales. So we include in the net sales, but in organic, it will only be inorganic when it wraps around for the year, which will be in the fourth quarter. So when you see organic sales that represents true year-on-year with no private label benefit in that number. Similar to volume, you will see the volume in a press release at plus 10% and then organic volume at plus 0.5%. So volume expanded even outside of private label, you get a feel for the size of private label in the as reported volume number. So, again, that will be that way Q1 through Q3, and then in Q4, it will wrap around, because it will be in both years and be in the organic numbers. .\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yeah. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to go back to gross margin kind of looking backwards and then trying to think about it going forward. So I guess I am curious what happened to gross margin in 4Q, I mean, I hear all of what you talked about some things unexpected. But if you go back and look at what you said at the last call, you were locked in at least that\u2019s what I thought you said on, I assume a bunch of these raw materials, ag pieces. So was just the manufacturing variance of startup costs, et cetera, just much greater. And I guess the question going forward then is I hear you in modeling the question on this call is about, improving gross margin expectations and all these things that are potential tailwinds. But how much visibility do you have as you sit here today and what potentially is based in that could go wrong? And then kind of pushing it forward longer term, how do you think about -- how does the company think about the necessity to grow gross margins over so that you can hit the earnings algorithm for the business given where the topline expectations are and just how important that is and what line of sight you have to get back to a number, not that I am expecting you to comment on, you can get to 60% again, but if you can talk directionally to that that would be helpful as well? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, Mark. Let me start with the end, the last question first and provide some thoughts and I will have Stan walk through you a bit more of our assumptions once again. Listen, driving gross margin for our company has always been fundamental and it\u2019s always been the fulcrum of our P&L, and as we laid out in the prepared comments, we expect gross profit to be up in 2023. I remind you that the gross profit was down 160 basis points in the fourth quarter, if -- when you exclude the impact of Red Collar. Some of the issues that we incurred in the fourth quarter, obviously, we had a mix issue with the lower skin health business that we mentioned. A little bit of a mix issue on Hill\u2019s as well with more of the Science Diet business versus prescription diet, but we obviously had the elevated ag prices moving through there and the startup costs that as Stan mentioned earlier, that moved through the gross profit line. But step back, again, I mean, we are very focused on getting pricing in the P&L and you have seen that sequentially improve from third to fourth quarter. We expect that to benefit us next year. Now there are a lot of assumptions on where commodities go. We talked about a couple of hundred million dollars there. But remember where we were in the first quarter of this year. We had a lot of assumptions there and we got ahead of that very, very quickly in terms of where things move. Now if things move -- stay where they are, improve, obviously, we don\u2019t think we will be at the low end of our guidance. But we feel it\u2019s a prudent and flexible place to be given the uncertainty that we have seen and the movement that we have seen, certainly, over the last six months to nine months in commodity prices not to mention foreign exchange. So let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more color once again on where we are from some of our locks in our contracts.\nStan Sutula: Yeah. So on gross profit and we look at raw and pack, we do lock in a majority of our commodities here at least 90 days out for the next quarter. But there is still conversion costs, there\u2019s still the manufacturing variances that we have to go through, labor cost that goes into that, et cetera. So when we look at this and for fourth quarter, the 250 basis point as reported decline in margin, again, private label drove about 90 points of that, so you are at 160 basis points. And as we look at prices here, again, it was 920 basis points, relatively consistent with Q3 and our conversion costs and some of the variances that we talked about had an impact overall on margin versus our original expectation. As we look going ahead, we are guiding for expansion of gross profit margin heading into 2023 and we think as we look at that, the components of that are going to be moderating commodities are on pack, improved pricing in RGM and then the productivity work that we have been doing across the Board will have a benefit here to margin. So the margin expansion again fuels that investment into advertising. So we do believe that margin expansion is a core component of foundation of our overall model and so that expansion into next year will fuel that model, which will allow us to deliver low-to-mid single-digit earnings growth.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I know you have covered a lot of ground, but I just was curious, knowing that 4Q gross margins came in below what you had anticipated. You have obviously detailed the reasons a couple of times. I was just curious, the bottomline still delivered, frankly, so that means there were some choices made, perhaps, a little bit short term on lines within OpEx. So I was just curious kind of what are the areas that you may be pulled back on in the shorter term than how you kind of make those decisions and how we should think about the reinvestment in 2023? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Well, we didn\u2019t pull back on the advertising investment, obviously, that was down 20 basis on a percent to sales, but if you exclude Red Collar advertising was flat and on a local currency basis, Lauren, the advertising was up and that becomes fundamental to continue to build the momentum of the progress we have seen in 2022 to ensure that we deliver that continued momentum in 2023 and that was a very deliberate choice to sustain the investment moving through the quarter. Obviously, a little bit of softness in gross margin, as I mentioned, largely driven by mix of the Hill\u2019s business coming in a little bit lower than we expected, as well as skin health, but we feel those are well under control. We have good visibility about where those two businesses are going. So we feel like we are in a pretty good position to continue to execute against our strategy, deliver gets the gross margin improvement in 2023. Obviously, the first half we have a bit more visibility, we don\u2019t have that visibility in the second half, but we will continue to execute against what we see in front of us and that is our need to take more pricing, get it into the P&L and ensure we have the investment to support that.\nStan Sutula: The only thing I\u2019d add, Lauren, on that one is, look, we took actions early in the year, particularly around the global productivity initiative that started to pay off in the back half of the year. So we saw some of that flow through here hit in the back half of the year. And we manage the overhead lines carefully and because we are running the entire P&L up and down and those overhead lines, we prioritize within that. We want to make sure we support advertising, digital, analytics and then we make trade-offs within that, as you would expect us to do go forward. We think that\u2019s just a prudent way to run the business and we will continue to do that heading into 2023.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, Lauren, we are very pleased with that middle part of the P&L around how we managed overheads, which given, obviously, the headwinds we have seen below that around interest expense, as well as tax, it\u2019s extremely important that we got ahead of that. We delivered an additional 50 basis points of overhead on top of the 150 basis points that we had in the previous year. So we feel that structures us well to invest in strategically the areas that we think are fundamental to driving long-term growth. Those are the capabilities that we have talked about around digital transformation, improved capabilities around innovation, certainly as we restructure that part of the organization and making sure that we have that operating leverage to sustain the advertising investment, which is clearly driving a good topline growth for us.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. So my question is just around cash flow. Free cash flow conversion, if I am doing the math right was about 74% of net income this year. I think in absolute dollars, free cash flow down about $900 million. So maybe you can talk a little bit about, as we look forward, do we expect some of that free cash flow productivity to improve? And then maybe just related on, I know you have talked about net interest expense being higher for this year, just if you can put a number on that and also on capital spending? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: All right. Let me hit the topline, and Bryan, good morning, by the way, and I will let Stan take you through some of the puts and takes. But, overall, cash flow -- our cash was down due to lower cash income, right? Obviously, that was the higher -- that was some choices that we made, particularly around working capital investments, a little bit increase in inventories as we were dealing with some of the supply chain disruptions we saw from suppliers and our need to sustain the consumption growth that we had in the marketplace, particularly some of the stronger consumption growth, but obviously, inventory days came up as a consequence of that. But we improved a bit a bit of that in the fourth quarter versus where we were in the third quarter. But clearly, it was driven by the lower cash profits driven by, obviously, the sustained foreign exchange hit as well as the challenges that we saw moving through gross margin on the year. CapEx was the other one, a deliberate choice for us, obviously, the growth that we have made -- the growth that we put into Hill\u2019s, and the investment and the significant increase in capital expenditures there and some of the increases that John mentioned earlier around sustainability, which we think are extremely important to position us for where the markets are moving forward. And overall, I would say that we expect a very nice improvement in operating cash flow in 2023.\nStan Sutula: Yeah. Let me pick up there on the cash flow. So, as Noel said, we do expect improvement in 2023 and it\u2019s really going to be two-fold. One, the improvement in cash profits, as we have guided to, and second, the improvement in working capital. We see opportunities there. We have been conservative on our working capital here in 2022 and particularly around inventory. We wanted to make sure that we could restore fill rates across the board that we had enough inventory to supply. And in particular towards the late in the fourth quarter as China had impacts from COVID on manufacturing, we prudently brought in additional inventory to make sure we could fulfill clients over the year end. On -- so on cash flow, we expect improvement in both working capital and cash profits. On interest expense, you see in fourth quarter a material increase on a year-on-year basis, and again, really comes from two components. First, the impact that it has on floating rate debt, in particular, CP, that\u2019s up significantly, as you know. And then second, we are carrying a slightly higher debt level, though, quite comfortable within our range and our leverage metrics for heading into 2023. So as you think about that interest expense, it will be larger than the gap you saw in fourth quarter, simply because you get a full year of carrying the Red Collar of funding through the year. That said, we think we have highly competitive rates on our debt going through. We have great access to the markets that fund our overall model. So, on capital spending, as you saw from our press release, we spent just under $700 million. I expect that could go up a little bit as we look at 2023 and that\u2019s really in a couple of areas. First, we are going to complete Tonganoxie as that comes online in the second half. And that we talked already about the Red Collar facilities, we have great plans for those as we are going to significantly increase our overall capacity for our Hill\u2019s business, which operates in a terrific segment and that investment obviously will have capital spending. In addition, we invest in sustainability type efforts like recyclable tube, which we think are important. We will continue to roll that out in a prudent manner and we continue to invest in IT capabilities, including our S/4HANA journey that we are well underway. So, overall, we are comfortable with the position heading into 2023 and that will expand cash flow at a material level on a year-on-year basis.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. The only thing I would add is strategically these investments are all around positioning us for long-term growth and success. A lot of discussion goes into the choices we make around our capital investments. And the supply chain, and certainly, the IT team are very focused on ensuring that the money is being put into areas that are going to give us improved capabilities moving forward and allow us to weather some of the storms that you have seen over the last three years where we have recognized the challenges and generated real opportunities coming out of those and that certainly has driven the topline of the company.\nNoel Wallace: So, with that, let me just finish off. I think that\u2019s the end of the questions. Again, 2022 was another year of strong progress for the business in terms of sales, market shares and productivity that moved through the P&L, but more importantly, the capabilities that we are building across the organization. We are excited to see the leverage moving through the P&L and we will see that continue in 2023 that will allow us to deliver the investment to sustain good topline growth, and obviously, very focused on delivering shareholder value moving forward. We will see everyone, I hope down in CAGNY in February, where we can talk a little bit about more of our plans in terms of how we are seeing 2023 unfold. But I\u2019d be remiss not to thank all the Colgate people listening on the call for an extraordinary year in 2022, a lot of challenges, but we recognize the opportunities that we had in front of us and I wish all of you a happy and successful 2023. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today\u2019s call and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us this morning and I wish all of you a very Happy New Year. So I mostly wanted to focus on the year ahead today, as I think we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2023, even as we plan for a difficult macroeconomic environment and continued uncertainty. That said, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2022. We delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories, including double-digit organic sales growth in Pet Nutrition and high single-digit organic growth in Oral Care. 2022 was our fourth straight year of delivering organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our 3% to 5% long-term target range and we delivered within or ahead of that range in every quarter over that time period, 16 consecutive quarters in all. And is the continuing strengthening of our strategy that has allowed us to grow consistently through different operating environments, as each year has presented its own challenges and its opportunities. But if we stay focused on driving the core, leveraging our capabilities across our portfolio, innovating in faster growth adjacencies and tapping into faster growth channels and markets, we will continue to grow. And in 2023, as we continue to execute on our strategy, we expect to accelerate earnings growth and generate incremental cash flow to drive shareholder value. Why are we well positioned for this year despite all of the uncertainty in the world today? It starts with our portfolio. We operate in four highly focused categories. Growing categories that consumers use every day and where they look to trusted brands to help themselves and their pets lead healthier lives. The focus on healthier lives means these consumers are motivated by science-driven innovation with professional endorsement, which is an area of particular strength for us. And the importance of trust in our categories helps keep private label penetration relatively low and allows for premiumization behind differentiated benefits. And within these categories, we have strong market shares. With most of our revenues coming from brands that have a number one or number two market shares on a global basis. The second reason is our focus on building, sharing and scaling capabilities to drive growth. I will continue to talk about our digital transformation as it impacts everything we do. This year we benefited from continued efficiencies in our digital media spending through data-driven modeling. Our efforts on innovation need to deliver over the long-term, not just the launch year, and we have shifted our resources to deliver more breakthrough and transformational innovation. In our prepared commentary, we talked about the share gains we are seeing in the whitening segment of the toothpaste category. It's a long-term strategy of launching Optic White Renewal and then Optic White Pro Series in the U.S. or our new MPS whitening technology where we are launching around the world, which leverages our superior R&D capabilities to drive long-term share growth. And on top of that, we continue to launch at-home whitening and professional whitening products to enhance our credibility and expand our presence in the premium segment. And our focus on building revenue growth management capabilities, particularly through increased use of data and analytics is driving our pricing growth in ways beyond just list price increases. And the third reason is our strong balance sheet. Our combined financial resources provide us the flexibility to reinvest in our portfolio or pursue value-enhancing acquisitions like our pet food acquisitions, which enables us to drive faster growth. The final reason we are well positioned is the efforts we have put into offsetting the extraordinary cost increases we have seen over the past several years. We have driven consistent pricing and we look to take additional pricing in the first half of this year. Our Funding the Growth program delivered another strong year in 2022 and we expect even higher levels of savings in 2023. We announced our global productivity initiative one year ago and we began to see the benefits in our numbers in the second half of 2022. We expect even greater savings in 2023 to help fund investment and drive operating margin expansion. So we believe we are well prepared for 2023, but there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. The macroeconomic environment outlook remains volatile, which can impact consumer spending. China remains a question mark as the country emerges from COVID lockdowns. While raw materials and foreign exchange remain headwinds, they look less onerous now. But as we learned last year, that can change quickly. So we head into 2023 with topline momentum and a proven strategy, with the right brands, the right capabilities and the right efficiency drivers to deliver topline growth and improve our bottomline performance. And with that, I will turn it over to the questions. Yeah. Thanks, Dara. Good morning. So, again, let's recap quickly, obviously, the strong topline growth or organic growth that we have seen across the business. We are very pleased, obviously, with finishing the year with strong momentum. Obviously, the pricing that we put into the P&L, particularly if you look on a two-year stack basis up to 15.5%, so sequentially up as we moved out of the quarter. So we have continued to take a lot of pricing and we will continue to see the benefits of that as we move into 2023. Volume continues to be a challenge across the world, as you have heard, I think, throughout the earnings season, categories have pulled back and that's expected given the magnitude of pricing that we have seen go into all geographies around the world. Our sense is will see continued pricing in the first half of this year, which we think will have a drag on volumes for the categories that we have seen particularly in the back half of this year, but that will begin to improve in the second half of the year. .  I think the other aspect on the organic guidance is really a question mark on the economic vibrance of the various markets around the world. We have seen Europe obviously under significant pressure with double-digit inflation. Categories have been soft. Elasticity is a little bit higher in Europe than the rest of the world. Obviously, China is a big question mark. Infection rates remain high. Yeah, a lot of euphoria about China reopening, but as you have seen in the fourth quarter, volumes have been very soft in China for the categories in which we compete, and we see that continuing, quite frankly, in the first quarter, that will improve as we move through the back half of the year to be sure. But that will bring, I think, a question mark to everyone in terms of uncertainty on where China goes and the impact that has. Pricing will need to continue to go through the categories in the first half of this year. As we announced in the prepared remarks, we will be taking more pricing and there's a real question mark, given the magnitude of the pricing that we have seen in the back half of 2022 and the pricing implementation in 2023, the impact that we will have on the consumer. So far, if I give an overarching comment to elasticities, they have been very much in line with where we have expected. So, overall, we think we feel good about the organic range. We feel very confident that we are within that range and if things continue to stay where they are and we continue to see the share growth that we are seeing across the world and the response to our innovation, hopefully we could be at the top end of that range or better. Sure. Thanks, Andrea. Good morning. So let me talk a little bit about volume performance around the world and more sequentially as we went through the quarter. Volume improved in the fourth quarter versus third quarter and that volume improvement came despite obviously an incremental point of advertising, excuse me, of pricing, which you saw at 12.5%. So, overall, we are pretty pleased. Some of the drawbacks on volume, as we discussed in the prepared remarks, obviously, skin health had a challenging quarter from inventory reductions, particularly in the online world. We saw those inventory reductions, particularly here in the North America business, and obviously, a significant inventory and volume softness in China due to COVID on the Filorga business. So that really pulled down quite a bit of the volume. You obviously have the Russia impact, which we would quantify to roughly around 30 basis points. Elasticity, as I mentioned early on, were very much in line and consistent around the world, slightly higher elasticities in Europe, but that should be expected and consistent with history, but very much in line with where we expected. A little bit more inventory reduction in India than we expected, particularly in the rural as the rural business has not come back nearly as quickly as we anticipated in the fourth quarter. We expect that, though, to come back in 2023. So, overall, that was very much driven by some inventory reductions we saw on skin, a little bit in the drug classic [ph] trade in the U.S. Likewise, the softness that we saw -- a continued softness we saw in the China skincare business. But, overall, volumes improved versus the third quarter and to a certain extent, more or less where we expected. We did not expect a further deceleration of inventory pullback in the U.S. on the skin business. So in terms of exit rates for Europe, if I characterize Europe in general, a strong share growth across the Board and mid-to-high single-digit organic sales growth in Oral Care and in Home Care, which as you rightfully pointed out, was offset by the weakness in Personal Care, which was principally Filorga, China. But, overall, shares are strong in Europe. We seem to be getting our pricing through. Negotiations continue to go quite well. However, categories have been rather soft in Europe given the amount of pricing that, that market has experienced and the sheer inflation that the European economies are incurring today. So, overall, I feel pretty good about Europe. The good news is the shares are strong and we are getting the pricing through and we feel we are set up for a good year in 2023. Good morning, Kaumil. Sure. I just characterized Europe, where we felt very good about where we ended up, particularly in Oral Care. North America, as you have seen the data, we are up or flat in eight to 12 categories. Importantly, good -- very strong Oral Care growth both in the year and in the quarter, so pretty good there. Latin America shares in general are flat and we feel good about where we are from a Latin America standpoint, given the sheer amount of pricing that we have taken. I think that's a representative of some of the strong innovation that we put into the market in the back half. Asia, I will characterize it as quite strong, particularly the e-commerce business, a little softness in the brick-and-mortar business. But, overall, e-commerce continues to perform very, very well and Africa, Middle East, strong as well. So, overall, we feel very good about the momentum we have had on market shares in value terms. Volume pretty much consistent with that, a little softer, particularly in Europe on the volume side in terms of our volume shares, and that's, I think, response to just the sheer amount of pricing that we have taken in that market. And as I mentioned earlier, obviously, a little softness in the Asian markets on volume, a lot of value going through those markets in general in the categories has been quite soft, but our volume shares in Asia seem to be holding up okay. Good morning. Yeah. Let me take the kind of strategically how we position the P&L particularly around growth and investment and then I will let Stan take you through some of the constructs on how we built internally gross margin and operating margins. As you rightly said, we are really pleased with the operating margin improvement that we are seeing moving through the P&L and that will continue allowing us to fund more advertisers. So as the prepared remarks indicated, we intend to continue to invest behind the business and we have seen great response to the strategy that we have executed over the last couple of years. Obviously, the core adjacencies and channels behind increased investment is driving very strong organic growth in the category and up 5% dollar in the quarter despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. We talked obviously through the back half of this year, the need to continue to invest in Hill's business once we had more capacity coming online, and that has obviously started to happen in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to obviously continue as we move into 2023. So we will continue to accelerate our investments in the Hill's business in order to reap the benefits of the incremental capacity that we have. Good momentum on Oral Care and strong innovation and a lot of pricing that we have taken across a broad section of categories and we want to ensure that we have the investment there to generate to get the pricing seated in the marketplace and continue to drive consumption growth for our retailers. So, overall, it will be another year of good investment, a good share growth we expected, and obviously, good topline growth coming through the P&L. Let me turn it over to Stan to kind of take you through how we bridged some of the aspects around gross margin and operating margin. Sure. As you saw in the fourth quarter, obviously, a continued difficult environment in terms of raw material inflation, another 900 basis points on top of what we had in the third quarter in terms of a headwind on gross profit. A good percentage of that continues to be ag prices, which obviously, have continued to move south on us. And in fact, if you look at the first half versus second half, Peter, ag prices were up 25%. So, obviously, that continued to impact the Hill's business. On top of that, as we integrated the three Red Collar facilities and began transitioning some of the high capacity volume business that we had in our own plants. We obviously incurred some startup costs and some variances moving through the P&L that obviously impacted margin in the quarter as well. And then I'd also characterize, as I mentioned, that obviously, the inventory reductions we saw in skin health and the drag from China on the skin health business likewise had a mix impact in the quarter. With that, let me turn it over to Stan to see if he has any more information in terms of how he wants -- we want to characterize how we are thinking about raw materials for next year. Sure and good morning, Kevin. I think you characterized that well. So let me just recap quickly a couple aspects of skin health and I will turn it over to Stan and John for the second part of your question. The impairment was obviously based on three issues. The biggest change is our outlook on growth in China. You have seen, I think, external numbers that the Beauty segment has taken a significant hit in the last three months to six months, in fact, imports were down 20%. And given the prolonged impact of COVID in China, particularly as it impacts travel retail, which were a significant portion of our businesses, we obviously then decided to rebase the outlook in years going forward and particularly 2023 in a much more conservative position to ensure that we can deliver on the growth aspects moving forward. Secondly, the situation in China regarding tourism around the world, as you followed our business on Filorga, it really went with Chinese travel, and as Chinese travel opens up potentially in the back half, we will see an improvement. But we assumed in the impairment that, that will continue to be a headwind for us as we move through at least the first six months of the year, slightly improving as we move through the back half of the year. And then as you well can understand the significant rise in interest rates has lowered the value in our discounted cash flow. But let me step back for a moment. Again, we continue to be very confident in our strategy around skin health. Obviously, the short-term impacts that we have had related to China, we believe ultimately, we will get behind us, but we have obviously been conservative in our assumptions on Filorga. We went into 2022, assuming China would open up and it didn't. But we feel good about where we are. We have seen some early signs, certainly in the early part of the year, particularly across our European business on Filorga to give us quite a bit of encouragement. Our U.S. business continues to be very, very strong, despite the inventory pullback that we saw in the fourth quarter. If I take our online business specifically, our share growth was up 300 basis points online in the back half of last year and on the year, which is terrific. Obviously, we incurred that share growth despite, obviously, inventories getting reduced. We do expect some of those inventories to come back slightly, but we are obviously assuming a considerable amount of conservatism there because we can't be sure that particularly the online retailers will take inventory up as quickly as they took it down. Our business overall continues to grow very, very nicely, particularly in the professional channel, which is the core part of our PCA and Elta business, and we have a good innovation plan coming on stream for 2023. So, overall, we still feel very good about the strategy behind skin health. Need China to turn and you have heard a lot of discussions about the uncertainty in China, but we think we have positioned the brand. So, obviously, as China comes back, we will be in a position to reap the benefits of that. Kevin, the only thing I would say relative to M&A strategy and capital deployment is our preference is still to deploy capital internally to our projects, because we are a big believer in return on invested capital and that generates the highest incremental returns. And so if you look at the investment we are making at Hill's and capacity, if you look at the investment we are making on some of our sustainability projects, Red Collar honestly is a little bit of both, right? It's M&A, but it also is an investment in internal growth, because we think that Hill's is one of the best growth engines we have. So I don't think there's any change in our capital allocation strategy, invest internally, we would like to pay a healthy dividend and the Board helps us develop the dividend strategy longer term. Then we will look at projects when the valuations are appropriate and we will see what happens with valuations in the market right now. I think the market is still somewhat influx from that standpoint. Good morning, Olivia. Sure. Good morning, Olivia. Again, as I mentioned earlier, Oral Care had a really, really strong year, high single-digit growth across the year and the quarter and we were high single-digit in Oral Care on three of the last four quarters and toothbrushes specifically up double-digit three of the last four quarters. Some of that was some easier comps as we were lapping some of the supply chain challenges that we had last year. But the important aspect there is share growth up on the year for both Oral -- toothpaste and toothbrushes. Specifically around elasticity, I think, it comes back to the strategy that we talked about for a couple of years now, which is the flexibility in our portfolio. We continue to innovate across all price points and we cover a wide gamut of price points, from opening to now, obviously pushing a lot more of the super premium segment, which you saw some of the examples of the success we are having in the whitening segment in that regard. So, overall, our categories -- our portfolio is well positioned for this environment. We spend a lot of time as we work through the operations around the world to ensure that we have value-added benefits to every price point within our portfolio and we are flexing our portfolio in different ways over the last couple of years and we are seeing that certainly translate into improved performance. Elmex would be a great example. Taking Elmex very selectively in the pharmy channel -- pharmacy channel around the world has allowed us to grow incremental share in those businesses. The other aspect I'd say is our core re-launches. We will have a significant core re-launch coming on the India business next year. We have re-launched our core business in some of our bigger markets around the world and that has helped some of the premium innovations come on incrementally to the franchise moving forward. So we feel pretty good about where we are with Oral Care. Elasticity is exactly where we expected and I think driven by a combination of the flexibility we have in our portfolio in addition to the innovation that we are bringing to the marketplace. Hi, Nik. Sure. As I mentioned, we had strong performance in China on the Colgate side of the business. Our Holly & Hazel business up nicely mid single digits, our Colgate business up nicely mid-to-high single digits. So, overall, we feel very good about the transformation that we put in place over the last couple of years across our China business. Our brick-and-mortar business is a little soft. But as I mentioned, that's, I think, characteristic with the lack of mobility around the country and as mobility improves, as you say, and if it improves earlier, by all means, we should benefit from that as we continue to expand our distribution in that marketplace. But it continues to be highly, highly uncertain. Obviously, the Chinese New Year, everyone is waiting very carefully to see the impacts of that. There's a lot of euphoria, but infection rates are still very, very high and things could change very, very quickly there. The comment I made about the back half is not only mobility within the country, which I think will probably, as you say, improve more quickly, but it's more external mobility in terms of more international travel, which would benefit the Filorga business. But again, we feel good from the success that we are having from a market share growth. Our -- as I mentioned earlier, our e-commerce business was up almost 300 basis points on the year this year and that is again a reflection of the strategy and some of the good innovation we brought into the market. If the markets improve, we shall -- certainly see the benefits of moving through our P&L earlier than we anticipated. But I would be quite cautious on China at this point. But over the long -- medium- and long-term, we are very optimistic about the growth opportunities there. Hey, Jason. Yeah. Thanks, Jason. As you said, we have coming off of some of the challenging capacity issues that we had in the third quarter, we feel like we have certainly turned the corner on that business. Again, a double-digit growth in the quarter, that's 27% growth on a two-year stack basis and we have delivered double-digit growth on the Hill's business 10 to 12 quarters and we feel with the capacity improvements that we have and obviously the continued increased investments that we feel we are in a very good position to deliver sustained profitable growth moving forward. Now, as I mentioned, ag prices were just up 25% half-to-half. Now you take that on the year versus last year, that's significantly more. I will let Stan talk in a moment to our hedging strategy, which is very minimal around ag prices. So we don't get a lot of -- we don't do a lot of hedging there. But, overall, it's taking pricing. It's making sure that we continue to move through the transition aspects of incorp -- integrating three plants and moving capacity from our existing plants into those plants. So there's startup costs associated with that, obviously, we are building a new web plant, which should open up towards the back half of the year. We have the startup costs associated with that running through the P&L. But all of it is around building investment ability for the future for us and our ability to continue to sustain the strong topline and the strong investment structure that we have by investing in capacity and allowing us to do the things that we do so well in the marketplace. So we feel good about where the business is. Obviously, the ag prices will be where they are and we are taking pricing, as you have seen both in the fourth quarter and plan to take more pricing in the first half of this year. But, again, if ag prices come back, things will get better, but we at this point don't expect any short-term benefits for ag coming back. Jason, I'd throw one other point, which I think is relevant to not only Hills, but to other aspects or other questions that have come up this morning. And that is the foreign exchange impact in Europe in the quarter, obviously, the second largest business outside the U.S. for Hill's is Europe and Europe had 11% headwind in foreign exchange and that obviously moved through the Colgate side of the business as well. Now you have seen the significant pricing that we are taking, but obviously, the transactional impact as well as the translational impact of that foreign exchange moved through in the fourth quarter, and certainly, dampened a little bit of the penny profit that we would have expected. Sure. Steve, let me take a very topline kind of strategically how we are integrating Red Collar and deliberate plans that we have take -- we have taken to ensure a successful integration into the Colgate-Palmolive Company. First, it's three significant plants that we are obviously integrating. And as we have talked about for the better part of a year, all of our existing facilities on Hill's have been running full out, and obviously, that is a very inefficient way to run your supply chain. Now we have obviously been investing in improved capacity, obviously, with the plants in addition to the Tonganoxie in addition to the plant that we purchased in Italy. But again, integrating those into the system to ensure one quality mechanisms are where they need to be, ensuring the lines are capable of the flexibility and the formulations and the sophistication of our formulations, making sure that, obviously, the all aspects of the science driven approach that we have taken to our formulas is well understood and by the culture of the organizations that we are integrating into the company. All of that has been very, very methodical. We are not going -- given that we need the capacity, we are not going to rush ourselves into doing this too quickly. So we have been very careful to ensure long-term success as we built the plans to bring that volume into the Colgate business over time. So, with that, let me turn it over to Stan. He will take you through a little bit of how we planned for Red Collar and how we are thinking about the ongoing startup costs associated with that. Yeah. Good morning, Rob. Thank you. Let me take the e-commerce question first. A good year for e-commerce, as I mentioned, it's up to 14% of our sales. We continue to see strong growth throughout the year, and importantly, in the most important markets around the world, we continue to see strong share growth. So, overall, we feel a lot of the work that we put into our digital transformation has paid out quite nicely in the consumption that we are seeing across the board, whether that's our skin business, whether that's our U.S. Oral Care business or our Hill's business, we are performing quite well. And we are sharing those capabilities very nicely across the enterprise, and as I have talked to you before in the past, obviously, Hill's was at the forefront of that and a lot of the skill sets that we built in our Hill's organization have certainly translated now across the enterprise and we are using those benefits to grow our e-commerce business, both on a share basis and a topline basis. The inventory drawdown was on PCA and Elta in the U.S. in the online channel, which is their number one retail channel. As you know, they sell through the profession and they sell online through the big online retailers. The big online retailers took significant inventory out of the system in the fourth quarter. These are very high priced items, as you are well aware, and they felt, I guess, managing their working capital that they were going to take those down in the fourth quarter. The good news, as I mentioned earlier, we didn't see a significant impact on our consumption. Our shares were actually up and the more important news is that we started to see that inventory rebuild itself slowly, I would say, in the first quarter of this year, particularly January. Now that's not to say that at the end of the quarter, we may see more draw downs. But in any case, the good news is we start to see some improvements there. But it was on the PCA and Elta business in the U.S. And likewise, on the Filorga business in China with the significant lockdowns that we saw across China in the fourth quarter and coming out of the third quarter, we saw significant inventory reductions in the online business there as well. Relative to private label, let me characterize, I guess, first Oral Care. So Oral Care private label in the U.S. is about 0.9 share and that share is roughly flat on the quarter -- in the fourth quarter and flat on the year. Oral Care private label shares in Europe are around 3.5%, and likewise, that share is flat. We are seeing a little bit of growth in private label businesses, particularly in Europe on some of the Home Care businesses. Obviously, cleaners dish, and to a certain extent, fabric softener, as we have seen about 1 point of growth in the private label business there, but consistent with where we expected. So nothing unusual, and importantly, we don't see, obviously, given the benign levels of shares we have seen in Oral Care, we haven't seen a significant turnaround there. On the Hill's trade-down, we have not seen trade-down thus far. If you go back to 2007, 2008, which we spent a lot of time looking at the premiumization of the category during that period. We did not see consumers pulling back on scientific -- scientifically proven Pet Nutrition. And we feel that given the strength of our innovation, and obviously, the strength of the investment that we are putting in the market, that we will be able to continue to manage that quite well. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with the end, the last question first and provide some thoughts and I will have Stan walk through you a bit more of our assumptions once again. Listen, driving gross margin for our company has always been fundamental and it's always been the fulcrum of our P&L, and as we laid out in the prepared comments, we expect gross profit to be up in 2023. I remind you that the gross profit was down 160 basis points in the fourth quarter, if -- when you exclude the impact of Red Collar. Some of the issues that we incurred in the fourth quarter, obviously, we had a mix issue with the lower skin health business that we mentioned. A little bit of a mix issue on Hill's as well with more of the Science Diet business versus prescription diet, but we obviously had the elevated ag prices moving through there and the startup costs that as Stan mentioned earlier, that moved through the gross profit line. But step back, again, I mean, we are very focused on getting pricing in the P&L and you have seen that sequentially improve from third to fourth quarter. We expect that to benefit us next year. Now there are a lot of assumptions on where commodities go. We talked about a couple of hundred million dollars there. But remember where we were in the first quarter of this year. We had a lot of assumptions there and we got ahead of that very, very quickly in terms of where things move. Now if things move -- stay where they are, improve, obviously, we don't think we will be at the low end of our guidance. But we feel it's a prudent and flexible place to be given the uncertainty that we have seen and the movement that we have seen, certainly, over the last six months to nine months in commodity prices not to mention foreign exchange. So let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more color once again on where we are from some of our locks in our contracts. Sure. Well, we didn't pull back on the advertising investment, obviously, that was down 20 basis on a percent to sales, but if you exclude Red Collar advertising was flat and on a local currency basis, Lauren, the advertising was up and that becomes fundamental to continue to build the momentum of the progress we have seen in 2022 to ensure that we deliver that continued momentum in 2023 and that was a very deliberate choice to sustain the investment moving through the quarter. Obviously, a little bit of softness in gross margin, as I mentioned, largely driven by mix of the Hill's business coming in a little bit lower than we expected, as well as skin health, but we feel those are well under control. We have good visibility about where those two businesses are going. So we feel like we are in a pretty good position to continue to execute against our strategy, deliver gets the gross margin improvement in 2023. Obviously, the first half we have a bit more visibility, we don't have that visibility in the second half, but we will continue to execute against what we see in front of us and that is our need to take more pricing, get it into the P&L and ensure we have the investment to support that. Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, Lauren, we are very pleased with that middle part of the P&L around how we managed overheads, which given, obviously, the headwinds we have seen below that around interest expense, as well as tax, it's extremely important that we got ahead of that. We delivered an additional 50 basis points of overhead on top of the 150 basis points that we had in the previous year. So we feel that structures us well to invest in strategically the areas that we think are fundamental to driving long-term growth. Those are the capabilities that we have talked about around digital transformation, improved capabilities around innovation, certainly as we restructure that part of the organization and making sure that we have that operating leverage to sustain the advertising investment, which is clearly driving a good topline growth for us. All right. Let me hit the topline, and Bryan, good morning, by the way, and I will let Stan take you through some of the puts and takes. But, overall, cash flow -- our cash was down due to lower cash income, right? Obviously, that was the higher -- that was some choices that we made, particularly around working capital investments, a little bit increase in inventories as we were dealing with some of the supply chain disruptions we saw from suppliers and our need to sustain the consumption growth that we had in the marketplace, particularly some of the stronger consumption growth, but obviously, inventory days came up as a consequence of that. But we improved a bit a bit of that in the fourth quarter versus where we were in the third quarter. But clearly, it was driven by the lower cash profits driven by, obviously, the sustained foreign exchange hit as well as the challenges that we saw moving through gross margin on the year. CapEx was the other one, a deliberate choice for us, obviously, the growth that we have made -- the growth that we put into Hill's, and the investment and the significant increase in capital expenditures there and some of the increases that John mentioned earlier around sustainability, which we think are extremely important to position us for where the markets are moving forward. And overall, I would say that we expect a very nice improvement in operating cash flow in 2023. Yeah. The only thing I would add is strategically these investments are all around positioning us for long-term growth and success. A lot of discussion goes into the choices we make around our capital investments. And the supply chain, and certainly, the IT team are very focused on ensuring that the money is being put into areas that are going to give us improved capabilities moving forward and allow us to weather some of the storms that you have seen over the last three years where we have recognized the challenges and generated real opportunities coming out of those and that certainly has driven the topline of the company. So, with that, let me just finish off. I think that's the end of the questions. Again, 2022 was another year of strong progress for the business in terms of sales, market shares and productivity that moved through the P&L, but more importantly, the capabilities that we are building across the organization. We are excited to see the leverage moving through the P&L and we will see that continue in 2023 that will allow us to deliver the investment to sustain good topline growth, and obviously, very focused on delivering shareholder value moving forward. We will see everyone, I hope down in CAGNY in February, where we can talk a little bit about more of our plans in terms of how we are seeing 2023 unfold. But I'd be remiss not to thank all the Colgate people listening on the call for an extraordinary year in 2022, a lot of challenges, but we recognize the opportunities that we had in front of us and I wish all of you a happy and successful 2023. Thanks, everyone."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Stan Sutula",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Noel. And on gross profit margin, you started to see some progress, right? North America, Latin America and Africa, Eurasia, you saw improvements in the operating margin in the fourth quarter. As we look at gross profit, Noel, highlighted the pricing, that significant flow-through will help in 2022. The productivity will be a tailwind here and while material and Ranpak in particular will still be a headwind that moderates coming off of 2022. So, as you look at gross profit margin expansion, that's going to be a benefit. But keep in mind, as you work down, we are going to have investments in advertising. We expect to increase that on a dollars and percent of sales. But also keep in mind, as you go down the income statement that interest expense is going to be up year-to-year. That's driven predominantly by increase in rates and also by slightly increased debt levels as we carry Red Collar in for the full year. And also taxes, so taxes around the world, in particular in recessionary environments, potentially being out there, we expect our tax position will be slightly higher on a year-on-year basis. So, while the operating margin or EBIT margin we expect will be up nicely, that will be partially offset by interest and taxes, delivering low-to-mid single-digit EPS growth. Yeah. The raw materials continue, as Noel highlighted, to be a headwind for us and your range is probably in the right ballpark here as you think about that on a year-on-year basis. But I would emphasize, it has been volatile. So things have moved up and down pretty significantly here, and in particular, the agriculture and how that applies to Hill's, those have not moderated, up in the second half, as Noel talked about at 25%, and as we look ahead, we think that will continue to be the primary headwind in raw and pack. The other volatile one is natural gas. Now fortunately, that's been a benefit here in terms of moderating in the late second half and fourth quarter. But we expect that could be volatile as well heading into particularly the back half of 2023. So a combination of those two primarily we think are the drivers as you look at raw impact going into the year. Now we have laid out our pricing actions and are funding the growth savings that we look to drive, combined with our productivity. And I will just mention Red Collar will moderate, but it's still going to be an impact on a full year basis and it's important to realize that. So that will moderate through the year on a full year basis, it will still be an impact on overall gross margin. And the capital allocation, I think, as we look at that return $2.9 billion to shareholders. We had $900 million of net share buyback. We have paid dividends since 1895 and 60 consecutive years of increasing it. So our capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. We think it's the right long-term strategy and we think our investment in M&A is appropriate when we don't have a better internal investment to do or to fill opportunities for us to fill out our model. Yeah. Thanks, Jason and Noel. So what I'd add on to that is, we don't have a large hedging program against ag and that's a philosophy for us. So we look, we do partial hedges there in ag. We don't do that in most other categories. But just while we have highlighted ag, there are other areas here like chicken livers, other specialty products that come in as part of the diets that make us more complex, as well as all the amino acids and everything else. Those have all had inflation as well. So while agriculture products have had the most significant, we have also had those and things like the AVM flu do have a ripple effect into the availability of those products. So as we look, we have also integrated now four plants through acquisitions, one from Nutriamo earlier in the year and then the three from Red Collar. So we took those over on September 30th. That integration has gone well. But as you would expect, there are startup costs that go along with that. As we bring Tonganoxie online, that's our new wet plant in Kansas in the second half of the year. We are very excited about that plan. It has great automation. It's going to be, I think, a great addition to the portfolio. But that has startup costs in 2023, in particular, in the first half as we hire staffing, get the staffing right heading into or going live. So important here on Hill's, we see a great market opportunity, science-based, our research center really supports that. We are investing the advertising behind that to drive that capability and to drive that demand and we think that serves us well for the long-term. So we expect margin improvement heading into 2023 in Hill's. We are excited about that market opportunity and what it represents to the company. We also think it fits really well in our overall portfolio with a science based approach. Yeah. So let's start with Red Collar first. So as Red Collar comes in and we cut over production over time and this will be over an elongated period of time. There are a few things that have to happen. One, and of course, I should start, all of this is baked into our guidance. So as we planned this out, this is all incorporated within our guidance. So first, as we take the Red Collar facilities and migrate those over to produce Hill's formulas, there is investment that has to go into that. We have incorporated that into our capital and we have incorporated any income statement impact into the numbers. And that really centers around what Red Collar was producing was much simpler formulas for us and for others, and our diets, our formulas are much more complex, in particular, in the prescription diet area, which is why I think they are such valuable to consumers. So that involves additional mixing, additional ability and testing, quality testing as we go in, and that will require capital investment into those facilities, all planned all on track. The variances that we have in total, so let me step back to there, the variances that we have in total go into gross profit so that as they are going through, we expect that those will get better. We expect that those will get better as we get some relief on the overall manufacturing as those Red Collar facilities come fully on board and produce more of Hill's formulas. That allows us to go in and do more efficiency planning within the existing facilities. So as we think about Tonganoxie, that's, again, the new wet food plant that will come online in the second half of 2023. In the beginning, we do have some startup costs there and those startup costs, again, are around things like bubble staffing as we bring the staff on board and get them trained and so we expect that, that will contribute in the second half, but it becomes a headwind in the first half around Hill's. So thinking about Red Collar, keep in mind that this was acquired and was in for the full quarter of Q4 of 2022. So we will wrap around from an impact here in Q4 of 2023. But as we go forward, you should think that the impact to margin is roughly in line with what we saw in fourth quarter. So it would be a benefit to the topline and given that the private label activity is at a much lower margin that will impact margin through the year but at a slightly decreasing rate. So, thanks, Noel. Rob, let me just pick up on the on the Hill's organic and private label and how we are showing that. If you look at the press release, you stated, you saw net sales were up 20%, organic sales were up 14%. There is no private label in the organic sales. So we include in the net sales, but in organic, it will only be inorganic when it wraps around for the year, which will be in the fourth quarter. So when you see organic sales that represents true year-on-year with no private label benefit in that number. Similar to volume, you will see the volume in a press release at plus 10% and then organic volume at plus 0.5%. So volume expanded even outside of private label, you get a feel for the size of private label in the as reported volume number. So, again, that will be that way Q1 through Q3, and then in Q4, it will wrap around, because it will be in both years and be in the organic numbers. . Yeah. So on gross profit and we look at raw and pack, we do lock in a majority of our commodities here at least 90 days out for the next quarter. But there is still conversion costs, there's still the manufacturing variances that we have to go through, labor cost that goes into that, et cetera. So when we look at this and for fourth quarter, the 250 basis point as reported decline in margin, again, private label drove about 90 points of that, so you are at 160 basis points. And as we look at prices here, again, it was 920 basis points, relatively consistent with Q3 and our conversion costs and some of the variances that we talked about had an impact overall on margin versus our original expectation. As we look going ahead, we are guiding for expansion of gross profit margin heading into 2023 and we think as we look at that, the components of that are going to be moderating commodities are on pack, improved pricing in RGM and then the productivity work that we have been doing across the Board will have a benefit here to margin. So the margin expansion again fuels that investment into advertising. So we do believe that margin expansion is a core component of foundation of our overall model and so that expansion into next year will fuel that model, which will allow us to deliver low-to-mid single-digit earnings growth. The only thing I'd add, Lauren, on that one is, look, we took actions early in the year, particularly around the global productivity initiative that started to pay off in the back half of the year. So we saw some of that flow through here hit in the back half of the year. And we manage the overhead lines carefully and because we are running the entire P&L up and down and those overhead lines, we prioritize within that. We want to make sure we support advertising, digital, analytics and then we make trade-offs within that, as you would expect us to do go forward. We think that's just a prudent way to run the business and we will continue to do that heading into 2023. Yeah. Let me pick up there on the cash flow. So, as Noel said, we do expect improvement in 2023 and it's really going to be two-fold. One, the improvement in cash profits, as we have guided to, and second, the improvement in working capital. We see opportunities there. We have been conservative on our working capital here in 2022 and particularly around inventory. We wanted to make sure that we could restore fill rates across the board that we had enough inventory to supply. And in particular towards the late in the fourth quarter as China had impacts from COVID on manufacturing, we prudently brought in additional inventory to make sure we could fulfill clients over the year end. On -- so on cash flow, we expect improvement in both working capital and cash profits. On interest expense, you see in fourth quarter a material increase on a year-on-year basis, and again, really comes from two components. First, the impact that it has on floating rate debt, in particular, CP, that's up significantly, as you know. And then second, we are carrying a slightly higher debt level, though, quite comfortable within our range and our leverage metrics for heading into 2023. So as you think about that interest expense, it will be larger than the gap you saw in fourth quarter, simply because you get a full year of carrying the Red Collar of funding through the year. That said, we think we have highly competitive rates on our debt going through. We have great access to the markets that fund our overall model. So, on capital spending, as you saw from our press release, we spent just under $700 million. I expect that could go up a little bit as we look at 2023 and that's really in a couple of areas. First, we are going to complete Tonganoxie as that comes online in the second half. And that we talked already about the Red Collar facilities, we have great plans for those as we are going to significantly increase our overall capacity for our Hill's business, which operates in a terrific segment and that investment obviously will have capital spending. In addition, we invest in sustainability type efforts like recyclable tube, which we think are important. We will continue to roll that out in a prudent manner and we continue to invest in IT capabilities, including our S/4HANA journey that we are well underway. So, overall, we are comfortable with the position heading into 2023 and that will expand cash flow at a material level on a year-on-year basis."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&A, John Faucher.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Allison. Good morning and welcome to our 2022 third quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with his thoughts on our Q3 results and our 2022 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. We continue to execute our growth strategy as we deal with an operating environment that remains very volatile. In the third quarter, we delivered high single-digit organic sales growth with growth across every division. We also delivered growth in all four of our categories, including high single-digit growth in Oral Care, Pet Nutrition and Personal Care. I know elasticities are a big topic of conversation this quarter. While our volumes were negatively impacted by retailer inventory reductions and Hill\u2019s supply chain constraints in the quarter, underlying elasticity remained in line with our expectations and we would expect volume performance to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter as these headwinds abate. We delivered strong pricing growth through revenue growth management and healthy productivity through Funding the Growth and the initial benefits of our 2022 Global Productivity Initiative. This helped us drive a sequential improvement in gross margin in the third quarter despite further increases in raw material prices. The headwinds we face, whether from foreign exchange, raw and packaging materials and logistics costs or macroeconomic uncertainty are significant, but we believe we are well positioned to deal with these issues. We have taken the difficult steps necessary to meet these challenges head on through pricing, productivity, capital deployment and other actions. These actions leave us well positioned to benefit when our markets stabilize. The first reason is our portfolio. We have focused \u2013 we have a focused portfolio of leading brands in growing categories competing across multiple price tiers. Consumers use the vast majority of our products everyday: when they shower, when they clean their homes, when they feed their pets and hopefully, when they brush their teeth after every meal. We believe this high frequency of usage, combined with the strength of our brands, helped with our elasticities despite significant pricing. This has been particularly true in Oral Care and our categories generally have low private label market shares compared to many other HPC categories where we don\u2019t compete. Consumers look to trusted brands to provide value and we have built brands over time to deliver value to our customers and our consumers, particularly given our breadth of offerings across price tiers from entry level to ultra premium. And our professional recommendation model in several of our largest categories also helps to provide added value and differentiation to consumers, which builds brand loyalty. And we have high market shares with number one or number two positions in many of our key segments across all four of our categories. We are also well positioned because we are building capabilities and then scaling them across the company in order to drive growth both now and in the future. Our most important capabilities are focused on science-led innovation, particularly in a time when there is so much pricing in our categories, it is vital to add consumer identifiable value. You can see our progress here on brands like Colgate Optic White, Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet, EltaMD and many others. It is also helping to drive improvements in our market share trends. I spent a lot of time at Barclays talking about our digital transformation, an area that is impacting every facet of our business: our e-commerce performance, the ROI of our advertising, a digital-driven supply chain, the use of AI and new product development and even how we are doing our training around the world. Revenue growth management is another capability we are scaling across the organization. We are putting the full force and effort of our data and analytics team into our RGM planning. We believe this is also helping us to make RGM\u2019s decisions to help to lessen the impact of elasticities. So as we head into the Q&A, I want to reiterate that our strategy is working and through an environment that remains uncertain and volatile, we believe we are well positioned with strong brands, scaling capabilities and most importantly, great people. So I will turn it over to the Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good morning everyone. I hope you are doing well. So I wanted to ask specifically on Hill\u2019s. Maybe first, is there a way you could potentially quantify the impact of the supply chain constraints and reductions in retail inventory had on organic sales in the quarter? And then maybe more importantly, I know you mentioned a return to double-digit organic sales growth in September, but can you maybe discuss why you remain confident in the acceleration in the business looking out to the fourth quarter and potentially longer term? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks Peter. Let me go back to the strategy. And I think as it underpins some of the \u2013 obviously, the supply chain constraints that we had earlier in the quarter, which is obviously based on really high demand for the brand. And we have had nine quarters of double-digit growth on that business with fundamentally the same supply chain network. So if you go back to the core elements of the strategy, really building science-driven innovation that we translate into claims for the consumer, claims for our vets and vet technicians that drives to endorsement of our brand. We translate that digitally across the enterprise run our e-commerce business ahead of general market shares. Ultimately, that is driving strong consumption. What happened in the early part of the quarter is the supply chain is obviously at 100% capacity, pre, obviously, the acquisitions of Red Collar and the acquisition that we made in Europe. We now have the ability to really free up capacity moving forward. We are going to be able to do a lot more efficient production in our existing facilities. We are transferring a lot of that volume into the new Red Collar facilities, which are coming upstream as of October. So we feel very good moving forward. And as you mentioned, we exited the quarter back in double-digit growth. So strong consumption in the business, shipments outpacing \u2013 excuse me, consumption, obviously, outpacing shipments and we feel very good about where we are in the next 3 to 6 months as we integrate the Red Collar acquisition and continue to operate our plants more efficiently in the existing network.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning. So, obviously incredibly strong pricing in the quarter. We haven\u2019t seen that level of quarterly growth in decades. So it would be helpful just to understand what you are seeing competitively out there given such strong Colgate pricing. Are you content with price gaps? Are you generally seeing competitors follow or might there be adjustments that are needed as you think about that pricing line going forward? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, good morning Eric. Thanks. Let\u2019s go back to, again, what we have been discussing all year. We took pricing obviously as we articulated in the second quarter, particularly across North America and other divisions. That pricing continued obviously in the third quarter. We have led pricing in many of our markets and that has been fundamental to the growth of the business right now. We believe it\u2019s critical to get the pricing into the P&L. We have now seen competitors begin to follow. So that should alleviate some of the volume pressure that we saw early in the quarter, but we feel very good about where we are with pricing. We obviously feel that the market will continue to hold that pricing as we see a very constructive market, as I have discussed in the past, with competition. Now competition was a little slow to follow, but we have seen that in the later end of the quarter that most of our competitors have followed in our core categories. So we feel pretty good. We talked about elasticities upfront. They are more or less in line with where we articulated at Barclays. We have seen a little bit more elasticity given the pricing that we took in some of the Home Care businesses. But again, we took Home Care pricing ahead of competition and competition is now following. So, we expect that to alleviate as we move forward. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are. Obviously, foreign exchange is the new dynamic we are dealing with and having lots of discussions with the team on how to manage price volume moving forward, but we feel very good about where we are right now.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. So can you comment a bit on the pace of volumes exiting the quarter? I think you alluded to the fact that Hill\u2019s got better with the acquisition. I know it takes, you mentioned, 3 to 6 months. I just want to reconcile, Noel, your comment also on pricing that your competitors are following now and then you hope to alleviate. Should we expect like the way the quarter unfolded that volumes were not as bad as you exit the quarter? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Andrea. Volumes improved as we exited the quarter as we talked about, obviously some of the supply chain constraints upfront on Hill\u2019s. We talked about post Barclays, as you remember we saw some early warning signs in the online business on our trade partners taking inventory down. We had not seen it in brick and mortar at that stage, but we had communicated that, that\u2019s not to say that might happen towards the end of the quarter, which is exactly what happened. We saw some inventory come out in some of the key retailers in North America. We obviously saw continued reductions in inventory on Amazon throughout the quarter and that ultimately led to roughly 100 basis points of headwinds on the quarter. Take that with additional 50 basis points of Russia impact in the quarter and obviously some of the supply chain constraints. So, we feel good about volume sequentially improving in the fourth quarter. Obviously, consumption seems to be holding out, but we have to bear in mind that there is a lot of pricing going in the market across multiple categories. So we will continue to watch that very carefully. We have also obviously had to pull a little bit of the advertising back in the quarter as we saw consumption across most categories slowdown in Europe and obviously the constraints on Hill\u2019s. Hill\u2019s, we moved that money to the fourth quarter to continue to drive consumption and exit the year strongly. We do not want to be cutting investment. We believe this hopefully, some of these volatility is short term. Our focus is continue to invest behind the brands and drive consumption as we move into 2023.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. Can you just perhaps comment on how you feel about gross margin progression, really pricing still coming in quite strong and the commodity impact actually worsened sequentially. But ultimately, commodities will ease going forward and into next year and presumably productivity remains a good story. So in the context of what you are seeing on the volume side, do you feel like you might need to reinvest back some to drive demand within promotions and perhaps that can reduce net pricing? But in general, it does feel like you are weathering quite a bit of commodity pressure here with pricing and these things are going to ease going forward. So I wonder if you could just give a sense on how you feel about gross margin progression over time? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Let me just \u2013 I will take it conceptually and strategically the top and then let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more color. Overall, strategically, as we talked about coming into the second quarter, we felt it was very important to get ahead of the inflationary environment and take as much pricing as we could. We watch that very carefully obviously with consumption. You combine that with the initiatives that we set out for 2022 with our Global Productivity Index. We felt it was very important to get ahead of this, which we announced back in 2021. And we are seeing that coming through on the gross profit line, obviously, gross profit up sequentially in the quarter despite 920 points of headwind in the gross margin reconciliation. So we feel that was important to get that in and we will continue to take pricing as necessary. Raw materials, I will turn it over to Stan to give you a flavor of where those are right now. We have seen a little bit of pullback, but more or less, we are still seeing significant increases versus where we were last year. Stan?\nStan Sutula: Yes. So we have seen some modest movement in materials cost. But overall, we continue to see raw materials as a full year 2022 as $1.3 billion full year increase. As a reminder, that\u2019s 23% year-to-year. In the third quarter, as Noel highlighted, it was 920 points, so a little bit of color underneath that. Oil has generally been lower since our last call, but now has kind of creep back to where it was then. We have seen ag as an offset here. It increased versus our previous guidance, particularly around proteins, corn, etcetera and those are notably higher versus where we were in July. Partially offsetting that, we have seen palm oil has actually come in a decent amount. Now, that\u2019s favorable, but tallow, soybean and other oils are still showing elevated levels of inflation. So, that\u2019s what keeps us at the $1.3 billion for the year. As a reminder, we lock in, so typically and this quarter is no exception, we are largely locked in for fourth quarter. Now one of the common \u2013 while natural gas is not a raw material per se, we do use it to power our plants, particularly in Europe. And that\u2019s been volatile and continues to escalate. So as we expected, raw materials continue to move, but overall, still see $1.3 billion. And this is why we have our GPI program, our Funding the Growth program as we look to take productivity to mitigate that 920 point headwind.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning. Stan maybe if I could just pick up on the last question. Can you just give us a sense of just given how volatile maybe raw material costs have been, are you locking in or hedging further out? And as we begin to kind of look at 2023, is there \u2013 how far ahead are you in terms of being locked in on raw material costs for \u201823?\nStan Sutula: Yes. Thanks for the question, Bryan. So as we look, we\u2019ve seen the volatility. While we\u2019ve had movement up and down, the $1.3 billion is exactly the same number we highlighted out of last quarter. So while we\u2019ve seen components move up and down, we\u2019ve only seen modest movement on a net basis. We typically lock in the next quarter, and then we do, do some longer-term pricing into that, mock that in out quarters. But it\u2019s relatively modest. As you\u2019d expect, the near quarter gets the most, and then it kind of scales down. But today, we\u2019re not going to give 2023 guidance. What we are looking at is the movement that we see. We\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re very prudent on not locking in areas that we think are going to moderate over time. And then we don\u2019t do a lot of hedging. So we do some in the ag space, but we don\u2019t do a lot of hedging among the others. We think price is the ultimate hedge.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. A couple of quick questions I\u2019ll try to squeeze in. So back to the $1.3 billion inflation, our quick math suggests that implies a reasonable amount of moderation in the fourth quarter. Still inflation, but certainly less than what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last two quarters. A, is that right? And secondly, in your Q, you give round numbers on percentage of sales by category. And I know they are round numbers. So there can be a lot of variability there. But it does suggest that you\u2019re seeing year-on-year declines in your Personal Care and Home Care categories. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re seeing within those individual categories? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Let me take the categories first, and then I\u2019ll let Stan provide a little bit more color on the raw materials and where we see the fourth quarter. Categories, by and large, are where we estimated. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen a little pullback in the Home Care categories, but Personal Care, Oral Care and Pet Nutrition continue to be quite healthy, particularly given the pricing that\u2019s going into the category. Relative to year-on-year, I mean, all of our categories in terms of how we play them are up. There may be some impact from foreign exchange there, Jason. But other than that, we see good growth across a broad nature of our categories.\nStan Sutula: And on the raw materials, Jason, we said in our last call that we thought this is going to peak in Q3. We continue to believe that. So while the full year still holds at $1.3 billion, we do expect some slight moderation in Q4. And again, we\u2019re largely locked in for that.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. The one area I\u2019d add is ag prices and some of the specialty ingredients that we use in Science Diet and Prescription Diet, those continue to be quite high. So we\u2019re watching those quite carefully as we move into \u201823.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to pivot, Noel, ask a question on portfolio strategy, two parts to it. The first one, the overall level of satisfaction with the portfolio. As you sit here today, any updated thoughts on where you potentially would want to augment through M&A. And the second part, as it pertains to Hill\u2019s, which is a business which has done extraordinarily well here recently, there is a view in the marketplace there is potentially some latent value in the Colgate portfolio, specifically related to that business. Love to get your thoughts there, perhaps remind us of the Board\u2019s approach to portfolio assessment. Thanks for that.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks for the question. In a world of significant volatility, we are really pleased with the diversity of the categories we compete in. They are carefully curated categories. We\u2019re highly focused on four. As you all know, we\u2019ve been focused on four for a long, long time. We have deep understanding in those four categories. We believe they are well constructed and well positioned for future growth whether you\u2019re looking at consumption opportunities, whether you\u2019re looking at price-driven opportunities in terms of premiumization. And obviously, they are all not going to run in tandem. And we\u2019ve obviously done some great things in the Pet Nutrition categories. We\u2019ve pivoted a lot of that strategy over the last 4 years, and you\u2019ve seen the success of that. You\u2019ve seen the success in this year as we\u2019re driving broad-based growth across all of our categories, which I talked about initially. Very happy with skin health. Obviously, the professional skin business in the U.S. continues to perform very well. Yes, the Filorga business in China continues to be a challenge, given the lockdowns we\u2019ve seen in China and the lack of travel of Chinese consumers around the world. But overall, we feel the ebb and flow of our categories is exactly where we want to be right now. And we feel very fortunate that we\u2019re very focused on four, and all those categories are growing today.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Great, thank you. My question was more around expenses. First on commodities and raw mat, is it possible to kind of parse out how much currency played a part versus inflation on a constant currency basis? And then on advertising, if you could just give a little bit more color. It sounded like most of that was related to the disruption in Hill\u2019s. Just a little bit more color in terms of your ongoing expectations, particularly in sort of the digital aspect, given what we\u2019ve heard from some of the digital advertisers. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: So let me start with the expenses piece. So on raw materials, obviously, we operate in over 200 countries and territories. So as you think about the currency impact on our overall portfolio, that also impacts our raw materials. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s outsized in any particular one. Some materials are sourced from one or two suppliers, so they\u2019ll have an outsized impact while others are sourced locally. And those have a natural hedge, if you will, from a currency aspect. So FX, as you think about the impact to raw materials, you should think about that largely in line with the impact of the overall company, and that will vary slightly by division.\nStan Sutula: On advertising, Olivia, you heard us say that on a dollar basis, we were down about 3%, but on a local currency basis, we were up 2%. So overall, we still feel good with the impact we\u2019re having in the markets. We\u2019ve done a lot of work, as others have done, to really optimize our spending with obviously a move of 50-plus of our spending now, 50% plus of our spend in digital. We\u2019re able to get much more deep into the analytics and the ROI metrics. We\u2019re doing a much better job at personalizing our content. As I\u2019ve talked about before, over 40,000 people around the world on our digital transformation, media being an important part of that. So we feel we\u2019re getting much better. We pulled back a little in Europe as we saw a pretty significant drop off in the categories. And so we wanted to be prudent as we thought about investment moving forward. And as I mentioned earlier, we pulled back a little bit in the third quarter at Hill\u2019s, but transferred that money into the fourth quarter to continue to drive consumption as we bring on more capacity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Callum Elliott of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nCallum Elliott: Hi, thanks for the question. Another portfolio question, if that\u2019s okay. I just wanted to ask you, can you talk please about the operational integration of the Oral Care business with the Personal Care and Home Care businesses, and specifically with a view to how difficult would it be to separate parts of or all of Personal Care, Home Care, if you were to change about the value of those Personal Care, Home Care businesses to the overall company?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. What I\u2019m going to do is step back again and talk about the strategy of the company and why it\u2019s working. And I think the results today illustrate that our growth strategies across all of our businesses and how we integrate those businesses and scale our capabilities are delivering strong performance for the overall business, 15 quarters now of organic sales growth within our 3% to 5% target range. We\u2019ve had growth in every division in all four of our categories. And we\u2019re particularly pleased, obviously, this quarter with high single-digit growth in Oral Care, our Personal Care business as well as our Pet Nutrition business. A key part of that strategy, which I think gets to the heart of your question, is how we\u2019re leveraging our capabilities across the enterprise. We\u2019ve talked about our science-driven approach, clinical substantiation for our products that drive claims, consumer acceptance, drive \u2013 lead to professional endorsement. As you know, we have a strong professional model across our pet business, our Oral Care business as well as our skin health business. We\u2019re leveraging those learnings. In fact, over the last 1.5 years, we put an organization in New York simply to look at how we continue to optimize and sharpen our professional strategies as we see brand recommended most often is a key driver of saliency for the brands and the equities and ultimately loyalty. Our digital transformation largely initially led by Hill\u2019s. We have now taken their capabilities, their talent and use those across the entire enterprise to further our digital capabilities. You\u2019ve seen our e-commerce business is one of the fastest-growing channel businesses that we have today. Our market shares in markets like China, which is the biggest e-commerce market, are outdelivering against any other competitor in the market. And we really attribute that to leveraging the scalability of certain capabilities across the enterprise. So again, we like the four categories we compete in, a lot of similarities, a lot of overlap. And we continue to see that executed in terms of the results that we\u2019ve delivered today.\nStan Sutula: One thing I\u2019d add there, I think, is that integration extends to our supply chain. One of our key attributes here is the production that we do across the world. And we integrate that particularly across Personal Care, Home Care and Oral Care, and that gives us a lot of leverage.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess two things. First off is you\u2019ve commented quite a bit on elasticity and feeling \u2013 saying it\u2019s very much in line. And I think you\u2019ve done a nice job calling out Hill\u2019s and then the inventory destocking in North America. But one thing that jumped out to me was just the volume performance in Latin America. So if you could just give \u2013 from other companies, I think we\u2019ve kind of seen what looks like a bit better resiliency in the face of pricing. So just curious if you could offer some more detail on Latin America? And secondly, I was just curious on your view broadly on inflation in grocery into 2023. How much more space do you think there is for incremental pricing across your portfolio? Is it terribly different domestically versus internationally? I\u2019d just be curious for some perspective on that as well. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Lauren. Let me talk to Latin America. In fact, I just got back from trips to Brazil and Mexico. So the information is very fresh. You saw the 20% pricing that we took in Latin America, obviously, following significant pricing in the second quarter, about 12.5. And as I mentioned upfront, we have led in pricing across all of our categories in Latin America. And as a result of leading, it took time for the others to catch up. And obviously, you got elasticity when the others haven\u2019t catch up is going to be a little bit higher. As we exited the quarter, we started to see volumes improve, particularly across Personal Care and Oral Care. Home Care, a little slow to recover, but we will see \u2013 I think we will see that stabilize as we move forward. But overall, the plans I saw in place in both Brazil and Mexico were really, really strong. Shares, very good in Brazil, a little soft in Mexico, particularly in Oral Care, given the fact that we took aggressive pricing competition follow initially. As I was leaving those markets, competition followed. So we feel pretty good as we move into the fourth quarter and into 2023. And the innovation plans that we have in place and the premiumization plans we have in place in Latin America look really, really strong. In fact, in both Mexico and Brazil, we have seen our share of the premium segment grow sequentially over the last five quarters, six quarters. So we feel good about where we are there. We\u2019re also, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, the importance of our core businesses, relaunching some of our core businesses to ensure that if we do see trade down and we continue to provide value at the opening price point, we\u2019re there for that consumer, so overall, feeling good about Latin America as we move into the fourth quarter and in 2023. Relative to inflation moving forward, listen, I think everyone is going to deal with that how they see fit. We will continue to take pricing. I think the key aspect for us is continuing to invest behind brand building. And that brand building ultimately allows us to take more pricing in the markets around the world and continue to drive value to our consumers. Now we will see where the competition goes. If inflation becomes more benign, which I think most people expect it to be, we will watch that carefully. But the pricing environment has been to now very constructive. And we anticipate that as we can bring stronger innovation into the market, continue to invest behind our brands, we will minimize the elasticity. Is there more opportunity in grocery? Absolutely. We will see that as it comes to fruition. But right now, we feel good about where we have taken pricing and particularly the plans we have in place to minimize elasticity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hi guys. Good morning. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about Europe? Obviously, we can see the delivery in the quarter, but an area where inflation might be the most acute is also an area where the consumer might be under the most amount of pressure. So, maybe if you can just talk about your outlook for Europe, particularly as we are going into the winter?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. You are right. I mean Europe is certainly under the most pressure, particularly around energy pricing. We have taken significant pricing in Europe as others have. It\u2019s \u2013 as you go back and look at that in history, it\u2019s the most pricing that\u2019s gone into the business in quite some time. Importantly, we have a good mix of price points covered in Europe. The strength of our Elmex and our Meridol brands, obviously, at the premium side, and Colgate, obviously more in the mainstream, you have seen the combination of those two businesses grow share in the quarter and in the year. So, we feel good about where we are. As I mentioned earlier, I think consistently across the world, a little bit more elasticity in the home care businesses. But we have got some pretty significant re-launches coming in early 2023 on our home care businesses. So, we feel good about the plans in place we have in order to continue to drive consumption there. So, overall, it\u2019s going to be a tough winter. We are going to watch that very closely. We feel we have got a good mix of brands at different price points to deal with the significant inflation that consumer is going to have to deal with. But obviously, a tough six months ahead of the Europeans.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just a couple of sort of follow-up questions. On the inventory side, the retail adjustments, is that \u2013 are you confident that\u2019s done at this point? And is there anything on the e-commerce side where there could be adjustments in terms of e-commerce-related inventories? And then second, can you give us any more details on China? We talked about that a lot in the past. How are you doing there? How are the market share trends? And how is that market starting to reopen? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Good morning Rob. Thanks. On the inventory adjustments, obviously, we saw quite a bit come out towards the end of the quarter. Is it done, we can\u2019t make that prediction. We follow these inventories, as I mentioned, I think on the second quarter call or up at Barclays to the day. I mean particularly with our big customers, we work very much in collaboration with them on the guidance and goals that they have. Invariably, what happens is they may take democratic decisions across all the categories if they are reducing inventories, and we deal with that unexpectedly towards the end of the quarter. We obviously are staying very close to case builds and on-shelf availability and communicating that back as necessary. The last thing they want to do is obviously run out of stocks, particularly with our portfolio, which are significant traffic drivers across the categories in which we compete. So, is it done, it\u2019s hard to say. It is below where they historically have managed their inventories. That usually means that they will bring them back to those levels or something closer, but we will have to watch that very carefully. It\u2019s very difficult for me to predict. A great quarter for China, we have talked about China over the last 2 years in terms of the transformation of our strategy on the ground, which was significant from our entire go-to-market to some of our marketing and innovation plans. We have seen our e-commerce continue to be one of the fastest-growing e-commerce brands in the market. We have seen our brick-and-mortar business stabilize over the last couple of quarters, which is terrific. You saw the growth that we delivered the last two quarters for greater were greater \u2013 our Greater China region, we delivered positive pricing and positive volume across our enterprise. We had the Hawley & Hazel, the Darlie re-launch has gone into effect. This is a significant, significant re-launch for the brand, changing the brand name. That\u2019s been quite successful. Our Colgate business continues to track well. So, overall, we feel good. Now no question, the lockdowns are having an impact. The lockdowns have had a significant impact on our Filorga business. They have had a significant impact on some of our premium brands as we have seen those typically translate into slower online sales. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are. We will see where the lockdowns go. That will open up the market. And as that comes back to a more stable predictability, we feel good about where we are and what we built in terms of capabilities on the ground during a very difficult 18 months.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up about your thoughts about big picture about promotional efficacy. The big debate is how much \u2013 I know you talked about everybody is wondering how much promotion is going to come back structurally. But I wanted to dig in and any comment you could have about are more people \u2013 people have gotten trained off of buying on deals. So, now a little bit more promos coming back in. It\u2019s a little bit more little-by-little anyway. How is promotional \u2013 is promotional efficacy where you are promoting working better or worse than your expectations, particularly in, say, North America and Europe, developed markets? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Jonathan, thanks for the question. Clearly, I think as the consumer becomes more strapped relative to inflation, they will be more astute in looking at promotions. I can characterize at least where promotional volumes are, particularly for North America. And it would be somewhat a generalized consensus for the rest of the world. Our promotional volumes are slightly down year-to-date. That was deliberately \u2013 deliberate. We have pulled back on some aggressive couponing that can drive volume, but doesn\u2019t do much for your P&L. We have seen some of our competitors follow that strategy, not all of them. I would say our two key competitors have taken their promotions up a little bit in the U.S. But you saw the U.S. numbers, at least our consumption continues to be very strong. In North America, we were up or flat in 8 of our 12 categories. Our toothpaste business and toothbrush business continue to perform quite well with share growth. And we have done that with good innovation and pulling back a little bit on promotion. Now, where does it go moving forward, I think promotions will be sharply managed by the categories and by our competitors. And we will have to watch that very carefully. But clearly, I think you would expect to see a little bit more volume sold on promotion moving forward, returning to much more normalized levels given the fact that the trade and our competitors will be looking to drive a little bit more volume in the categories. But we are going to watch that very carefully. Again, I think it comes down to your ability to leverage your portfolio effectively. A lot of the work that we have done in revenue growth management really gets to the heart of that on how to balance entry price point, mid-price point and premium price points in order to drive value to the category and to our customers and ultimately giving the consumer a good proposition to take home.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNik Modi: Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Noel, I was just hoping you can reconcile the inventory destocking dynamic. I am just thinking about fill rates are recovering. At the same time, the categories in which you play are high frequency. So, is this just a broader retailer decision based on dollar-based inventory that they are holding across the store, or is purchase frequency, let\u2019s say, within oral care, people are squeezing a little extra out of their tube, and the purchase cycles are getting a little wider. Any perspective around that would be helpful.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Trips are down, but starting to turn a little bit. We are not seeing significant changes in, obviously, household penetration across our categories. Consumers may be losing a little bit less. We will have to watch that moving forward. The basic driver in volume has been just more deliberate shifts in some of our trade partners trying to manage their costs, particularly as they see discretionary items slow. They have had to look at, obviously, their full basket of inventory and take inventory down more, quite frankly, across the enterprise. We watch, as I mentioned upfront, very, very carefully with our trade partners. We watch out of stocks. Our case fills are all back up, obviously, looking good across the business with the exception of the early supply chain constraints we had on Hill\u2019s, as I mentioned. But we feel good about where we are from that standpoint, which gives us a lot more visibility and a lot more confidence as we deal with our trade partners to give them what they need. Again, predicting what they are going to do towards the end of the quarter becomes difficult. But I think as these things stabilize, inventories stay down at these levels, the trade will look to high velocity categories is their first priority to take back up because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive traffic in their stores.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. Just a few questions for me. One, could you just comment on what global volume growth would be in your categories? Second, just maybe remind us thoughts about pricing, particularly in pets, if there is any sort of deflation? And then just more broadly on pricing, how are you thinking about maintaining the pricing that you have taken? What would be the expectation for that retention? And has there been any sort of change from a retailer standpoint in terms of your discussions about taking or retaining? And maybe if you could talk a bit \u2013 I know some of the questions were talking about that domestically, but maybe if you could talk on a global basis, your perspective, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Yes. Global categories, we are tracking today around 3% to 4%, maybe a little shy of that in volumes, but value more or less 3% to 4%. And obviously, as pricing goes into the market, you see the ebbs and flows there. But overall, we expect volumes to recover. We do think purchase cycles, as I mentioned earlier, will get a little bit more elongated. Consumers will watch their consumption and their pantries quite carefully. We have seen \u2013 we watch the pantry inventories. We have seen a little bit of that come down, but that\u2019s to be expected. But overall, I mean we are looking at global category growth in the 3% to 4% range. And obviously, we are growing above that generally around the world. And so that obviously leads to better consumption on our categories or at least better shares. In terms of pricing in the categories, our ability to retain that, that depends largely, quite frankly, on our innovation and the value proposition we are bringing to consumers. And we have spent a lot of time. It\u2019s not just taking pricing. There is a lot of re-launches into that RGM strategy that we have been talking about to ensure that across all price points, we are adding value to the consumer, something new and different for them to continue to use our brands and see longevity in terms of the interest they have in our equities. And so we have been very careful to ensure that it\u2019s not just straight pricing that we are bringing value, whether it\u2019s through price pack architecture, through better innovation in terms of science-driven claims, etcetera, etcetera. Specifically on Hill\u2019s, I think it\u2019s very much about the innovation strategy that we have, the Derm Complete launch, significant innovation. The obesity diets that we have, significant innovation in the market. So, that drives real value with the consumer that we can communicate and justify the price increases that we have. So, we will continue to execute against that strategy, and we will watch the categories carefully as we balance volume and price moving forward.\nOperator: The last question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Well. Great. Thanks. I actually want to go back to Europe, and you spoke about this a bit, but I guess I was getting a question just like a little more perspective on your outlook on European profitability and whether or not you thought it is going to get worse before it gets better or whether or not you saw improvement on the horizon. And maybe as part of that, I guess I was also curious what you are seeing from some of your European-based competitors, which are obviously on the other side of the FX wall here and how that may be playing into pricing considerations and competitive considerations perhaps in Europe as a headwind to profitability or maybe it\u2019s \u2013 or maybe more globally?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Europe had a good quarter. Obviously, this has been an incredible undertaking to get that level of pricing in the P&L. You haven\u2019t seen that, quite frankly, in a long, long time. And I think it plays out \u2013 plays back to a lot of the work and the focus that we have had around revenue growth management. Europe is doing an extraordinary job. Steve, you know the trade there can be difficult, but we have seen a lot of good opportunities to take pricing in the categories. It\u2019s also, I think underscored the ability to bring real new news to the categories, and we are doing that across the board. We have strong brands in oral care in Europe. Obviously, Meridol and Elmex at the premium side of the business continue to grow in this environment despite the fact that we have led on pricing. So, we feel pretty good about where we are. I again mentioned that the home care business across the world is the challenge, and we are taking a very deeper look at exactly what we need to do to ensure we continue to drive more volume in those categories. We have got strong businesses in home care in Europe, and we need to be mindful of that. I will mention, I guess as a point private label. Private label, down across all our categories in North America. In market shares, you have seen it inch up, but you would expect a little bit more in Europe. So, we are going to have to watch that. This is a market that will be challenged in the next six months, given the inflationary pressures they are under that everyone is well aware of. And we are thinking very carefully about how to continue to execute successfully. The key is getting pricing in the P&L, which allows us \u2013 the leverage that we need to do the things that we need to do moving forward.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I will now return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Well, thanks everyone and good questions. I want to come back to just a couple of concluding remarks. As you have seen, I think our strategy continues to pay off. The broad-based growth is encouraging, all four categories, all six divisions, the innovation stream that we are putting in the market, that\u2019s a testament to a lot of the changes we have made in innovation over the last couple of years, that\u2019s driving premiumization and making sure we sustain our strong core businesses, particularly at the entry level. The digital transformation is having a profound impact on how we operate around the world, how we drive RGM, how we drive content. So, we think we have a well positioned portfolio moving forward. The most important and I am really proud of how our team has executed the strategy to deliver the continued organic sales growth. There has been a tremendous amount of headwinds against the business, but we have now delivered 15 straight quarters of either in line or above our 3% to 5% target. And this quarter was 7% organic, is a terrific quarter. And we are very proud of the work that the teams on the ground are doing. So, with that, I wish all of you a healthy and safe end of the year. And I look forward to speaking to you in January.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. We continue to execute our growth strategy as we deal with an operating environment that remains very volatile. In the third quarter, we delivered high single-digit organic sales growth with growth across every division. We also delivered growth in all four of our categories, including high single-digit growth in Oral Care, Pet Nutrition and Personal Care. I know elasticities are a big topic of conversation this quarter. While our volumes were negatively impacted by retailer inventory reductions and Hill's supply chain constraints in the quarter, underlying elasticity remained in line with our expectations and we would expect volume performance to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter as these headwinds abate. We delivered strong pricing growth through revenue growth management and healthy productivity through Funding the Growth and the initial benefits of our 2022 Global Productivity Initiative. This helped us drive a sequential improvement in gross margin in the third quarter despite further increases in raw material prices. The headwinds we face, whether from foreign exchange, raw and packaging materials and logistics costs or macroeconomic uncertainty are significant, but we believe we are well positioned to deal with these issues. We have taken the difficult steps necessary to meet these challenges head on through pricing, productivity, capital deployment and other actions. These actions leave us well positioned to benefit when our markets stabilize. The first reason is our portfolio. We have focused \u2013 we have a focused portfolio of leading brands in growing categories competing across multiple price tiers. Consumers use the vast majority of our products everyday: when they shower, when they clean their homes, when they feed their pets and hopefully, when they brush their teeth after every meal. We believe this high frequency of usage, combined with the strength of our brands, helped with our elasticities despite significant pricing. This has been particularly true in Oral Care and our categories generally have low private label market shares compared to many other HPC categories where we don't compete. Consumers look to trusted brands to provide value and we have built brands over time to deliver value to our customers and our consumers, particularly given our breadth of offerings across price tiers from entry level to ultra premium. And our professional recommendation model in several of our largest categories also helps to provide added value and differentiation to consumers, which builds brand loyalty. And we have high market shares with number one or number two positions in many of our key segments across all four of our categories. We are also well positioned because we are building capabilities and then scaling them across the company in order to drive growth both now and in the future. Our most important capabilities are focused on science-led innovation, particularly in a time when there is so much pricing in our categories, it is vital to add consumer identifiable value. You can see our progress here on brands like Colgate Optic White, Hill's Prescription Diet, EltaMD and many others. It is also helping to drive improvements in our market share trends. I spent a lot of time at Barclays talking about our digital transformation, an area that is impacting every facet of our business: our e-commerce performance, the ROI of our advertising, a digital-driven supply chain, the use of AI and new product development and even how we are doing our training around the world. Revenue growth management is another capability we are scaling across the organization. We are putting the full force and effort of our data and analytics team into our RGM planning. We believe this is also helping us to make RGM's decisions to help to lessen the impact of elasticities. So as we head into the Q&A, I want to reiterate that our strategy is working and through an environment that remains uncertain and volatile, we believe we are well positioned with strong brands, scaling capabilities and most importantly, great people. So I will turn it over to the Q&A now. Yes. Thanks Peter. Let me go back to the strategy. And I think as it underpins some of the \u2013 obviously, the supply chain constraints that we had earlier in the quarter, which is obviously based on really high demand for the brand. And we have had nine quarters of double-digit growth on that business with fundamentally the same supply chain network. So if you go back to the core elements of the strategy, really building science-driven innovation that we translate into claims for the consumer, claims for our vets and vet technicians that drives to endorsement of our brand. We translate that digitally across the enterprise run our e-commerce business ahead of general market shares. Ultimately, that is driving strong consumption. What happened in the early part of the quarter is the supply chain is obviously at 100% capacity, pre, obviously, the acquisitions of Red Collar and the acquisition that we made in Europe. We now have the ability to really free up capacity moving forward. We are going to be able to do a lot more efficient production in our existing facilities. We are transferring a lot of that volume into the new Red Collar facilities, which are coming upstream as of October. So we feel very good moving forward. And as you mentioned, we exited the quarter back in double-digit growth. So strong consumption in the business, shipments outpacing \u2013 excuse me, consumption, obviously, outpacing shipments and we feel very good about where we are in the next 3 to 6 months as we integrate the Red Collar acquisition and continue to operate our plants more efficiently in the existing network. Yes, good morning Eric. Thanks. Let's go back to, again, what we have been discussing all year. We took pricing obviously as we articulated in the second quarter, particularly across North America and other divisions. That pricing continued obviously in the third quarter. We have led pricing in many of our markets and that has been fundamental to the growth of the business right now. We believe it's critical to get the pricing into the P&L. We have now seen competitors begin to follow. So that should alleviate some of the volume pressure that we saw early in the quarter, but we feel very good about where we are with pricing. We obviously feel that the market will continue to hold that pricing as we see a very constructive market, as I have discussed in the past, with competition. Now competition was a little slow to follow, but we have seen that in the later end of the quarter that most of our competitors have followed in our core categories. So we feel pretty good. We talked about elasticities upfront. They are more or less in line with where we articulated at Barclays. We have seen a little bit more elasticity given the pricing that we took in some of the Home Care businesses. But again, we took Home Care pricing ahead of competition and competition is now following. So, we expect that to alleviate as we move forward. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are. Obviously, foreign exchange is the new dynamic we are dealing with and having lots of discussions with the team on how to manage price volume moving forward, but we feel very good about where we are right now. Yes. Thanks, Andrea. Volumes improved as we exited the quarter as we talked about, obviously some of the supply chain constraints upfront on Hill's. We talked about post Barclays, as you remember we saw some early warning signs in the online business on our trade partners taking inventory down. We had not seen it in brick and mortar at that stage, but we had communicated that, that's not to say that might happen towards the end of the quarter, which is exactly what happened. We saw some inventory come out in some of the key retailers in North America. We obviously saw continued reductions in inventory on Amazon throughout the quarter and that ultimately led to roughly 100 basis points of headwinds on the quarter. Take that with additional 50 basis points of Russia impact in the quarter and obviously some of the supply chain constraints. So, we feel good about volume sequentially improving in the fourth quarter. Obviously, consumption seems to be holding out, but we have to bear in mind that there is a lot of pricing going in the market across multiple categories. So we will continue to watch that very carefully. We have also obviously had to pull a little bit of the advertising back in the quarter as we saw consumption across most categories slowdown in Europe and obviously the constraints on Hill's. Hill's, we moved that money to the fourth quarter to continue to drive consumption and exit the year strongly. We do not want to be cutting investment. We believe this hopefully, some of these volatility is short term. Our focus is continue to invest behind the brands and drive consumption as we move into 2023. Sure. Let me just \u2013 I will take it conceptually and strategically the top and then let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more color. Overall, strategically, as we talked about coming into the second quarter, we felt it was very important to get ahead of the inflationary environment and take as much pricing as we could. We watch that very carefully obviously with consumption. You combine that with the initiatives that we set out for 2022 with our Global Productivity Index. We felt it was very important to get ahead of this, which we announced back in 2021. And we are seeing that coming through on the gross profit line, obviously, gross profit up sequentially in the quarter despite 920 points of headwind in the gross margin reconciliation. So we feel that was important to get that in and we will continue to take pricing as necessary. Raw materials, I will turn it over to Stan to give you a flavor of where those are right now. We have seen a little bit of pullback, but more or less, we are still seeing significant increases versus where we were last year. Stan? Yes. Let me take the categories first, and then I'll let Stan provide a little bit more color on the raw materials and where we see the fourth quarter. Categories, by and large, are where we estimated. Obviously, we've seen a little pullback in the Home Care categories, but Personal Care, Oral Care and Pet Nutrition continue to be quite healthy, particularly given the pricing that's going into the category. Relative to year-on-year, I mean, all of our categories in terms of how we play them are up. There may be some impact from foreign exchange there, Jason. But other than that, we see good growth across a broad nature of our categories. Yes. The one area I'd add is ag prices and some of the specialty ingredients that we use in Science Diet and Prescription Diet, those continue to be quite high. So we're watching those quite carefully as we move into \u201823. Yes. Thanks for the question. In a world of significant volatility, we are really pleased with the diversity of the categories we compete in. They are carefully curated categories. We're highly focused on four. As you all know, we've been focused on four for a long, long time. We have deep understanding in those four categories. We believe they are well constructed and well positioned for future growth whether you're looking at consumption opportunities, whether you're looking at price-driven opportunities in terms of premiumization. And obviously, they are all not going to run in tandem. And we've obviously done some great things in the Pet Nutrition categories. We've pivoted a lot of that strategy over the last 4 years, and you've seen the success of that. You've seen the success in this year as we're driving broad-based growth across all of our categories, which I talked about initially. Very happy with skin health. Obviously, the professional skin business in the U.S. continues to perform very well. Yes, the Filorga business in China continues to be a challenge, given the lockdowns we've seen in China and the lack of travel of Chinese consumers around the world. But overall, we feel the ebb and flow of our categories is exactly where we want to be right now. And we feel very fortunate that we're very focused on four, and all those categories are growing today. So let me start with the expenses piece. So on raw materials, obviously, we operate in over 200 countries and territories. So as you think about the currency impact on our overall portfolio, that also impacts our raw materials. So I wouldn't say it's outsized in any particular one. Some materials are sourced from one or two suppliers, so they'll have an outsized impact while others are sourced locally. And those have a natural hedge, if you will, from a currency aspect. So FX, as you think about the impact to raw materials, you should think about that largely in line with the impact of the overall company, and that will vary slightly by division. Yes. What I'm going to do is step back again and talk about the strategy of the company and why it's working. And I think the results today illustrate that our growth strategies across all of our businesses and how we integrate those businesses and scale our capabilities are delivering strong performance for the overall business, 15 quarters now of organic sales growth within our 3% to 5% target range. We've had growth in every division in all four of our categories. And we're particularly pleased, obviously, this quarter with high single-digit growth in Oral Care, our Personal Care business as well as our Pet Nutrition business. A key part of that strategy, which I think gets to the heart of your question, is how we're leveraging our capabilities across the enterprise. We've talked about our science-driven approach, clinical substantiation for our products that drive claims, consumer acceptance, drive \u2013 lead to professional endorsement. As you know, we have a strong professional model across our pet business, our Oral Care business as well as our skin health business. We're leveraging those learnings. In fact, over the last 1.5 years, we put an organization in New York simply to look at how we continue to optimize and sharpen our professional strategies as we see brand recommended most often is a key driver of saliency for the brands and the equities and ultimately loyalty. Our digital transformation largely initially led by Hill's. We have now taken their capabilities, their talent and use those across the entire enterprise to further our digital capabilities. You've seen our e-commerce business is one of the fastest-growing channel businesses that we have today. Our market shares in markets like China, which is the biggest e-commerce market, are outdelivering against any other competitor in the market. And we really attribute that to leveraging the scalability of certain capabilities across the enterprise. So again, we like the four categories we compete in, a lot of similarities, a lot of overlap. And we continue to see that executed in terms of the results that we've delivered today. Yes. Thanks, Lauren. Let me talk to Latin America. In fact, I just got back from trips to Brazil and Mexico. So the information is very fresh. You saw the 20% pricing that we took in Latin America, obviously, following significant pricing in the second quarter, about 12.5. And as I mentioned upfront, we have led in pricing across all of our categories in Latin America. And as a result of leading, it took time for the others to catch up. And obviously, you got elasticity when the others haven't catch up is going to be a little bit higher. As we exited the quarter, we started to see volumes improve, particularly across Personal Care and Oral Care. Home Care, a little slow to recover, but we will see \u2013 I think we will see that stabilize as we move forward. But overall, the plans I saw in place in both Brazil and Mexico were really, really strong. Shares, very good in Brazil, a little soft in Mexico, particularly in Oral Care, given the fact that we took aggressive pricing competition follow initially. As I was leaving those markets, competition followed. So we feel pretty good as we move into the fourth quarter and into 2023. And the innovation plans that we have in place and the premiumization plans we have in place in Latin America look really, really strong. In fact, in both Mexico and Brazil, we have seen our share of the premium segment grow sequentially over the last five quarters, six quarters. So we feel good about where we are there. We're also, as we've talked about in the past, the importance of our core businesses, relaunching some of our core businesses to ensure that if we do see trade down and we continue to provide value at the opening price point, we're there for that consumer, so overall, feeling good about Latin America as we move into the fourth quarter and in 2023. Relative to inflation moving forward, listen, I think everyone is going to deal with that how they see fit. We will continue to take pricing. I think the key aspect for us is continuing to invest behind brand building. And that brand building ultimately allows us to take more pricing in the markets around the world and continue to drive value to our consumers. Now we will see where the competition goes. If inflation becomes more benign, which I think most people expect it to be, we will watch that carefully. But the pricing environment has been to now very constructive. And we anticipate that as we can bring stronger innovation into the market, continue to invest behind our brands, we will minimize the elasticity. Is there more opportunity in grocery? Absolutely. We will see that as it comes to fruition. But right now, we feel good about where we have taken pricing and particularly the plans we have in place to minimize elasticity. Yes. You are right. I mean Europe is certainly under the most pressure, particularly around energy pricing. We have taken significant pricing in Europe as others have. It's \u2013 as you go back and look at that in history, it's the most pricing that's gone into the business in quite some time. Importantly, we have a good mix of price points covered in Europe. The strength of our Elmex and our Meridol brands, obviously, at the premium side, and Colgate, obviously more in the mainstream, you have seen the combination of those two businesses grow share in the quarter and in the year. So, we feel good about where we are. As I mentioned earlier, I think consistently across the world, a little bit more elasticity in the home care businesses. But we have got some pretty significant re-launches coming in early 2023 on our home care businesses. So, we feel good about the plans in place we have in order to continue to drive consumption there. So, overall, it's going to be a tough winter. We are going to watch that very closely. We feel we have got a good mix of brands at different price points to deal with the significant inflation that consumer is going to have to deal with. But obviously, a tough six months ahead of the Europeans. Yes. Good morning Rob. Thanks. On the inventory adjustments, obviously, we saw quite a bit come out towards the end of the quarter. Is it done, we can't make that prediction. We follow these inventories, as I mentioned, I think on the second quarter call or up at Barclays to the day. I mean particularly with our big customers, we work very much in collaboration with them on the guidance and goals that they have. Invariably, what happens is they may take democratic decisions across all the categories if they are reducing inventories, and we deal with that unexpectedly towards the end of the quarter. We obviously are staying very close to case builds and on-shelf availability and communicating that back as necessary. The last thing they want to do is obviously run out of stocks, particularly with our portfolio, which are significant traffic drivers across the categories in which we compete. So, is it done, it's hard to say. It is below where they historically have managed their inventories. That usually means that they will bring them back to those levels or something closer, but we will have to watch that very carefully. It's very difficult for me to predict. A great quarter for China, we have talked about China over the last 2 years in terms of the transformation of our strategy on the ground, which was significant from our entire go-to-market to some of our marketing and innovation plans. We have seen our e-commerce continue to be one of the fastest-growing e-commerce brands in the market. We have seen our brick-and-mortar business stabilize over the last couple of quarters, which is terrific. You saw the growth that we delivered the last two quarters for greater were greater \u2013 our Greater China region, we delivered positive pricing and positive volume across our enterprise. We had the Hawley & Hazel, the Darlie re-launch has gone into effect. This is a significant, significant re-launch for the brand, changing the brand name. That's been quite successful. Our Colgate business continues to track well. So, overall, we feel good. Now no question, the lockdowns are having an impact. The lockdowns have had a significant impact on our Filorga business. They have had a significant impact on some of our premium brands as we have seen those typically translate into slower online sales. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are. We will see where the lockdowns go. That will open up the market. And as that comes back to a more stable predictability, we feel good about where we are and what we built in terms of capabilities on the ground during a very difficult 18 months. Yes. Jonathan, thanks for the question. Clearly, I think as the consumer becomes more strapped relative to inflation, they will be more astute in looking at promotions. I can characterize at least where promotional volumes are, particularly for North America. And it would be somewhat a generalized consensus for the rest of the world. Our promotional volumes are slightly down year-to-date. That was deliberately \u2013 deliberate. We have pulled back on some aggressive couponing that can drive volume, but doesn't do much for your P&L. We have seen some of our competitors follow that strategy, not all of them. I would say our two key competitors have taken their promotions up a little bit in the U.S. But you saw the U.S. numbers, at least our consumption continues to be very strong. In North America, we were up or flat in 8 of our 12 categories. Our toothpaste business and toothbrush business continue to perform quite well with share growth. And we have done that with good innovation and pulling back a little bit on promotion. Now, where does it go moving forward, I think promotions will be sharply managed by the categories and by our competitors. And we will have to watch that very carefully. But clearly, I think you would expect to see a little bit more volume sold on promotion moving forward, returning to much more normalized levels given the fact that the trade and our competitors will be looking to drive a little bit more volume in the categories. But we are going to watch that very carefully. Again, I think it comes down to your ability to leverage your portfolio effectively. A lot of the work that we have done in revenue growth management really gets to the heart of that on how to balance entry price point, mid-price point and premium price points in order to drive value to the category and to our customers and ultimately giving the consumer a good proposition to take home. Sure. Trips are down, but starting to turn a little bit. We are not seeing significant changes in, obviously, household penetration across our categories. Consumers may be losing a little bit less. We will have to watch that moving forward. The basic driver in volume has been just more deliberate shifts in some of our trade partners trying to manage their costs, particularly as they see discretionary items slow. They have had to look at, obviously, their full basket of inventory and take inventory down more, quite frankly, across the enterprise. We watch, as I mentioned upfront, very, very carefully with our trade partners. We watch out of stocks. Our case fills are all back up, obviously, looking good across the business with the exception of the early supply chain constraints we had on Hill's, as I mentioned. But we feel good about where we are from that standpoint, which gives us a lot more visibility and a lot more confidence as we deal with our trade partners to give them what they need. Again, predicting what they are going to do towards the end of the quarter becomes difficult. But I think as these things stabilize, inventories stay down at these levels, the trade will look to high velocity categories is their first priority to take back up because that's what's going to drive traffic in their stores. Sure. Yes. Global categories, we are tracking today around 3% to 4%, maybe a little shy of that in volumes, but value more or less 3% to 4%. And obviously, as pricing goes into the market, you see the ebbs and flows there. But overall, we expect volumes to recover. We do think purchase cycles, as I mentioned earlier, will get a little bit more elongated. Consumers will watch their consumption and their pantries quite carefully. We have seen \u2013 we watch the pantry inventories. We have seen a little bit of that come down, but that's to be expected. But overall, I mean we are looking at global category growth in the 3% to 4% range. And obviously, we are growing above that generally around the world. And so that obviously leads to better consumption on our categories or at least better shares. In terms of pricing in the categories, our ability to retain that, that depends largely, quite frankly, on our innovation and the value proposition we are bringing to consumers. And we have spent a lot of time. It's not just taking pricing. There is a lot of re-launches into that RGM strategy that we have been talking about to ensure that across all price points, we are adding value to the consumer, something new and different for them to continue to use our brands and see longevity in terms of the interest they have in our equities. And so we have been very careful to ensure that it's not just straight pricing that we are bringing value, whether it's through price pack architecture, through better innovation in terms of science-driven claims, etcetera, etcetera. Specifically on Hill's, I think it's very much about the innovation strategy that we have, the Derm Complete launch, significant innovation. The obesity diets that we have, significant innovation in the market. So, that drives real value with the consumer that we can communicate and justify the price increases that we have. So, we will continue to execute against that strategy, and we will watch the categories carefully as we balance volume and price moving forward. Yes. Europe had a good quarter. Obviously, this has been an incredible undertaking to get that level of pricing in the P&L. You haven't seen that, quite frankly, in a long, long time. And I think it plays out \u2013 plays back to a lot of the work and the focus that we have had around revenue growth management. Europe is doing an extraordinary job. Steve, you know the trade there can be difficult, but we have seen a lot of good opportunities to take pricing in the categories. It's also, I think underscored the ability to bring real new news to the categories, and we are doing that across the board. We have strong brands in oral care in Europe. Obviously, Meridol and Elmex at the premium side of the business continue to grow in this environment despite the fact that we have led on pricing. So, we feel pretty good about where we are. I again mentioned that the home care business across the world is the challenge, and we are taking a very deeper look at exactly what we need to do to ensure we continue to drive more volume in those categories. We have got strong businesses in home care in Europe, and we need to be mindful of that. I will mention, I guess as a point private label. Private label, down across all our categories in North America. In market shares, you have seen it inch up, but you would expect a little bit more in Europe. So, we are going to have to watch that. This is a market that will be challenged in the next six months, given the inflationary pressures they are under that everyone is well aware of. And we are thinking very carefully about how to continue to execute successfully. The key is getting pricing in the P&L, which allows us \u2013 the leverage that we need to do the things that we need to do moving forward."

            "content": "Yes. So we have seen some modest movement in materials cost. But overall, we continue to see raw materials as a full year 2022 as $1.3 billion full year increase. As a reminder, that's 23% year-to-year. In the third quarter, as Noel highlighted, it was 920 points, so a little bit of color underneath that. Oil has generally been lower since our last call, but now has kind of creep back to where it was then. We have seen ag as an offset here. It increased versus our previous guidance, particularly around proteins, corn, etcetera and those are notably higher versus where we were in July. Partially offsetting that, we have seen palm oil has actually come in a decent amount. Now, that's favorable, but tallow, soybean and other oils are still showing elevated levels of inflation. So, that's what keeps us at the $1.3 billion for the year. As a reminder, we lock in, so typically and this quarter is no exception, we are largely locked in for fourth quarter. Now one of the common \u2013 while natural gas is not a raw material per se, we do use it to power our plants, particularly in Europe. And that's been volatile and continues to escalate. So as we expected, raw materials continue to move, but overall, still see $1.3 billion. And this is why we have our GPI program, our Funding the Growth program as we look to take productivity to mitigate that 920 point headwind. Yes. Thanks for the question, Bryan. So as we look, we've seen the volatility. While we've had movement up and down, the $1.3 billion is exactly the same number we highlighted out of last quarter. So while we've seen components move up and down, we've only seen modest movement on a net basis. We typically lock in the next quarter, and then we do, do some longer-term pricing into that, mock that in out quarters. But it's relatively modest. As you'd expect, the near quarter gets the most, and then it kind of scales down. But today, we're not going to give 2023 guidance. What we are looking at is the movement that we see. We're trying to make sure we're very prudent on not locking in areas that we think are going to moderate over time. And then we don't do a lot of hedging. So we do some in the ag space, but we don't do a lot of hedging among the others. We think price is the ultimate hedge. And on the raw materials, Jason, we said in our last call that we thought this is going to peak in Q3. We continue to believe that. So while the full year still holds at $1.3 billion, we do expect some slight moderation in Q4. And again, we're largely locked in for that. On advertising, Olivia, you heard us say that on a dollar basis, we were down about 3%, but on a local currency basis, we were up 2%. So overall, we still feel good with the impact we're having in the markets. We've done a lot of work, as others have done, to really optimize our spending with obviously a move of 50-plus of our spending now, 50% plus of our spend in digital. We're able to get much more deep into the analytics and the ROI metrics. We're doing a much better job at personalizing our content. As I've talked about before, over 40,000 people around the world on our digital transformation, media being an important part of that. So we feel we're getting much better. We pulled back a little in Europe as we saw a pretty significant drop off in the categories. And so we wanted to be prudent as we thought about investment moving forward. And as I mentioned earlier, we pulled back a little bit in the third quarter at Hill's, but transferred that money into the fourth quarter to continue to drive consumption as we bring on more capacity. One thing I'd add there, I think, is that integration extends to our supply chain. One of our key attributes here is the production that we do across the world. And we integrate that particularly across Personal Care, Home Care and Oral Care, and that gives us a lot of leverage."

        "content": "Operator: Good day. And welcome to today\u2019s Colgate-Palmolive Company\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and it\u2019s being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&Q, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John. Thank you.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Caroline. Good morning. And welcome to our 2022 second quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and earnings materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures including those identified in Tables 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will now provide you with his thoughts on our Q2 results and our 2022 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I am delighted to share with you our second quarter results. On the first quarter call, I talked about my confidence that our organic sales growth would accelerate from our first quarter results. Some of this was due to the improvement in trends in February, March and April that we discussed on the call. But what really gives me confidence is the fundamental changes Colgate people have made to drive growth, which is why we are raising our organic sales growth guidance to 5% to 7% for 2022. Our second quarter results including double-digit organic sales growth in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition, show that the growth strategies we put in place three years ago are delivering on our objectives and how the power of our global portfolio is working. We are delivering growth across all of our divisions and all of our categories. We are showing the ability to take pricing because we have built healthier brands. We have built up our innovation capabilities so we can deliver more breakthrough and transformational innovation that can drive both category growth and market share. We have accelerated our digital transformation across the company by leveraging the capabilities we have built at Hill\u2019s and in China, and other developed markets to lead ecommerce in our markets where this important growth channel is underdeveloped. And crucially in this operating environment, our revenue growth management tools are driving positive pricing and mixes our efforts to offset the significant raw material and logistics inflation we are seeing, although, the -- along with the productivity and our ability to improve our price mix, which has enabled us to rebuild our gross margin moving forward. And looking at the quarter, the second quarter marked our 14th consecutive quarter with organic sales growth either in or above our long-term target range of 3% to 5% and that growth is broad based. We delivered organic sales growth in all six of our divisions. We delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories, Oral Care, Pet Nutrition, Personal Care and Home Care, with all four categories either in line with or above our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. As we discussed on the first quarter call, our execution on revenue growth management and premiumization allowed us to deliver a 500 basis points sequential acceleration in pricing growth. Encouragingly, despite this pricing, our volume performance also improved sequentially in the quarter on both a one year and a two-year basis, behind strong marketing plans, innovation and improved supply chain performance. Our market share performance continues to improve with our global toothpaste and manual toothbrushes are now up on a year-to-date basis. We continue to deliver on productivity with another strong quarter of funding to growth, which is vital to our plans to regain lost gross margin. As we enter the back half, we are just beginning to see early benefits from my 2022 global productivity initiative. Over the next 18 months, this program will help drive operating leverage. But we are still dealing with a very difficult cost environment. We now expect $1.3 billion in raw material and packaging inflation, with higher logistics costs as well. Foreign Exchange has become a bigger headwind since our first quarter earnings release. The euro has moved to parity with the dollar and most other currencies have weakened as well. But we will continue to invest in our brands, advertising spending was up on $1 basis, with continued shift to working from non-working and higher focus on digital spending. We are investing our capital to drive future growth as well. We are building capacity to meet strong consumer demand, particularly for Hill\u2019s, but also for other projects like our recyclable tube, which we continue to roll out across the globe. As we look to the balance of 2022 and into next year, we are focused on executing our strategies with the right innovation, brand support revenue growth management and capital plans to deliver on our long-term growth targets, while working to rebuild our gross margins and deliver sustainable profitable growth in all four of our categories. And with that, I am happy to take your questions. Caroline, can we move to the Q&A. Caroline?\nJohn Faucher: Okay. If everyone can just hold on, we are working. It seems like there\u2019s a problem on their end on the call.\nNoel Wallace: Are we in? Yeah.\nJohn Faucher: You are muted. Yeah. We are working on it. Everyone can just hold tight. There\u2019s a problem on the conference call and so, hopefully, we will be back up shortly. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Apologies, that question will actually come from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nNoel Wallace: Hey, Peter.\nPeter Grom: I hope you are doing well. Yeah. So, Noel, I was just wondering if we could take a step back and can you maybe just give us an update on kind of the health of the consumer in some of your key markets, particularly emerging markets and maybe specifically Latin America? Are you beginning to see any signs of softening demand or trade down in your core categories? And I guess, how do you think emerging market growth evolves from here as we look out to the back half of the year and potentially into 2023? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question. If you scan at least the numbers we are looking around the world, you continue to see great pretty good vitality at the consumer level, emerging markets growing mid-single digits, obviously some slowdown in the developed world, particularly out of Europe where you saw some sluggishness in the categories. But specifically to your question on emerging, it looks pretty good now. A lot of pricing as you can imagine going through, but if we come back to our overarching strategy and as we really laid out in the first quarter that we would be continuing to take pricing coupled with strong revenue growth management, but more importantly, accelerating our innovation cycle into those markets. Strong innovation on the premium and the value orientation side has allowed us obviously to continue to deliver strong topline growth, both in price and in volume. We will watch the consumer really closely, Peter. We obviously have a lot of teams on the ground, looking at exactly where the elasticities are. But so far, elasticities are in line with what we expected or slightly better. But that will change over time as you see more and more pricing going into the market and other economic factors impact categories. But, overall, so far we have seen the categories behave as we expected. Not a lot of trade down, but its early days. We will see how that evolves over time.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So, you just mentioned the elasticity looks pretty good so far. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, given the strong pricing you are able to realize in the quarter? Are you seeing competitors move at similar levels? And then specifically, maybe talk a little bit about the Americas in terms of the sustainability of this growth turnaround we have seen in the U.S.? And if you could just touch on the consumer in Latin America, that would be helpful also? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. In terms of, just an overarching statement on competition, clearly, it\u2019s been constructive relative to how we have seen competitors behave and I don\u2019t pretend to understand their strategies or quite frankly react to them. We are very focused on executing our strategies in the marketplace and as we laid out again in early on the first quarter call that we would be taking a leading pricing in some of the markets, and ultimately, we expected given the inflation is impacting everyone, we would see competition follow as well and that\u2019s been the case by and large around the world. So, overall, a constructive environment relative to pricing. In terms of the Americas, obviously, you have seen strong turnaround in our North America business. Again, we highlighted that we were taking pricing and saw momentum build in the first quarter, and that continued as we mentioned in the first quarter call through April, and obviously, you see now with the performance of the North America business, a good performance overall. I would call out that, obviously, they saw strong consumption across the categories. The innovation is certainly taking hold, excited to see the takeaway on Pro Series, which is at the premium end of the toothpaste. You have seen the market share and scanner performance, with scanner data in the U.S. up in 11, eight -- eight of 11 categories over the last 13 weeks, which again, I think, shows the turnaround of that business, and importantly, the performance of some of our innovation coming in broad-based across all the categories in which we compete. So, overall, good. We are watching this closely. It\u2019s an unpredictable environment relative to where we see consumers evolving, where we see inflation evolving. But the good news is, we have taken pricing, we have more pricing planned across the world moving into the back half and we will watch the consumer impact of that very carefully.\nDara Mohsenian: Okay.\nOperator: And Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities has our next question.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning. So pretty good progress on North American margins sequentially as pricing has built, you noted in the prepared remarks that, your supply chain headwinds are starting to abate and with pretty good traction with the consumer on this pricing, I just wonder if you have any updated thoughts on where we stand today on just the potential to rebuild margins in that segment even amidst the inflation, which is going to be a little bit higher than your prior expectations?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. You have known our company for many years, how focused we are on gross profit and we will continue to be laser focused on recovering gross profit as we move through the balance of this year and into 2023. The pricing and innovation strategies and revenue growth management discipline that we have across the organization is clearly focused and tailored towards getting our teams equipped to find innovative ways to drive category growth, get value into the categories through pricing and other innovation initiatives and that will clearly be the roadmap moving forward. And we feel quite confident given the health of our brands, the investment that we have been putting behind our brands, that we will have the ability to continue to take pricing in the marketplace. We will watch it very closely as I mentioned. But recognizing we have a very broad portfolio of products. We compete at the high end and at the low end of the market, and historically, we have been able to flex our portfolio quite well in markets where we have had difficult economic circumstances. So we will continue to innovate across all price points and be sure that we are capturing any trade down if that happens, which we have not seen at this stage. But, ultimately, I would expect you will see some trade down moving forward and we will continue to innovate the top end to drive the premiumization opportunity that we see.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Good morning and thank you for the new call format and prepared remarks. So my question is on pricing and a follow-up on volumes in Europe and Asia-Pac. On pricing, you had an impressive 8.5 global uptick in the quarter globally and about 3% in North America. So I believe there is additional pricing or as you mentioned coming through potentially oral care, I believe in the U.S. in July. Can you confirm the timing and the magnitude? And in Europe, in terms of volumes, you lost -- perhaps you lost temporary distribution, because you had a 3% decline in volume there. I mean, not sure if it\u2019s related to the war. And if you can round up the Asia-Pac exit rate also, Noel Wallace, because you exit and you had a minus 17, just to make sure that we recover all basis. I mean not to take the -- and obviously the 9% organic growth, but I just want to make sure that we know the puts and takes there? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks. A lot packed in that one. So let me talk a little bit about the overarching thoughts around organic growth in the topline. Obviously, strong pricing is 8.5. But I call out the positive volume growth where we saw across North America, Asia and Hill\u2019s, and if you take obviously the impact of Russia, that volume moved up nearly 100 basis points. So, overall, we are very pleased with the broadness of the pricing that we took across all divisions and the positive volume growth that we saw across some of the markets that I just mentioned. When you look at, specifically calling out some of the other markets, Europe obviously was impacted by a couple of things, the negotiations on pricing certainly impacted categories. We tend to see some elasticity in Europe happen early on as the market adjusted to the new pricing, but ultimately, that tends to become -- that is mitigated over time as you see everyone take pricing. Asia, you asked about, obviously strong growth in Asia, both in pricing and in volume. We had an easier comp on Hawley & Hazel, but I would call out the CP China business, which grew significantly in the quarter as well on a more difficult comp. So overall really pleased with China, despite the lockdowns that we saw in the marketplace there. So we were able to overcome that and deliver strong consumption growth across most of our business. So, overall, we are pleased with the balance of pricing and volume. We are pleased with how we are getting pricing executed, and more importantly, we are pleased with the innovation that\u2019s going into the market across multiple price points in order to sustain that moving forward. Moving forward, I would say that, we will continue to be pushing pricing and my expectation is we will see some pressure on volume in the year to go, but that\u2019s to be expected as we get more pricing in the market. The important part is the balance of innovation across all price points to mitigate that.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey guys. Good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Can you talk maybe or compare and contrast what your market shares look like from a volume perspective versus revenue perspective. Obviously, elasticities are better than planned, but curious on how it looks like versus the market. And then on your assumptions for commodity costs, are they linked to just assuming spot stays where it is or do you have some assumptions in there for things, particularly like palm oil and such? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, very -- we are very pleased with the share performance. Now recognize that a lot of the share performance that we public -- that we make public don\u2019t pickup ecommerce shares and some of the untracked channels. But that being said, our global shares continue to track well on both toothpaste and toothbrushes. Obviously, we are taking pricing. So we are seeing value shares respond to that. Volume shares have been a little bit softer. But if you look back historically, where you have seen very acute pricing enter the marketplace, over time, you see volume come down. But over time, as I mentioned, it\u2019s our responsibility to bring innovation across price points, our responsibility to work with the trade to drive volume back in the categories. We have big traffic builders. Our brands are strong around the world and we know our retailers rely on us to bring traffic into their stores and drive volume and basket. So we will continue to focus on finding innovation to ensure that the volume aspect of the category is protected. But I do expect, as we get more pricing in the market, volumes will be a little bit soft year to go, but we will manage that very, very closely. On commodity specifically, again, coming back to the first quarter, we talked about $1.2 billion of raw material inflation. We have adjusted that up to $1.3 billion this quarter. There is most of that will come in the second quarter, but we will get a lot of that coming back through the back half of the year. We have new spot rates as you mentioned and we have seen, obviously, some commodities come down, but we are pretty much locked in for the third quarter. Any benefit to any deflation that we see will get a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, possibly more of that coming in 2023. But we will look to, obviously continue to take pricing given the unprecedented environment that we are seeing both on raw materials and logistics, and make sure that we have the marketing plans to execute that effectively.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on quarter as always.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Kevin.\nKevin Grundy: Hey. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Noel, just to kind of pull together some of the pieces of what you have touched on with respect and as it pertains to the guidance, so you hedged it up your 5% from 4% to 6%. And, I am just looking to get at some of the macro and category-specific assumptions underlying that, understanding it\u2019s going to differ little bit by category, but it does imply the midpoint of deceleration in the back half of the year, again to each of year-over-year comparisons. And maybe just touch on that a little bit and maybe just some conservatism around elasticities that you have seen and should elasticities hold its upside, but maybe just comment on pulling together some of the commentary so forth and so far on the call relative to the guidance in the back half? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. So, obviously, we have taken our guidance up based on the consumption we are seeing in the market based on the fact that we have been able to get strong pricing and early on, obviously, see some good volume moving through the P&L. FX continues to be the biggest incremental issue that we see based on where we were in the first quarter. But, overall, we see the categories behaving as we expected. Now given the incredible unpredictability of what\u2019s happening in the global world right now, we are watching those category performance very, very carefully. Our estimations are based on the fact the elasticity will be consistent with what we expected it to be or slightly better and we will adjust accordingly as we move down the road, but it\u2019s very difficult to predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen at this stage. So we based our macros on what we can see today and what we can control. So let\u2019s come back to what we can control. We control the execution of our strategy and we are executing against all the things that we have talked about, driving the core, looking at adjacencies, new channels and some of the faster growth channels particularly ecommerce, and you see that delivering in the results that we have had over the last 14 quarters. So we are pleased with the strategies taking hold. I think the competencies we are building around digital across the entire enterprise, the competencies that we are building on innovation are all starting to track well in terms of how we evaluate them and we are seeing that play out in the performance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Good morning, everyone.\nNoel Wallace: Hey, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: I wanted to ask a question about just -- more broadly about just the rebuilding of gross margins and so like forgetting about the constructs of fiscal years and timeframes. Just is it -- can you rebuild gross margins if inflation were to or your cost of goods basket today were to stay at its current level so the inflation doesn\u2019t proceed? Would it be possible to rebuild gross margins with cost at this level or does it somewhat depend upon some sort of disinflation, if you will, in the cost basket?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. It depends on a couple of things, Bryan. First and foremost, we believe that over the longer term our focus is on rebuilding gross margins and we feel quite confident that we can do that, particularly in the current environment, given the strength of our brand, the investment we are putting behind the brands and the innovation grid that we have out in front of us. A couple of things that need to happen, obviously, the pricing in the market needs to hold, as you see inflation come down, it\u2019s a real question of where competitors will go with pricing. We think it\u2019s been quite rational to this stage. We think that given the unprecedented levels that you will see constructive moves around pricing and promotion moving forward. But we are prepared for that. It\u2019s really the flex of our portfolio across different price points that we need to manage very, very carefully. So in my view, if inflation holds, the big determinant will be, will pricing hold, and my sense is, given where we see the marketplace today, that will be the case. So the answer is longer term, yes, we absolutely believe that we can rebuild gross margins.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on terrific results. Also kind of stepping back, Noel, over the last two years or three years, and what appears to us to be a very disciplined and systematic manner, you have kind of addressed various issues, whether it\u2019s channel in the drug stores and in digital, whether it\u2019s premiumization, whether it\u2019s competition against local brands and really you have done a fantastic job executing and improving the momentum of the business on a commercial basis. Apart from the macro factors that are going on today and not to diminish those, but in terms of the general commercial strategy, where is the focus now in terms of improving your actual business momentum and what are you doing to address that? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Rob, and good morning. So if you come back again, I think, to the heart of our strategy, which is big core businesses that need to be innovated against and you see that coming through. We have got a pretty significant innovation on our anti-cavity business going, coming out in some of the developing part of the world. The premiumization aspect that we have talked about for quite some time, Rob. We continue to obviously unfold that across different parts of our category, whether it would be on our Hill\u2019s business or whether it be on our Oral Care business, most recently with the Pro Series launch, which is a great innovation with our highest level of hydrogen peroxide in the marketplace. And obviously, looking into the adjacencies and new channels, if we talk about new channels specifically to your point, we still see a lot of runway there. Most of our markets, our online share is now above our general market share, which is terrific. I call out China specifically where we are up as you saw in the prepared remarks, 600 basis points on our ecommerce share and that\u2019s the largest ecommerce business we have in Oral Care across the world and that\u2019s been driven through good premium innovation, a lot of good personalized marketing, getting into data driven decisions in terms of how we think about it. I come back to the success we have on digital and really equate it back to what we did with Hill\u2019s years back. I mean, that knowledge transfer that we had on Hill\u2019s where we went digital and online is transferring all around the world and we are seeing great results in our ecommerce business specifically. It\u2019s up to now about 14% of our total sales. It was up nearly 20% in the quarter in terms of growth. So, overall, we are seeing a lot of those strategies we put in place. Moving forward, not a lot of changes, Rob. We are focused on the execution. I think getting some of the supply chain constraints behind us is critically important for us and that allows us to get back to focusing on what we do best, which is execution and innovation across multiple price points and that\u2019s exactly where we see things unfolding. Revenue growth management will be critically important to our success moving forward. I think the discipline that we have on the ground quarter-to-quarter gets better. Are we where we need to be? No. But the pricing you see reflected over the last two quarters where you see at least a two-year stack on pricing, which looks terrific for us, I think is a testament to the fact that we are finding ways to build off the strength of our brands and get value executed in the marketplace. So, not a lot of changes, more focused on revenue growth management, more focused on our productivity initiatives. And in terms of funding the growth and our Global Productivity Program, which you are well aware of, getting that executed in the back half and early 2023. So, again, let\u2019s focus on what we do best, get on our front foot and continue to execute.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hey. Good morning. Noel, actually picking up on some of the things you were just talking about -- at the end, I guess, based on your prepared remarks and your commentary just now, it sounds like most of your earlier supply chain issues have generally abated around the world. I just wanted to confirm that and to see if call -- if -- see if there is any color you have around bottlenecks that you are still working through, number one. And then number two, on line of sight to funding the growth and savings from the Global Productivity initiative. Just maybe a little bit of color around how those savings can accelerate in the back half, I think, they are expected to, but just maybe confirm that and whether we should expect that to skew at all to the fourth quarter versus the third quarter?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Steve, and good morning. So let me address the supply chain first. Clearly, a lot of headwinds over the last six months to nine months, COVID related, obviously, at the heart of that, which has been somewhat consistent with the space and you are seeing others obviously talk about that more now. A lot of the supply chain North America issues are behind us, you have seen that obviously translate into much better on shelf availability, and obviously, that translates into good consumption for our brands and the market share performance that we had over the last 13 weeks. It is still a very, very unpredictable environment in terms of what we are seeing there. The team is all over it. But I think the tougher part is behind us certainly across North America. I would say, given the strong demand that we are seeing on Hill\u2019s, obviously, that team is doing an extraordinary job, continuing to deliver on what we need to have to meet the demand we are seeing in the marketplace. Obviously, 18% organic, comping 15% from last year is a really strong performance and I give the supply chain -- our global supply chain who is pulling on resources from all of our businesses around the world to bring in thoughts and ideas on how to continue to meet that capacity. We made some good strategic decisions on our balance sheet. Obviously, the Nutriamo facility that we have opening up in Europe will alleviate some of that, but we need to watch Hill\u2019s carefully, because obviously, the consumption is high, which I don\u2019t anticipate we will see that level of consumption quarter-to-quarter. We will see some strengths and some slowdown. But, overall, the underlying fundamentals of that business are strong. We need to ensure we continue to execute from a supply chain standpoint. So, overall, we feel much better about where we are globally from a supply chain. On funding the growth and GPI. GPI as we mentioned will be more back half loaded and into 2023. We had a marginal amount of savings come through in the second quarter. The bulk of the savings will come through in the third quarter and fourth quarter and into 2023, and you will see obviously that likewise in funding the growth. It\u2019s pretty evenly spaced. But, historically, we get a little bit more funding the growth in the back half and the teams are obviously very focused. We talked about that in the first quarter call that we had a lot more focus against funding the growth given the unprecedented environment, and fortunately, the global productivity initiative that we put in place last year in anticipation of a more difficult marketplace, we are starting to see the benefits of that unfold this year.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: I want to talk about how in your view the competitive environment might change given all the global sort of macro slowdown concerns? Does it --how do you think about this? Does it perhaps puts you in a better competitive positioning, particularly in emerging markets versus some smaller local players? And then just following up, you mentioned a couple of times that you do expect trade down. You haven\u2019t seen it yet, but you are expecting it to come. But you are still planning to price, and obviously, the Hill\u2019s results speak for themselves. So if you could just kind of triangulate those different pieces of expecting trade down, but obviously, not seeing it yet, that would be helpful? Thank you so much.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. A couple of things. So, first of all, if I take the back end of your question first, the strategy that we have deployed in high inflationary times, which we have a lot of experience in this marketplace doing that is to balance our entire portfolio. We have -- we compete across multiple price points. In some countries, five to six different price points in a specific category. That allows us to be very thoughtful on where we take pricing and when we take pricing. And obviously, a lot of the analytics that we have in place, Olivia, now allow us to kind of see where consumers are trading in and out of to ensure that we are adjusting our strategies accordingly. And I think that flexibility and agility that we have learned over the years in managing high inflationary markets has afforded us the opportunity to think very carefully about how we want to adjust to this moving forward. The competitive environment may change, for sure. If inflation becomes more benign, there may be a decision by others to decide to put that into promotion to get some volume. But as I mentioned earlier on, I think, the market seems to be acting quite rationally. This is an unprecedented environment for all CPG relative to the levels of inflation and so my instinct is you are not going to see a lot of people chasing volume by discounting price, they are going to try to get -- regain margin into the P&L. You know, Colgate is very focused on gross profit. We will continue to be focused on getting pricing into the P&L as that allows us to maintain the advertising support to drive the topline and make sure we get our innovation while seated in the marketplace and I don\u2019t really see that changing over the foreseeable future. We will flex our portfolio accordingly and the good news is we compete across so many price points across all of our categories that we feel that buffers us a bit for against any trade down that we see in the marketplace.\nOperator: We will now take a question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to ask a question on Pet Care, specifically, without obviously drilling down too much. But the performance has been really strong, right? You go back even pre-pandemic, just really has gotten better since kind of mid-2000. I think what a lot of people know understand is that there were a lot of pet adoptions during the early parts of the pandemic, which continue. I guess if you could unpack a bit of how much of the contribution has come from that and maybe if you could talk about how you measure your success amongst that newer cohort in terms of your market share amongst those that have adopted pets over the last two years? And given that they are probably somewhat new to pet ownership, how do you think about the risk if any of trade down given where the economy maybe going?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Back on Hill\u2019s. Clearly, strong performance. The strategies that we have deployed on Hill\u2019s are the same strategies we have deployed across all of our categories. And the learning that we have had from Hill\u2019s, it certainly is they have been much more at the forefront on digital and online, as I mentioned earlier. That knowledge transfer has been terrific and shared the cross the world relative to how we are thinking about the business. And if you go back to the essence of our strategy, it\u2019s faster growth channels, and obviously, they are looking at ecommerce as an opportunity for growth. The expansion into new markets, our global supply chain, as well as our global footprint allows them to think about more expansion. Clearly, they are seeing a pickup from pet ownership in the U.S. that works in perpetuity in many respects, because consumers are going to -- pet owners are going to continue to feed their pets. We have benefited, I think, from getting back to what we stand for which is science. Science is inherent to all of our core categories, whether it\u2019s Oral Care, Skin Health and we use that platform to really drive innovation, drive superior consumer benefits and health benefits across the value chain and you are seeing that obviously translate into strong growth for that business. So, again, core adjacencies, channels, get back to what we stand for, which is science and superiority, leveraging our professional model across the enterprise. They have done a terrific job obviously with their vet partnerships, which again is akin to what we do in oral care and what we do in skincare. The digital work that Hill\u2019s is doing is the best-in-class for us as a company. As you know, they built that business with a digital-first mindset. Obviously, now we are taking digital into thematic advertising as we expand penetration for the brand and expand brand awareness, which candidly are quite low still. So, all in all, we feel very good about where we are. Strong growth, we have got tough comps moving forward, as I mentioned earlier, but we feel pretty good about where we are and where the consumer is. If you go back to 2007, 2008, during the last recession, we did not see a lot of trade down out of the Hill\u2019s business during that time. So we feel pretty good. The brand is stronger. We are innovating and we are spending behind the brand moving forward. Obviously, the supply chain is an opportunity to move this forward and we are using our balance sheet accordingly to address that.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Lauren.\nLauren Lieberman: I just had two questions. First of all, just to clarify, you would mentioned earlier, plans on second half pricing and I was just curious and if you can tell us geographically, I think, it was in regard to North America, specifically, but I just was -- if you are looking for a little bit more detail on that? And then the second thing was on advertising spending. In the release, you had mentioned a plan now for it to be flat as a percentage of sales, still up in dollar terms and you did raise the sales outlook, but I just wanted to get a sense for how you might describe advertising spending plans today versus where they maybe were at the start of the year? That would just be helpful. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. So, on pricing, let me just make it more on a global basis. Clearly, with the inflation that we have seen as we talked about in the first quarter and we are very clear in laying out visibility in the first quarter around where we saw pricing evolve through the quarter. Obviously, it accelerated in the back half of the first quarter and into April. We expect pricing will accelerate as we look at our organic growth composition through the balance of the year. That means obviously that we will have new pricing executed in the back half of the year and that will be pretty broad based across the world. I am not going to get into specific regions. But I will say that we will be taking pricing across both to developed and developing world in the back half of the year and that will be depend on categories, competitive situations and we are looking at each of that very closely, but broad based we are taking pricing across the world. Relative to advertising, obviously, given the strong topline, the percentage of sales came down. Our absolute dollar was a little bit up. We expect our dollar increase to be up in the back half of the year as we continue to support our strong innovation plans and as a percentage of sales, we are estimating that, that will come in more or less in line with where we were last year. You saw in the prepared remarks, we are spending a lot more time thinking about our digital advertising and the return on investment. We are getting there. We are moving a lot more money from non-working into working media in order to balance some of the growth opportunities we see in the market. So we feel pretty good about where we are from an advertising standpoint and intend to continue to invest to build our branch.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Jason.\nJason English: Hey, there. Thanks for spotting me in. If -- sorry, if my question is redone into maybe your prepared remarks, your 10-Q, but we got a lot of information dumped on us today. I must confess, I have not been able to get through all of it. But a couple of things that stood out to me. North America, the sequential improvement in margins was certainly impressive and better than I was expecting. I haven\u2019t been able to get to the drivers in your Q yet, but can you give us any more color on what contributed to, I guess, the statement of year-on-year decline and the sequential uptick and whether or not just anything transitory aiding that?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks. So, obviously, the North America had strong sequential improvement in margin, obviously, up around a couple of hundred basis points that you saw as we put it in the prepared remarks. Dollar sales growth is driving that and obviously good topline growth, a good consumption growth across our categories. I mentioned earlier, Jason, that at least the last 13 weeks we have seen share growth in eight of our 1 categories, which again, I think, is the result of obviously the execution results we are getting in the marketplace, the innovation, working our promotions effectively in the marketplace and some of the new products that we put in place. But, obviously, we are going to continue to focus on gross margin expansion across both North America and the company. Gross profit is the key focus. The funding the growth initiatives that we have in place, getting the mix right, getting the innovation right in Oral Care as we move through the back half of the year will be critically important. Supply chain was a contributor to that as well. Obviously, we have got some of those issues that are behind us, still a lot of pressure. We need to focus on logistics, which continues to be a real headwind for both North America and the company, and as we see opportunities in the back half, we will certainly look to take those.\nJason English: Good stuff, Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. So I will turn the conference back over to Noel Wallace for any closing remarks.\nNoel Wallace: Well, thanks everyone. Again, broad based growth across the company, executing and transferring knowledge across our core categories, we are seeing obviously good consumption. Obviously an unprecedented environment around pricing, we will continue to be focused on revenue growth management, our funding the growth initiatives and our global productivity initiative as we go into the back half. Thanks for the call this morning and we look forward to talk with everyone soon.\nOperator: And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Once, again, thanks everyone for joining us. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I am delighted to share with you our second quarter results. On the first quarter call, I talked about my confidence that our organic sales growth would accelerate from our first quarter results. Some of this was due to the improvement in trends in February, March and April that we discussed on the call. But what really gives me confidence is the fundamental changes Colgate people have made to drive growth, which is why we are raising our organic sales growth guidance to 5% to 7% for 2022. Our second quarter results including double-digit organic sales growth in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition, show that the growth strategies we put in place three years ago are delivering on our objectives and how the power of our global portfolio is working. We are delivering growth across all of our divisions and all of our categories. We are showing the ability to take pricing because we have built healthier brands. We have built up our innovation capabilities so we can deliver more breakthrough and transformational innovation that can drive both category growth and market share. We have accelerated our digital transformation across the company by leveraging the capabilities we have built at Hill's and in China, and other developed markets to lead ecommerce in our markets where this important growth channel is underdeveloped. And crucially in this operating environment, our revenue growth management tools are driving positive pricing and mixes our efforts to offset the significant raw material and logistics inflation we are seeing, although, the -- along with the productivity and our ability to improve our price mix, which has enabled us to rebuild our gross margin moving forward. And looking at the quarter, the second quarter marked our 14th consecutive quarter with organic sales growth either in or above our long-term target range of 3% to 5% and that growth is broad based. We delivered organic sales growth in all six of our divisions. We delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories, Oral Care, Pet Nutrition, Personal Care and Home Care, with all four categories either in line with or above our long-term target range of 3% to 5%. As we discussed on the first quarter call, our execution on revenue growth management and premiumization allowed us to deliver a 500 basis points sequential acceleration in pricing growth. Encouragingly, despite this pricing, our volume performance also improved sequentially in the quarter on both a one year and a two-year basis, behind strong marketing plans, innovation and improved supply chain performance. Our market share performance continues to improve with our global toothpaste and manual toothbrushes are now up on a year-to-date basis. We continue to deliver on productivity with another strong quarter of funding to growth, which is vital to our plans to regain lost gross margin. As we enter the back half, we are just beginning to see early benefits from my 2022 global productivity initiative. Over the next 18 months, this program will help drive operating leverage. But we are still dealing with a very difficult cost environment. We now expect $1.3 billion in raw material and packaging inflation, with higher logistics costs as well. Foreign Exchange has become a bigger headwind since our first quarter earnings release. The euro has moved to parity with the dollar and most other currencies have weakened as well. But we will continue to invest in our brands, advertising spending was up on $1 basis, with continued shift to working from non-working and higher focus on digital spending. We are investing our capital to drive future growth as well. We are building capacity to meet strong consumer demand, particularly for Hill's, but also for other projects like our recyclable tube, which we continue to roll out across the globe. As we look to the balance of 2022 and into next year, we are focused on executing our strategies with the right innovation, brand support revenue growth management and capital plans to deliver on our long-term growth targets, while working to rebuild our gross margins and deliver sustainable profitable growth in all four of our categories. And with that, I am happy to take your questions. Caroline, can we move to the Q&A. Caroline? Are we in? Yeah. Hey, Peter. Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question. If you scan at least the numbers we are looking around the world, you continue to see great pretty good vitality at the consumer level, emerging markets growing mid-single digits, obviously some slowdown in the developed world, particularly out of Europe where you saw some sluggishness in the categories. But specifically to your question on emerging, it looks pretty good now. A lot of pricing as you can imagine going through, but if we come back to our overarching strategy and as we really laid out in the first quarter that we would be continuing to take pricing coupled with strong revenue growth management, but more importantly, accelerating our innovation cycle into those markets. Strong innovation on the premium and the value orientation side has allowed us obviously to continue to deliver strong topline growth, both in price and in volume. We will watch the consumer really closely, Peter. We obviously have a lot of teams on the ground, looking at exactly where the elasticities are. But so far, elasticities are in line with what we expected or slightly better. But that will change over time as you see more and more pricing going into the market and other economic factors impact categories. But, overall, so far we have seen the categories behave as we expected. Not a lot of trade down, but its early days. We will see how that evolves over time. Hi, Dara. Sure. In terms of, just an overarching statement on competition, clearly, it's been constructive relative to how we have seen competitors behave and I don't pretend to understand their strategies or quite frankly react to them. We are very focused on executing our strategies in the marketplace and as we laid out again in early on the first quarter call that we would be taking a leading pricing in some of the markets, and ultimately, we expected given the inflation is impacting everyone, we would see competition follow as well and that's been the case by and large around the world. So, overall, a constructive environment relative to pricing. In terms of the Americas, obviously, you have seen strong turnaround in our North America business. Again, we highlighted that we were taking pricing and saw momentum build in the first quarter, and that continued as we mentioned in the first quarter call through April, and obviously, you see now with the performance of the North America business, a good performance overall. I would call out that, obviously, they saw strong consumption across the categories. The innovation is certainly taking hold, excited to see the takeaway on Pro Series, which is at the premium end of the toothpaste. You have seen the market share and scanner performance, with scanner data in the U.S. up in 11, eight -- eight of 11 categories over the last 13 weeks, which again, I think, shows the turnaround of that business, and importantly, the performance of some of our innovation coming in broad-based across all the categories in which we compete. So, overall, good. We are watching this closely. It's an unpredictable environment relative to where we see consumers evolving, where we see inflation evolving. But the good news is, we have taken pricing, we have more pricing planned across the world moving into the back half and we will watch the consumer impact of that very carefully. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. You have known our company for many years, how focused we are on gross profit and we will continue to be laser focused on recovering gross profit as we move through the balance of this year and into 2023. The pricing and innovation strategies and revenue growth management discipline that we have across the organization is clearly focused and tailored towards getting our teams equipped to find innovative ways to drive category growth, get value into the categories through pricing and other innovation initiatives and that will clearly be the roadmap moving forward. And we feel quite confident given the health of our brands, the investment that we have been putting behind our brands, that we will have the ability to continue to take pricing in the marketplace. We will watch it very closely as I mentioned. But recognizing we have a very broad portfolio of products. We compete at the high end and at the low end of the market, and historically, we have been able to flex our portfolio quite well in markets where we have had difficult economic circumstances. So we will continue to innovate across all price points and be sure that we are capturing any trade down if that happens, which we have not seen at this stage. But, ultimately, I would expect you will see some trade down moving forward and we will continue to innovate the top end to drive the premiumization opportunity that we see. Yeah. Thanks. A lot packed in that one. So let me talk a little bit about the overarching thoughts around organic growth in the topline. Obviously, strong pricing is 8.5. But I call out the positive volume growth where we saw across North America, Asia and Hill's, and if you take obviously the impact of Russia, that volume moved up nearly 100 basis points. So, overall, we are very pleased with the broadness of the pricing that we took across all divisions and the positive volume growth that we saw across some of the markets that I just mentioned. When you look at, specifically calling out some of the other markets, Europe obviously was impacted by a couple of things, the negotiations on pricing certainly impacted categories. We tend to see some elasticity in Europe happen early on as the market adjusted to the new pricing, but ultimately, that tends to become -- that is mitigated over time as you see everyone take pricing. Asia, you asked about, obviously strong growth in Asia, both in pricing and in volume. We had an easier comp on Hawley & Hazel, but I would call out the CP China business, which grew significantly in the quarter as well on a more difficult comp. So overall really pleased with China, despite the lockdowns that we saw in the marketplace there. So we were able to overcome that and deliver strong consumption growth across most of our business. So, overall, we are pleased with the balance of pricing and volume. We are pleased with how we are getting pricing executed, and more importantly, we are pleased with the innovation that's going into the market across multiple price points in order to sustain that moving forward. Moving forward, I would say that, we will continue to be pushing pricing and my expectation is we will see some pressure on volume in the year to go, but that's to be expected as we get more pricing in the market. The important part is the balance of innovation across all price points to mitigate that. Good morning. Yes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, very -- we are very pleased with the share performance. Now recognize that a lot of the share performance that we public -- that we make public don't pickup ecommerce shares and some of the untracked channels. But that being said, our global shares continue to track well on both toothpaste and toothbrushes. Obviously, we are taking pricing. So we are seeing value shares respond to that. Volume shares have been a little bit softer. But if you look back historically, where you have seen very acute pricing enter the marketplace, over time, you see volume come down. But over time, as I mentioned, it's our responsibility to bring innovation across price points, our responsibility to work with the trade to drive volume back in the categories. We have big traffic builders. Our brands are strong around the world and we know our retailers rely on us to bring traffic into their stores and drive volume and basket. So we will continue to focus on finding innovation to ensure that the volume aspect of the category is protected. But I do expect, as we get more pricing in the market, volumes will be a little bit soft year to go, but we will manage that very, very closely. On commodity specifically, again, coming back to the first quarter, we talked about $1.2 billion of raw material inflation. We have adjusted that up to $1.3 billion this quarter. There is most of that will come in the second quarter, but we will get a lot of that coming back through the back half of the year. We have new spot rates as you mentioned and we have seen, obviously, some commodities come down, but we are pretty much locked in for the third quarter. Any benefit to any deflation that we see will get a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, possibly more of that coming in 2023. But we will look to, obviously continue to take pricing given the unprecedented environment that we are seeing both on raw materials and logistics, and make sure that we have the marketing plans to execute that effectively. Hi, Kevin. Yeah. So, obviously, we have taken our guidance up based on the consumption we are seeing in the market based on the fact that we have been able to get strong pricing and early on, obviously, see some good volume moving through the P&L. FX continues to be the biggest incremental issue that we see based on where we were in the first quarter. But, overall, we see the categories behaving as we expected. Now given the incredible unpredictability of what's happening in the global world right now, we are watching those category performance very, very carefully. Our estimations are based on the fact the elasticity will be consistent with what we expected it to be or slightly better and we will adjust accordingly as we move down the road, but it's very difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen at this stage. So we based our macros on what we can see today and what we can control. So let's come back to what we can control. We control the execution of our strategy and we are executing against all the things that we have talked about, driving the core, looking at adjacencies, new channels and some of the faster growth channels particularly ecommerce, and you see that delivering in the results that we have had over the last 14 quarters. So we are pleased with the strategies taking hold. I think the competencies we are building around digital across the entire enterprise, the competencies that we are building on innovation are all starting to track well in terms of how we evaluate them and we are seeing that play out in the performance. Hey, Bryan. Yeah. It depends on a couple of things, Bryan. First and foremost, we believe that over the longer term our focus is on rebuilding gross margins and we feel quite confident that we can do that, particularly in the current environment, given the strength of our brand, the investment we are putting behind the brands and the innovation grid that we have out in front of us. A couple of things that need to happen, obviously, the pricing in the market needs to hold, as you see inflation come down, it's a real question of where competitors will go with pricing. We think it's been quite rational to this stage. We think that given the unprecedented levels that you will see constructive moves around pricing and promotion moving forward. But we are prepared for that. It's really the flex of our portfolio across different price points that we need to manage very, very carefully. So in my view, if inflation holds, the big determinant will be, will pricing hold, and my sense is, given where we see the marketplace today, that will be the case. So the answer is longer term, yes, we absolutely believe that we can rebuild gross margins. Sure. Thanks, Rob, and good morning. So if you come back again, I think, to the heart of our strategy, which is big core businesses that need to be innovated against and you see that coming through. We have got a pretty significant innovation on our anti-cavity business going, coming out in some of the developing part of the world. The premiumization aspect that we have talked about for quite some time, Rob. We continue to obviously unfold that across different parts of our category, whether it would be on our Hill's business or whether it be on our Oral Care business, most recently with the Pro Series launch, which is a great innovation with our highest level of hydrogen peroxide in the marketplace. And obviously, looking into the adjacencies and new channels, if we talk about new channels specifically to your point, we still see a lot of runway there. Most of our markets, our online share is now above our general market share, which is terrific. I call out China specifically where we are up as you saw in the prepared remarks, 600 basis points on our ecommerce share and that's the largest ecommerce business we have in Oral Care across the world and that's been driven through good premium innovation, a lot of good personalized marketing, getting into data driven decisions in terms of how we think about it. I come back to the success we have on digital and really equate it back to what we did with Hill's years back. I mean, that knowledge transfer that we had on Hill's where we went digital and online is transferring all around the world and we are seeing great results in our ecommerce business specifically. It's up to now about 14% of our total sales. It was up nearly 20% in the quarter in terms of growth. So, overall, we are seeing a lot of those strategies we put in place. Moving forward, not a lot of changes, Rob. We are focused on the execution. I think getting some of the supply chain constraints behind us is critically important for us and that allows us to get back to focusing on what we do best, which is execution and innovation across multiple price points and that's exactly where we see things unfolding. Revenue growth management will be critically important to our success moving forward. I think the discipline that we have on the ground quarter-to-quarter gets better. Are we where we need to be? No. But the pricing you see reflected over the last two quarters where you see at least a two-year stack on pricing, which looks terrific for us, I think is a testament to the fact that we are finding ways to build off the strength of our brands and get value executed in the marketplace. So, not a lot of changes, more focused on revenue growth management, more focused on our productivity initiatives. And in terms of funding the growth and our Global Productivity Program, which you are well aware of, getting that executed in the back half and early 2023. So, again, let's focus on what we do best, get on our front foot and continue to execute. Yeah. Thanks, Steve, and good morning. So let me address the supply chain first. Clearly, a lot of headwinds over the last six months to nine months, COVID related, obviously, at the heart of that, which has been somewhat consistent with the space and you are seeing others obviously talk about that more now. A lot of the supply chain North America issues are behind us, you have seen that obviously translate into much better on shelf availability, and obviously, that translates into good consumption for our brands and the market share performance that we had over the last 13 weeks. It is still a very, very unpredictable environment in terms of what we are seeing there. The team is all over it. But I think the tougher part is behind us certainly across North America. I would say, given the strong demand that we are seeing on Hill's, obviously, that team is doing an extraordinary job, continuing to deliver on what we need to have to meet the demand we are seeing in the marketplace. Obviously, 18% organic, comping 15% from last year is a really strong performance and I give the supply chain -- our global supply chain who is pulling on resources from all of our businesses around the world to bring in thoughts and ideas on how to continue to meet that capacity. We made some good strategic decisions on our balance sheet. Obviously, the Nutriamo facility that we have opening up in Europe will alleviate some of that, but we need to watch Hill's carefully, because obviously, the consumption is high, which I don't anticipate we will see that level of consumption quarter-to-quarter. We will see some strengths and some slowdown. But, overall, the underlying fundamentals of that business are strong. We need to ensure we continue to execute from a supply chain standpoint. So, overall, we feel much better about where we are globally from a supply chain. On funding the growth and GPI. GPI as we mentioned will be more back half loaded and into 2023. We had a marginal amount of savings come through in the second quarter. The bulk of the savings will come through in the third quarter and fourth quarter and into 2023, and you will see obviously that likewise in funding the growth. It's pretty evenly spaced. But, historically, we get a little bit more funding the growth in the back half and the teams are obviously very focused. We talked about that in the first quarter call that we had a lot more focus against funding the growth given the unprecedented environment, and fortunately, the global productivity initiative that we put in place last year in anticipation of a more difficult marketplace, we are starting to see the benefits of that unfold this year. Yeah. A couple of things. So, first of all, if I take the back end of your question first, the strategy that we have deployed in high inflationary times, which we have a lot of experience in this marketplace doing that is to balance our entire portfolio. We have -- we compete across multiple price points. In some countries, five to six different price points in a specific category. That allows us to be very thoughtful on where we take pricing and when we take pricing. And obviously, a lot of the analytics that we have in place, Olivia, now allow us to kind of see where consumers are trading in and out of to ensure that we are adjusting our strategies accordingly. And I think that flexibility and agility that we have learned over the years in managing high inflationary markets has afforded us the opportunity to think very carefully about how we want to adjust to this moving forward. The competitive environment may change, for sure. If inflation becomes more benign, there may be a decision by others to decide to put that into promotion to get some volume. But as I mentioned earlier on, I think, the market seems to be acting quite rationally. This is an unprecedented environment for all CPG relative to the levels of inflation and so my instinct is you are not going to see a lot of people chasing volume by discounting price, they are going to try to get -- regain margin into the P&L. You know, Colgate is very focused on gross profit. We will continue to be focused on getting pricing into the P&L as that allows us to maintain the advertising support to drive the topline and make sure we get our innovation while seated in the marketplace and I don't really see that changing over the foreseeable future. We will flex our portfolio accordingly and the good news is we compete across so many price points across all of our categories that we feel that buffers us a bit for against any trade down that we see in the marketplace. Yeah. Back on Hill's. Clearly, strong performance. The strategies that we have deployed on Hill's are the same strategies we have deployed across all of our categories. And the learning that we have had from Hill's, it certainly is they have been much more at the forefront on digital and online, as I mentioned earlier. That knowledge transfer has been terrific and shared the cross the world relative to how we are thinking about the business. And if you go back to the essence of our strategy, it's faster growth channels, and obviously, they are looking at ecommerce as an opportunity for growth. The expansion into new markets, our global supply chain, as well as our global footprint allows them to think about more expansion. Clearly, they are seeing a pickup from pet ownership in the U.S. that works in perpetuity in many respects, because consumers are going to -- pet owners are going to continue to feed their pets. We have benefited, I think, from getting back to what we stand for which is science. Science is inherent to all of our core categories, whether it's Oral Care, Skin Health and we use that platform to really drive innovation, drive superior consumer benefits and health benefits across the value chain and you are seeing that obviously translate into strong growth for that business. So, again, core adjacencies, channels, get back to what we stand for, which is science and superiority, leveraging our professional model across the enterprise. They have done a terrific job obviously with their vet partnerships, which again is akin to what we do in oral care and what we do in skincare. The digital work that Hill's is doing is the best-in-class for us as a company. As you know, they built that business with a digital-first mindset. Obviously, now we are taking digital into thematic advertising as we expand penetration for the brand and expand brand awareness, which candidly are quite low still. So, all in all, we feel very good about where we are. Strong growth, we have got tough comps moving forward, as I mentioned earlier, but we feel pretty good about where we are and where the consumer is. If you go back to 2007, 2008, during the last recession, we did not see a lot of trade down out of the Hill's business during that time. So we feel pretty good. The brand is stronger. We are innovating and we are spending behind the brand moving forward. Obviously, the supply chain is an opportunity to move this forward and we are using our balance sheet accordingly to address that. Hi, Lauren. Sure. So, on pricing, let me just make it more on a global basis. Clearly, with the inflation that we have seen as we talked about in the first quarter and we are very clear in laying out visibility in the first quarter around where we saw pricing evolve through the quarter. Obviously, it accelerated in the back half of the first quarter and into April. We expect pricing will accelerate as we look at our organic growth composition through the balance of the year. That means obviously that we will have new pricing executed in the back half of the year and that will be pretty broad based across the world. I am not going to get into specific regions. But I will say that we will be taking pricing across both to developed and developing world in the back half of the year and that will be depend on categories, competitive situations and we are looking at each of that very closely, but broad based we are taking pricing across the world. Relative to advertising, obviously, given the strong topline, the percentage of sales came down. Our absolute dollar was a little bit up. We expect our dollar increase to be up in the back half of the year as we continue to support our strong innovation plans and as a percentage of sales, we are estimating that, that will come in more or less in line with where we were last year. You saw in the prepared remarks, we are spending a lot more time thinking about our digital advertising and the return on investment. We are getting there. We are moving a lot more money from non-working into working media in order to balance some of the growth opportunities we see in the market. So we feel pretty good about where we are from an advertising standpoint and intend to continue to invest to build our branch. Hi, Jason. Sure. Thanks. So, obviously, the North America had strong sequential improvement in margin, obviously, up around a couple of hundred basis points that you saw as we put it in the prepared remarks. Dollar sales growth is driving that and obviously good topline growth, a good consumption growth across our categories. I mentioned earlier, Jason, that at least the last 13 weeks we have seen share growth in eight of our 1 categories, which again, I think, is the result of obviously the execution results we are getting in the marketplace, the innovation, working our promotions effectively in the marketplace and some of the new products that we put in place. But, obviously, we are going to continue to focus on gross margin expansion across both North America and the company. Gross profit is the key focus. The funding the growth initiatives that we have in place, getting the mix right, getting the innovation right in Oral Care as we move through the back half of the year will be critically important. Supply chain was a contributor to that as well. Obviously, we have got some of those issues that are behind us, still a lot of pressure. We need to focus on logistics, which continues to be a real headwind for both North America and the company, and as we see opportunities in the back half, we will certainly look to take those. Well, thanks everyone. Again, broad based growth across the company, executing and transferring knowledge across our core categories, we are seeing obviously good consumption. Obviously an unprecedented environment around pricing, we will continue to be focused on revenue growth management, our funding the growth initiatives and our global productivity initiative as we go into the back half. Thanks for the call this morning and we look forward to talk with everyone soon."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, John Faucher. Please go ahead, John.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Cristina. Good morning and welcome to our 2022 first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures including those identified in Tables 5 and 6 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with his thoughts on our Q1 results and our 2022 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John and good morning to all of you. Given the release of the prepared commentary earlier this morning, I will keep my remarks fairly short as I am certain you have a number of questions. Obviously, 2022 is shaping up as a more difficult year than we anticipated with greater-than-expected increases in raw materials as you have seen from others, particularly fats and oils and logistics. This is offsetting what we think will be a very solid year for organic sales growth now that we are seeing our global supply chain stabilize following COVID-related lockdowns and stress in logistic networks around the world [Technical Difficulty] sales growth for the balance of the year. First off, we knew that Q1 will be the most difficult quarter given comparisons, supply chain issues and pricing negotiations. We exited the quarter with high single-digit pricing as we took more pricing in developed markets starting in February and continuing into April. We believe this is more indicative of the pricing we will see for the balance of the year. Elasticity seemed to be either in line or better than expectations and this should help limit incremental volume weakness from the higher pricing over the balance of the year. Encouragingly, as we said in our prepared remarks, volume and organic sales performance improved in February and March versus January and organic sales growth has continued to accelerate in April. Importantly, we are beginning to see the benefits of the stabilization in our global supply chain network with the impacts of COVID-related factory closures behind us and the opening of the global logistic capacities. Our guidance does not assume further COVID-related lockdowns in the balance of the year that would impact our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. Our U.S. on-shelf availability for toothpaste has been below normal for several months as we dealt with the same supply chain challenges you have heard about from other companies. By tapping into our global supply chain, we were able to restore shipments and our availability is now back to normal levels, which you are seeing reflected in better market share performance in toothpaste. And with the improved share performance in manual toothbrushes in the U.S., where our share is up 4.5 points year-to-date, we feel better about the trajectory of U.S. oral care. Combined with increased advertising through the balance of the year, significant innovation, particularly around whitening in the U.S. and in Asia and the relaunch of two important core brands, our Hawley & Hazel brand in China and the Hill\u2019s Prescription Diet business, we feel confident in our forecast for an acceleration in organic sales growth for the balance of the year. This gets us to our new guidance of 4% to 6% organic sales growth. Tempering this outlook obviously is the difficult cost environment. Our entire cost factor has risen over the past few months, but the biggest impact has come in the area that we call fats and oils. That\u2019s palm oil, palm krona oil, soybean oil, tallow and others. This has historically been our second biggest area of raw material spend behind coal new resins. Although given the inflation we are seeing this year, our spending in the second half on fats and oils will equal our spending on resins. These ingredients are used in every category we compete in and we expect a more than 60% increase across fats and oils this year. And while you know our global supply chain is a strategic advantage, the global nature of our supply chain is adding to costs in the current environment. Freight rates from Mexico to the U.S. are up 30% year-over-year and ocean freights have basically doubled. We continued to take significant steps to offset these headwinds. We are taking additional pricing and we are launching premium innovation. We established our 2022 global productivity initiative to drive further cost savings for this year and next year while accelerating our Funding the Growth initiatives. We have reduced our overhead ex-logistics spending by $30 million in the quarter versus the first quarter last year already. So, as we open it up for your questions, we know we need to execute on during the balance of the year and we are very focused against that. While we know our guidance is below our previous expectations, we believe that our cost forecasts are prudent and that our plans are well thought through and well supported to deliver on our organic sales growth guidance, while leaving us well positioned as we look to return to profitable growth. Thanks. And I will be happy to take your questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys. So just a two-part question on guidance. Noel, when you have this large external change in terms of higher costs, clearly, it requires a change in the level of guidance that we have today, but it also requires a change in sort of choices around the P&L in terms of pricing, levels of investment, productivity, etcetera. So a), just short-term with the new guidance, you quantified very well in the prepared remarks, the cost changes. Obviously, the org sales change. But can you just be a bit more specific on maybe some of the other drivers in terms of incremental price you are expecting with the new guidance for 2022, how you think about incremental productivity? Will it change ad spends at all? I am just \u2013 and part of the reason I ask it is you have got $650 million in higher costs, so that\u2019s a high-teens earnings impact. That\u2019s sort of doubled the earnings revision in the guidance. So I am just trying to better understand the offsets, just some of the cost pressures? And then b), just wanted to really extend that same question more strategically longer term. You have obviously had success reaccelerating organic sales growth to some extent with the changes under your leadership. Do these sort of P&L decisions this year \u2013 how might, if at all, it impact the strategies you put in place or sort of the long-term top line growth trajectory as you look beyond this year? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Dara. Let me start a little bit about the pricing comment, because I think it\u2019s obviously core to how we are thinking about the balance of the year. As you know, we took pricing in at least the developed markets a little late in the quarter. As we had talked about in the fourth quarter, we have planned to take pricing in February, March and April and that\u2019s exactly what happened. So, we didn\u2019t get the benefits of the pricing in the first quarter P&L, largely in North America as well as Europe, while we were able to get significant pricing across the developing part of the world, it was North America and Europe, which lagged a little bit in the quarter. As we exited the quarter, we saw high single-digit pricing being executed, particularly in the March month and obviously, that has continued to transpire as we look at the strong sales that we are seeing in April. We have likewise continued to accelerate pricing in the developing part of the world in the year to go. So, a combination of what we are doing in the developed world and the execution of those prices, which was lagged a little bit, particularly in Europe as we were going through some longer negotiations than we anticipated as we entered the quarter \u2013 and we have consequently taken more pricing in the rest of the world, we feel very good about where we are for pricing and March being more indicative of the type of pricing that you will see in the balance of the year. So, so far so good, particularly around elasticities, volumes are more or less in line with where we thought. But it\u2019s early days on elasticity. We will see how that unfolds in the balance of the year. But we obviously have, we believe a very strong innovation plan, very strong promotional plan as well. So, on pricing, which I think is core to our guidance, we feel pretty good based on what we have seen in March, as I said, where we see it in April and more importantly, the plans that we have put in place for the balance of the year. Strategically, in terms of choices no big changes there. I mean, we have a really strong growth plans. We have talked about going into the year on premium innovation as well as core innovation. You heard a little bit of that in my comments, two significant launches on core innovation. That\u2019s our Hawley & Hazel business, which is the number one brand in China that is a complete portfolio change across the entire business. That was obviously some of the softness we saw in volume in the first quarter was driven by the fact that we were transitioning into an entirely new bundle across the entire portfolio. And likewise, on our prescription diet business, which you know we have had great success on the science diet, we are now taking a lot of those learnings into improved nutrition, improved packaging and conceptual execution on the Prescription Diet business, which is at a premium price. I would also say that on some of our other core businesses around the world, particularly given the pricing environment that we are faced with, we are now in a much better place to execute re-launches given we have more \u2013 a better line of sight on our supply chain issues that we were faced with. That was obviously taking time away from putting new products in the market \u2013 so strategically, when we start thinking about how that lays out for this year and next, we will get back to a lot of those core re-launches, which will allow us to take pricing obviously bolster volume and value at the same time. So that\u2019s kind of where we are strategically, making the right choices, we think about getting pricing in the market, making sure we execute against our very strong innovation plan and protect the core businesses, which will be very, very important as we move into a potential recessionary environment.\nOperator: We will go to our next question from Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: Hey, good morning everyone. I hope you are doing well. So, I just wanted to ask about the organic revenue outlook. Noel, I know you mentioned the sequential improvement in February and March and into April. Can you maybe unpack that a little bit? How much stronger was the growth versus what you saw in January? And then just for the high single-digit pricing that we should expect through the balance of the year, is the volume assumption in the 4% to 6% organic revenue outlook predicated on historical elasticities or what you are seeing in the market today? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. So, let me deconstruct a little bit of Q1. January was a little softer than we anticipated. As I mentioned, we obviously saw a little softness in Europe given some of the delayed pricing negotiations. We saw little softness in our Hawley & Hazel business as we mentioned, that\u2019s really transitory as we are moving from the old bundle to a new bundle. We saw little softness in our French business and we saw a little softness in the rural areas in India. So that led to a somewhat soft January. Sequentially, we saw all that improve in February and March, both volumes improved February, March versus January. And as I mentioned, we had strong pricing starting to get executed early March and towards the end of the month and into April. So, we feel quite good about where we ended the quarter. And as I mentioned, we have seen that translate into a strong April as well. So, that\u2019s kind of how we have set up the guidance for the year. So, 4% in the first quarter, we believe will be the low end of organic for the year and that will sequentially grow as we move more pricing into the P&L as well as continue to innovate and provide some volume enhancements as we move through the balance of the year. I will say that again, getting the supply chain constraints behind us from a ball point, yes, it cost us money relative to doing some of the things that we did to get more toothpaste on the shelf to get more toothbrushes in the market. We have seen that translate into more volume in the business as a result as well. And that\u2019s a good thing because we are seeing it translate into consumption and category growth for our retailers. So from an organic standpoint, you will see it sequentially grow through the quarters, particularly as we execute more pricing in the second quarter. And as I mentioned, we have now looked to take more pricing in the back half as we will see the peak in raw materials come through later in the year. Relative to the pricing aspect, I think not much more to add there. We have taken \u2013 we took strong pricing in developing part of the world. You see our 2-year stack on pricing at roughly 10%. And there is more pricing to come. And you will see pricing as a percentage of our organic growth likely accelerate certainly in the second and third quarters. And we will see where we end up in what situation we are in, in the fourth quarter, but pricing will accelerate. That\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. Obviously, the revenue management initiatives that we have been taking \u2013 we are getting more premium innovation and I won\u2019t get into some of the success we are having behind the Optic White Pro Series, which is our most premium-priced whitening bundle that\u2019s doing quite well out of the box. We are obviously, as I mentioned earlier, importantly using our supply chain now to get core re-launches executed quicker, which will give us a pricing opportunity as well. So, those would be the three key initiatives relative to getting pricing up in the back half.\nOperator: We will go to our next question from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to perhaps focus on North America and talk about home care, which was obviously a headwind as you called out. And Noel, you just pointed out that some of the new franchises and the premiumization efforts have been bearing fruit. So, I was wondering how we should be thinking in the balance of the year? And just as a prior question regarding elasticities, how we should be thinking it looks as if, as you said, like you have a stacked 10% pricing. I am assuming that is U.S. So, how can we be thinking as you rollover more pricing? Just a fine point there, is that pricing coming in at the end of the summer into the fall or actually earlier than that in the U.S.? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Andrea. Good morning. Let me talk a little bit about home care. So again, a little bit of the constraints that we had with contractors and the implications of certainly the COVID-related issues that have challenged a lot of the contract manufacturing in the U.S. that certainly plagued us a bit on some of our home care, particularly our dish liquid business. And we have specifically addressed that and starting to see the improvements of that as we move through the balance of the first quarter and as we moved into April as well. So, we see home care from a volume standpoint starting to come back nicely. We are taking pricing on some of that home care business in the second quarter as well. And so that will obviously translate into improved performance. Overall, the cleaner business is solid. The fabric softener business is quite solid from a share standpoint, a little softness in dish liquid and we have plans on particularly the Palmolive and Ajax business in the U.S. from a combination of both pricing and some new product initiatives to hopefully bolster that business as we move through the back half. On elasticities, again, it\u2019s really early days here. And I think you have seen it consistently across most of the sector. Everyone is assuming that elasticities will be better than historical numbers. Why? It\u2019s because everyone is consistently taking up pricing \u2013 so therefore, everything is going to be up and we are everyday or products that consumers use everyday. And so, as a result of that aspect, I think you will see a little bit less and less elasticities than we have seen in the past and that\u2019s what we have seen so far. But again, there is a couple of factors to take into consideration. There will be significant inflation across the entire consumer segment and we will be watching that very closely. But if you go back historically, our franchise and our portfolio positioning plays well in inflationary environments, because we have big core businesses, widespread distribution and we compete across multiple price points. But we know that we can continue to grow the premium segment of the market, which is where we under-index, high indexes in the core business, but we are going to take ambitious plans on our core business to bring value to the category and to our retailers. So we feel pretty good about where the elasticities will ultimately end up here just because we\u2019ve experienced it before. We\u2019ve got good innovation going into the market. And as I said, kind of all ships are rising in this case to the categories are all taking pricing across the board.\nOperator: We will go next to Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy, your line is open please check your mute button.\nWendy Nicholson: Can you hear me?\nNoel Wallace: We can, Wendy.\nWendy Nicholson: Okay, sorry about that. So just a follow-up on that line of questioning about the elasticities. If I look back in my model, the one business that really suffered during the \u2013 great recession for you was the Hill\u2019s business. And I honestly can\u2019t remember whether that was something specific to the Hill\u2019s business, whether it\u2019s innovation or a competitive thing or whether that was an area where consumers really did trade down. So I guess number one, you don\u2019t need to recreate history for me, but just in terms of your confidence that the Hill\u2019s business this time around is going to remain strong. Your volume growth there has been amazing. Just your confidence that if we do go into a recession, consumers are going to trade down and look for cheaper pet food? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. If you go back to \u2013 I believe you\u2019re probably looking at \u201808, \u201809, and that was at least the beginning of the naturals boom, as you remembered. And as we have openly stated, we made in our view, some strategic errors in how we chase the naturals rather than staying true to the core business. So I think that was the biggest driver. And certainly, at that point in time, when the Hill\u2019s business was nowhere near as salient and had nowhere close to the momentum that it has today, and we\u2019re certainly on our front foot and continue to think about that business in terms of investment. You heard today that we closed the Nutriamo contract manufacturing facility that we bought in Italy. That is going to unlock more wet capacity for us, which is one of the fastest-growing segments, particularly in Europe, which is exciting. We\u2019re relaunching the Prescription Diet business going into the back half of this year, which is obviously about half of our business, which we think is going to be an exciting innovation for particularly our veterinarian professionals. So the business is in a much different place today than it was back in \u201808, \u201809. Obviously, much more on us on it. We\u2019re going to maintain the investment spend there, which we think is critically important. Again, this is a business that has low penetration and low share, so a lot of upside in North America and capacity constrained today, hence the reason of why the purchase of Nutriamo. So again, we think we\u2019re in a much different place than we were in \u201808, \u201809. The brand itself is significantly stronger than it\u2019s been in the past.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to get a little bit more granularity around your full year EPS expectations and how much of the EPS revision is due to input costs versus FX rate as you handicap, but perhaps a 10 points ring on EPS expectations from one end of the pendulum to the other. And realizing, obviously, there is no shortage of uncertainty. But can you talk about what the most meaningful changes are there? And mathematically, how do you get from where you were to mid-singles down the singles? And then specifically for international markets, can you talk about what your peers are doing not just the multinationals, but the local players with respect to pricing, is the expectation that they are pricing or the realization what you\u2019re seeing so far that they are pricing at a commensurate level to what you\u2019re doing? Thank you so much.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Olivia. Great to hear from you. Let me just talk conceptually on the EPS, and then I\u2019ll have Stan jump in and give you a little bit more a bridge in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about it. But fundamentally, listen, this comes down to the extraordinary acceleration that we saw in our raw materials post the January guidance, which as you\u2019ve heard, is around $0.5 billion. So just add on its own is driving, obviously, the significant change in EPS, combined with the fact that our logistics have continued to accelerate. Part of that, we will work out of as we move through potentially the back half of the year with improved manufacturing and supply chain, which is obviously important for us to get that product on the shelf, as I mentioned, which is we\u2019re doing at a higher cost, but we anticipate logistics will stay high. Ocean rates, we are keeping ocean rates at where they are today for the balance of the year. And obviously, some of the transit rates that we\u2019re seeing, particularly out of Mexico, which are up about 30% versus the year ago period, we\u2019re assuming that will maintain itself as well. So, raw materials, largely driven by fast and oils, I will get Stan. Why don\u2019t I have Stan open that up a little bit for you. And then I\u2019ll come back and we will talk about the international markets and pricing.\nStan Sutula: Sure. Thanks, Noel. So as we entered the year, we knew the commodity costs were going to be up year-on-year, and we planned for that. In January, we entered the year, we saw in the market. We expected that material cost would moderate as we went through the year. At that time, in January, we anticipated roughly $750 million or 13% and year-to-year increase. But as we stated in January, if the commodity costs don\u2019t moderate, that would represent a headwind. So what\u2019s happened? Since January, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we\u2019ve seen significant movement in those commodity costs. And now we see an incremental $500 million of cost for the year. What that means is that material costs will be up over 20% for the full year on a year-on-year basis. So we put some context a little bit underneath what\u2019s happening in those commodities. Natural gas is up over 60%. And natural gas is used to power many of our plants and importantly, many of our suppliers\u2019 plants, which puts pressure on their costs and timing. Soybean and corn are up by over third; palms, up 25% and increasing. So as we said earlier, what that means for the year, fats and oils, including palm will be up over 60% year-to-year and doubled since 2020. Resins are up over 20%. And these two categories combined fats and oils and resins make up a significant portion of the material spend and on a combined basis are up nearly 40%. Take glycerin, another important material, and that\u2019s more than doubled year-to-year. So as we\u2019ve looked at logistics, we saw similar cost inflation. And since we\u2019ve seen that increase, we\u2019ve over $150 million since our expectations in January, that translates to logistics being up nearly 20% for the full year. And some of this increase is because we prioritize meeting clients\u2019 needs. We talked briefly about this, our decision to prioritize toothbrush shipments given client demand and market opportunity, particularly in North America, we grew that category double digits and gained over 450 points of share. Now I think importantly, Noel talked about this would represent over a 20% increase to our cost over $1.2 billion. But what are we doing to tackle that and mitigate some of that significant escalation? On materials, we\u2019re leveraging alternate materials, we\u2019re viable, reformulating where that makes sense, taking price to reflect the cost increase. We\u2019ve talked about price significantly here. And then, things like leveraging analytics to enhance our procurement process and driving our robust Funding the Growth program to help mitigate that profit impact. On logistics, we are taking a number of actions. As our supply chain stabilizes from things like COVID-impact and material shortages, we\u2019re going to streamline our logistics use less expedited transport. Now temporarily, we\u2019re carrying more finished goods inventory due to erratic and longer transit times. We\u2019re also making things like investments in automating our warehouses. So while these remain volatile, we\u2019re being aggressive to tackle those. So from a P&L point of view, as you translate that down to EPS, those are going to be a headwind for us for the year. We\u2019re taking aggressive pricing, aggressive funding the growth and productivity actions but we\u2019re still expecting margin will contract for the year. And we are going to maintain investment in advertising. We believe that that\u2019s an important component of our long-term model, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken that our organic growth up to the 4% to 6% range. Take that down, we will continue to drive improvements in overhead. And stripping logistics, our overhead improved on a year-on-year basis. And the team has done a very good job of managing that prudently, but that\u2019s what yields us down to a EPS when you take into the effects the multiple interest rate hikes, a headwind on tax, that drives the EPS here down on a year-on-year basis to mid-single digits.\nNoel Wallace: So let me come back to what we\u2019re seeing on local brands and certainly private label to a certain extent as an extension of that. I would just return for some travel around Asia. We\u2019re certainly seeing some of the local brands take pricing there. And likewise, I think we\u2019re going to see private label follow very quickly. Obviously, these increases impact them, and their cost of goods are obviously materially higher than ours. So we will watch that carefully. We don\u2019t have a lot of categories that index highly with private label. Obviously, oral care very low single digits. The two categories that we need to watch carefully are liquid hands open toothbrushes. But so far, we have not seen a significant erosion or migration to private label and so [Technical Difficulty] as we see the environment unfold over the next few months.\nOperator: And we will go to our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hi, thanks everybody. Good morning. I guess I\u2019m curious as to how you think about the supply chain impacts in terms of quantification in the quarter, whether in terms of volume or market share, particularly in North America, but throughout your remarks or supply chain issues, including in Europe and Latin America, holding you back. So just curious as to how you think about how much you were held back and how that \u2013 how much of that kind of reverses and releases for the balance of the year, number one. And then number two, just maybe just some further details on China. It was down overall. I think in your release, you said that you called out Colgate China itself as a point of strength. So obviously, some timing there with Hawley & Hazel, but just some \u2013 maybe some more color on what happened in China and how you think about that market going forward, which is obviously a very dynamic context? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Steve. Listen, the supply chain, as we talked about throughout 2021 has been really choppy with a lot of second and third derivative impacts of all the implications related to COVID. But if you take specifically the impacts to us, where you really feel it is on shelf availability. And we have historically been best-in-class in that regard across our categories and some of the setbacks we saw from COVID lockdowns in China where we saw some of the challenges we\u2019ve seen in logistics coming out of Mexico, raw material suppliers as well, having shortfalls that caused a lot of choppiness in our supply chain throughout 2021 and certainly accelerated a bit as we went into the first \u2013 out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. The good news is, as we finished off in the back half of February and into March, we saw a lot of those issues structurally get much, much better for us as a company. Our on-shelf availability, which should dip way below norms, was now back right at top of class. And you see that directly in our point-of-sale data in some of those customers where we actually now are measuring detailed on-shelf availability at the daily and weekly basis that allows us to react very, very quickly. We have taken decisions through 2021 and in the first quarter, to ensure that we have sufficient inventory to compensate some of those \u2013 the shortfalls that we we\u2019re seeing and the uncertainty that we had from various contractors or raw material suppliers. That has cost us some money but we feel in the end is now given the trade, obviously, far more \u2013 a clear line of sight in terms of our ability to source an increasing demand, particularly behind our toothpaste and toothbrush business here in the first quarter. So on-shelf ability significantly improved as we exited the quarter and has maintained itself as we went into April, that has translated into better market share performance. Take the U.S. in the last 5 weeks, we were up or flat in seven out of 11 categories, which is a marked improvement versus where we had been in the past. Some of the issues likewise translated into the European business where we saw some shortfalls in terms of service levels there, that now has been addressed through some decisions that we have taken, and we\u2019re seeing likewise, as we exited the quarter a little bit better volume. So all in all, across the board, \u2013 most of those issues now are behind us, particularly the lockdown issues that really had a significant impact on part of our business. And I give credit to the supply chain for doing a tremendous amount of agility work that I think is only going to set us up for stronger resilience moving forward as we see some of the uncertainty continue to unfold in certain parts of the world. China is actually a really good story from the sense of our CP China business was up high single digits in the quarter. Our CP China business, combined with Holly & Hazel, was up 650 basis points in market share in the online business, which is obviously the fastest-growing part of the China \u2013 the retail sector. Hawley & Hazel business was migrating, as I mentioned, Steve, to an entirely new portfolio and repositioning of the brand, including a brand name change that will incur \u2013 that was rolling out in the first quarter. As a result of the significant distribution scale of China, we were moving down inventories of old product distributors. We\u2019re obviously taking their inventories down in preparation for the excitement behind the relaunch. We\u2019ve started to see a lot of that unfold in the back end of March and now into April, and we will see it ultimately, it will take a couple more months before we see full distribution of that new product across the China market. So overall, the China business looks quite strong for us. For the first time in many, many years, our overall China market shares in toothpaste, that\u2019s combined, Hawley & Hazel and Colgate are up. So it\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve heard me say that, but I think that\u2019s a testament to some big strategic changes that we made in China. Now going back 2.5, 3 years, both in terms of portfolio strategy as well as go to market that we\u2019d say is definitely paying dividends. And we will watch obviously the Hawley and Hazel relaunch carefully but quite excited about that thus far in terms of how we\u2019re seeing it hit the market.\nOperator: We will go to our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, guys. Thanks for slotting me in. I guess a couple of questions. First, kind of building off your last comments around the online or the exit of the Darlie brand, when did that begin exactly like in the execution? And I imagine you\u2019re planning assumption is that you\u2019re not going to retain all of the sales as you migrate away from the brand. When do you think that pressure will be behind us? I think even or how many quarters do we have to live with what\u2019s likely going to be a drag from the rebranding?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Listen, I mean, we expect, obviously, that we will not only hold but ultimately build share with this relaunch, Jason, that\u2019s the intent. I mean we have significant investment planned behind this relaunch. It is the number one brand in China, has incredible salience. We\u2019re putting in improved technology as well. We have an innovation stream that\u2019s coming behind this. Now there is no question there is always risk when you change a brand name, but all of the work that we\u2019ve done thus far and what we\u2019ve seen early days, that transition really started at the tail end of January, early February, the bulk of it starting to happen in March. And as I mentioned, will unfold more than likely over the next couple \u2013 2 to 3 months. We will know by the end of the second quarter, third quarter, where we are. We will get a good sense, particularly in the online world. As I mentioned, the vast majority \u2013 the fastest-growing channel is online in China. And we will get a read pretty quickly in how we are doing relative to our online business with Darlie in that market. But overall, this is a widely distributed product, very, very strong, obviously gets into C, D and E cities. So, it\u2019s widely distributed. It will take time to work through the old product, but we are starting to see some of the new product already on shelf in the modern trade, and so far, so good. But I would say, give us another quarter, the balance of this quarter to really assess how we are doing and come back to you with the point of view as we move into the third quarter.\nOperator: We will go to our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the supply chain question, because I do know that in fourth quarter or even third quarter results, you had talked about supply chain dynamics impacting North America. But at least to my recollection, this is the first we have heard about supply chain bottlenecks and headwinds for Latin America and Europe. And given it impacted sales in the quarter, I would think that you would had a sense of that by the time you reported 4Q. Same goes, honestly, for the sort of softer start to the year in January. So, I just \u2013 I wanted to ask specifically about the supply chain dynamics in Latin America and Europe. And then a broader question just on visibility because it just feels like \u2013 I know it\u2019s a volatile environment, but that there seems to be an intra-quarter moving target and just level of confidence, frankly, as we look forward for the balance of the year? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Lauren, let me just clarify. We have not had supply chain issues in Latin America. The supply chain issues and the volatility that we have seen has principally been driven by the North America complexities that we have incurred as well as some shortfalls from some of our raw material suppliers in the middle of the quarter in Europe, which created obviously some constraints there. So, specifically, it\u2019s been North America driven by some lockdown issues in China as well as some of the COVID-related issues we had in some of our facilities here in North America. So, as I mentioned, we feel very good about where we have now in March. Structurally, things have gotten much better, efficiencies in the plant, asset utilization, capacity output, all are moving in the right direction, which are good indications that we are moving to where we want to be. And as I mentioned, some of the service level challenges that we have had. And I think everyone has moved through, but we were somewhat exacerbated by those in terms of our ability to get what we needed into some of our key customers are now back to historical high levels. So, good news there, no issue, Latin America. On Europe, specifically had dealt with a some raw material shortages that came from some of our suppliers mid-quarter. So, that was after we discussed it, we set guidance in January, that particularly hit us in Europe, and that has now moved behind us and things are back to a much more normalized level. We see that, quite frankly, all around the world. I mean if you look at a number of issues that we dealt with in 2021 and moving into the quarter this year with raw material suppliers or contractors, those seem to have subsided. Let\u2019s watch it carefully because anything can happen in the current world, given the uncertainty that everyone is faced with. But we have put a lot more resilience into the system now to deal with some of the unforeseen circumstances that we are seeing. Listen, in terms of visibility, Lauren, we were \u2013 we came out of last year understanding that we were faced with $750 million of incremental cost and we had the pricing in place to deal with that. And the gross margins came in more or less in line, actually just slightly below where we expected, a little bit above guidance to the Street in the first quarter. And then we got hit with the significant incremental increases to the tune of $0.5 billion post the January call, which came in mid-Feb and into March. So, that\u2019s been the single biggest issue in terms of visibility for us. We did not anticipate those. We had cost becoming more benign in the back half initially when we set guidance, obviously, with the war, all of that change. So, the visibility for us became dramatically different as we exited the quarter and hence the change in our guidance that we have communicated today.\nJohn Faucher: Lauren, if I could just add one thing, going back to your Latin America comment. There was some impact in Latin America, really, over the last couple of quarters relative to the supply chain issues we saw with plant lockdowns in Asia. So, that was what we were referring to in the prepared commentary.\nNoel Wallace: But no, nothing relative to LatAm for themselves, they have been able to obviously continue to do what they need to do. But as you know, we source quite a bit of product out of Latin America. The costs have gone up, but we don\u2019t have anything that we would consider significant there.\nOperator: We will go to our next question from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI.\nJavier Escalante: Hi everyone. I say that two things that it would be helpful because \u2013 and it\u2019s really on Lauren\u2019s question. This is that it feels that your supply chain is very global. And when you speak about Colgate, you talk about toothpaste and not toothbrushes. And then the problem in Latin America seems to be that you have problems sourcing toothbrushes out of Asia and toothpaste in the U.S. is out of Mexico. So, I think that there is a little bit of a disconnect between our understanding of the supply chain and your conversation. So, if you could clarify, in the U.S., what are the supply chain issues? Is it that Mexico is not delivering into the U.S.? And then in Latin America, is it that toothbrushes in Asia are now coming through into Latin America? And finally, in Latin America, you basically said that you had no supply chain issues, but volumes dropped. So, why is the drop, because if you think about Procter and Unilever, they grew organic sales in Latin America in 16%, so the consumer seems to be fine. So, what is that \u2013 why is it that Latin America is lagging your competitors? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Okay. Let me address the supply chain first. Toothbrushes, first and foremost, is a global supply chain we source predominantly out of Asia as well as some sourcing out of Latin America. Obviously, given the lockdowns that we saw in Asia in 2021 and subsequently having an impact in the first quarter that impacted most of our global toothbrush business around the world, more acutely here in the U.S., where we have taken decisions in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, to ensure that we accelerated migration of those toothbrushes when supply came back online, back into refill inventories and improve on-shelf ability. So, we had issues there, particularly for North America, where we are having to bring product in expediently in order to fulfill demand. That impacted some of our sourcing \u2013 some of our toothbrush business likewise in Latin America, likewise in Europe, but it was more acutely faced by the North America business, and we addressed that. Our toothpaste business historically has been a balance of a global supply chain that works very, very efficiently. Given some of the challenges that we had in the North America, we were bringing more product out of Mexico, they were fulfilling increased demand for our product. It came into additional costs. Obviously, as we talked about earlier, that freight rates out of Mexico increased. We did have some delays getting product across the border at times, but that was not a function of our problem. It was a function of what was happening systemically across the marketplace. So, our toothpaste supply chain is global. It has been a competitive advantage for us for years and years. We are able to now transfer products from one market to another quite consistently and quite efficiently. But as you have delays in one market or supplier implications in one market, it obviously creates a little bit of a bottleneck for you. We have taken decisions to ensure that we are having locations that are efficiently sourcing local markets where needed. And I think today, we are in a much better position than we have been in the past related to dealing with the uncertainty of the supply chain network that exists in the world that we live in today. So, overall, we think we are in a good place. On volumes for Latin America, listen, the only real shortfall in volumes for us in Latin America was Brazil. We took high-double digit pricing, 15% pricing in that market. We saw volumes come off a little bit, which historically has been consistent with where we have seen. We have taken significant pricing. Mexico had positive pricing, positive volumes across the board. So, I would really attribute it to some of the softness we saw in Brazil, because the rest of the business is okay, and we will see how Brazil unfolds. But this is quite consistent with what we have seen in the past when we have taken significant pricing.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and good morning everyone. I guess I wanted to go back and try to understand the pricing strategy for \u201822. So, you talked obviously about being $750 million or so cost headwind in January, which has obviously gotten bigger, but it was still a big number back then. It seems others were a bit more proactive, at least it seems to me, more proactive and got stronger pricing earlier in the year. And I guess your comment to gross margin for you all was better than guided, but it was still down a lot. So, I guess I am curious, was there a volume calculus in your decision to seemingly lag some peers on pricing. And now that you are taking more price, how should we be thinking about volumes relative to pricing for \u201822? In other words, kind of what has changed or how do we think about the change in your assumptions there. So, if you could talk about the decision kind of first of all, whether that\u2019s right or not? And then how we think about the volume change as a result? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. What happened in the first quarter, obviously, as we saw a little bit of delays in our pricing execution in Europe, which I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, given some of the annual negotiations and ultimately how those unfolded. The good news is those are behind us as we exited the quarter, and we will see that pricing fully reflected as we move into the second quarter. We were a little late in the U.S. arguably, I think in terms of how we sell things, but we did lead pricing in our core business ahead of competition. We have seen competition ultimately follow, but we did lead in the U.S. So, we felt like we got to have it pretty quickly, but obviously, the costs moved a little bit beyond what we expected. So, coming back to gross margin, we were kind of more in line with what we thought. We thought we would see most of the pricing come through in the back half of the quarter, which would obviously deliver accelerated sequential gross margin through the balance of the year. That was the initial assumption. But obviously, all things changed when the February-March \u2013 mid-February, March cost increases came through. We have now subsequently taken more pricing. We will be taking more pricing in developing part of the world as we move through the balance of the year. And we are also looking at obviously accelerated pricing, particularly through re-launches in the developed part of the world as we move through the back half.\nOperator: We will go to our next question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Noel, I think we covered a lot of this. I wanted to kind of pick up on Lauren\u2019s question and some others. Just the degree of the downward revision of your outlook versus peers and even more broadly staples, so everyone can appreciate how challenging the environment is. It\u2019s not lost in anyone for a moment. But it\u2019s difficult for everyone, right, at the same time. So, without being redundant because we spend a lot of time on the cost headwinds and supply chain issues. But what do you feel like is materially different about your business, product categories, commodity basket, the speed or scope with which you can move on pricing, supply chain, scope of productivity savings, controls around FP&A, your stance on conservatism in guidance. As you look at that relative to the peers, which I know you guys are following closely, what do you think is very unique about your business that\u2019s causing a sharper downward revision than we have seen elsewhere? Thanks for that.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks Kevin. Listen, I think we stated it upfront. What is uniquely different for us right now is obviously the significant move we have seen in fats and oils. And that is a significant part of our cost structure of our business in addition to things that have moved up quite significantly, that historically have been quite benign relative to our cost of goods, things like glycerin, which have doubled in pricing. So, fats and oils is the big driver here. We are assuming that those costs will stay at the current levels and slightly increase through the balance of the year. I don\u2019t know how others have assumed that. As a result, we have seen \u2013 we have taken oil more or less at current levels with a slight increase through the balance of the year. That may be a different assumption than others have taken. And we obviously have the logistics on cost given our short-term implications of our global supply chain, which we ultimately think as we move into 2023, will move behind us. So, that\u2019s predominantly the biggest difference. We have very strong brands that allow us to take pricing. You have seen that consistently year-in, year-out, our ability to take pricing, particularly in the developing part of the world, and we will continue to execute against that, but we will watch the consumer environment very carefully. We are maintaining our investments in the business. That\u2019s very important for us to continue to accelerate the top line growth. That\u2019s hence why we feel good about the 4% to 6% organic, given that we will be maintaining our investments in that piece. So, it\u2019s really that. Our logistics \u2013 our overhead structure, just to talk to that, we have the global productivity initiative, as you know, that we have launched. We are accelerating the savings in that through the back half of this year. Our operating costs or just our direct overheads were actually down in the quarter, which again, we will get the leverage from that as we move and accelerate sales through the back half of the year. But the biggest difference is we are assuming a continued \u2013 a very, very costly inflationary environment through the balance of the year. We don\u2019t see that changing at this point. I am not sure the assumptions that others have made or whether they made any assumptions at this stage, but we feel it\u2019s prudent for the business to create the visibility that you need that we are assuming, those costs will continue to be at current levels or slightly above.\nOperator: Our last question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you for taking my follow-up. Just on the Brazil comment, I understand like, you mentioned Noel, that the pricing and there was some price elasticity. I was just hoping if you can touch, was it more on the personal care side or auto care, or what are your plans to kind of make it perhaps more competitive given that the currencies went to your favor, I think that\u2019s the good news there. Is there any ways of trying to defend the share \u2013 the volume share given that you probably took pricing more in dollar terms than you would appreciate at that point?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Listen, it\u2019s early days. We obviously took pricing very, very quickly, as I mentioned, we saw volumes come off a little bit in the business. And it was quite frankly, more in the personal. Our market shares in toothpaste are actually up 20 basis points in Brazil. So, overall, we have seen again, coming back to the core strategy, we have re-launched our Sorriso business, which is performing very well in the market. We launched Colgate Total, which is performing well in the market, and you have heard us talk about MX. So, market mix, so market shares are actually up. We will see or we will watch that very closely, but we feel pretty good about where we are, but we have got pricing in the P&L. We anticipate that, obviously, competition will follow given our leadership position in the marketplace, but that will be up for them to decide. But we feel good about where we are. And the volumes, historically, when we have taken pricing at these levels are more or less consistent in terms of the falloff that we would have expected.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Noel, I will turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nNoel Wallace: No. Thanks everyone. Let me again extend my appreciation to all Colgate people. Let me specifically call out our employees in the Ukraine, who our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we continue to support you and your health and your safety with all the possible opportunities that we can provide you. Thanks everyone. We will talk soon.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning to all of you. Given the release of the prepared commentary earlier this morning, I will keep my remarks fairly short as I am certain you have a number of questions. Obviously, 2022 is shaping up as a more difficult year than we anticipated with greater-than-expected increases in raw materials as you have seen from others, particularly fats and oils and logistics. This is offsetting what we think will be a very solid year for organic sales growth now that we are seeing our global supply chain stabilize following COVID-related lockdowns and stress in logistic networks around the world [Technical Difficulty] sales growth for the balance of the year. First off, we knew that Q1 will be the most difficult quarter given comparisons, supply chain issues and pricing negotiations. We exited the quarter with high single-digit pricing as we took more pricing in developed markets starting in February and continuing into April. We believe this is more indicative of the pricing we will see for the balance of the year. Elasticity seemed to be either in line or better than expectations and this should help limit incremental volume weakness from the higher pricing over the balance of the year. Encouragingly, as we said in our prepared remarks, volume and organic sales performance improved in February and March versus January and organic sales growth has continued to accelerate in April. Importantly, we are beginning to see the benefits of the stabilization in our global supply chain network with the impacts of COVID-related factory closures behind us and the opening of the global logistic capacities. Our guidance does not assume further COVID-related lockdowns in the balance of the year that would impact our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. Our U.S. on-shelf availability for toothpaste has been below normal for several months as we dealt with the same supply chain challenges you have heard about from other companies. By tapping into our global supply chain, we were able to restore shipments and our availability is now back to normal levels, which you are seeing reflected in better market share performance in toothpaste. And with the improved share performance in manual toothbrushes in the U.S., where our share is up 4.5 points year-to-date, we feel better about the trajectory of U.S. oral care. Combined with increased advertising through the balance of the year, significant innovation, particularly around whitening in the U.S. and in Asia and the relaunch of two important core brands, our Hawley & Hazel brand in China and the Hill's Prescription Diet business, we feel confident in our forecast for an acceleration in organic sales growth for the balance of the year. This gets us to our new guidance of 4% to 6% organic sales growth. Tempering this outlook obviously is the difficult cost environment. Our entire cost factor has risen over the past few months, but the biggest impact has come in the area that we call fats and oils. That's palm oil, palm krona oil, soybean oil, tallow and others. This has historically been our second biggest area of raw material spend behind coal new resins. Although given the inflation we are seeing this year, our spending in the second half on fats and oils will equal our spending on resins. These ingredients are used in every category we compete in and we expect a more than 60% increase across fats and oils this year. And while you know our global supply chain is a strategic advantage, the global nature of our supply chain is adding to costs in the current environment. Freight rates from Mexico to the U.S. are up 30% year-over-year and ocean freights have basically doubled. We continued to take significant steps to offset these headwinds. We are taking additional pricing and we are launching premium innovation. We established our 2022 global productivity initiative to drive further cost savings for this year and next year while accelerating our Funding the Growth initiatives. We have reduced our overhead ex-logistics spending by $30 million in the quarter versus the first quarter last year already. So, as we open it up for your questions, we know we need to execute on during the balance of the year and we are very focused against that. While we know our guidance is below our previous expectations, we believe that our cost forecasts are prudent and that our plans are well thought through and well supported to deliver on our organic sales growth guidance, while leaving us well positioned as we look to return to profitable growth. Thanks. And I will be happy to take your questions now. Sure. Thanks, Dara. Let me start a little bit about the pricing comment, because I think it's obviously core to how we are thinking about the balance of the year. As you know, we took pricing in at least the developed markets a little late in the quarter. As we had talked about in the fourth quarter, we have planned to take pricing in February, March and April and that's exactly what happened. So, we didn't get the benefits of the pricing in the first quarter P&L, largely in North America as well as Europe, while we were able to get significant pricing across the developing part of the world, it was North America and Europe, which lagged a little bit in the quarter. As we exited the quarter, we saw high single-digit pricing being executed, particularly in the March month and obviously, that has continued to transpire as we look at the strong sales that we are seeing in April. We have likewise continued to accelerate pricing in the developing part of the world in the year to go. So, a combination of what we are doing in the developed world and the execution of those prices, which was lagged a little bit, particularly in Europe as we were going through some longer negotiations than we anticipated as we entered the quarter \u2013 and we have consequently taken more pricing in the rest of the world, we feel very good about where we are for pricing and March being more indicative of the type of pricing that you will see in the balance of the year. So, so far so good, particularly around elasticities, volumes are more or less in line with where we thought. But it's early days on elasticity. We will see how that unfolds in the balance of the year. But we obviously have, we believe a very strong innovation plan, very strong promotional plan as well. So, on pricing, which I think is core to our guidance, we feel pretty good based on what we have seen in March, as I said, where we see it in April and more importantly, the plans that we have put in place for the balance of the year. Strategically, in terms of choices no big changes there. I mean, we have a really strong growth plans. We have talked about going into the year on premium innovation as well as core innovation. You heard a little bit of that in my comments, two significant launches on core innovation. That's our Hawley & Hazel business, which is the number one brand in China that is a complete portfolio change across the entire business. That was obviously some of the softness we saw in volume in the first quarter was driven by the fact that we were transitioning into an entirely new bundle across the entire portfolio. And likewise, on our prescription diet business, which you know we have had great success on the science diet, we are now taking a lot of those learnings into improved nutrition, improved packaging and conceptual execution on the Prescription Diet business, which is at a premium price. I would also say that on some of our other core businesses around the world, particularly given the pricing environment that we are faced with, we are now in a much better place to execute re-launches given we have more \u2013 a better line of sight on our supply chain issues that we were faced with. That was obviously taking time away from putting new products in the market \u2013 so strategically, when we start thinking about how that lays out for this year and next, we will get back to a lot of those core re-launches, which will allow us to take pricing obviously bolster volume and value at the same time. So that's kind of where we are strategically, making the right choices, we think about getting pricing in the market, making sure we execute against our very strong innovation plan and protect the core businesses, which will be very, very important as we move into a potential recessionary environment. Sure. So, let me deconstruct a little bit of Q1. January was a little softer than we anticipated. As I mentioned, we obviously saw a little softness in Europe given some of the delayed pricing negotiations. We saw little softness in our Hawley & Hazel business as we mentioned, that's really transitory as we are moving from the old bundle to a new bundle. We saw little softness in our French business and we saw a little softness in the rural areas in India. So that led to a somewhat soft January. Sequentially, we saw all that improve in February and March, both volumes improved February, March versus January. And as I mentioned, we had strong pricing starting to get executed early March and towards the end of the month and into April. So, we feel quite good about where we ended the quarter. And as I mentioned, we have seen that translate into a strong April as well. So, that's kind of how we have set up the guidance for the year. So, 4% in the first quarter, we believe will be the low end of organic for the year and that will sequentially grow as we move more pricing into the P&L as well as continue to innovate and provide some volume enhancements as we move through the balance of the year. I will say that again, getting the supply chain constraints behind us from a ball point, yes, it cost us money relative to doing some of the things that we did to get more toothpaste on the shelf to get more toothbrushes in the market. We have seen that translate into more volume in the business as a result as well. And that's a good thing because we are seeing it translate into consumption and category growth for our retailers. So from an organic standpoint, you will see it sequentially grow through the quarters, particularly as we execute more pricing in the second quarter. And as I mentioned, we have now looked to take more pricing in the back half as we will see the peak in raw materials come through later in the year. Relative to the pricing aspect, I think not much more to add there. We have taken \u2013 we took strong pricing in developing part of the world. You see our 2-year stack on pricing at roughly 10%. And there is more pricing to come. And you will see pricing as a percentage of our organic growth likely accelerate certainly in the second and third quarters. And we will see where we end up in what situation we are in, in the fourth quarter, but pricing will accelerate. That's a combination of a couple of things. Obviously, the revenue management initiatives that we have been taking \u2013 we are getting more premium innovation and I won't get into some of the success we are having behind the Optic White Pro Series, which is our most premium-priced whitening bundle that's doing quite well out of the box. We are obviously, as I mentioned earlier, importantly using our supply chain now to get core re-launches executed quicker, which will give us a pricing opportunity as well. So, those would be the three key initiatives relative to getting pricing up in the back half. Sure. Thanks, Andrea. Good morning. Let me talk a little bit about home care. So again, a little bit of the constraints that we had with contractors and the implications of certainly the COVID-related issues that have challenged a lot of the contract manufacturing in the U.S. that certainly plagued us a bit on some of our home care, particularly our dish liquid business. And we have specifically addressed that and starting to see the improvements of that as we move through the balance of the first quarter and as we moved into April as well. So, we see home care from a volume standpoint starting to come back nicely. We are taking pricing on some of that home care business in the second quarter as well. And so that will obviously translate into improved performance. Overall, the cleaner business is solid. The fabric softener business is quite solid from a share standpoint, a little softness in dish liquid and we have plans on particularly the Palmolive and Ajax business in the U.S. from a combination of both pricing and some new product initiatives to hopefully bolster that business as we move through the back half. On elasticities, again, it's really early days here. And I think you have seen it consistently across most of the sector. Everyone is assuming that elasticities will be better than historical numbers. Why? It's because everyone is consistently taking up pricing \u2013 so therefore, everything is going to be up and we are everyday or products that consumers use everyday. And so, as a result of that aspect, I think you will see a little bit less and less elasticities than we have seen in the past and that's what we have seen so far. But again, there is a couple of factors to take into consideration. There will be significant inflation across the entire consumer segment and we will be watching that very closely. But if you go back historically, our franchise and our portfolio positioning plays well in inflationary environments, because we have big core businesses, widespread distribution and we compete across multiple price points. But we know that we can continue to grow the premium segment of the market, which is where we under-index, high indexes in the core business, but we are going to take ambitious plans on our core business to bring value to the category and to our retailers. So we feel pretty good about where the elasticities will ultimately end up here just because we've experienced it before. We've got good innovation going into the market. And as I said, kind of all ships are rising in this case to the categories are all taking pricing across the board. We can, Wendy. Yes. If you go back to \u2013 I believe you're probably looking at \u201808, \u201809, and that was at least the beginning of the naturals boom, as you remembered. And as we have openly stated, we made in our view, some strategic errors in how we chase the naturals rather than staying true to the core business. So I think that was the biggest driver. And certainly, at that point in time, when the Hill's business was nowhere near as salient and had nowhere close to the momentum that it has today, and we're certainly on our front foot and continue to think about that business in terms of investment. You heard today that we closed the Nutriamo contract manufacturing facility that we bought in Italy. That is going to unlock more wet capacity for us, which is one of the fastest-growing segments, particularly in Europe, which is exciting. We're relaunching the Prescription Diet business going into the back half of this year, which is obviously about half of our business, which we think is going to be an exciting innovation for particularly our veterinarian professionals. So the business is in a much different place today than it was back in \u201808, \u201809. Obviously, much more on us on it. We're going to maintain the investment spend there, which we think is critically important. Again, this is a business that has low penetration and low share, so a lot of upside in North America and capacity constrained today, hence the reason of why the purchase of Nutriamo. So again, we think we're in a much different place than we were in \u201808, \u201809. The brand itself is significantly stronger than it's been in the past. Yes. Thanks, Olivia. Great to hear from you. Let me just talk conceptually on the EPS, and then I'll have Stan jump in and give you a little bit more a bridge in terms of how we're thinking about it. But fundamentally, listen, this comes down to the extraordinary acceleration that we saw in our raw materials post the January guidance, which as you've heard, is around $0.5 billion. So just add on its own is driving, obviously, the significant change in EPS, combined with the fact that our logistics have continued to accelerate. Part of that, we will work out of as we move through potentially the back half of the year with improved manufacturing and supply chain, which is obviously important for us to get that product on the shelf, as I mentioned, which is we're doing at a higher cost, but we anticipate logistics will stay high. Ocean rates, we are keeping ocean rates at where they are today for the balance of the year. And obviously, some of the transit rates that we're seeing, particularly out of Mexico, which are up about 30% versus the year ago period, we're assuming that will maintain itself as well. So, raw materials, largely driven by fast and oils, I will get Stan. Why don't I have Stan open that up a little bit for you. And then I'll come back and we will talk about the international markets and pricing. So let me come back to what we're seeing on local brands and certainly private label to a certain extent as an extension of that. I would just return for some travel around Asia. We're certainly seeing some of the local brands take pricing there. And likewise, I think we're going to see private label follow very quickly. Obviously, these increases impact them, and their cost of goods are obviously materially higher than ours. So we will watch that carefully. We don't have a lot of categories that index highly with private label. Obviously, oral care very low single digits. The two categories that we need to watch carefully are liquid hands open toothbrushes. But so far, we have not seen a significant erosion or migration to private label and so [Technical Difficulty] as we see the environment unfold over the next few months. Sure. Thanks, Steve. Listen, the supply chain, as we talked about throughout 2021 has been really choppy with a lot of second and third derivative impacts of all the implications related to COVID. But if you take specifically the impacts to us, where you really feel it is on shelf availability. And we have historically been best-in-class in that regard across our categories and some of the setbacks we saw from COVID lockdowns in China where we saw some of the challenges we've seen in logistics coming out of Mexico, raw material suppliers as well, having shortfalls that caused a lot of choppiness in our supply chain throughout 2021 and certainly accelerated a bit as we went into the first \u2013 out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. The good news is, as we finished off in the back half of February and into March, we saw a lot of those issues structurally get much, much better for us as a company. Our on-shelf availability, which should dip way below norms, was now back right at top of class. And you see that directly in our point-of-sale data in some of those customers where we actually now are measuring detailed on-shelf availability at the daily and weekly basis that allows us to react very, very quickly. We have taken decisions through 2021 and in the first quarter, to ensure that we have sufficient inventory to compensate some of those \u2013 the shortfalls that we we're seeing and the uncertainty that we had from various contractors or raw material suppliers. That has cost us some money but we feel in the end is now given the trade, obviously, far more \u2013 a clear line of sight in terms of our ability to source an increasing demand, particularly behind our toothpaste and toothbrush business here in the first quarter. So on-shelf ability significantly improved as we exited the quarter and has maintained itself as we went into April, that has translated into better market share performance. Take the U.S. in the last 5 weeks, we were up or flat in seven out of 11 categories, which is a marked improvement versus where we had been in the past. Some of the issues likewise translated into the European business where we saw some shortfalls in terms of service levels there, that now has been addressed through some decisions that we have taken, and we're seeing likewise, as we exited the quarter a little bit better volume. So all in all, across the board, \u2013 most of those issues now are behind us, particularly the lockdown issues that really had a significant impact on part of our business. And I give credit to the supply chain for doing a tremendous amount of agility work that I think is only going to set us up for stronger resilience moving forward as we see some of the uncertainty continue to unfold in certain parts of the world. China is actually a really good story from the sense of our CP China business was up high single digits in the quarter. Our CP China business, combined with Holly & Hazel, was up 650 basis points in market share in the online business, which is obviously the fastest-growing part of the China \u2013 the retail sector. Hawley & Hazel business was migrating, as I mentioned, Steve, to an entirely new portfolio and repositioning of the brand, including a brand name change that will incur \u2013 that was rolling out in the first quarter. As a result of the significant distribution scale of China, we were moving down inventories of old product distributors. We're obviously taking their inventories down in preparation for the excitement behind the relaunch. We've started to see a lot of that unfold in the back end of March and now into April, and we will see it ultimately, it will take a couple more months before we see full distribution of that new product across the China market. So overall, the China business looks quite strong for us. For the first time in many, many years, our overall China market shares in toothpaste, that's combined, Hawley & Hazel and Colgate are up. So it's been a long time since you've heard me say that, but I think that's a testament to some big strategic changes that we made in China. Now going back 2.5, 3 years, both in terms of portfolio strategy as well as go to market that we'd say is definitely paying dividends. And we will watch obviously the Hawley and Hazel relaunch carefully but quite excited about that thus far in terms of how we're seeing it hit the market. Sure. Listen, I mean, we expect, obviously, that we will not only hold but ultimately build share with this relaunch, Jason, that's the intent. I mean we have significant investment planned behind this relaunch. It is the number one brand in China, has incredible salience. We're putting in improved technology as well. We have an innovation stream that's coming behind this. Now there is no question there is always risk when you change a brand name, but all of the work that we've done thus far and what we've seen early days, that transition really started at the tail end of January, early February, the bulk of it starting to happen in March. And as I mentioned, will unfold more than likely over the next couple \u2013 2 to 3 months. We will know by the end of the second quarter, third quarter, where we are. We will get a good sense, particularly in the online world. As I mentioned, the vast majority \u2013 the fastest-growing channel is online in China. And we will get a read pretty quickly in how we are doing relative to our online business with Darlie in that market. But overall, this is a widely distributed product, very, very strong, obviously gets into C, D and E cities. So, it's widely distributed. It will take time to work through the old product, but we are starting to see some of the new product already on shelf in the modern trade, and so far, so good. But I would say, give us another quarter, the balance of this quarter to really assess how we are doing and come back to you with the point of view as we move into the third quarter. Sure. Lauren, let me just clarify. We have not had supply chain issues in Latin America. The supply chain issues and the volatility that we have seen has principally been driven by the North America complexities that we have incurred as well as some shortfalls from some of our raw material suppliers in the middle of the quarter in Europe, which created obviously some constraints there. So, specifically, it's been North America driven by some lockdown issues in China as well as some of the COVID-related issues we had in some of our facilities here in North America. So, as I mentioned, we feel very good about where we have now in March. Structurally, things have gotten much better, efficiencies in the plant, asset utilization, capacity output, all are moving in the right direction, which are good indications that we are moving to where we want to be. And as I mentioned, some of the service level challenges that we have had. And I think everyone has moved through, but we were somewhat exacerbated by those in terms of our ability to get what we needed into some of our key customers are now back to historical high levels. So, good news there, no issue, Latin America. On Europe, specifically had dealt with a some raw material shortages that came from some of our suppliers mid-quarter. So, that was after we discussed it, we set guidance in January, that particularly hit us in Europe, and that has now moved behind us and things are back to a much more normalized level. We see that, quite frankly, all around the world. I mean if you look at a number of issues that we dealt with in 2021 and moving into the quarter this year with raw material suppliers or contractors, those seem to have subsided. Let's watch it carefully because anything can happen in the current world, given the uncertainty that everyone is faced with. But we have put a lot more resilience into the system now to deal with some of the unforeseen circumstances that we are seeing. Listen, in terms of visibility, Lauren, we were \u2013 we came out of last year understanding that we were faced with $750 million of incremental cost and we had the pricing in place to deal with that. And the gross margins came in more or less in line, actually just slightly below where we expected, a little bit above guidance to the Street in the first quarter. And then we got hit with the significant incremental increases to the tune of $0.5 billion post the January call, which came in mid-Feb and into March. So, that's been the single biggest issue in terms of visibility for us. We did not anticipate those. We had cost becoming more benign in the back half initially when we set guidance, obviously, with the war, all of that change. So, the visibility for us became dramatically different as we exited the quarter and hence the change in our guidance that we have communicated today. But no, nothing relative to LatAm for themselves, they have been able to obviously continue to do what they need to do. But as you know, we source quite a bit of product out of Latin America. The costs have gone up, but we don't have anything that we would consider significant there. Sure. Okay. Let me address the supply chain first. Toothbrushes, first and foremost, is a global supply chain we source predominantly out of Asia as well as some sourcing out of Latin America. Obviously, given the lockdowns that we saw in Asia in 2021 and subsequently having an impact in the first quarter that impacted most of our global toothbrush business around the world, more acutely here in the U.S., where we have taken decisions in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, to ensure that we accelerated migration of those toothbrushes when supply came back online, back into refill inventories and improve on-shelf ability. So, we had issues there, particularly for North America, where we are having to bring product in expediently in order to fulfill demand. That impacted some of our sourcing \u2013 some of our toothbrush business likewise in Latin America, likewise in Europe, but it was more acutely faced by the North America business, and we addressed that. Our toothpaste business historically has been a balance of a global supply chain that works very, very efficiently. Given some of the challenges that we had in the North America, we were bringing more product out of Mexico, they were fulfilling increased demand for our product. It came into additional costs. Obviously, as we talked about earlier, that freight rates out of Mexico increased. We did have some delays getting product across the border at times, but that was not a function of our problem. It was a function of what was happening systemically across the marketplace. So, our toothpaste supply chain is global. It has been a competitive advantage for us for years and years. We are able to now transfer products from one market to another quite consistently and quite efficiently. But as you have delays in one market or supplier implications in one market, it obviously creates a little bit of a bottleneck for you. We have taken decisions to ensure that we are having locations that are efficiently sourcing local markets where needed. And I think today, we are in a much better position than we have been in the past related to dealing with the uncertainty of the supply chain network that exists in the world that we live in today. So, overall, we think we are in a good place. On volumes for Latin America, listen, the only real shortfall in volumes for us in Latin America was Brazil. We took high-double digit pricing, 15% pricing in that market. We saw volumes come off a little bit, which historically has been consistent with where we have seen. We have taken significant pricing. Mexico had positive pricing, positive volumes across the board. So, I would really attribute it to some of the softness we saw in Brazil, because the rest of the business is okay, and we will see how Brazil unfolds. But this is quite consistent with what we have seen in the past when we have taken significant pricing. Yes. What happened in the first quarter, obviously, as we saw a little bit of delays in our pricing execution in Europe, which I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, given some of the annual negotiations and ultimately how those unfolded. The good news is those are behind us as we exited the quarter, and we will see that pricing fully reflected as we move into the second quarter. We were a little late in the U.S. arguably, I think in terms of how we sell things, but we did lead pricing in our core business ahead of competition. We have seen competition ultimately follow, but we did lead in the U.S. So, we felt like we got to have it pretty quickly, but obviously, the costs moved a little bit beyond what we expected. So, coming back to gross margin, we were kind of more in line with what we thought. We thought we would see most of the pricing come through in the back half of the quarter, which would obviously deliver accelerated sequential gross margin through the balance of the year. That was the initial assumption. But obviously, all things changed when the February-March \u2013 mid-February, March cost increases came through. We have now subsequently taken more pricing. We will be taking more pricing in developing part of the world as we move through the balance of the year. And we are also looking at obviously accelerated pricing, particularly through re-launches in the developed part of the world as we move through the back half. Sure. Thanks Kevin. Listen, I think we stated it upfront. What is uniquely different for us right now is obviously the significant move we have seen in fats and oils. And that is a significant part of our cost structure of our business in addition to things that have moved up quite significantly, that historically have been quite benign relative to our cost of goods, things like glycerin, which have doubled in pricing. So, fats and oils is the big driver here. We are assuming that those costs will stay at the current levels and slightly increase through the balance of the year. I don't know how others have assumed that. As a result, we have seen \u2013 we have taken oil more or less at current levels with a slight increase through the balance of the year. That may be a different assumption than others have taken. And we obviously have the logistics on cost given our short-term implications of our global supply chain, which we ultimately think as we move into 2023, will move behind us. So, that's predominantly the biggest difference. We have very strong brands that allow us to take pricing. You have seen that consistently year-in, year-out, our ability to take pricing, particularly in the developing part of the world, and we will continue to execute against that, but we will watch the consumer environment very carefully. We are maintaining our investments in the business. That's very important for us to continue to accelerate the top line growth. That's hence why we feel good about the 4% to 6% organic, given that we will be maintaining our investments in that piece. So, it's really that. Our logistics \u2013 our overhead structure, just to talk to that, we have the global productivity initiative, as you know, that we have launched. We are accelerating the savings in that through the back half of this year. Our operating costs or just our direct overheads were actually down in the quarter, which again, we will get the leverage from that as we move and accelerate sales through the back half of the year. But the biggest difference is we are assuming a continued \u2013 a very, very costly inflationary environment through the balance of the year. We don't see that changing at this point. I am not sure the assumptions that others have made or whether they made any assumptions at this stage, but we feel it's prudent for the business to create the visibility that you need that we are assuming, those costs will continue to be at current levels or slightly above. Sure. Listen, it's early days. We obviously took pricing very, very quickly, as I mentioned, we saw volumes come off a little bit in the business. And it was quite frankly, more in the personal. Our market shares in toothpaste are actually up 20 basis points in Brazil. So, overall, we have seen again, coming back to the core strategy, we have re-launched our Sorriso business, which is performing very well in the market. We launched Colgate Total, which is performing well in the market, and you have heard us talk about MX. So, market mix, so market shares are actually up. We will see or we will watch that very closely, but we feel pretty good about where we are, but we have got pricing in the P&L. We anticipate that, obviously, competition will follow given our leadership position in the marketplace, but that will be up for them to decide. But we feel good about where we are. And the volumes, historically, when we have taken pricing at these levels are more or less consistent in terms of the falloff that we would have expected. No. Thanks everyone. Let me again extend my appreciation to all Colgate people. Let me specifically call out our employees in the Ukraine, who our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we continue to support you and your health and your safety with all the possible opportunities that we can provide you. Thanks everyone. We will talk soon."

            "name": "Stan Sutula",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Noel. So as we entered the year, we knew the commodity costs were going to be up year-on-year, and we planned for that. In January, we entered the year, we saw in the market. We expected that material cost would moderate as we went through the year. At that time, in January, we anticipated roughly $750 million or 13% and year-to-year increase. But as we stated in January, if the commodity costs don't moderate, that would represent a headwind. So what's happened? Since January, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we've seen significant movement in those commodity costs. And now we see an incremental $500 million of cost for the year. What that means is that material costs will be up over 20% for the full year on a year-on-year basis. So we put some context a little bit underneath what's happening in those commodities. Natural gas is up over 60%. And natural gas is used to power many of our plants and importantly, many of our suppliers' plants, which puts pressure on their costs and timing. Soybean and corn are up by over third; palms, up 25% and increasing. So as we said earlier, what that means for the year, fats and oils, including palm will be up over 60% year-to-year and doubled since 2020. Resins are up over 20%. And these two categories combined fats and oils and resins make up a significant portion of the material spend and on a combined basis are up nearly 40%. Take glycerin, another important material, and that's more than doubled year-to-year. So as we've looked at logistics, we saw similar cost inflation. And since we've seen that increase, we've over $150 million since our expectations in January, that translates to logistics being up nearly 20% for the full year. And some of this increase is because we prioritize meeting clients' needs. We talked briefly about this, our decision to prioritize toothbrush shipments given client demand and market opportunity, particularly in North America, we grew that category double digits and gained over 450 points of share. Now I think importantly, Noel talked about this would represent over a 20% increase to our cost over $1.2 billion. But what are we doing to tackle that and mitigate some of that significant escalation? On materials, we're leveraging alternate materials, we're viable, reformulating where that makes sense, taking price to reflect the cost increase. We've talked about price significantly here. And then, things like leveraging analytics to enhance our procurement process and driving our robust Funding the Growth program to help mitigate that profit impact. On logistics, we are taking a number of actions. As our supply chain stabilizes from things like COVID-impact and material shortages, we're going to streamline our logistics use less expedited transport. Now temporarily, we're carrying more finished goods inventory due to erratic and longer transit times. We're also making things like investments in automating our warehouses. So while these remain volatile, we're being aggressive to tackle those. So from a P&L point of view, as you translate that down to EPS, those are going to be a headwind for us for the year. We're taking aggressive pricing, aggressive funding the growth and productivity actions but we're still expecting margin will contract for the year. And we are going to maintain investment in advertising. We believe that that's an important component of our long-term model, and that's why we've taken that our organic growth up to the 4% to 6% range. Take that down, we will continue to drive improvements in overhead. And stripping logistics, our overhead improved on a year-on-year basis. And the team has done a very good job of managing that prudently, but that's what yields us down to a EPS when you take into the effects the multiple interest rate hikes, a headwind on tax, that drives the EPS here down on a year-on-year basis to mid-single digits."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter in full year 2023 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q4 and full year 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q4 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q4 and full year results and our 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our strong finish to a very good year in 2023 and our positive outlook for 2024. Over the past two years, we've been particularly focused on sustaining our strong organic sales growth while rebuilding our margins and improving our cash flow performance. We delivered on all three of those goals this year while still investing behind advertising to strengthen our brands and building and scaling capabilities to deliver future growth. 2023 marked our fifth consecutive year of organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our 3% to 5% long-term target range. We delivered balanced organic sales growth, growth in all six divisions, all four of our categories, and with improved balance between pricing and volume as we exited the year. Volume rounded to flat in the fourth quarter and was up for the quarter, excluding the impact of lower private label volumes at Hill\u2019s. Our market share momentum is improving behind strong innovation, higher levels of brand investment with a focus on improving the effectiveness of each dollar spent. We're also seeing the benefits of our digital transformation as our efforts with data analytics continue to proceed. Our commitment to revenue growth management and the strength of our funding the growth efforts combined with our global productivity initiative drove gross margin expansion, double-digit-based business operating profit growth, and high single-digit based business EPS growth. We delivered these results while increasing the investment in marketing and strategic capabilities and absorbing the headwinds from higher interest expense, pension and tax. We drove greater than 60% free cash flow growth, allowing us to invest behind our brands, increase capacity and buy back stock. We also increased our dividend for the 61st consecutive year. I am deeply proud of the results Colgate people have delivered in a challenging operating environment. 2024 will offer many of the same challenges as 2023, geopolitical unrest, foreign exchange headwinds and a challenged consumer, continued softness in China, and a large number of political elections around the world. We enter 2024 with strong momentum and the plans in place to deliver in this environment, as well as greater flexibility in both our income statement and our balance sheet. As we have mentioned over the past few quarters, we're focused on returning to consistent, compounded EPS growth, and our 2024 guidance reflects this ambition. We will continue to invest to drive high-quality, balanced organic sales growth and with both volume and pricing growing. We plan to deliver our productivity to fund this incremental investment while growing earnings per share. This should enable us to deliver strong cashflow growth to invest back in the business and return cash to shareholders. I look forward to discussing our 2024 plans in further detail at CAGNY next month, so you can share the confidence the Colgate-Palmolive team has in our continued growth. And with that, I'll take your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys. So just wanted to focus on market share results in Q4 and as you look ahead, oral care share was obviously strong again and you delivered healthy expansion for the full year. Can you just talk about your forward positioning on the share front in oral care? You've got a tougher comparison here. So how do you think about the sustainability of those share gains as you look out to 2024? And then a similar question on pet. Obviously some industry pressure points, can you sort of juxtapose your market share relative to those industry pressure points and if the unlocked capacity is a significant driver of market share opportunity in the longer term in that business? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Great. Good morning, Dara. Thank you. So let me start a little bit broader on the categories, particularly oral care. We're really encouraged to see the inflection of positive volume growth in the categories around the world. And in many of the regions where we had seen negative volume growth, we started to see an inflection of that towards the end of the fourth quarter in the category. So that gives us great confidence that the category and the pricing that we put in place is continuing to turn. And importantly, we're going to see that growth continue in 2024. As you bring that back to our business, a really strong quarter for oral care, as you mentioned, both from a organic and sales standpoint, but likewise, as that transferred into better market share growth. If I take oral care in general, we were up double digits in the quarter. That translated into strong market share growth, particularly in regions like Latin America, Europe, Africa, Eurasia, and you saw some improved scanner data in the US as well. I think this is a reflection of the core business strategy that we have in place, the increased advertising that we're putting behind the business, as well as a strong innovation pipeline that continued in the back half of 2023 and will continue in 2024 as well. So market share is around the world strong and we would anticipate that, that will see continued growth as we move through the balance of 2024. And I would caveat with some of that, obviously the markets will be challenged given some of the upfront issues I mentioned, but pleasing to see the strong volume growth in some of our bigger regions. If you take Latin America, particularly three strong quarters of strong volume growth, very much driven by oral care, but quite frankly, that was a cross section of all of our categories, and you see that volume improving across all of our divisions. So again, I think we're well positioned on that. Let me talk a little bit about pet, because I think there's some important context to our strategy and why what we're doing is different for the market and what we're doing is working for the marketplace as well. We talked about Colgate being the most penetrated brand in the world. We also know that Hill\u2019s is low penetration, so we will continue to execute a series of differentiated strategies on Hill\u2019s in order to continue to accelerate our growth on that business. So, if I take the three aspects that we think about for Hill\u2019s, reach, awareness, and conversion, reach obviously is a reflection of the strong advertising that we're putting in place to get the message out. With low single digit penetration on Hill\u2019s, we want to ensure the awareness of our superior science is well understood, hence the strategy to drive more TV spending, more digital spending consistently through the quarters. We're spending a lot of time on the effectiveness of that reach to ensure that we're getting the awareness of it. We're using obviously a strong professional endorsement that we have behind vets and continue to accelerate our science and our clinical communication with that key opinion [really] (ph) is critical to the success of the brand. And importantly, as we think about conversion, a lot of non-users in the category, as I mentioned I think on the third quarter call, 5% of consumers are using a therapeutic nutrition, but theoretically 80% should be using a therapeutic nutrition. So a lot of opportunity to continue to drive share. The dynamics in the category, hence you're seeing a little bit of trade down from wet into dry. I mentioned that on the third quarter call, treats have suffered. Now we're not immune to the category softness, but if you take a step back and look at our principal retail environments, pet specialty, neighborhood pet, we're growing share nicely across all of those environments, which means we're helping our retail partners grow category dollars. Penetration was up roughly 10% in the US, our biggest and largest market, so we're very pleased with the progress we have there. Yes, the category is a little softer, but we have the right strategies and differentiated strategies in place to continue to accelerate growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone. Maybe this question both for Noel and Stan, just related to Argentina. I think there was maybe a write-down that ran through the other expense line. So if you could give us a little bit more color on that and how much of that may recur and maybe, Noel, just kind of stepping back, I think this week we've heard from a several other companies who maybe even rethinking how they approach Argentina given the devaluation. It's been a while right since we've had this kind of currency crisis in Latin America. So, I don't know, just your perspective, both short-term, how we should be thinking about it from a accounting perspective, Stan? And then, Noel, just how you're thinking about Argentina maybe longer term?\nNoel Wallace: Okay, great. Bryan, good morning and thank you. Let me talk again a little bit of history in Argentina. And I apologize to go down with an extended answer, but I think it's important for the audience to understand how we operate in these hyperinflationary environments. We've been in Argentina close to 100 years. We have an extraordinarily capable management team that understands hyperinflationary counting, understands how to manage the income statement and the balance sheet, understands how to prevent further devaluations on the balance sheet as we move forward. And that's a reflection of just years and years of experience dealing with this level of volatility. We can go back to 2001, 2002, which I think was the last major devaluation in the country. 2014 had one as well. So we're very accustomed to ensuring we're doing everything to manage the potential volatility in a market like Argentina, and that experience has certainly played out. We have always, always continued to invest for the long term in Argentina. We have manufacturing on the ground. We have good relationships in terms of our ability to access dollars. But importantly, given some of the limitations that we've seen over the years on the ability to access dollars, we now have flexibility in the business to import product into the country as well. So we're very attuned to the volatility. I would say on the flip side, good news that price controls seem to have been settled a bit, and we're not going to see as much of those moving forward. So we continue to operate in an environment where we can bring value to the consumer and take pricing in order to offset some of the significant transaction. Now, we're not immune to the devaluation. We'll see that ultimately unfold as we go through the next couple quarters, more on the margin line than the profit line, but ultimately we will make sure we get pricing in the market and that will take some time to flow through into the P&L. But overall, experienced team which I want to thank for their incredible diligence in how they do --they deal with the economic environment there and feel pretty good that we've got real control of what's going on in Argentina notwithstanding there will be continued volatility. So with that, let me give Stan a chance to talk a little bit about how we're managing more closely the income statement.\nStan Sutula: Thanks, Noel. And, Bryan, let me start and pick up where Noel left off on the team. So as an example, we have a gentleman that I work with, Jose Fernando and he is my CFO for Latin America. But, he was also the CFO or the Finance Director in Argentina in 2002. So we have a depth of experience and I think that manifests itself with a very proactive approach to market conditions. So he and I talk on a very regular basis about changing market conditions, and then more importantly the proactive nature of what we do about that. So they've operated in a hyperinflationary environment for a very long time. They take the actions necessary where we look at the long term. So while we operate hyperinflationary environment, we account for it appropriately. You do see the impact of the devaluation and other income other expense. It was not the majority of that line item. So there are other items in there but we dealt with that, we delivered our overall numbers, we improved our productivity, we delivered margin expansion, profit expansion and cash flow. So I think the team's done a very nice job looking at it proactively and dealing with it decisively. So you mentioned on a go forward basis, obviously when you [de-val] (ph), your balance sheet gets smaller. We'll continue to take those actions going forward. We have a growing business there. So, going forward, I would not anticipate a major impact to our results from Argentina.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you [indiscernible] and good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you can talk, Noel, a little bit more about marketing investments. And you elaborated just recently that you mentioned increased [marked] (ph) advertising. And are you also seeing a normalizing promotional environment in the past? You had said that you dialed down and you're reinvesting in promotional capabilities in the US. Can you comment on how you stand right now and how the category promotional levels are? And separately, if you can talk a bit about the supply chain changes that you implemented with the new leadership and also how your position in light of the disruptions in the Middle East and the learnings from the pandemic? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Great. Thanks and good morning, Andrea. So let me take the advertising and promotional piece, and I'll come back and add a little bit of context on some of the great work that Luciano has done as he's come into the new role. The strategy has been quite consistent for the last three to four years about our ability to build brands through great communication and great innovation. And you've seen that obviously flow through the P&L. And despite the fact that we have obviously grown and accelerated advertising meaningfully over the last couple of years. We've continued to deliver against our guidance and exceed our operating profit objectives, which is terrific. Well, that just gives you a sense for the health of the P&L today and our ability to continue to fund investment going forward, and that will clearly be our strategy. Now, likewise, it gives us flexibility to be very focused on the efficiency of that spend. And I can assure you there's not a discussion that goes by where we don't talk about reach and frequency, and the ROI associated with our spend, both at the digital level and the linear TV level. So we're very, very, very focused on the ability to drive more efficiency through the P&L as we accelerate our advertising. And as we said in the prepared comments, we anticipate to continue to accelerate the advertising into 2024. Promotional environment is very constructive right now. I would say it's about 75% to 80% of the pre-COVID levels. So it's come down. It's more moderated. We -- as I've mentioned, in second and third quarter calls, that we will be very selective on increasing the cadence of our promotions in some of the geographies where we may have taken a little bit too much pricing as we led in some of those markets. That will be prudent and thoughtful and focused in certain select markets. But overall, the promotional environment seems very constructive. And our objective is to drive category and healthy volume growth through obviously the accelerated advertising line. On the supply chain, Luciano has come in and really thinking about the continued transformation of that, bringing a lot of good ideas on automation and data analytics and driving network optimization. A lot of our focus over the last couple of years, particularly at Hill's, was increasing capacity, and you saw that through our capital expenditure line. That will moderate as we move forward with more spending being allocated towards efficiency and savings and optimizing the network and very much digitizing the supply chain and getting very aggressive on using data analytics to optimize our efficiency and our case field level. So overall, pleased with where he's taking the group and that team has done just an extraordinary job getting us ready for further optimization moving forward.\nStan Sutula: And, Andrea, I'll just pick up on your last comment around the issues out in the Red Sea and the shipping. So we've been also proactive on that, looking at alternate methods where available, planning for the lead time disruption. And the rest of the supply chain has remained stable, so we don't see issues there. But we have anticipated longer lead times than planned appropriately for 2024.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Noel, going back to Hill's, clearly, high single-digit top line growth, excluding the private label, discontinuation, very strong results in the quarter. As you think about '24, like, can you give us a sense of how you see the volume for that business evolving and also the pricing environment in pet food. And then at the margin line, you saw a pretty significant cost headwinds in 2023. Are you seeing any moderation on the cultural and protein side for the Hill's business? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Good morning, Filippo. Thank you. We see more balanced volume and price as we move into 2024. Obviously, we've had roughly six quarters of aggressive pricing, seven quarters where we've had to take pricing to offset a lot of the inflation that we've seen in agricultural products. To get to your second part of your question, we do see ag prices beginning to moderate, which is good, which over time, as we see the pricing settle out in the markets, we anticipate that volume will come back. But remember, this is the one category we compete in where we've seen prolonged inflation as we move through the back half of 2023. But we anticipate that will definitely moderate as we move into 2024, and pricing likewise will moderate, and we'll see a return to really continuing to drive that successful household penetration number that I shared with you earlier, which is obviously our ability to continue to support strong advertising. So overall, we'll see that more balanced growth as we move through 2024. And on the margin line, as I mentioned again, a more moderating cost. We're still lapping some of the strong inflationary environments that we had in the first half of last year. So that pricing that we've taken in the back half of this year and early in the quarter will stay, but we'll see the volumes start to come back as we move through the back half of the year more meaningfully.\nOperator: The next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nCallum Elliott: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Really good to see the big uptick in brand spending this year and the success it\u2019s having on competitive performance and growth. My question is, can you talk about some of the other investment buckets outside of advertising and brand spend? I'm thinking R&D, CapEx, some of the more infrastructure capability investments that sit in the P&L. Where are you guys today now versus where you think you need to be? And what's the relative importance of these non-brand spend buckets in your view? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah, Callum, thank you and good morning. A good question because we've talked a lot about positioning ourselves to win in the short term, but more importantly, succeed consistently in the long term. And that has been a lot around obviously the advertising investment. But as you well point out, investing in other areas, specifically capabilities, our digital transformation would be at the forefront of that, training and developing talent, bringing in talent, ensuring that we're optimizing our agency and the talent that they have on that side. So that's an important part of ultimately building the capabilities to continue to drive the effectiveness of our spend and ultimately setting ourselves up for better data architecture and the infrastructure required to do that and do it consistently over the long term. So a lot of investment going in that space as well. On the capital side, we've had, obviously, a lot of spending on the capital side in terms of increased capacity. As I mentioned earlier, we're going to see that start to shift to a lot more optimization and savings projects moving through our manufacturing facilities. As I mentioned earlier, setting up infrastructure for our data architecture and our data transformation. So overall, these are all investments for the long term that we think will continue to play out and allow us to drive that consistent earnings growth that we talked about earlier. Stan, anything to add to that?\nStan Sutula: Callum, the only thing I'd say is when you look at the face of the income statement or balance sheet, the absolute numbers, it doesn't reflect the one of our key jobs here is to allocate resources and we reallocate to those high-growth areas or the areas with the most potential. While that may not show on the absolute line, underneath the covers, that reallocation of resources, whether it's dollars or human capacity is what supports us in analytics and digital and data and S/4 HANA and to enhance all those capabilities. So lots of work under the covers to drive resource to those key areas.\nNoel Wallace: And I'd mentioned very indirectly tied to your question, is the strong cash flow, right? The cash flow is giving us the ability to have a lot more flexibility in how we invest across the business, and that is pleasingly up significantly as you saw in the quarter and the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about gross margin. It was obviously very strong in the quarter and you expect progress in '24. Maybe just some perspective on the work you've done to get here, the drivers this quarter. But then also, as we look at '24, I'm assuming from a year-over-year perspective, that expansion is heavily weighted to the first part of the year. But sequentially, how should we think about gross margin? Is the fourth quarter a high watermark? Or is there a sequential progress that can be made? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Let me top line, and I'll let Stan answer a couple of questions. Obviously, I think that pricing, I think cost, I think foreign exchange is obviously the big drivers in the cost line for us. So we've done a terrific job in delivering strong funding to growth. I think a lot of opportunities as we had the supply chain settling down, our ability to start ramping up a lot of the projects that were in many respects on the back burner during COVID. That has allowed us to drive strong funding to growth. We anticipate that that will continue as we move forward into 2024. The pricing has been a big part of the gross margin expansion that we've been very aggressive with over the last six quarters. Yes, pricing will be more balanced as we move forward. So you would anticipate that will be a lesser impact as we move through the gross profit and raw materials will continue to, I think, be inflationary, but far more benign than we've seen in the past and there's clearly a moderation there. So ultimately, hopefully, an opportunity for us. With that, let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more construct to that.\nStan Sutula: So first, we're very pleased with the progress on gross profit through 2023. We had sequential improvement across the categories driven by a broad base of innovation, productivity, that helped offset that commodity situation that we all had to deal with. Now as you think about going forward, coming off of Q4, there are a number of items that always impact the timing, Q4 to Q1. And this year, there's a couple of new ones with a little bit of Argentina, timing of some events worldwide, like Chinese New Year, the timing of when that occurs and where some of this price rolls through, roll through from 2023 and incremental new price. So as we go through the year, we expect that, that will expand, but not at the same kind of levels, obviously, as 2023. So working through that, the teams are focused on productivity. The balance of the top line will change from pricing being the predominant driver to pricing and volume and that productivity will help us drive the margin improvement as we go through the year.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. I would just simply underscore that there will be a sequential impact at the margin line on Argentina as we will take pricing in the quarter, but that will take a while to flow through to recover the transaction impact of the de-val.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to ask specifically about Latin America volume performance, up 8% this quarter, three straight quarters of growth. And I recognize that the comps are somewhat easy, but the growth is still really impressive. Can you maybe just unpack how much of that is a function of category growth versus share performance? And really, how does that inform your view on volume growth looking out to '24 in Latin America specifically? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks. We talked about it, I think, on the second and third call -- on third quarter call that the strength of our Latin America business and ultimately, our ability to lead in pricing and then the consistent history we have of seeing volume return to the categories. And so if I talk at the category level first, what's great is we've seen all three of the categories in which we compete, inflect positively from a category standpoint. And you've obviously seen us growing quite considerably on the volume side, the last three quarters, which is generating good volume share growth for our business. So we're very pleased with the overall performance there. And based on where we see the categories inflecting right now, we're pretty confident that we're going to continue to see balanced growth as we move forward. We'll have to take some currency pricing for sure through the year. But as we've indicated before, we would expect the volume to come back in these markets, and that's exactly what we're seeing. If you drill down to some of our biggest markets, particularly Brazil and Mexico, really strong quarter for both those markets with double-digit volume growth for Brazil and for -- and strong double-digit growth for Mexico as well. So again, a clear indication that the strategy of putting in strong innovation across all price points, getting the advertising, which we accelerated in the fourth quarter, likewise in Latin America, is helping to recover the categories and drive good volume market share in that business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNik Modi: Yeah. Thank you, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow up maybe on the raw material packaging inflation. Just some more perspective. You cited specialty products, I just wanted to get some context around that and what exactly some of those elements are.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Let me throw that one to Stan and he can give you a little bit more context there.\nStan Sutula: Sure. Unlike the prior two years, we don't expect a material impact here. So we see modest inflation in 2024 and there are some areas like every year that go up and down. But there are some new ones this year, things like fish oil has increased significantly. But overall, we expect modest inflation. And so while commodities overall are off of their highs, they're still elevated versus pre-COVID levels. And we expect that as we go through this, there might be a little bit of benefit moving in our favor, but not dramatically. And the only thing I'd say after that is raw materials are one component. So we deal with conversion costs, we deal with transport and logistics costs, and we drive productivity across all these areas through our Funding the Growth program, and that's why we're confident on margin expansion for 2024.\nNik Modi: Great. And Stan, if I could just follow up on Filippo's question. I think he was asking on proteins as it relates to Hill\u2019s. So you cited ag costs, but maybe just comment on protein? What you are seeing\u2026\nStan Sutula: Yeah. Pleasingly, at least at the current point in time, we're not seeing an impact to Hill's in total on an increased basis year-on-year. So we look in total around Hill\u2019s as ag has kind of stabilized here a bit as well as proteins, we don't see a big headwind heading into 2024 based on total for commodities for Hill's. And that's important, because as we drive productivity with modest levels of flow-through on price and the innovation, that will allow us to continue to expand margin on the Hill's portfolio.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hey, good morning. So I wanted to ask about productivity and maybe go down to the regional level. I think this was the best productivity in our model anyways, going back roughly 20 years. And so is there anything abnormal about this quarter, any pull forward of productivity? Or are we talking about maybe just productivity muscle continues to build here? And that this is something that we can think about being at a slightly higher run rate go forward? And then just connected to that, this was the best North America margin we've seen in some time. Was there any outsized productivity benefit in the quarter? Or are you just starting to see some easing costs and better efficiency relative to the stabilization we're seeing in the business? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Yeah, a little bit of all of that, quite frankly. Obviously, with the incredible inflation that we've seen over the last 1.5 years across the bulk of our commodity basket, we've had to obviously accelerate the funding the growth and the higher cost obviously have allowed us to generate higher funding the growth. As I mentioned earlier, a lot more efficiency in the plants and our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities to drive more of the funding the growth projects has likewise allowed us to step up a little bit of that funding the growth in 2023 that we historically had not had the time to do. So a bit of it will be symptomatic of the year and the opportunity. But I think the discipline that we've ingrained and the culture that we have ingrained at Colgate around funding the growth in parallel, likewise with the global productivity initiative that we put in place, has allowed us to generate obviously strong contraction in our costs overall. I wouldn't say use it as a benchmark for going forward. There will be a lot of moving parts to that, but we feel like structurally, we're in a better place on funding the growth. Structurally, we've managed to execute the GPI in line and slightly towards the high end of the guidance range that we provided earlier on that initiative. So we feel like we're in a good place. Pricing will moderate, so it's important that we continue to generate the strong funding the growth and through the P&L in order to generate the margin growth that Stan talked about.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you, good morning. First, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the top line, obviously, coming off a very impressive 7% top line growth in Q4. The guide for the fiscal year at sort of 3% to 5%. Can you just provide some perspective thinking about first half versus second half, perhaps the cadence of volume growth as the pricing contribution sort of begins to lap? And then similarly on EPS, obviously, a very strong '23 and Q4, talking about the mid- to high single digits. That, of course -- that range implies potential for growth deceleration in 2024. So just talk about what has to happen to get to the high and what you incorporate in terms of the low end and perhaps an incremental conservatism built into the guide? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, Olivia, and good morning. So as I said in my front comments, we believe we are well positioned to deliver consistent compounded earnings growth moving forward. And that's certainly reflected in our guidance in the range that we provided. We have a good strong momentum coming out of '23 and heading into '24. And I think most importantly, the flexibility in the P&L and the balance sheet has allowed us to set ourselves up for continued success. As we look at the cadence of that, we will see the balance overall change as we lap the higher pricing that we've had through the bulk of 2023, that will rebalance itself down to be sure and we'll see the volume come back in the categories. As I talked about earlier and ultimately, our focus on driving household penetration with the increased advertising and the market share position that we have. So we think we're in a good position. Comps will get tougher as you say, but we feel that we'll see the volume growth come back and will offer balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. Now recognize that we still have some inflationary markets, Argentina, we talked about, obviously, Nigeria and Turkey that will drive some pricing. We've got some flow through. Most of the pricing we'll see in 2024 will be pricing flow through. We are going to take a little bit of new pricing in certain select markets. But overall, we're going to see a much better balance, as I mentioned upfront. How that ultimately unfolds we shall see but we're definitely planning for more balanced growth as we move through the back half of this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKaumil Gajrawala: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Could you maybe just give us a kind of state of play in China, starting maybe with the market and then getting into new business specifically?\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thank you, Kaumil, and good morning. In China, you've heard it, I think, consistently throughout the earnings season so far that there's a real slowdown in China, and we're not immune to that slowdown. I will say with respect to some of the numbers out there, we feel we've performed very, very well across Greater China. Our business roughly down low to mid-single digits and that was very much commensurate with the category declines that we saw in those markets. Clearly, on the skin health side, we've seen a more acute decline in the categories and therefore, a bigger decline in our business as well. Long term, the market fundamentals remain intact. And I think it will take some time as we move through 2024 for those markets to come back. Obviously, a lot of stimulus money, as you've read, going back into the market, but we shall see the impact that has on consumers and consumption. But we think we're well positioned. The business continues to build share on the Colgate side. We talked about the Holly & Hazel. We think we're now shipping more closely to consumption as we move through the price increase and some of the inventory allocations that we've seen across the trade and we've got a strong innovation pipeline for next year, but we will be thoughtful and prudent on our investment structure in China until we see the categories come back to levels that invite us to invest more. But we feel long term, a good market and the dynamics are there, but we want to be thoughtful in the short term.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks, good morning. On North America, it was great to see volumes inflect a positive this quarter, and you called out growth not just in oral care, but also in bar soap, liquid hand soap and cleaners. So I know there's a lot of things that kind of contribute to that better performance. You mentioned more balanced promotions. But I was wondering if could you spend a little bit of time talking about innovation across the business and any plans for '24? And maybe also if you could talk a little bit about any plans you may have around hand dish and plans to kind of stabilize and regain share in that business? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Hi, Lauren. Good morning. Thanks. I can't really talk specifically to the innovation that we have in 2024. But I can say, obviously, that we've got a strong pipeline and a much more balanced pipeline across all of our businesses. The acceleration in advertising is thoughtful and strategic as well that we will support more of our businesses in North America. I think that's a reflection of the really strong operating profit growth that we've reinjected back into the business. So we feel like we're in a much better place to support some of the categories that had been declining in advertising over the years. So we feel we're in a good place to reflect continued growth on the volume side. Obviously, the pricing will moderate quite considerably in the US as we move through 2024. And we've got a strong innovation pipeline across the categories in order to ensure that we continue to drive market share. The other aspect of it is, as I've talked about, a more balanced cadence of promotions, and we will make sure we execute those very, very thoughtfully. We have no intentions on going back to the historical numbers there, but we feel we've got some opportunities in select accounts in select parts of the country in order to accelerate where we've seen competition be quite aggressive. So good position. Really happy with the health of the P&L. Really happy with the advertising that we put back in the P&L, which will bode well for the long-term health of that business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody. Two questions for me. One, on North America. So global market share better, in North America markets for toothpaste a little bit weaker, advertising spend obviously increased in 4Q and for the year. How much is the right level? And is there a correlation in the US between advertising and volume performance? Is there more to it than that R&D, whatever, curious there? And then on the Hill's business, given the weakness in pet specialty channel, has it made you think at all about whether your distribution mix in terms of where the product is sold, is right at this point? Or do you potentially think about expanding that to other retailer areas? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Good morning, Mark. Thanks. So North America first. Clearly, we're trying to get much more balanced investment across North America. We needed to get the P&L, particularly the middle P&L in the right shape, and that was a strategic choice that we made. A strategic choice enabled by, I think, the broadness of health of our business around the world that has allowed us to obviously accelerate the investment in North America as we took more pricing in the market. So we have a strong innovation pipeline. We anticipate that we'll continue to increase our investment levels. This is not for the short term, this is for the long-term health of that business, which we believe to be a very, very vital market for our success in the future. And we've seen the benefits coming through across our overall consumption. See some -- a little softness in the Nielsen tracked channels, I'll say that our non-tracked channels are growing at 3 to 4 multiple of the tracked channels. So we feel the overall investment in its entirety is proving to grow the consumption and the sales that we need in that marketplace. So long story short, we think we're in a good position for that. On your Hill's comment, our focus is in the channels where we compete. And we believe we're a differentiated unique product that drives the premium nutrition side. Science clearly is the segment that continues to grow, particularly amongst pet specialty. We have no plans to expand distribution in the food drug mass. We believe that would deteriorate the brand and we have very unique distribution policies that require us to be in the channels that we're in. And we continue, as I've mentioned earlier, to feel we have significant upside in those channels and the brand penetration that I mentioned earlier continues to grow. So in a good place, no intentions on expanding distribution. That being said, as you know, the bulk of our business is done in the US. We will be very selective about market expansion on the Hill's business, making sure we get the business model right, making sure the vet becomes a core part of that expansion strategy because that would drive long-term sustainable profitability for the business. And so we'll continue to look for opportunities as we increase the health of that business and the expansion needed in markets around the world.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Noel, I was wondering if you can talk about India for a little bit. A lot of the companies that we talk to are very excited about the market and see it increasingly vibrant. So perhaps maybe review your position there, market share trends, if you're seeing more opportunities and what your plans are? And then just a kind of a housecleaning item for Stan. It looked like there was a $0.07 impact on the other income item under -- on other income, but there were some offsets there and some asset sales and a value-added tax refund. If you could kind of just let us better understand exactly what's going on there. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Rob, and good morning. So India, you saw the results this week, very strong results across the board, 9% organic, continued strong pricing and sequentially better volume in that market. I would likewise say we remain very excited and bullish on the market in India. We'll see the continued return to the rural segment, the vitality of the rural segment, which will bode well for volume as we move -- as we look forward. The other aspect, which I won't get into a lot of specific details, we have some really strong innovation plan for India, particularly around our core businesses. And we're excited to see that obviously be delivered in the market and executed. The team is doing an exceptional job finding added distribution points to make sure that we continue to capitalize on investment strategy. So bullish on India, good results and sequentially right where we'd like to see their business today and setting us up for ultimately another strong year in 2024.\nStan Sutula: Hey, Rob, let me pick up on your second questionnaire and other income, other expense. As we talked earlier, that is made up of a number of items, both from this year and last year. And Argentina devaluation is certainly an impact, but not the majority of it. We also have some start-up costs in there, some onetime items from this year and last year. What I would say is that's not a new run rate. That's not going to continue into next [year at] (ph) that level. And you should think about these as kind of onetime events in nature. So these change as you go through the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Lewis with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\nEdward Lewis: Yes, thanks very much. Just wanted to talk on Europe. Another quarter of strong pricing this quarter. And looking back, I think it's 9.5% for 2023 or 4.5% in 2022. So just be really interested to hear how you're thinking about pricing over here because consistently, I guess, in the past, pricing hasn't been a big part of the story in Europe. Is this kind of a new kind of attitude we should expect to continue doing sort of more pricing in general coming out of Europe?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Ed. Good question. We think we've learned a tremendous amount on pricing in Europe and really work closely with our retail partners to find ways to drive value and ultimately their categories. Clearly, a significant inflation over the last six or seven quarters, which certainly helped to take more pricing in the marketplace. But I think our teams have exited \u201823 with more confidence. Now there's no question as inflation declines in 2024, we'll get a much more balanced view of pricing and volume moving back into the P&L. But I think some good stories that have allowed us to really accelerate our innovation and drive real value in the categories by relaunching our brands. You heard Jean-Luc talked about that at Deutsche Bank Conference, and I think that continues to be a consistent theme. So a lot of learning there, not saying it's going to be a challenge as we move forward to get more pricing in Europe, but we believe we've got the tools and the vehicle is to continue to find ways to accelerate category growth and therefore, our margin growth in the business.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I would now like to return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.\nNoel Wallace: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. We hope you agree that the strategies and plans we have in place to deliver consistent compounded profitable growth to drive value for all of our stakeholders is there. And let me particularly thank all the Colgate employees around the world for their incredible hard work and dedication to deliver these strong results in 2023 and thank them in advance for the results they're going to continue to deliver in 2024. Thanks, everyone. We'll see you down in Florida.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our strong finish to a very good year in 2023 and our positive outlook for 2024. Over the past two years, we've been particularly focused on sustaining our strong organic sales growth while rebuilding our margins and improving our cash flow performance. We delivered on all three of those goals this year while still investing behind advertising to strengthen our brands and building and scaling capabilities to deliver future growth. 2023 marked our fifth consecutive year of organic sales growth either in line or ahead of our 3% to 5% long-term target range. We delivered balanced organic sales growth, growth in all six divisions, all four of our categories, and with improved balance between pricing and volume as we exited the year. Volume rounded to flat in the fourth quarter and was up for the quarter, excluding the impact of lower private label volumes at Hill's. Our market share momentum is improving behind strong innovation, higher levels of brand investment with a focus on improving the effectiveness of each dollar spent. We're also seeing the benefits of our digital transformation as our efforts with data analytics continue to proceed. Our commitment to revenue growth management and the strength of our funding the growth efforts combined with our global productivity initiative drove gross margin expansion, double-digit-based business operating profit growth, and high single-digit based business EPS growth. We delivered these results while increasing the investment in marketing and strategic capabilities and absorbing the headwinds from higher interest expense, pension and tax. We drove greater than 60% free cash flow growth, allowing us to invest behind our brands, increase capacity and buy back stock. We also increased our dividend for the 61st consecutive year. I am deeply proud of the results Colgate people have delivered in a challenging operating environment. 2024 will offer many of the same challenges as 2023, geopolitical unrest, foreign exchange headwinds and a challenged consumer, continued softness in China, and a large number of political elections around the world. We enter 2024 with strong momentum and the plans in place to deliver in this environment, as well as greater flexibility in both our income statement and our balance sheet. As we have mentioned over the past few quarters, we're focused on returning to consistent, compounded EPS growth, and our 2024 guidance reflects this ambition. We will continue to invest to drive high-quality, balanced organic sales growth and with both volume and pricing growing. We plan to deliver our productivity to fund this incremental investment while growing earnings per share. This should enable us to deliver strong cashflow growth to invest back in the business and return cash to shareholders. I look forward to discussing our 2024 plans in further detail at CAGNY next month, so you can share the confidence the Colgate-Palmolive team has in our continued growth. And with that, I'll take your questions. Great. Good morning, Dara. Thank you. So let me start a little bit broader on the categories, particularly oral care. We're really encouraged to see the inflection of positive volume growth in the categories around the world. And in many of the regions where we had seen negative volume growth, we started to see an inflection of that towards the end of the fourth quarter in the category. So that gives us great confidence that the category and the pricing that we put in place is continuing to turn. And importantly, we're going to see that growth continue in 2024. As you bring that back to our business, a really strong quarter for oral care, as you mentioned, both from a organic and sales standpoint, but likewise, as that transferred into better market share growth. If I take oral care in general, we were up double digits in the quarter. That translated into strong market share growth, particularly in regions like Latin America, Europe, Africa, Eurasia, and you saw some improved scanner data in the US as well. I think this is a reflection of the core business strategy that we have in place, the increased advertising that we're putting behind the business, as well as a strong innovation pipeline that continued in the back half of 2023 and will continue in 2024 as well. So market share is around the world strong and we would anticipate that, that will see continued growth as we move through the balance of 2024. And I would caveat with some of that, obviously the markets will be challenged given some of the upfront issues I mentioned, but pleasing to see the strong volume growth in some of our bigger regions. If you take Latin America, particularly three strong quarters of strong volume growth, very much driven by oral care, but quite frankly, that was a cross section of all of our categories, and you see that volume improving across all of our divisions. So again, I think we're well positioned on that. Let me talk a little bit about pet, because I think there's some important context to our strategy and why what we're doing is different for the market and what we're doing is working for the marketplace as well. We talked about Colgate being the most penetrated brand in the world. We also know that Hill's is low penetration, so we will continue to execute a series of differentiated strategies on Hill's in order to continue to accelerate our growth on that business. So, if I take the three aspects that we think about for Hill's, reach, awareness, and conversion, reach obviously is a reflection of the strong advertising that we're putting in place to get the message out. With low single digit penetration on Hill's, we want to ensure the awareness of our superior science is well understood, hence the strategy to drive more TV spending, more digital spending consistently through the quarters. We're spending a lot of time on the effectiveness of that reach to ensure that we're getting the awareness of it. We're using obviously a strong professional endorsement that we have behind vets and continue to accelerate our science and our clinical communication with that key opinion [really] (ph) is critical to the success of the brand. And importantly, as we think about conversion, a lot of non-users in the category, as I mentioned I think on the third quarter call, 5% of consumers are using a therapeutic nutrition, but theoretically 80% should be using a therapeutic nutrition. So a lot of opportunity to continue to drive share. The dynamics in the category, hence you're seeing a little bit of trade down from wet into dry. I mentioned that on the third quarter call, treats have suffered. Now we're not immune to the category softness, but if you take a step back and look at our principal retail environments, pet specialty, neighborhood pet, we're growing share nicely across all of those environments, which means we're helping our retail partners grow category dollars. Penetration was up roughly 10% in the US, our biggest and largest market, so we're very pleased with the progress we have there. Yes, the category is a little softer, but we have the right strategies and differentiated strategies in place to continue to accelerate growth. Okay, great. Bryan, good morning and thank you. Let me talk again a little bit of history in Argentina. And I apologize to go down with an extended answer, but I think it's important for the audience to understand how we operate in these hyperinflationary environments. We've been in Argentina close to 100 years. We have an extraordinarily capable management team that understands hyperinflationary counting, understands how to manage the income statement and the balance sheet, understands how to prevent further devaluations on the balance sheet as we move forward. And that's a reflection of just years and years of experience dealing with this level of volatility. We can go back to 2001, 2002, which I think was the last major devaluation in the country. 2014 had one as well. So we're very accustomed to ensuring we're doing everything to manage the potential volatility in a market like Argentina, and that experience has certainly played out. We have always, always continued to invest for the long term in Argentina. We have manufacturing on the ground. We have good relationships in terms of our ability to access dollars. But importantly, given some of the limitations that we've seen over the years on the ability to access dollars, we now have flexibility in the business to import product into the country as well. So we're very attuned to the volatility. I would say on the flip side, good news that price controls seem to have been settled a bit, and we're not going to see as much of those moving forward. So we continue to operate in an environment where we can bring value to the consumer and take pricing in order to offset some of the significant transaction. Now, we're not immune to the devaluation. We'll see that ultimately unfold as we go through the next couple quarters, more on the margin line than the profit line, but ultimately we will make sure we get pricing in the market and that will take some time to flow through into the P&L. But overall, experienced team which I want to thank for their incredible diligence in how they do --they deal with the economic environment there and feel pretty good that we've got real control of what's going on in Argentina notwithstanding there will be continued volatility. So with that, let me give Stan a chance to talk a little bit about how we're managing more closely the income statement. Great. Thanks and good morning, Andrea. So let me take the advertising and promotional piece, and I'll come back and add a little bit of context on some of the great work that Luciano has done as he's come into the new role. The strategy has been quite consistent for the last three to four years about our ability to build brands through great communication and great innovation. And you've seen that obviously flow through the P&L. And despite the fact that we have obviously grown and accelerated advertising meaningfully over the last couple of years. We've continued to deliver against our guidance and exceed our operating profit objectives, which is terrific. Well, that just gives you a sense for the health of the P&L today and our ability to continue to fund investment going forward, and that will clearly be our strategy. Now, likewise, it gives us flexibility to be very focused on the efficiency of that spend. And I can assure you there's not a discussion that goes by where we don't talk about reach and frequency, and the ROI associated with our spend, both at the digital level and the linear TV level. So we're very, very, very focused on the ability to drive more efficiency through the P&L as we accelerate our advertising. And as we said in the prepared comments, we anticipate to continue to accelerate the advertising into 2024. Promotional environment is very constructive right now. I would say it's about 75% to 80% of the pre-COVID levels. So it's come down. It's more moderated. We -- as I've mentioned, in second and third quarter calls, that we will be very selective on increasing the cadence of our promotions in some of the geographies where we may have taken a little bit too much pricing as we led in some of those markets. That will be prudent and thoughtful and focused in certain select markets. But overall, the promotional environment seems very constructive. And our objective is to drive category and healthy volume growth through obviously the accelerated advertising line. On the supply chain, Luciano has come in and really thinking about the continued transformation of that, bringing a lot of good ideas on automation and data analytics and driving network optimization. A lot of our focus over the last couple of years, particularly at Hill's, was increasing capacity, and you saw that through our capital expenditure line. That will moderate as we move forward with more spending being allocated towards efficiency and savings and optimizing the network and very much digitizing the supply chain and getting very aggressive on using data analytics to optimize our efficiency and our case field level. So overall, pleased with where he's taking the group and that team has done just an extraordinary job getting us ready for further optimization moving forward. Yeah. Good morning, Filippo. Thank you. We see more balanced volume and price as we move into 2024. Obviously, we've had roughly six quarters of aggressive pricing, seven quarters where we've had to take pricing to offset a lot of the inflation that we've seen in agricultural products. To get to your second part of your question, we do see ag prices beginning to moderate, which is good, which over time, as we see the pricing settle out in the markets, we anticipate that volume will come back. But remember, this is the one category we compete in where we've seen prolonged inflation as we move through the back half of 2023. But we anticipate that will definitely moderate as we move into 2024, and pricing likewise will moderate, and we'll see a return to really continuing to drive that successful household penetration number that I shared with you earlier, which is obviously our ability to continue to support strong advertising. So overall, we'll see that more balanced growth as we move through 2024. And on the margin line, as I mentioned again, a more moderating cost. We're still lapping some of the strong inflationary environments that we had in the first half of last year. So that pricing that we've taken in the back half of this year and early in the quarter will stay, but we'll see the volumes start to come back as we move through the back half of the year more meaningfully. Yeah, Callum, thank you and good morning. A good question because we've talked a lot about positioning ourselves to win in the short term, but more importantly, succeed consistently in the long term. And that has been a lot around obviously the advertising investment. But as you well point out, investing in other areas, specifically capabilities, our digital transformation would be at the forefront of that, training and developing talent, bringing in talent, ensuring that we're optimizing our agency and the talent that they have on that side. So that's an important part of ultimately building the capabilities to continue to drive the effectiveness of our spend and ultimately setting ourselves up for better data architecture and the infrastructure required to do that and do it consistently over the long term. So a lot of investment going in that space as well. On the capital side, we've had, obviously, a lot of spending on the capital side in terms of increased capacity. As I mentioned earlier, we're going to see that start to shift to a lot more optimization and savings projects moving through our manufacturing facilities. As I mentioned earlier, setting up infrastructure for our data architecture and our data transformation. So overall, these are all investments for the long term that we think will continue to play out and allow us to drive that consistent earnings growth that we talked about earlier. Stan, anything to add to that? And I'd mentioned very indirectly tied to your question, is the strong cash flow, right? The cash flow is giving us the ability to have a lot more flexibility in how we invest across the business, and that is pleasingly up significantly as you saw in the quarter and the year. Yeah. Let me top line, and I'll let Stan answer a couple of questions. Obviously, I think that pricing, I think cost, I think foreign exchange is obviously the big drivers in the cost line for us. So we've done a terrific job in delivering strong funding to growth. I think a lot of opportunities as we had the supply chain settling down, our ability to start ramping up a lot of the projects that were in many respects on the back burner during COVID. That has allowed us to drive strong funding to growth. We anticipate that that will continue as we move forward into 2024. The pricing has been a big part of the gross margin expansion that we've been very aggressive with over the last six quarters. Yes, pricing will be more balanced as we move forward. So you would anticipate that will be a lesser impact as we move through the gross profit and raw materials will continue to, I think, be inflationary, but far more benign than we've seen in the past and there's clearly a moderation there. So ultimately, hopefully, an opportunity for us. With that, let me turn it over to Stan to give you a little bit more construct to that. Yeah. I would just simply underscore that there will be a sequential impact at the margin line on Argentina as we will take pricing in the quarter, but that will take a while to flow through to recover the transaction impact of the de-val. Thanks. We talked about it, I think, on the second and third call -- on third quarter call that the strength of our Latin America business and ultimately, our ability to lead in pricing and then the consistent history we have of seeing volume return to the categories. And so if I talk at the category level first, what's great is we've seen all three of the categories in which we compete, inflect positively from a category standpoint. And you've obviously seen us growing quite considerably on the volume side, the last three quarters, which is generating good volume share growth for our business. So we're very pleased with the overall performance there. And based on where we see the categories inflecting right now, we're pretty confident that we're going to continue to see balanced growth as we move forward. We'll have to take some currency pricing for sure through the year. But as we've indicated before, we would expect the volume to come back in these markets, and that's exactly what we're seeing. If you drill down to some of our biggest markets, particularly Brazil and Mexico, really strong quarter for both those markets with double-digit volume growth for Brazil and for -- and strong double-digit growth for Mexico as well. So again, a clear indication that the strategy of putting in strong innovation across all price points, getting the advertising, which we accelerated in the fourth quarter, likewise in Latin America, is helping to recover the categories and drive good volume market share in that business. Sure. Let me throw that one to Stan and he can give you a little bit more context there. Yeah. Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Yeah, a little bit of all of that, quite frankly. Obviously, with the incredible inflation that we've seen over the last 1.5 years across the bulk of our commodity basket, we've had to obviously accelerate the funding the growth and the higher cost obviously have allowed us to generate higher funding the growth. As I mentioned earlier, a lot more efficiency in the plants and our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities to drive more of the funding the growth projects has likewise allowed us to step up a little bit of that funding the growth in 2023 that we historically had not had the time to do. So a bit of it will be symptomatic of the year and the opportunity. But I think the discipline that we've ingrained and the culture that we have ingrained at Colgate around funding the growth in parallel, likewise with the global productivity initiative that we put in place, has allowed us to generate obviously strong contraction in our costs overall. I wouldn't say use it as a benchmark for going forward. There will be a lot of moving parts to that, but we feel like structurally, we're in a better place on funding the growth. Structurally, we've managed to execute the GPI in line and slightly towards the high end of the guidance range that we provided earlier on that initiative. So we feel like we're in a good place. Pricing will moderate, so it's important that we continue to generate the strong funding the growth and through the P&L in order to generate the margin growth that Stan talked about. Thanks, Olivia, and good morning. So as I said in my front comments, we believe we are well positioned to deliver consistent compounded earnings growth moving forward. And that's certainly reflected in our guidance in the range that we provided. We have a good strong momentum coming out of '23 and heading into '24. And I think most importantly, the flexibility in the P&L and the balance sheet has allowed us to set ourselves up for continued success. As we look at the cadence of that, we will see the balance overall change as we lap the higher pricing that we've had through the bulk of 2023, that will rebalance itself down to be sure and we'll see the volume come back in the categories. As I talked about earlier and ultimately, our focus on driving household penetration with the increased advertising and the market share position that we have. So we think we're in a good position. Comps will get tougher as you say, but we feel that we'll see the volume growth come back and will offer balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. Now recognize that we still have some inflationary markets, Argentina, we talked about, obviously, Nigeria and Turkey that will drive some pricing. We've got some flow through. Most of the pricing we'll see in 2024 will be pricing flow through. We are going to take a little bit of new pricing in certain select markets. But overall, we're going to see a much better balance, as I mentioned upfront. How that ultimately unfolds we shall see but we're definitely planning for more balanced growth as we move through the back half of this year. Sure. Thank you, Kaumil, and good morning. In China, you've heard it, I think, consistently throughout the earnings season so far that there's a real slowdown in China, and we're not immune to that slowdown. I will say with respect to some of the numbers out there, we feel we've performed very, very well across Greater China. Our business roughly down low to mid-single digits and that was very much commensurate with the category declines that we saw in those markets. Clearly, on the skin health side, we've seen a more acute decline in the categories and therefore, a bigger decline in our business as well. Long term, the market fundamentals remain intact. And I think it will take some time as we move through 2024 for those markets to come back. Obviously, a lot of stimulus money, as you've read, going back into the market, but we shall see the impact that has on consumers and consumption. But we think we're well positioned. The business continues to build share on the Colgate side. We talked about the Holly & Hazel. We think we're now shipping more closely to consumption as we move through the price increase and some of the inventory allocations that we've seen across the trade and we've got a strong innovation pipeline for next year, but we will be thoughtful and prudent on our investment structure in China until we see the categories come back to levels that invite us to invest more. But we feel long term, a good market and the dynamics are there, but we want to be thoughtful in the short term. Yeah. Hi, Lauren. Good morning. Thanks. I can't really talk specifically to the innovation that we have in 2024. But I can say, obviously, that we've got a strong pipeline and a much more balanced pipeline across all of our businesses. The acceleration in advertising is thoughtful and strategic as well that we will support more of our businesses in North America. I think that's a reflection of the really strong operating profit growth that we've reinjected back into the business. So we feel like we're in a much better place to support some of the categories that had been declining in advertising over the years. So we feel we're in a good place to reflect continued growth on the volume side. Obviously, the pricing will moderate quite considerably in the US as we move through 2024. And we've got a strong innovation pipeline across the categories in order to ensure that we continue to drive market share. The other aspect of it is, as I've talked about, a more balanced cadence of promotions, and we will make sure we execute those very, very thoughtfully. We have no intentions on going back to the historical numbers there, but we feel we've got some opportunities in select accounts in select parts of the country in order to accelerate where we've seen competition be quite aggressive. So good position. Really happy with the health of the P&L. Really happy with the advertising that we put back in the P&L, which will bode well for the long-term health of that business. Yeah. Good morning, Mark. Thanks. So North America first. Clearly, we're trying to get much more balanced investment across North America. We needed to get the P&L, particularly the middle P&L in the right shape, and that was a strategic choice that we made. A strategic choice enabled by, I think, the broadness of health of our business around the world that has allowed us to obviously accelerate the investment in North America as we took more pricing in the market. So we have a strong innovation pipeline. We anticipate that we'll continue to increase our investment levels. This is not for the short term, this is for the long-term health of that business, which we believe to be a very, very vital market for our success in the future. And we've seen the benefits coming through across our overall consumption. See some -- a little softness in the Nielsen tracked channels, I'll say that our non-tracked channels are growing at 3 to 4 multiple of the tracked channels. So we feel the overall investment in its entirety is proving to grow the consumption and the sales that we need in that marketplace. So long story short, we think we're in a good position for that. On your Hill's comment, our focus is in the channels where we compete. And we believe we're a differentiated unique product that drives the premium nutrition side. Science clearly is the segment that continues to grow, particularly amongst pet specialty. We have no plans to expand distribution in the food drug mass. We believe that would deteriorate the brand and we have very unique distribution policies that require us to be in the channels that we're in. And we continue, as I've mentioned earlier, to feel we have significant upside in those channels and the brand penetration that I mentioned earlier continues to grow. So in a good place, no intentions on expanding distribution. That being said, as you know, the bulk of our business is done in the US. We will be very selective about market expansion on the Hill's business, making sure we get the business model right, making sure the vet becomes a core part of that expansion strategy because that would drive long-term sustainable profitability for the business. And so we'll continue to look for opportunities as we increase the health of that business and the expansion needed in markets around the world. Yeah. Thanks, Rob, and good morning. So India, you saw the results this week, very strong results across the board, 9% organic, continued strong pricing and sequentially better volume in that market. I would likewise say we remain very excited and bullish on the market in India. We'll see the continued return to the rural segment, the vitality of the rural segment, which will bode well for volume as we move -- as we look forward. The other aspect, which I won't get into a lot of specific details, we have some really strong innovation plan for India, particularly around our core businesses. And we're excited to see that obviously be delivered in the market and executed. The team is doing an exceptional job finding added distribution points to make sure that we continue to capitalize on investment strategy. So bullish on India, good results and sequentially right where we'd like to see their business today and setting us up for ultimately another strong year in 2024. Yes. Thanks, Ed. Good question. We think we've learned a tremendous amount on pricing in Europe and really work closely with our retail partners to find ways to drive value and ultimately their categories. Clearly, a significant inflation over the last six or seven quarters, which certainly helped to take more pricing in the marketplace. But I think our teams have exited \u201823 with more confidence. Now there's no question as inflation declines in 2024, we'll get a much more balanced view of pricing and volume moving back into the P&L. But I think some good stories that have allowed us to really accelerate our innovation and drive real value in the categories by relaunching our brands. You heard Jean-Luc talked about that at Deutsche Bank Conference, and I think that continues to be a consistent theme. So a lot of learning there, not saying it's going to be a challenge as we move forward to get more pricing in Europe, but we believe we've got the tools and the vehicle is to continue to find ways to accelerate category growth and therefore, our margin growth in the business. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. We hope you agree that the strategies and plans we have in place to deliver consistent compounded profitable growth to drive value for all of our stakeholders is there. And let me particularly thank all the Colgate employees around the world for their incredible hard work and dedication to deliver these strong results in 2023 and thank them in advance for the results they're going to continue to deliver in 2024. Thanks, everyone. We'll see you down in Florida."

            "name": "Stan Sutula",
            "content": "Thanks, Noel. And, Bryan, let me start and pick up where Noel left off on the team. So as an example, we have a gentleman that I work with, Jose Fernando and he is my CFO for Latin America. But, he was also the CFO or the Finance Director in Argentina in 2002. So we have a depth of experience and I think that manifests itself with a very proactive approach to market conditions. So he and I talk on a very regular basis about changing market conditions, and then more importantly the proactive nature of what we do about that. So they've operated in a hyperinflationary environment for a very long time. They take the actions necessary where we look at the long term. So while we operate hyperinflationary environment, we account for it appropriately. You do see the impact of the devaluation and other income other expense. It was not the majority of that line item. So there are other items in there but we dealt with that, we delivered our overall numbers, we improved our productivity, we delivered margin expansion, profit expansion and cash flow. So I think the team's done a very nice job looking at it proactively and dealing with it decisively. So you mentioned on a go forward basis, obviously when you [de-val] (ph), your balance sheet gets smaller. We'll continue to take those actions going forward. We have a growing business there. So, going forward, I would not anticipate a major impact to our results from Argentina. And, Andrea, I'll just pick up on your last comment around the issues out in the Red Sea and the shipping. So we've been also proactive on that, looking at alternate methods where available, planning for the lead time disruption. And the rest of the supply chain has remained stable, so we don't see issues there. But we have anticipated longer lead times than planned appropriately for 2024. Callum, the only thing I'd say is when you look at the face of the income statement or balance sheet, the absolute numbers, it doesn't reflect the one of our key jobs here is to allocate resources and we reallocate to those high-growth areas or the areas with the most potential. While that may not show on the absolute line, underneath the covers, that reallocation of resources, whether it's dollars or human capacity is what supports us in analytics and digital and data and S/4 HANA and to enhance all those capabilities. So lots of work under the covers to drive resource to those key areas. So first, we're very pleased with the progress on gross profit through 2023. We had sequential improvement across the categories driven by a broad base of innovation, productivity, that helped offset that commodity situation that we all had to deal with. Now as you think about going forward, coming off of Q4, there are a number of items that always impact the timing, Q4 to Q1. And this year, there's a couple of new ones with a little bit of Argentina, timing of some events worldwide, like Chinese New Year, the timing of when that occurs and where some of this price rolls through, roll through from 2023 and incremental new price. So as we go through the year, we expect that, that will expand, but not at the same kind of levels, obviously, as 2023. So working through that, the teams are focused on productivity. The balance of the top line will change from pricing being the predominant driver to pricing and volume and that productivity will help us drive the margin improvement as we go through the year. Sure. Unlike the prior two years, we don't expect a material impact here. So we see modest inflation in 2024 and there are some areas like every year that go up and down. But there are some new ones this year, things like fish oil has increased significantly. But overall, we expect modest inflation. And so while commodities overall are off of their highs, they're still elevated versus pre-COVID levels. And we expect that as we go through this, there might be a little bit of benefit moving in our favor, but not dramatically. And the only thing I'd say after that is raw materials are one component. So we deal with conversion costs, we deal with transport and logistics costs, and we drive productivity across all these areas through our Funding the Growth program, and that's why we're confident on margin expansion for 2024. Yeah. Pleasingly, at least at the current point in time, we're not seeing an impact to Hill's in total on an increased basis year-on-year. So we look in total around Hill's as ag has kind of stabilized here a bit as well as proteins, we don't see a big headwind heading into 2024 based on total for commodities for Hill's. And that's important, because as we drive productivity with modest levels of flow-through on price and the innovation, that will allow us to continue to expand margin on the Hill's portfolio. Hey, Rob, let me pick up on your second questionnaire and other income, other expense. As we talked earlier, that is made up of a number of items, both from this year and last year. And Argentina devaluation is certainly an impact, but not the majority of it. We also have some start-up costs in there, some onetime items from this year and last year. What I would say is that's not a new run rate. That's not going to continue into next [year at] (ph) that level. And you should think about these as kind of onetime events in nature. So these change as you go through the year."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Allison. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q3 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q3 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q3 results and our 2023 outlook, and we will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Good morning, everyone. I want to give you my thoughts this morning on a very strong quarter of top and bottom-line growth, along with our raised 2023 outlook. As you can see in the materials we published this morning, our strategy is working, and the continued execution of the strategy leaves us well positioned as we look out to the future. We believe this will enable us to deliver balanced organic sales growth going forward, growing in all six divisions, all four of our categories, and with both volume and pricing growth. Organic volume performance improved in the quarter, which we believe puts us on our way towards a return to volume growth. And with the leverage from this balanced growth, along with the global productivity initiative, focused cost containment, and our funding the growth initiatives, we now have multiple points of leverage in our P&L. This should enable us to deliver consistent operating profit and earnings growth going forward. You can see this in our Q3 results as our gross margin was up both sequentially and year-on-year, driven by sales growth, and overheads were down, driven by logistics. This leverage allowed us to deliver another quarter of double-digit operating profit growth, along with a 23% increase in advertising. Some of our markets remain choppy and the headwinds like foreign exchange and higher interest rates will continue to impact us, but we are leveraging the strength and the global reach of our brands while driving scale advantages through our science-based innovation, digital marketing, revenue growth management, and best-in-class on-the-ground execution. Our momentum leaves us very well positioned to deliver strong results with compounding top and bottom-line growth as we look to generate consistent long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders.  And with that, I'll turn it over to the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing well. So, Noel, I wanted to ask specifically on just kind of the return to balance topline growth and kind of how you see that evolving over the next couple of quarters. I mean, excluding H&H, you probably already would've been there this quarter, as you highlighted in the prepared remarks. So, is this something that you kind of expect to achieve call it in the near term as you kind of exit 2023? Or is it going to be a dynamic that you would expect to kind of play out over the next several quarters? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, good morning, Peter. Thanks. Listen, we're obviously very pleased with the sequential improvement really throughout the entire P&L. Volume improved, and as you rightly pointed out, if you take the Hawley & Hazel business out, which as you know, we're working through a price increase in that market, our volume inflected positive in the quarter. And we've seen that pretty consistent around particularly some of our emerging markets where we saw very positive volume. So, we\u2019re pleased with the sequential improvements. The category dynamics are consistent with what we talked about, but they're not necessarily linear. I mean, we're seeing some puts and takes as we look around the regions and the different categories that we compete in. Obviously, taking more pricing across the pet food business as agg prices continue to stay high, but overall, the sequential improvement is playing out more or less as we anticipated. And as we move forward, our intention is to continue to drive balanced organic growth in the short and the long term.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. Noel, you mentioned the full-year guidance, of course, was raised seven to eight, but it still implies a deceleration, of course, in the fourth quarter. And you called out in your prepared remarks, some of the puts and takes, in particular anniversarying the acquisitioning path, and then that would lead to a reduction in third-party manufacturing for private label. Can you break that down because it also implies, I'm assuming the base business a deceleration, and I understand that you're lapping a lot of the pricing, but just as we think about volumes and in particularly North America, there has been a sequential improvement and you called out as well that you are expecting promo and more activations in trade. So, anything you can share with us in terms of the progress you've made to regain volumes in North America as it relates to the full guidance for the fourth quarter. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Good morning, Andrea. Let me take the North America piece of that question first, and then I'll highlight more strategically across the enterprise. So, North America is on pace with exactly what we talked about in the Q2 call, continued sequential improvement across the board, and we anticipate that they will see sequential improvement in their business as we move through the fourth quarter. A lot of that was getting the promotional cadence right, and we started to implement some of that promotional opportunity in the backend of the third quarter. Most of that will come through in the fourth quarter, and we're pleased with it. Obviously, the important part about North America is the oral care business, that inflected positive with high single-digit growth in oral care and positive volume growth on that business in the quarter as well, and we anticipate that will continue as we move through the balance of the year.  So, North America overall trending as we expected. We're still not pleased with some of the scanner shares, but as we said, we'll get the promotional opportunity right as we move through the balance of the year. And importantly, our non-promoted volume, which reflects, I think, the strong advertising that we're putting into the North America business, continues to inflect positive. Strategically, around the world, we\u2019re seeing volume improve across the world. Now, that is based on a lot of the geographies we've seen the pricing start to subside a bit as we're not taking more pricing in some of the markets. Really pleased seeing in markets where we took pricing early, like Latin America, where we've seen a very positive inflection in volume. Volume was up 5%. And if you look at Mexico and Brazil, specifically, Mexico was up mid-single digits. Brazil was up high single digits in volume. So, again, I think a reflection of the strong advertising innovation and the fact that over time, as pricing settles out in the market, you see the volumes come back and that's pretty consistent. Europe, likewise, a little improvement in volume. So, we're seeing exactly as we expected to see volumes start to sequentially improve, but it's not necessarily linear. And I want to leave that point that we'll watch that carefully as we move forward and we'll continue to implement our strategies of strong innovation across the core adjacencies and channels, and we'll see that play out as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDaraMohsenian: Good morning. Can you guys discuss market share performance in your key geographies and product categories in Q3, how you're performing on the share front? And given you've taken robust pricing, what are you seeing competitively in terms of the pricing and promotional environment and how might that play into your shares performance? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, thanks. Good morning, Dara. Sure. Overall, shares look good. We're up on a global basis. Let me just take toothpaste, which we track globally. Shares are up about 100 basis points. That's driven by strong performance in Europe, where we've seen record high shares, particularly behind the strategy of pushing our higher-end therapeutic brands on the premium side with Elmex and Meridol, as well as strong innovation on the Colgate side behind whitening. So, Europe delivering very strong. Africa, Middle East, we're up in 10 of 11 markets and market shares there. So, continue to show nice performance. Pleasingly, Latin America, where we, as you know, we have very high shares, shares are stable. We've seen shares growing in Brazil, slightly down in Mexico, but tracking up in recent periods. So, we're pleased with that. US in the recent weeks, we started to see some of the promotional volumes come back as we very thoughtfully put promotions in the market. We're not just going to buy share back for the sake of buying it back. We're going to get a much healthier category as we move forward, and that's been very deliberate in how we thought about that business there. Africa, excuse me, Asia shares continue to be strong for us in China, so we're pleased with that. And likewise, as you go around the region, share is pretty good in India. We've done some really good work on our core business in the last couple of months, and we anticipate that's going to inflect positive for our core business. Overall, pleased with pleased with market shares. On the Hill\u2019s business, likewise, very strong volume and value share growth in pet specialty and neighborhood pets, which is where we track. We're one of the fastest growing brands in both those retail environments. So, we\u2019re pleased with obviously the strategy of bringing innovation and the increased advertising support we're bringing into the business. A little softness on our home care business in the US and that, again, attributes right back to the promotional cadence, and we're addressing that as we move through the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey, good morning, everyone. So, clearly you returned to solid volume growth at Hill\u2019s and solid results despite a more challenging category. So, Noel, can you maybe comment about how your business is positioned compared to the category weakness that we're seeing, which seems concentrated more on the wet side and the treat side. And then just thinking about Q4, how should we think about the progression of volume in Hill\u2019s, considering you're going to lose some of the private label volumes both from a topline, but also from a margin standpoint. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks, Filippo, and good morning. So, again, a great quarter for Hill\u2019s, obviously with strong balanced pricing and volume growth in the quarter. That growth was quite pervasive across the world as we saw a good growth in the US, as well as in some of our emerging markets, and likewise in Canada. Category has slowed a bit, as you've heard from others. That's, as you mentioned, a combination of sustained pricing in the category over the last four or five quarters and agg prices still remaining high. And so, it's not to be unexpected that the volume would slow a little bit. As you rightfully point out, you've seen some conversion from wet into dry. That lowers the volume. You've seen, obviously treats, which is more discretionary. And you'll recall, as we said in the Q2 call, we don't have a significant business at all in the treats segment. And likewise, I would say the non-science brands continue to perform quite well, but are not immune to the continued challenges that that you highlighted in the category. But as I mentioned just a moment ago, we continue to grow share, and for us, this is a share gain. We only have 5% to 6% penetration in our largest market in the US. So, we have a lot of upside still, hence the reason why we continue to bring strong innovation in the market. Hence the reason why we continue to advertise very aggressively to drive household penetration. Likewise, we see opportunities continued in the prescription diet. Our studies show that only about 5% of pet owners are using a prescription product, whereas potentially up to 80% could be using it. So, that affords us an upside. We've talked about wet, obviously some conversion from wet into dry, but we have very low shares in the wet segment, which has been one of the historically growing segments. And we have plans, as we've ta talked about in the past, to continue to grow that. So, overall, we feel we're positioned well, but not immune to some of the softness that we've seen. But likewise, as I mentioned, we're very focused on driving share and ultimately expanding this business internationally. We'll watch the category carefully. We know our retailers are very focused on nutrition, and the science segment continues to perform well, and that's where we're putting our strategies in order to continue to drive penetration.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hey, morning folks. Thanks for slotting me in, and let's stay there. Let's stay on pet nutrition for a minute, but let's pivot to maybe the bottom line. Looks like gross margins for that segment down 360 bps this quarter, kind of bringing two-year to down 900, very consistent with what we saw last quarter. And I get the mixed benefits of the acquisitions. I get the plant startup expense. I get the inflation, like these are all, obviously factors that have been contributing to the pressure, but I'm expecting all of them to sort of subside as you start to rotate the product out of the Red Collar assets, as you start to pivot some of your resources from starting up plants to attacking some of the efficiency, and hopefully as some of the input cost pressure subsides and price catches up. But we haven't yet seen progress yet. What is a reasonable expectation for us as we try to level set our own expectations? When should we start to see the benefits of all those dynamics come to fruition? And how much recovery should we be expecting?\nNoel Wallace: Well, thanks for the question. Again, sequentially, things are moving in the right direction, and that's exactly what we've talked about in previous calls. And obviously, operating profit and EBIT continues to inflect where we want it. We continue to support the business with a disproportionate amount of our total increase in advertising, as we talked about. That is, again, strategic based on the low penetration and the real headroom that we continue to see in the category for us. As we see agg prices have somewhat flattened out, and that's good news for us, given a lot of the pricing that we've taken, we anticipate that that will start to inflect more positive in our gross margins as we move forward. As you rightfully pointed out, we have a significant amount of cost is still moving through the P&L on getting our new facilities ramped up. The new wet facility will start to ramp up here in the fourth quarter. So, we'll have some costs associated with that, but ultimately, over the longer term, those costs will subside and we feel good about where we are with the new Red Collar plants, getting those integrated in. So, overall, with pricing continuing to flow through, with agg prices holding and continuing to drive premiumization in the category, we feel good about the long-term trajectory of operating margins in this business.\nOperator: Next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Thanks. Good morning. Want to ask you a little bit more about North America, given that - a couple of things. First, the pricing accelerated on a two-year stack. If you could talk about the drivers of that. I assume promotion is a big piece of that. You mentioned advertising was up 25% in North America. Was that the highest amongst the divisions? And just if you could talk a little bit more about how you think about the ROI and the timing of the impact of that higher advertising. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks and good morning, Olivia. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with the progress. Again, this is a very deliberate and strategic execution of how we're trying to get the health of our brands and the health of our P&L in a better place. And as I mentioned in the second quarter call, we may have pulled back a little bit too far on some of the promotional cadence, but we're adjusting that, but adjusting it very prudently where we see the ROI and where we believe we can drive sustained volume and share opportunity moving forward. The 25% increase was not the highest. As I just mentioned, Hill\u2019s continues to receive the disproportionate amount of the advertising increase. But North America, again, given the vibrancy of that market and the long-term strategic importance of that market, we will continue to invest for the long term. Great progress on the operating margins, as you saw move through that P&L. That is a reflection, again, I think of a much more prudent approach to pricing in the market and our promotional cadence. And we feel good about the sequential growth that we saw in the quarter and the sequential growth that we'll continue to see in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Had a question on ad spend. I think year-to-date now we're over 12 - we\u2019re running at a rate that's about a little over 12% as a percentage of sales. And so, given the increase that will end the year at, is this a good base to think of in terms of ad spend going forward, or would you consider taking up further? So, just trying to get a sense now if we've kind of rebased or if this is a new base in terms of ad spend.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks, Bryan. Listen, it's not as much as a percent of sales. It's really about how we're getting - what return on investment we're getting for that. And clearly, you've seen that play through the P&L on the strong organic in the business, the continued growth on market shares around the world, particularly in those strategic categories that we're pushing more deliberately with the advertising. So, it's really about an ROI. And as we see that play back through the P&L, which we clearly are, we'll continue to invest. So, we\u2019re really focused now, I'll say, on making sure we continue to optimize that investment. We put a lot more focus on programmatic buying, a lot more focus on personalization and getting content right. You heard E talk about when we were down in Florida with regards to the importance of advertising creative and content development. So, putting a lot more focus to get better ROI for what we're delivering. So, not necessarily a percent, but overall, we\u2019re getting the performance through the P&L and through our businesses on the ground.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey, great, thank you, and good morning. Maybe just two questions if I could. One is to follow up and round up the volume conversation. You talked about line of sight to improvements in North America and in Asia Pacific. The other area of softness in the quarter was Europe. Just love some perspective on sort of your path to volume improvement in that region. And then more broadly, stepping back, I guess this builds a little bit on the question Bryan was just asking, but you've had just tremendous success this year in driving underlying margin improvement, which has allowed the AMT reinvestment that we've seen year-to-date. I guess, as you are scenario modeling and starting to plan for the year ahead, how do you weigh the puts and takes on margins as you look ahead? And what's your level of confidence you can continue to drive that underlying margin improvement to enable the investment should the ROI exist? \nNoel Wallace: Yes, good morning, Steve. Thanks. So, let me talk again a little bit on volumes. Globally, as you've heard from others, volumes in the categories tend to be down around 2% to 3%. This is a function, obviously, of the aggressive pricing that you've seen sequentially over the last three or four quarters. So, that continues to improve, and in my view, that will continue to improve as pricing moderates over the next couple of quarters and we lapse some of the aggressive pricing that we've had, certainly within our P&L. But from a category standpoint, there's going to be obviously a shift from more pricing-driven organic growth to more volume-driven organic growth. And it's very difficult to actually predict exactly at the pace that's going to happen by geography, because we've taken pricing, competitors taking pricing at different points in the year. So, over time, sequentially though, we see volume returning to a more normalized level, and we see pricing returning to a more normalized level. And that's more or less how it's playing out. Difficult to predict from geography to geography, from quarter to quarter.  On the margin, obviously, a lot of focus, as you know, across the business. We've got a lot of levers in the P&L now to drive operating margins and gross margins. Why don't I let Stan talk to a little bit about that. He's been very focused on driving that across most of our regions. \nStan Sutula: Thanks, Noel. Steve, it's a good question on the driving margin. So, if you take a look at what we've been able to do with the income statement this year, the top to bottom, the flexibility and the strength on all the different lines, have given us a lot more opportunity to drive margin, and it gives us flexibility, and that allows us to react to market conditions and anticipate, and more importantly, invest in those areas of the business that can deliver value. When we look at all those collectively, we think that leaves us well positioned for expanding margin over time. And while we're not going to give guidance for 2024 here today, we think that we are exiting the quarter with a stronger business model here than we entered the year.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, in the release, or in the prepared remarks, you talked about some of the improvement in oral care toothpaste, specifically in North America, but I was wondering if we could talk a bit about home and personal care. The advertising spend, like you said, up 25% this quarter. Just curious about how that is maybe being allocated across the different divisions within North America, how you're thinking about kind of innovation in home and personal care. I know, Noel, you'd mentioned some of the promotional cadence dynamics improving for home care in the fourth quarter, but I was just curious at efforts beyond that to kind of get those businesses more on the right track. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Hey, Lauren, good morning. So, overall, the bulk of our North America business is oral care and it receives the bulk of that advertising increase. But pleasingly, we are supporting our home care and our personal care businesses, which is important. And clearly, as we get the promotional cadence back on those businesses, particularly here in the fourth quarter, we anticipate we'll see an improvement in shares. Now, again, we had a lot of unprofitable share historically where we were chasing share and buying share. And we have deliberately, as we see great health across our P&L and the geographies across the world, we have the opportunity to right-size that in the US and get the shares much more profitable and get much more sustainable share growth moving forward. And the intention is to continue to support all those businesses in the US as we move forward. The other one is our skin health business in the US is getting good levels of advertising. That continues to perform well. If you take our skin health business outside of China, that grew double digits in the quarter for us. So, we continue to see a nice growth on that business, and we'll continue to support that in the US market as well.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning, everyone. I couldn't help but notice the commentary around the currency impact carrying into 2024. At the same time, Noel, you were quite clear in your remarks today that Colgate has multiple levers to continue profit growth. This year, you're going to be doing high single-digit earnings. It would appear on low single-digit currency impact. You, I think, put up the best productivity number on a basis point impact that we've seen in almost 10 years despite raw materials which remain stubbornly high. Well, I know there's conversion and other costs in there as well. But just as you think about next year, and I know you're not giving guidance today, but does your ability to still deliver high single-digit earnings this year despite the currency headwind, give you confidence on next year, especially because some of these drivers, like pricing, perhaps strong productivity and other levers at your disposal, remain available to you going into next year? So, thanks for any perspective on that.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, Chris, thanks. Listen, I'm not going to get into 2024, start predicting where things will evolve, but clearly, foreign exchange moved more negative in the quarter for us. And you've seen that obviously the dollar strengthening as we move into the fourth quarter. But as Stan rightfully pointed out, I think the important aspect here is that the levers within our P&L are better than they've been in quite some time. We have different aspects playing to our advantage now. Obviously, we're getting the pricing executed in the market. We're starting to see volume flow through over the longer term. That will improve efficiencies in our plants. As we've gotten our forecast accuracy improved in the plants, that allows us to obviously run more of our funding the growth, which obviously came through very strong. We have the productivity moving through the P&L. so, we're really trying to pull on all levers to give us as much flexibility as possible. Foreign exchange is obviously a big unknown as we move forward, but you've seen us historically be able to price against this. We obviously have some inflationary pricing in the P&L in the third quarter based on where we see the Argentine peso go, where we see part of the Nigeria foreign exchange has been an issue as well, and likewise in Turkey. But over time, the important part is for us to drive flexibility through our P&L so we can adjust to market circumstances in the most efficient and prudent way.\nOperator: Next question today is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, thanks, and morning, everybody. So, yesterday, a competitor of yours, sort of in certain categories, talked about refocusing the business on product superiority. Obviously, a large US competitor has successfully pivoted the business towards that strategy, with success in recent years. Curious how you think about, or would assess the portion of your portfolio and innovation that meets the criteria. Have you adjusted R&D as a focus, the spending towards these product areas? And as sort of a second question, it might be related, might not be, the issues you bring up with the H&H business in China. Maybe I'm na\u00efve in assuming that some of it could potentially relate to this, where you're taking prices up but not necessarily innovating. If that's wrong, obviously talk to that, but just kind of talk generally about what's going on there and how much is price, how much is other stuff. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks, Mark. Let me come back to the core of our strategy, which was innovating across our core in adjacencies and channels. And all of it is underpinned by science-based innovation, and that has always distinguished our portfolio historically, and we have absolutely dialed that up in terms of how we focus our R&D efforts across the organization. Good examples of that is obviously the growth that we've had in the whitening segment. We have, in our view, some of the best efficacy-based products in the category. We're very pleased with the growth that we've seen in whitening at the premium side with our peroxide-based. We've obviously moved into pens, which is incremental consumption opportunity and the opportunity to drive regiment and a premiumization. We've moved into our chair distinct strategy, which is anchoring science-based whitening through the profession as well. So, science continues to play very importantly into our growth strategy. And you've seen that play out in oral care, certainly seen it play out in in our pediatrician business, as well as very recently in skin health. And likewise, as we look at some of the innovations coming on in our home care business, we've seen some great innovation on concentrate, some great innovation on tablets in Europe. So, we continue to use science as a way to drive differentiation and certainly drive our premiumization. Specifically on the Hawley & Hazel business, as I mentioned in the second quarter, we took pricing. That has taken longer to actually get executed in the market, given the multiple levels of our go-to-market strategy on the Hawley and Hazel business. And obviously, you've seen a slowdown in the category in China, which has also come on top of that. But the good news, as we exited the third quarter, we saw the Hawley & Hazel business start to inflect positively, and we continue to see that as we speak. So, we\u2019re not completely out of where we want it to be, but everything is moving in the right direction. Conversely, the innovation behind Hawley & Hazel is very strong. Once we have that pricing executed, we'll come in with a good first half plan of innovation, and that will be science-based innovation, as I mentioned. The parallel to that is obviously the great success we've had in China with the Colgate business. The Colgate business continues to perform very, very well, growing share in e-commerce, the fastest growing channels, and that is driven behind premium innovation with real science-based structures to that.\nOperator: Next question will come from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRob Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. I'm wondering if we can drill in on the US and maybe talk a little bit about what's going on in the non-track channels, kind of which channels are leading the growth and why do you continue - do you expect that to continue in the future, having a pretty big gap between the scanner results and the non-track? And then if you could put that also in the context of how you see the US consumer and the health of the US consumer developing over the next couple of quarters and any pivots that you may do or adjustments to potentially a weakening consumer outlook. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Hey, good morning, Rob. Thanks. Clearly, in the results, and you've seen the scanner data, which continues to be soft, and as I mentioned, we're addressing that more sharply in the fourth quarter. Our non-track business continues to perform exceptionally well, and that has been a strategy that we've talked about for quite some time. Those are some of the faster growing channels. We continue to invest in those channels. We continue to grow share in those channels. And overall, that's certainly leading to a broader-based healthier business for us moving forward. You talk Club. You talk some of the discount channels. You talk some of the e-commerce channels as well. So, overall, we think we\u2019re well positioned in the US to continue to leverage where the growth is coming from. The consumer continues to be resilient. I would say the promotional environment is constructive right now. We've seen a little bit of pickup in some categories, but overall, still below pre-COVID levels. And as we continue to be, as I said, very thoughtfully prudent on how we elevate our cadence of promotions moving forward, we feel good about our ability to continue to drive non-track. Now, I'll remind you that non-tracked are about 14% of the total company sales. And so, while very important for us in the US and the team there under Jesper's leadership is laser focused on addressing that, we're going to get that back to a healthier share as we move forward.\nOperator: Our last question today is a follow-up from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. Thanks again, Operator. Hey Stan, just a question around inflation. I know in the press release or the prepared remarks, you talked about - or I guess the press release, talked about still several hundred million dollars of inflation expected for this year. Can you just give us some context of, is it the same moderating? Like, as we're exiting the year, just how we should be thinking about the trend on inflation? I know you called out inflation in pet. So, just trying to get a sense of whether or not it's - how it's trending. Is it trending better or worse than kind of where we were coming out of 2Q?\nStan Sutula: Yes, sure, Bryan. So, as we said, our view on raw materials in total remains consistent with prior quarters. And we still do see several hundred million of gross cost inflation raw materials for 2023. But while the overall totals in line, there have been some shifts underneath that. First, agriculture has not eased. In some cases, it\u2019s actually gone up. That affects primarily our Hill\u2019s business. Offsetting that, some commodities such as resins and oils have actually softened a bit. But when we look in total, that basket is roughly still in line. And while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten a lot better. The one we continue to watch carefully is obviously energy with all the volatility in that market. And then also just keep in mind, some of our raw materials are not pure commodities, but specialty, flavors, fragrances. Those tend to have less volatility. But I think if you pull back, our teams have done a great job driving productivity to mitigate some of that inflation. And you saw in our funding the growth, this has really helped us balance the margin. You combine that with RGM, and it's resulted in that margin expansion. So, if I got to pull that back, while that's been relatively steady in total, the pieces moving around underneath, that has - our gross profit in total for the company has gone up 140 basis points year-to-year. And that's a combination of that pricing in RGM has been able to more than compensate for the raw materials going through. So, as we look at that heading into the last quarter, we haven't actually seen a lot of change in the commodity basket, so we expect that to continue through the end of the year.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, Bryan, I\u2019d just reiterate, again, that 140, you add another 50 basis points for private label, and if you add logistics in there, which others include in cost of goods, that adds roughly another 130. So, north of 300 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. And that's terrific in terms of how we saw things ultimately playing out. And as we see hopefully a more benign cost environment over the medium term and our ability to hold pricing and continue to innovate at the high end, we feel pretty good about the continued ability to sustain high margins in the categories in which we compete.\nNoel Wallace: So, thanks everyone for joining the call today. Let me just close up by saying we really appreciate your interest in the company. We hope you agree that we have the strategies and the plans in place to deliver consistent, compounded profitable growth to drive value for all of our shareholders. And I would be remiss not to thank all the Colgate from all folks around the world who have delivered a very strong quarter for us in the third quarter of 2023. So, thanks everyone. We'll talk to you in January.\nOperator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I want to give you my thoughts this morning on a very strong quarter of top and bottom-line growth, along with our raised 2023 outlook. As you can see in the materials we published this morning, our strategy is working, and the continued execution of the strategy leaves us well positioned as we look out to the future. We believe this will enable us to deliver balanced organic sales growth going forward, growing in all six divisions, all four of our categories, and with both volume and pricing growth. Organic volume performance improved in the quarter, which we believe puts us on our way towards a return to volume growth. And with the leverage from this balanced growth, along with the global productivity initiative, focused cost containment, and our funding the growth initiatives, we now have multiple points of leverage in our P&L. This should enable us to deliver consistent operating profit and earnings growth going forward. You can see this in our Q3 results as our gross margin was up both sequentially and year-on-year, driven by sales growth, and overheads were down, driven by logistics. This leverage allowed us to deliver another quarter of double-digit operating profit growth, along with a 23% increase in advertising. Some of our markets remain choppy and the headwinds like foreign exchange and higher interest rates will continue to impact us, but we are leveraging the strength and the global reach of our brands while driving scale advantages through our science-based innovation, digital marketing, revenue growth management, and best-in-class on-the-ground execution. Our momentum leaves us very well positioned to deliver strong results with compounding top and bottom-line growth as we look to generate consistent long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders.  And with that, I'll turn it over to the questions. Yes, good morning, Peter. Thanks. Listen, we're obviously very pleased with the sequential improvement really throughout the entire P&L. Volume improved, and as you rightly pointed out, if you take the Hawley & Hazel business out, which as you know, we're working through a price increase in that market, our volume inflected positive in the quarter. And we've seen that pretty consistent around particularly some of our emerging markets where we saw very positive volume. So, we're pleased with the sequential improvements. The category dynamics are consistent with what we talked about, but they're not necessarily linear. I mean, we're seeing some puts and takes as we look around the regions and the different categories that we compete in. Obviously, taking more pricing across the pet food business as agg prices continue to stay high, but overall, the sequential improvement is playing out more or less as we anticipated. And as we move forward, our intention is to continue to drive balanced organic growth in the short and the long term. Sure. Good morning, Andrea. Let me take the North America piece of that question first, and then I'll highlight more strategically across the enterprise. So, North America is on pace with exactly what we talked about in the Q2 call, continued sequential improvement across the board, and we anticipate that they will see sequential improvement in their business as we move through the fourth quarter. A lot of that was getting the promotional cadence right, and we started to implement some of that promotional opportunity in the backend of the third quarter. Most of that will come through in the fourth quarter, and we're pleased with it. Obviously, the important part about North America is the oral care business, that inflected positive with high single-digit growth in oral care and positive volume growth on that business in the quarter as well, and we anticipate that will continue as we move through the balance of the year.  So, North America overall trending as we expected. We're still not pleased with some of the scanner shares, but as we said, we'll get the promotional opportunity right as we move through the balance of the year. And importantly, our non-promoted volume, which reflects, I think, the strong advertising that we're putting into the North America business, continues to inflect positive. Strategically, around the world, we're seeing volume improve across the world. Now, that is based on a lot of the geographies we've seen the pricing start to subside a bit as we're not taking more pricing in some of the markets. Really pleased seeing in markets where we took pricing early, like Latin America, where we've seen a very positive inflection in volume. Volume was up 5%. And if you look at Mexico and Brazil, specifically, Mexico was up mid-single digits. Brazil was up high single digits in volume. So, again, I think a reflection of the strong advertising innovation and the fact that over time, as pricing settles out in the market, you see the volumes come back and that's pretty consistent. Europe, likewise, a little improvement in volume. So, we're seeing exactly as we expected to see volumes start to sequentially improve, but it's not necessarily linear. And I want to leave that point that we'll watch that carefully as we move forward and we'll continue to implement our strategies of strong innovation across the core adjacencies and channels, and we'll see that play out as we move forward. Sure, thanks. Good morning, Dara. Sure. Overall, shares look good. We're up on a global basis. Let me just take toothpaste, which we track globally. Shares are up about 100 basis points. That's driven by strong performance in Europe, where we've seen record high shares, particularly behind the strategy of pushing our higher-end therapeutic brands on the premium side with Elmex and Meridol, as well as strong innovation on the Colgate side behind whitening. So, Europe delivering very strong. Africa, Middle East, we're up in 10 of 11 markets and market shares there. So, continue to show nice performance. Pleasingly, Latin America, where we, as you know, we have very high shares, shares are stable. We've seen shares growing in Brazil, slightly down in Mexico, but tracking up in recent periods. So, we're pleased with that. US in the recent weeks, we started to see some of the promotional volumes come back as we very thoughtfully put promotions in the market. We're not just going to buy share back for the sake of buying it back. We're going to get a much healthier category as we move forward, and that's been very deliberate in how we thought about that business there. Africa, excuse me, Asia shares continue to be strong for us in China, so we're pleased with that. And likewise, as you go around the region, share is pretty good in India. We've done some really good work on our core business in the last couple of months, and we anticipate that's going to inflect positive for our core business. Overall, pleased with pleased with market shares. On the Hill's business, likewise, very strong volume and value share growth in pet specialty and neighborhood pets, which is where we track. We're one of the fastest growing brands in both those retail environments. So, we're pleased with obviously the strategy of bringing innovation and the increased advertising support we're bringing into the business. A little softness on our home care business in the US and that, again, attributes right back to the promotional cadence, and we're addressing that as we move through the fourth quarter. Yes, thanks, Filippo, and good morning. So, again, a great quarter for Hill's, obviously with strong balanced pricing and volume growth in the quarter. That growth was quite pervasive across the world as we saw a good growth in the US, as well as in some of our emerging markets, and likewise in Canada. Category has slowed a bit, as you've heard from others. That's, as you mentioned, a combination of sustained pricing in the category over the last four or five quarters and agg prices still remaining high. And so, it's not to be unexpected that the volume would slow a little bit. As you rightfully point out, you've seen some conversion from wet into dry. That lowers the volume. You've seen, obviously treats, which is more discretionary. And you'll recall, as we said in the Q2 call, we don't have a significant business at all in the treats segment. And likewise, I would say the non-science brands continue to perform quite well, but are not immune to the continued challenges that that you highlighted in the category. But as I mentioned just a moment ago, we continue to grow share, and for us, this is a share gain. We only have 5% to 6% penetration in our largest market in the US. So, we have a lot of upside still, hence the reason why we continue to bring strong innovation in the market. Hence the reason why we continue to advertise very aggressively to drive household penetration. Likewise, we see opportunities continued in the prescription diet. Our studies show that only about 5% of pet owners are using a prescription product, whereas potentially up to 80% could be using it. So, that affords us an upside. We've talked about wet, obviously some conversion from wet into dry, but we have very low shares in the wet segment, which has been one of the historically growing segments. And we have plans, as we've ta talked about in the past, to continue to grow that. So, overall, we feel we're positioned well, but not immune to some of the softness that we've seen. But likewise, as I mentioned, we're very focused on driving share and ultimately expanding this business internationally. We'll watch the category carefully. We know our retailers are very focused on nutrition, and the science segment continues to perform well, and that's where we're putting our strategies in order to continue to drive penetration. Well, thanks for the question. Again, sequentially, things are moving in the right direction, and that's exactly what we've talked about in previous calls. And obviously, operating profit and EBIT continues to inflect where we want it. We continue to support the business with a disproportionate amount of our total increase in advertising, as we talked about. That is, again, strategic based on the low penetration and the real headroom that we continue to see in the category for us. As we see agg prices have somewhat flattened out, and that's good news for us, given a lot of the pricing that we've taken, we anticipate that that will start to inflect more positive in our gross margins as we move forward. As you rightfully pointed out, we have a significant amount of cost is still moving through the P&L on getting our new facilities ramped up. The new wet facility will start to ramp up here in the fourth quarter. So, we'll have some costs associated with that, but ultimately, over the longer term, those costs will subside and we feel good about where we are with the new Red Collar plants, getting those integrated in. So, overall, with pricing continuing to flow through, with agg prices holding and continuing to drive premiumization in the category, we feel good about the long-term trajectory of operating margins in this business. Yes, thanks and good morning, Olivia. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with the progress. Again, this is a very deliberate and strategic execution of how we're trying to get the health of our brands and the health of our P&L in a better place. And as I mentioned in the second quarter call, we may have pulled back a little bit too far on some of the promotional cadence, but we're adjusting that, but adjusting it very prudently where we see the ROI and where we believe we can drive sustained volume and share opportunity moving forward. The 25% increase was not the highest. As I just mentioned, Hill's continues to receive the disproportionate amount of the advertising increase. But North America, again, given the vibrancy of that market and the long-term strategic importance of that market, we will continue to invest for the long term. Great progress on the operating margins, as you saw move through that P&L. That is a reflection, again, I think of a much more prudent approach to pricing in the market and our promotional cadence. And we feel good about the sequential growth that we saw in the quarter and the sequential growth that we'll continue to see in the fourth quarter. Yes, thanks, Bryan. Listen, it's not as much as a percent of sales. It's really about how we're getting - what return on investment we're getting for that. And clearly, you've seen that play through the P&L on the strong organic in the business, the continued growth on market shares around the world, particularly in those strategic categories that we're pushing more deliberately with the advertising. So, it's really about an ROI. And as we see that play back through the P&L, which we clearly are, we'll continue to invest. So, we're really focused now, I'll say, on making sure we continue to optimize that investment. We put a lot more focus on programmatic buying, a lot more focus on personalization and getting content right. You heard E talk about when we were down in Florida with regards to the importance of advertising creative and content development. So, putting a lot more focus to get better ROI for what we're delivering. So, not necessarily a percent, but overall, we're getting the performance through the P&L and through our businesses on the ground. Yes, good morning, Steve. Thanks. So, let me talk again a little bit on volumes. Globally, as you've heard from others, volumes in the categories tend to be down around 2% to 3%. This is a function, obviously, of the aggressive pricing that you've seen sequentially over the last three or four quarters. So, that continues to improve, and in my view, that will continue to improve as pricing moderates over the next couple of quarters and we lapse some of the aggressive pricing that we've had, certainly within our P&L. But from a category standpoint, there's going to be obviously a shift from more pricing-driven organic growth to more volume-driven organic growth. And it's very difficult to actually predict exactly at the pace that's going to happen by geography, because we've taken pricing, competitors taking pricing at different points in the year. So, over time, sequentially though, we see volume returning to a more normalized level, and we see pricing returning to a more normalized level. And that's more or less how it's playing out. Difficult to predict from geography to geography, from quarter to quarter.  On the margin, obviously, a lot of focus, as you know, across the business. We've got a lot of levers in the P&L now to drive operating margins and gross margins. Why don't I let Stan talk to a little bit about that. He's been very focused on driving that across most of our regions. Sure. Hey, Lauren, good morning. So, overall, the bulk of our North America business is oral care and it receives the bulk of that advertising increase. But pleasingly, we are supporting our home care and our personal care businesses, which is important. And clearly, as we get the promotional cadence back on those businesses, particularly here in the fourth quarter, we anticipate we'll see an improvement in shares. Now, again, we had a lot of unprofitable share historically where we were chasing share and buying share. And we have deliberately, as we see great health across our P&L and the geographies across the world, we have the opportunity to right-size that in the US and get the shares much more profitable and get much more sustainable share growth moving forward. And the intention is to continue to support all those businesses in the US as we move forward. The other one is our skin health business in the US is getting good levels of advertising. That continues to perform well. If you take our skin health business outside of China, that grew double digits in the quarter for us. So, we continue to see a nice growth on that business, and we'll continue to support that in the US market as well. Yes, Chris, thanks. Listen, I'm not going to get into 2024, start predicting where things will evolve, but clearly, foreign exchange moved more negative in the quarter for us. And you've seen that obviously the dollar strengthening as we move into the fourth quarter. But as Stan rightfully pointed out, I think the important aspect here is that the levers within our P&L are better than they've been in quite some time. We have different aspects playing to our advantage now. Obviously, we're getting the pricing executed in the market. We're starting to see volume flow through over the longer term. That will improve efficiencies in our plants. As we've gotten our forecast accuracy improved in the plants, that allows us to obviously run more of our funding the growth, which obviously came through very strong. We have the productivity moving through the P&L. so, we're really trying to pull on all levers to give us as much flexibility as possible. Foreign exchange is obviously a big unknown as we move forward, but you've seen us historically be able to price against this. We obviously have some inflationary pricing in the P&L in the third quarter based on where we see the Argentine peso go, where we see part of the Nigeria foreign exchange has been an issue as well, and likewise in Turkey. But over time, the important part is for us to drive flexibility through our P&L so we can adjust to market circumstances in the most efficient and prudent way. Yes, thanks, Mark. Let me come back to the core of our strategy, which was innovating across our core in adjacencies and channels. And all of it is underpinned by science-based innovation, and that has always distinguished our portfolio historically, and we have absolutely dialed that up in terms of how we focus our R&D efforts across the organization. Good examples of that is obviously the growth that we've had in the whitening segment. We have, in our view, some of the best efficacy-based products in the category. We're very pleased with the growth that we've seen in whitening at the premium side with our peroxide-based. We've obviously moved into pens, which is incremental consumption opportunity and the opportunity to drive regiment and a premiumization. We've moved into our chair distinct strategy, which is anchoring science-based whitening through the profession as well. So, science continues to play very importantly into our growth strategy. And you've seen that play out in oral care, certainly seen it play out in in our pediatrician business, as well as very recently in skin health. And likewise, as we look at some of the innovations coming on in our home care business, we've seen some great innovation on concentrate, some great innovation on tablets in Europe. So, we continue to use science as a way to drive differentiation and certainly drive our premiumization. Specifically on the Hawley & Hazel business, as I mentioned in the second quarter, we took pricing. That has taken longer to actually get executed in the market, given the multiple levels of our go-to-market strategy on the Hawley and Hazel business. And obviously, you've seen a slowdown in the category in China, which has also come on top of that. But the good news, as we exited the third quarter, we saw the Hawley & Hazel business start to inflect positively, and we continue to see that as we speak. So, we're not completely out of where we want it to be, but everything is moving in the right direction. Conversely, the innovation behind Hawley & Hazel is very strong. Once we have that pricing executed, we'll come in with a good first half plan of innovation, and that will be science-based innovation, as I mentioned. The parallel to that is obviously the great success we've had in China with the Colgate business. The Colgate business continues to perform very, very well, growing share in e-commerce, the fastest growing channels, and that is driven behind premium innovation with real science-based structures to that. Yes. Hey, good morning, Rob. Thanks. Clearly, in the results, and you've seen the scanner data, which continues to be soft, and as I mentioned, we're addressing that more sharply in the fourth quarter. Our non-track business continues to perform exceptionally well, and that has been a strategy that we've talked about for quite some time. Those are some of the faster growing channels. We continue to invest in those channels. We continue to grow share in those channels. And overall, that's certainly leading to a broader-based healthier business for us moving forward. You talk Club. You talk some of the discount channels. You talk some of the e-commerce channels as well. So, overall, we think we're well positioned in the US to continue to leverage where the growth is coming from. The consumer continues to be resilient. I would say the promotional environment is constructive right now. We've seen a little bit of pickup in some categories, but overall, still below pre-COVID levels. And as we continue to be, as I said, very thoughtfully prudent on how we elevate our cadence of promotions moving forward, we feel good about our ability to continue to drive non-track. Now, I'll remind you that non-tracked are about 14% of the total company sales. And so, while very important for us in the US and the team there under Jesper's leadership is laser focused on addressing that, we're going to get that back to a healthier share as we move forward. Yes, Bryan, I'd just reiterate, again, that 140, you add another 50 basis points for private label, and if you add logistics in there, which others include in cost of goods, that adds roughly another 130. So, north of 300 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. And that's terrific in terms of how we saw things ultimately playing out. And as we see hopefully a more benign cost environment over the medium term and our ability to hold pricing and continue to innovate at the high end, we feel pretty good about the continued ability to sustain high margins in the categories in which we compete. So, thanks everyone for joining the call today. Let me just close up by saying we really appreciate your interest in the company. We hope you agree that we have the strategies and the plans in place to deliver consistent, compounded profitable growth to drive value for all of our shareholders. And I would be remiss not to thank all the Colgate from all folks around the world who have delivered a very strong quarter for us in the third quarter of 2023. So, thanks everyone. We'll talk to you in January."

            "content": "Thanks, Noel. Steve, it's a good question on the driving margin. So, if you take a look at what we've been able to do with the income statement this year, the top to bottom, the flexibility and the strength on all the different lines, have given us a lot more opportunity to drive margin, and it gives us flexibility, and that allows us to react to market conditions and anticipate, and more importantly, invest in those areas of the business that can deliver value. When we look at all those collectively, we think that leaves us well positioned for expanding margin over time. And while we're not going to give guidance for 2024 here today, we think that we are exiting the quarter with a stronger business model here than we entered the year. Yes, sure, Bryan. So, as we said, our view on raw materials in total remains consistent with prior quarters. And we still do see several hundred million of gross cost inflation raw materials for 2023. But while the overall totals in line, there have been some shifts underneath that. First, agriculture has not eased. In some cases, it's actually gone up. That affects primarily our Hill's business. Offsetting that, some commodities such as resins and oils have actually softened a bit. But when we look in total, that basket is roughly still in line. And while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten a lot better. The one we continue to watch carefully is obviously energy with all the volatility in that market. And then also just keep in mind, some of our raw materials are not pure commodities, but specialty, flavors, fragrances. Those tend to have less volatility. But I think if you pull back, our teams have done a great job driving productivity to mitigate some of that inflation. And you saw in our funding the growth, this has really helped us balance the margin. You combine that with RGM, and it's resulted in that margin expansion. So, if I got to pull that back, while that's been relatively steady in total, the pieces moving around underneath, that has - our gross profit in total for the company has gone up 140 basis points year-to-year. And that's a combination of that pricing in RGM has been able to more than compensate for the raw materials going through. So, as we look at that heading into the last quarter, we haven't actually seen a lot of change in the commodity basket, so we expect that to continue through the end of the year."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher.\nJohn Faucher: Thank you, Allison. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the Q2 2023 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the Q2 2023 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q2 results and our 2023 outlook, and we will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So a few quick thoughts this morning on our strong quarter of top and bottom line growth and clearly along with the improved 2023 outlook we provided. On the first quarter call, you'll recall, I highlighted three priorities for the year, driving organic sales growth as we face tougher comparisons, executing on productivity and revenue growth management to fund brand investment, while also delivering on our earnings targets, and improving our cash flow performance. While not without its challenges, in Q2, we made strong progress on all three of these. On organic sales growth, Q2 showed the strength of our global portfolio as we delivered our strongest quarterly growth on a two-year stack basis since Q3 2008, with both organic volume and pricing growth accelerating on a two-year stack basis. We delivered organic sales growth in all six divisions and in each of our categories grew in the mid-single digits or higher. We are laser-focused on returning to balanced organic sales growth and we believe the investments we are making, combined with easier comparisons, give us a path to improved volume growth going forward as we leverage increased brand support and innovation while still delivering profit growth. The strength of our revenue growth management efforts, combined with our progress on funding the growth, drove improvement in our gross margin both sequentially and year-over-year. Our Base Business SG&A was down 30 basis points in the quarter. A strong sales growth, lower logistics costs and the benefits of our 2022 global productivity initiative drove operating leverage even as we increased advertising spending by 20%. Combined with our gross margin expansion, we delivered 60 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter. This enabled us to deliver upside versus expectations in the quarter despite continued pressure from below the line items, including the impact of higher interest rates and tax. As you've heard me say, it's just virtuous combination of growth driven leverage, revenue growth management, cost containment and productivity to drive investments in capabilities and brand building which drove the strong quality of this quarter's results. We believe it also lays the groundwork for our performance across the balance of the year and into the future. And finally, our strong cash flow performance continued in the quarter, which is helping us offset some of these below the line headwinds. Free cash flow was up more than 50% in the quarter and is more than up -- up more than 80% year-to-date through net income growth and improved working capital performance and pleasingly, particularly in inventories and payables. So I'm pleased with how we started the year, but I'm also well aware of the challenges and uncertainty ahead of us. Our goal is to deliver consistent, high quality compounded top and bottom line growth to drive shareholder value. And I believe Colgate-Palmolive has the brands, the global footprint and the people to deliver. So with that, I'll turn it over to the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And Our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nNoel Wallace: Hi, Dara (ph).\nDara Mohsenian: So another impressive quarter of organic sales growth. And as you mentioned, the CAGR is accelerated on a multiyear basis, but it was driven by pricing more than entirely. And obviously, from here, we're going into a period where we're cycling higher pricing. So can you just talk about, conceptually at a high level, how you think about the balance of organic sales growth going forward, level of visibilities that volume can come back as pricing drops off? And maybe within that question also, if you could just touch on the global Oral Care share and the performance in the quarter and prospects going forward, that would be helpful also. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Dara. So let me go back to a couple of the comments I made in my opening statement and really talk about how we're trying to work to improve the quality of the P&L, which puts us in the best position to drive compounded long-term balanced growth top and bottom line, which is what we've been talking about for quite some time. As you know, we're coming out of what has been the worst raw material environment in decades. So our plan is with the combination of the revenue wealth management we talked about and the discipline that we're putting across the company in that area, more pricing and productivity, we can restore our gross margins and that's been the key focus. We believe that if we exit this type of environment with a structurally lower gross margin, you're going to be in a hole that's very difficult to dig yourself out of in the future, particularly because you need the gross margin to fund the investment in capabilities and the brand building, which you certainly saw in the quarter. We want to grow margins while still investing behind our brands and sustain a consistent organic sales growth, which we're clearly demonstrating. The key to do is getting pricing in the P&L. We certainly focused our teams on the ground in that area because the depth and duration of this cost inflation that we're experiencing has been an issue and you simply can't do it with one round of pricing. It needs to be consistent and deliberate and purposeful. And now as we look at cost inflation slowing overall, there are still places where we see margin pressure. So we -- of course, we need to take additional pricing, and this has had an impact on the volume. Maybe a couple of examples. China is a good example. We've taken pricing on our Hawley & Hazel joint venture in order to improve profitability long-term to drive the necessary investments in digital, the premium innovation required in that market and a continued shift to e-commerce. And as you know, China is a very difficult market in which to take pricing. And in the short term, that hasn't -- that's had an impact on our volume through lower promotions and wholesaler inventories as we look to set the new pricing in the market. But the long-term implications of not restoring margins are more problematic. I'd go on to North America as well, where we're working to improve the health of our business and our brands through shifting more consistent brand support from above the net revenue line to obviously into margin expansion. This will improve health of our brands and our P&L. We're seeing this play out in our non-promoted share, which is growing, which is a healthy way to grow the business. In the short term, was the volume impact from reduced promotions more than we expected? Yes, it was. But the good news is, we've adjusted the P&L, we've strengthened it and we can adjust moving forward as we see the opportunities provide themselves. So while we're delivering both sales and profit growth along with increases in brand support in the middle of the P&L, it's clearly a healthier way to drive the business. If I look at the Hill's business, we're still seeing high levels of cost inflation, as you've heard us talk about in the first quarter and gross margins are still down year-over-year. So we've taken additional pricing to get the right margin structure for this business for the long-term. Much of the Hill's volume decline in the quarter was in emerging markets as much of the time is due to go-to-market changes or shipments that we had. The good news is the EMEA or our Europe business, and particularly there we were strong, U.S. volumes were only down slightly in the quarter against a very difficult comparison with pricing as you saw up in the teens. But we're focused on getting Hill's back to volume growth the right way. This is a business that responds very well to science driven innovation and strong advertising. We want to make sure that it's well funded and through the gross margin expansion that you've seen. And Hill's saw the biggest advertising increases in brand building in this quarter and will continue to fuel that investment. So I understand the importance of gaining volume growth, as you asked. We know we're all focused on that and as you are. But as I said, we want to do that in a way that sets us up structurally for long-term profitable growth. That means a good visibility towards restoring our gross margin to previous levels through revenue growth management and productivity that we've been talking about, well-funded advertising and the ability to drive operating leverage with the strong innovation that we're bringing to the market and healthier brands. So with a lot of great work by Colgate people, we have gross margin, overheads and logistics trending positively. We just finished the first half where we increased advertising by 17%. We have put additional pricing in place. We have strong innovation across all the divisions and categories. And we have second half volume comps that are easier by about 500 basis points. So we feel we're very well positioned. So with that, let me turn it over to the other questions.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the prior question, Noel. You mentioned the need to take incremental pricing. Can you give us a little bit more color which category, country combination are you taking more pricing? What has been the response so far, and generally, like the magnitude relative to the prior price increases? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Let me just come back to a quick finish on Dara's point. He asked about market shares. Dara, so our market share -- global market shares are up on toothpaste around the world. Strong growth obviously in Europe, a little softness in North America, as you've seen in the scanner data. And we're obviously addressing that as we go into the back half. Latin America shares look good. Asia shares look good. Africa shares look really, really strong. We're up or flat in all the 11 markets where we read shares there. So overall, oral toothpaste shares are pretty good. Filippo, on your question with regarding the pricing, certainly in some of the higher inflationary markets, we will probably still see pricing in the back half of the year. Take Turkey, take Argentina, take Pakistan and some of the other higher inflationary areas around the world. We took pricing in the second quarter in North America. Obviously, that had some impact on volume in the quarter. But we'll see deliberate and very focused pricing where we have margin pressure. On the Hill's business, clearly, we've seen ag prices accelerate through 2022 and into '23. So we're taking pricing commensurate with that as we move into the back half. But it will be more isolated and targeted the bigger price increases are in the P&L. And as you heard us talk about, we took a lot of pricing in 2022. About 58% of the pricing in the P&L this year is flow through from last year. So we still have a little bit to go, but most of it is in the P&L already.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Noel. Maybe just kind of tying it back to -- maybe this ties back to Dara's question. But in the prepared remarks, you talked about -- on a percentage of sales basis, SG&A would be up in North America, Europe and Hill's to support volume acceleration. And I guess, as we look through the results, it looks like it's been pretty good in Europe, like, you've gained share. So maybe if you can, for some context, in terms of that investment, how much of it is \u2013 like, where has each of those geographies progressed relative to the investment? Is it right to read that you're having an impact in Europe and you still have some catch-up to do in North America? Just want to get some color on that.\nNoel Wallace: Absolutely. Thanks, Bryan. Yeah. I'll start with Europe. Obviously, we've increased investment there and we're seeing terrific response to particularly the elmex and meridol brands where we've elevated our investment there, but likewise, on the Colgate brand. So a lot of the efforts that we've had on premium whitening have played out to drive incremental share in Europe. So that investment across that business is certainly playing out. But importantly, the investment in Europe is broader based than just Oral Care. We have a wonderful relaunch on Sanex, that's underway across Europe. We're putting investment behind that. We relaunched our Soupline business in France, which is a big business for us. And we've launched the Suavitel -- the Soupline Hearts, which we're putting investment behind that. So I think what's important is with operating margins back to growth, it's giving us a lot more flexibility to support a wide array of brands, particularly in Europe. And that would be the case likewise in Latin America, where we've obviously seen a little pickup in exchange. So on a local currency basis, we're getting more advertising. And I'd also point to the fact that we're getting more efficient and targeted with our advertising with some of our digital skills that we're implementing across the world. North America, it's taking a little bit more time. You certainly have seen the promoted share fall off. But as I mentioned in my comments to Dara, the important thing is our non-promoted volume share is growing. And that's a clear reflection of the fact that we've increased support on the brand and building the health of the brand. And if you look at the attributes of the Colgate brand, particularly in North America, we're seeing good movements in terms of how we measure the health of the equity. So good news there. Asia, likewise, good response. We've obviously seen a fall-off on our biggest business, which is Darlie due to the price increase. But the Colgate business overall, where we've added more support similarly is responding very, very well. And we couldn't be more happy with the progress we're seeing in Africa on the Oral Care business with the elevated increase that we're seeing. Advertising doesn't respond immediately. It takes quarters after quarters of consistent growth. And what\u2019s important, back to the quality of the P&L, is that with the quality of the P&L where it is, it allows us to sustain that advertising. In this quarter, you obviously saw us increase it. And that\u2019s clearly the strategy because over the long term, consistent levels of advertising play out for brands the best.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. Noel, you mentioned the balanced volume and pricing, obviously, impressive to see some of the green shoots in Africa and Eurasia. Can you talk also about the brand support above the line you mentioned in North America and elaborate more on that? And obviously, that has been a main drag to global volumes. And I understand it takes time, of course, to see volume share rebound. But do you see in terms of like when should we see some improvement there as you talk to your customers? And then sorry to get a second part of the question, but I want to understand also your impressive rebound in margins in the quarter came through. Even looking at your prepared remarks, you mentioned raw material and packaging, you still ahead of 540 basis points negative impact. So I'm thinking about the cadence of this inflation, if you can comment and then how we can expect that from here? I know you reiterated margins up, but I just want to see to the P&L, what would be the puts and takes there? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Andrea and good morning. So on above the line expenses, obviously, when you're in an environment of inflation and recovering cost and taking pricing either through list prices or revenue growth management, it involves a reallocation of your promotional dollars for two reasons. One, you want to ensure that when you're taking list price increases, you see that pricing in the market and you get consistency of implementation around the retail environment. So that was an important part of the second quarter pricing we took in North America. To do that, you need to pull back on some of your promotional volumes. That was done, one, because some of those promotional volumes are unprofitable. So as I mentioned earlier, we are very focused in North America on building brand health and getting back to consistent delivery of share growth with advertising and innovation through simply -- and simply taking some of the reliance on promotions away. Did we pull back a little bit too much perhaps? But we're going to be very thoughtful moving forward on how we put grocery net back into the North America business to ensure that we continue to grow margins and obviously grow share at the same time. But we will ensure that, that happens in the back half. But I can tell you that we're going to be very thoughtful on how we approach all the categories relative to promotions to ensure we maintain the margins in the P&L. And around the world, I think we were quite consistent with the above the line where we had list price increases. We were managing promotions. We'll have a little bit easier comps as we've talked about on pricing -- harder comps on pricing in the back half, but easier on volume. So I think we'll see a better balance between our organic growth as we move through the back half of the year, but we'll still see a little bit of pricing moving through, as I mentioned, upfront. On the margin line, clearly, very pleased with the progress that we're making both at the gross profit level and the operating margin level. And I remind everyone that our gross profit does not include logistics and cost of goods. So if you take logistics, obviously, we had a very strong quarter relative to gross profit acceleration. And our SG&A was down despite the fact that we took a 20% -- we implemented a 20% increase in advertising. Let me turn it over to Stan. He can give you a little bit of color on how we're thinking about raw materials phasing out through the balance of the second half.\nStan Sutula: Thanks, Noel. So raw materials, as we look towards the second half, we will see these moderate. But there are pockets that actually are going up, and predominantly, they're impacting Hill's. So around ag and proteins, those continue to escalate. So while on a year-on-year basis, these will moderate slightly coming off of the first half, they still will be a headwind in the second half of the year. Now we continue to drive funding the growth savings. The teams have done a really nice job on driving that productivity and we will carry that through the back half of the year as well. So we do expect margin to improve in the second half and continue that momentum. And then obviously, just as we look at FX, it's going to bounce around here a bit. And in particular, we've seen pressure in Africa, Eurasia countries as well as Asia-Pacific. So overall, we do expect margins to improve in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you. First, can you just elaborate a little bit on what the impact of logistics is just so we can kind of compare you to your peers? And then specifically on the U.S., could you just talk about the path forward? I mean, we talked about the -- what's driven some of the challenges so far in terms of volume. But could you talk about the actions that you're planning to take for the second half, whether it's some relaxation in terms of the pullback and reinstating perhaps some of the promotion or other actions that you're planning to take with respect to the U.S. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Olivia and good morning. I'd ask you to reference the Q on details on logistics. There's a lot more detail in there. And if you're not finding what you need, obviously follow up with John and Stan afterwards. On the volume cadence, certainly, as you look at the back half, as I mentioned, the comps get much easier. But despite that, we're going to be very deliberate in how we think about volume creation in the back half. We\u2019re going to be thoughtful, as I mentioned, continuing to focus on the structure of the P&L, which we believe is absolutely imperative for the long-term sustainability of the company. We think that we can keep the gross margin accelerating, we\u2019ll keep the advertising in the P&L and not simply chasing unprofitable volume. So we\u2019re going to be very focused on that. That being said, we do expect a slightly heightened promotional environment in the back half. As cost tend to level out, we\u2019ll see probably a little bit more promotions. I will say that around the world today, we have not seen an elevated promotional environment. We are recently starting to see more volume being sold on promotions but not the frequency of promotions there or the depth of promotions in the market. So that\u2019s an important aspect. But we\u2019re going to be very deliberate in how we think about the promotional cadence in the back half, probably a little bit more in the U.S. But the rest of the world will be very targeted where we see competitive needs to put more money there. But so far, it\u2019s been quite constructive. And we continue to believe pushing our brands through innovation and top \u2013 and advertising is the healthiest way to grow the business longer term.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for swapping me in. Stan mentioned earlier the elevated degree of inflation that's continuing to impact, but also the new price increases. How should we expect them to translate into margins? I mean, it's good to see the moderation in gross margin expansion this quarter. But we're still down a lot from where we were. What is the right level of profitability for that business on a normalized basis and what is the pathway to getting there?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. So again, we are taking aggressive pricing across the Hill's business, as you've seen through the recent quarters and we continue to see some inflationary prices on ag prices. Now do we think that's going to continue into '24? Unlikely, but we want to assure we continue to take pricing this year to recover that. Is there a number that we're targeting? No. We want to continue to do this in a very thoughtful way. We see real opportunities to continue to grow both gross profit and operating margin at Hill's in a healthy way quarter-to-quarter moving out, particularly given the pricing that we'll see flow through the back half of the P&L and hopefully a more benign cost environment. We also have mixed opportunities that we're very focused on as we get the new Tonganoxie up and running and the wet -- and we get wet capacity building that will allow a little bit of margin accretion on mix. So we're pleased with that. We're getting the productivity through the plants operating more efficiently. So we'll see that. And obviously, as the private label business comes off, that will be a natural organic accretion to both gross profit and operating profit at the end. So good aspects to \u2013 as we see the business projecting over time. We\u2019re going to ensure that we\u2019re competitive relative to pricing in the market. We\u2019re going to continue to ensure that we keep the high levels of advertising there on the Hill\u2019s business, which you saw in the quarter. So overall, we feel pretty good about the phasing of gross profit accretion moving forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nStephen Powers: Hey. Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask more of a general question on the state of the advertising industry as you see it. You talked obviously making increases, the 20% increase this quarter. I guess the question I'm left with is just how you're seeing the efficacy of that advertising. Do you believe the efficacy is up commensurate with the increased dollar investment or is there inflation or other dynamics cutting into that efficacy just as you the environment today as you plan ahead?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Steve and good morning. I'll take you back to CAGNY, when Eve (ph) presented a lot of our digital advancement and the digital transformation and ultimately how our focus on digital advertising is yielding a much higher ROI, we have the ability to analytically measure that much more effectively than we have in the past. Our copy effectiveness is getting much better. So we're seeing the efficacy delivered there through the brand health measures that I talked about earlier. We're obviously spending more money on generating first-party data. That allows us to obviously look more holistically across the market and get more targeted media that's more personalized and effective, which has been terrific. And as I mentioned upfront, the non-promoted volume share in the U.S. is a big metric for us because that clearly indicates that our advertising is driving more non-promoted share. So we were up about 100 basis points in non-promoted share and that's excellent. That's exactly what we want. Now we may have pulled back, as I mentioned, a little too much on the promotion, but we'll get the balance right as we move forward. So the efficacy overall, we're very pleased. And that's clearly demonstrated in some of the market share performances as we have around the world, where we've had elevated advertising to support that, particularly across some of the brands -- non-Colgate brands. I mentioned Sanex in Europe. We talked about the Suavitel business and the Axion business in Mexico, which is obviously well supported. So overall, we see a more healthy balance of advertising across our categories. And over time, this is going to lead to more sustainable growth.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. A quick follow-up and then my other question. Where your volumes are down, particularly in the U.S.? Has that gone to competitors or is it more of a function of consumers postponing purchase or orders being postponed? So that's just kind of the follow-up. And then my main question is, where you see yourself in digital and e-commerce. Arguably, a few years ago, you were unsatisfied and have made a lot of investments and they're certainly panning out particularly in China. Do you believe that you're kind of where you need to be, to be fully competitive globally in digital and e-commerce now? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Rob and good morning. So on the volume, particularly in the U.S., as I mentioned already, we saw some -- our promoted share fall-off across a couple of our categories in the U.S., as we pulled back on some of the promotions and established some of the new pricing. Where it's gone to is a multitude of the competitors, obviously, where they have not pulled back on their promotional levels as much. And therefore, we saw a little bit of migration to them. But clearly, that consumer typically responds to promotions, whether it's couponing or otherwise. And they're not that difficult to get back, but we want to get -- we want to get those consumers back in a much healthier way moving forward. So the overall structure of the U.S. P&L improves and that's pretty consistent around the world. When you pull back on promotions, you're going to have a highly driven consumer that looks at pricing and value, and you need to ensure that you're obviously providing that value moving forward. So we'll get the balance right. Our digital -- on that, we've talked a lot about our digital transformation, yeah, three years ago, we weren't where we needed to be. And I would say we're very, very pleased with where we are today. We do an external study with BCG, which assesses all of our peer group vis-a-vis their digital capabilities. And three years ago, we were below the peer group. Today, we are above the peer group. And we're not best-in-class yet, so we feel we've got more room to go. And Brigitte and Diana and Prabha and all the operating units are very focused on this, and we feel we\u2019ve got good plans in place to continue to advance that. And our goal is absolutely to become best-in-class.\nOperator: Next question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to maybe talk a little bit about Latin America. I know it's a market where you've been putting a lot of premium innovation in place. It's been a core part of the strategy, particularly in Oral Care. And yet there's significant inflation in some markets. So I was just curious for an update there may be on premiumization versus affordability, what you're seeing in terms of consumer trends outside of the reported results, but kind of what the dynamics are from a consumer environment standpoint and how you're managing those two ends of the pricing ladder. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Lauren and good morning. So you saw the results, another really strong organic sales growth for Latin America. And pleasingly, after five quarters of double-digit pricing, we saw volume improve in Latin America. And I think this is a good proxy for as we think about pricing in other markets and coupling that with strong advertising, ultimately the volume will come back. It's a quite resilient consumer. They're accustomed to inflationary pricing. But as long as you\u2019re bringing a collection of strong innovation and continuing their brand support, which is vitally important to come out of these tougher times with stronger brands, you see the volume return to category. So both Mexico and Brazil delivered volume growth in the quarter and both had very strong growth organically given the fact that they also took pricing. So overall, really pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in Latin America. And likewise, we\u2019re seeing the velocity and the turns improve more than we anticipated given some of the inflationary pressures in those markets. Now we shall watch it very carefully as the inflation continues to mount. But overall, structurally the P&Ls are in good shape, and the consumer seems to be quite responsive to the innovation and the pricing that we\u2019re putting in the market. So overall, we feel we\u2019re in a very good place.\nOperator: Question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yeah. Thanks and good morning. Wanted to ask a question on the Hill's business. Again, just maybe thinking about category than your business. So how are you thinking -- or what are you observing from the category standpoint? We can obviously see somewhat U.S. data, but curious how you think about it around the world that volumes overall are a little bit weaker. How much of that is a reflection of just all the pricing that you and your competitors are taking? Is there some of just sort of pause within the category over the -- after the last couple of years of really strong growth and adoption levels? And then longer term, how do you think about -- and maybe this goes to Jason's question a little bit, but how do you think about the contribution to price and mix and volumes for that business over time? And how does that contribute to improving margins relative to where we are? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Mark. So clearly, another strong quarter for Hill's, double-digit organic sales growth despite lapping. And I remind everyone that we're lapping 18% growth in the year ago period. So obviously, a really strong quarter. And the quarter a year ago was mid-single digit volume, so ultimately, a good quarter. And on a two-year stack, we were up. So looking quite strong. Categories softened a little bit towards the end of the category -- I mean, excuse me, the end of the quarter. You would expect that given the amount of pricing that\u2019s gone into that over the last three or four quarters. But overall, Europe continues to be very strong. U.S., strong despite very high comps. We anticipate that we\u2019ll see a little bit of sluggishness as we move forward in the categories, only because of all the pricing that\u2019s been taken. But that will be more around the discretionary items in pet specialty than food. Nutrition seems to be okay. I walked stores with some of the CEOs of the big pet specialty retailers recently, and they seem quite bullish relative to the nutritional and particularly the premium segment of the market, where you don\u2019t see a live elasticity in terms of when consumers trade off of diets, particularly on our prescription side. But we\u2019re going to have to watch that quite carefully because there\u2019s been a lot of pricing that\u2019s going into the category. Emerging markets continues to be a real growth opportunity for us. It\u2019s small for us right now, but we need to continue to focus on those opportunities, particularly in Latin America and in Southeast Asia, to a certain extent. So overall, you\u2019ll see us focus on those moving forward. But the categories continue to be quite robust, particularly given the growth headwind \u2013 growth head space that we have in emerging markets given we don\u2019t have high penetration there. So overall, we feel pretty good, but we\u2019re cautious on ultimately how the category continues to evolve from a volume standpoint as we see a lot of pricing going in those categories. But again, getting the P&L structured right, getting gross margin up consistently over the next couple of quarters will be very important for us to maintain the high advertising levels that are so critical to drive penetration in that category.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So just a couple quick follow-ups for me. Just -- and apologies for asking a North America question. This is more about making sure expectations are set and we know how to think about this going forward. But a little bit of promotions come back in, but you're really focusing on a more sustainable total P&L. Could still see some volume pressure for a bit until you lap some of these strategy adjustments that you made. And by the time we get beyond that, perhaps the volumes start to smooth out a bit more. So am I characterizing that correctly? And then second, just a quick clarification or follow-up. Olivia asked a question about freight. I think the 10-Q just says the year-over-year change. Dan, you had said 9.5% of sales was the freight number in Q1 and you expected it to trend low 9s for the rest of the year. Did that come through in the quarter? So thanks so much on those two items.\nNoel Wallace: Let me -- Stan answer the logistics question, then I'll get back to your North American question.\nStan Sutula: Yeah. So logistics is playing out like we expected and improved slightly from the previous quarter. And we expect that, that improvement will also continue in the second half.\nNoel Wallace: Chris, on North America, so I think you said it well. I mean, we're looking very deliberately to improve the structure of that P&L as we move forward. Again, it's -- the inherent objective there is to improve brand health. So we will clearly continue to fund advertising. We will be very choiceful on where we start to look at elevating promotions to recover some of that promotional share. Our focus is driving non-promoted share moving forward. But we need to be careful that we're not pulling back too much there. So we'll monitor that moving forward. And we'll see, I think from quarter-to-quarter, there will be a little bit of volatility in the gross margin line as we move forward as we see costs ultimately level out and where the pricing and the mix ends up. But we feel good about the back half relative to our ability to continue to drive operating margin expansion. I remind everyone that North America -- the North America HPC business is about 20% of our total business. And what is so nice about the Colgate business is that we have such diversity of our business around the world that as we need to fund opportunities in North America or Asia, we will have the ability to pull from certain regions around the world. So we\u2019re well balanced in that regard. And I think North America has a good plan for the back half and we\u2019ll be very deliberate on their spending and their focus on recovering some of the share loss that we\u2019ve had in the quarter.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. So I wanted to just circle back to the top line growth, which the second half organic sales guidance is still relatively wide and implies a decent slowdown, which makes sense as you start to cycle pricing. Can you maybe just talk about the moving pieces that would put organic revenue growth at the higher end or the lower end of that range as we move forward here? And maybe specifically, you mentioned several times throughout this call the sequential improvement on a two-year stack for volume. And just given the step up in investment innovation, should we expect that trend to continue as we move into the back half of the year? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. So it's tough to nail down exactly how the balance will end up. I mean, we'll have to watch it very carefully. It's going to differ by category and by geography. But clearly, the comps get easier from a volume standpoint in the back half. You heard me mention around 500 basis points. So that will certainly be a nice tailwind for us. And obviously, the comps on pricing get a little bit more challenging in the back half as we move forward. But we feel very good relative to the guidance that we provided and comfortable that we can achieve that. But we'll see how the categories behave, if the consumer continues to be rather fickle around the world. But as I mentioned, it's been very constructive promotionally. And so far, the resilience, particularly in markets like Latin America, and to a certain extent, Africa, had been very, very good where we've taken a lot of pricing. We'll watch North America quite closely. And obviously, we think we continue to have a lot of hedge based on the Hill's business as we continue to drive penetration and share growth, which, incidentally, I didn't talk shares on Hill's. They continue to respond very, very well with share growth in the quarter across most of our recipes, which is terrific. So we feel good about where we are in the guidance and we'll see where it ultimately ends up. Obviously, if there's upside, we'll take it. But we feel good that we're in a range that is responsible to continuing to keep the structure of the P&L the way it is. Relative to -- the second part of your question was on -- was on advertising, Peter or what was it on?\nPeter Grom: No. It was just the sequential improvement on a two-year stack basis. Just recognizing that the comps get easier, if the two-year stack improves, what does that actually imply? Because it would seem to imply it does improve that there could be some nice improvement in return to volume growth in the back half of the year?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah, exactly. And you said it well. I think we'll start to see a return to volume growth in the back half of the year. The two-year stacks, as I mentioned upfront have continued to accelerate. We'll have to -- my expectation, you'd probably see that moderate a bit as we move through the back half, but volumes will improve. And as I mentioned, we still have some pricing coming through that we've taken this year, so we'll see the benefit of that and a little bit of the flow-through from last year. So overall, I think we\u2019ll have a more balanced composition as we move through the back half of the year.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A portion of the call.\nNoel Wallace: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, and thanks for the questions this morning. We continue to appreciate your interest in our company. Clearly, we had a strong quarter and I hope you agree, the strategies and the plans in place to deliver consistent compounded profitable growth are there and that will allow us to drive increased shareholder value. We couldn't do this without the incredible efforts from Colgate people all over the world who continue to focus on execution of our strategy and the consistency of delivery. So I thank them and I look forward to talking to everyone in the third quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. So a few quick thoughts this morning on our strong quarter of top and bottom line growth and clearly along with the improved 2023 outlook we provided. On the first quarter call, you'll recall, I highlighted three priorities for the year, driving organic sales growth as we face tougher comparisons, executing on productivity and revenue growth management to fund brand investment, while also delivering on our earnings targets, and improving our cash flow performance. While not without its challenges, in Q2, we made strong progress on all three of these. On organic sales growth, Q2 showed the strength of our global portfolio as we delivered our strongest quarterly growth on a two-year stack basis since Q3 2008, with both organic volume and pricing growth accelerating on a two-year stack basis. We delivered organic sales growth in all six divisions and in each of our categories grew in the mid-single digits or higher. We are laser-focused on returning to balanced organic sales growth and we believe the investments we are making, combined with easier comparisons, give us a path to improved volume growth going forward as we leverage increased brand support and innovation while still delivering profit growth. The strength of our revenue growth management efforts, combined with our progress on funding the growth, drove improvement in our gross margin both sequentially and year-over-year. Our Base Business SG&A was down 30 basis points in the quarter. A strong sales growth, lower logistics costs and the benefits of our 2022 global productivity initiative drove operating leverage even as we increased advertising spending by 20%. Combined with our gross margin expansion, we delivered 60 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter. This enabled us to deliver upside versus expectations in the quarter despite continued pressure from below the line items, including the impact of higher interest rates and tax. As you've heard me say, it's just virtuous combination of growth driven leverage, revenue growth management, cost containment and productivity to drive investments in capabilities and brand building which drove the strong quality of this quarter's results. We believe it also lays the groundwork for our performance across the balance of the year and into the future. And finally, our strong cash flow performance continued in the quarter, which is helping us offset some of these below the line headwinds. Free cash flow was up more than 50% in the quarter and is more than up -- up more than 80% year-to-date through net income growth and improved working capital performance and pleasingly, particularly in inventories and payables. So I'm pleased with how we started the year, but I'm also well aware of the challenges and uncertainty ahead of us. Our goal is to deliver consistent, high quality compounded top and bottom line growth to drive shareholder value. And I believe Colgate-Palmolive has the brands, the global footprint and the people to deliver. So with that, I'll turn it over to the Q&A. Hi, Dara (ph). Sure. Thanks, Dara. So let me go back to a couple of the comments I made in my opening statement and really talk about how we're trying to work to improve the quality of the P&L, which puts us in the best position to drive compounded long-term balanced growth top and bottom line, which is what we've been talking about for quite some time. As you know, we're coming out of what has been the worst raw material environment in decades. So our plan is with the combination of the revenue wealth management we talked about and the discipline that we're putting across the company in that area, more pricing and productivity, we can restore our gross margins and that's been the key focus. We believe that if we exit this type of environment with a structurally lower gross margin, you're going to be in a hole that's very difficult to dig yourself out of in the future, particularly because you need the gross margin to fund the investment in capabilities and the brand building, which you certainly saw in the quarter. We want to grow margins while still investing behind our brands and sustain a consistent organic sales growth, which we're clearly demonstrating. The key to do is getting pricing in the P&L. We certainly focused our teams on the ground in that area because the depth and duration of this cost inflation that we're experiencing has been an issue and you simply can't do it with one round of pricing. It needs to be consistent and deliberate and purposeful. And now as we look at cost inflation slowing overall, there are still places where we see margin pressure. So we -- of course, we need to take additional pricing, and this has had an impact on the volume. Maybe a couple of examples. China is a good example. We've taken pricing on our Hawley & Hazel joint venture in order to improve profitability long-term to drive the necessary investments in digital, the premium innovation required in that market and a continued shift to e-commerce. And as you know, China is a very difficult market in which to take pricing. And in the short term, that hasn't -- that's had an impact on our volume through lower promotions and wholesaler inventories as we look to set the new pricing in the market. But the long-term implications of not restoring margins are more problematic. I'd go on to North America as well, where we're working to improve the health of our business and our brands through shifting more consistent brand support from above the net revenue line to obviously into margin expansion. This will improve health of our brands and our P&L. We're seeing this play out in our non-promoted share, which is growing, which is a healthy way to grow the business. In the short term, was the volume impact from reduced promotions more than we expected? Yes, it was. But the good news is, we've adjusted the P&L, we've strengthened it and we can adjust moving forward as we see the opportunities provide themselves. So while we're delivering both sales and profit growth along with increases in brand support in the middle of the P&L, it's clearly a healthier way to drive the business. If I look at the Hill's business, we're still seeing high levels of cost inflation, as you've heard us talk about in the first quarter and gross margins are still down year-over-year. So we've taken additional pricing to get the right margin structure for this business for the long-term. Much of the Hill's volume decline in the quarter was in emerging markets as much of the time is due to go-to-market changes or shipments that we had. The good news is the EMEA or our Europe business, and particularly there we were strong, U.S. volumes were only down slightly in the quarter against a very difficult comparison with pricing as you saw up in the teens. But we're focused on getting Hill's back to volume growth the right way. This is a business that responds very well to science driven innovation and strong advertising. We want to make sure that it's well funded and through the gross margin expansion that you've seen. And Hill's saw the biggest advertising increases in brand building in this quarter and will continue to fuel that investment. So I understand the importance of gaining volume growth, as you asked. We know we're all focused on that and as you are. But as I said, we want to do that in a way that sets us up structurally for long-term profitable growth. That means a good visibility towards restoring our gross margin to previous levels through revenue growth management and productivity that we've been talking about, well-funded advertising and the ability to drive operating leverage with the strong innovation that we're bringing to the market and healthier brands. So with a lot of great work by Colgate people, we have gross margin, overheads and logistics trending positively. We just finished the first half where we increased advertising by 17%. We have put additional pricing in place. We have strong innovation across all the divisions and categories. And we have second half volume comps that are easier by about 500 basis points. So we feel we're very well positioned. So with that, let me turn it over to the other questions. Sure. Let me just come back to a quick finish on Dara's point. He asked about market shares. Dara, so our market share -- global market shares are up on toothpaste around the world. Strong growth obviously in Europe, a little softness in North America, as you've seen in the scanner data. And we're obviously addressing that as we go into the back half. Latin America shares look good. Asia shares look good. Africa shares look really, really strong. We're up or flat in all the 11 markets where we read shares there. So overall, oral toothpaste shares are pretty good. Filippo, on your question with regarding the pricing, certainly in some of the higher inflationary markets, we will probably still see pricing in the back half of the year. Take Turkey, take Argentina, take Pakistan and some of the other higher inflationary areas around the world. We took pricing in the second quarter in North America. Obviously, that had some impact on volume in the quarter. But we'll see deliberate and very focused pricing where we have margin pressure. On the Hill's business, clearly, we've seen ag prices accelerate through 2022 and into '23. So we're taking pricing commensurate with that as we move into the back half. But it will be more isolated and targeted the bigger price increases are in the P&L. And as you heard us talk about, we took a lot of pricing in 2022. About 58% of the pricing in the P&L this year is flow through from last year. So we still have a little bit to go, but most of it is in the P&L already. Absolutely. Thanks, Bryan. Yeah. I'll start with Europe. Obviously, we've increased investment there and we're seeing terrific response to particularly the elmex and meridol brands where we've elevated our investment there, but likewise, on the Colgate brand. So a lot of the efforts that we've had on premium whitening have played out to drive incremental share in Europe. So that investment across that business is certainly playing out. But importantly, the investment in Europe is broader based than just Oral Care. We have a wonderful relaunch on Sanex, that's underway across Europe. We're putting investment behind that. We relaunched our Soupline business in France, which is a big business for us. And we've launched the Suavitel -- the Soupline Hearts, which we're putting investment behind that. So I think what's important is with operating margins back to growth, it's giving us a lot more flexibility to support a wide array of brands, particularly in Europe. And that would be the case likewise in Latin America, where we've obviously seen a little pickup in exchange. So on a local currency basis, we're getting more advertising. And I'd also point to the fact that we're getting more efficient and targeted with our advertising with some of our digital skills that we're implementing across the world. North America, it's taking a little bit more time. You certainly have seen the promoted share fall off. But as I mentioned in my comments to Dara, the important thing is our non-promoted volume share is growing. And that's a clear reflection of the fact that we've increased support on the brand and building the health of the brand. And if you look at the attributes of the Colgate brand, particularly in North America, we're seeing good movements in terms of how we measure the health of the equity. So good news there. Asia, likewise, good response. We've obviously seen a fall-off on our biggest business, which is Darlie due to the price increase. But the Colgate business overall, where we've added more support similarly is responding very, very well. And we couldn't be more happy with the progress we're seeing in Africa on the Oral Care business with the elevated increase that we're seeing. Advertising doesn't respond immediately. It takes quarters after quarters of consistent growth. And what's important, back to the quality of the P&L, is that with the quality of the P&L where it is, it allows us to sustain that advertising. In this quarter, you obviously saw us increase it. And that's clearly the strategy because over the long term, consistent levels of advertising play out for brands the best. Sure. Thanks, Andrea and good morning. So on above the line expenses, obviously, when you're in an environment of inflation and recovering cost and taking pricing either through list prices or revenue growth management, it involves a reallocation of your promotional dollars for two reasons. One, you want to ensure that when you're taking list price increases, you see that pricing in the market and you get consistency of implementation around the retail environment. So that was an important part of the second quarter pricing we took in North America. To do that, you need to pull back on some of your promotional volumes. That was done, one, because some of those promotional volumes are unprofitable. So as I mentioned earlier, we are very focused in North America on building brand health and getting back to consistent delivery of share growth with advertising and innovation through simply -- and simply taking some of the reliance on promotions away. Did we pull back a little bit too much perhaps? But we're going to be very thoughtful moving forward on how we put grocery net back into the North America business to ensure that we continue to grow margins and obviously grow share at the same time. But we will ensure that, that happens in the back half. But I can tell you that we're going to be very thoughtful on how we approach all the categories relative to promotions to ensure we maintain the margins in the P&L. And around the world, I think we were quite consistent with the above the line where we had list price increases. We were managing promotions. We'll have a little bit easier comps as we've talked about on pricing -- harder comps on pricing in the back half, but easier on volume. So I think we'll see a better balance between our organic growth as we move through the back half of the year, but we'll still see a little bit of pricing moving through, as I mentioned, upfront. On the margin line, clearly, very pleased with the progress that we're making both at the gross profit level and the operating margin level. And I remind everyone that our gross profit does not include logistics and cost of goods. So if you take logistics, obviously, we had a very strong quarter relative to gross profit acceleration. And our SG&A was down despite the fact that we took a 20% -- we implemented a 20% increase in advertising. Let me turn it over to Stan. He can give you a little bit of color on how we're thinking about raw materials phasing out through the balance of the second half. Sure. Thanks, Olivia and good morning. I'd ask you to reference the Q on details on logistics. There's a lot more detail in there. And if you're not finding what you need, obviously follow up with John and Stan afterwards. On the volume cadence, certainly, as you look at the back half, as I mentioned, the comps get much easier. But despite that, we're going to be very deliberate in how we think about volume creation in the back half. We're going to be thoughtful, as I mentioned, continuing to focus on the structure of the P&L, which we believe is absolutely imperative for the long-term sustainability of the company. We think that we can keep the gross margin accelerating, we'll keep the advertising in the P&L and not simply chasing unprofitable volume. So we're going to be very focused on that. That being said, we do expect a slightly heightened promotional environment in the back half. As cost tend to level out, we'll see probably a little bit more promotions. I will say that around the world today, we have not seen an elevated promotional environment. We are recently starting to see more volume being sold on promotions but not the frequency of promotions there or the depth of promotions in the market. So that's an important aspect. But we're going to be very deliberate in how we think about the promotional cadence in the back half, probably a little bit more in the U.S. But the rest of the world will be very targeted where we see competitive needs to put more money there. But so far, it's been quite constructive. And we continue to believe pushing our brands through innovation and top \u2013 and advertising is the healthiest way to grow the business longer term. Yeah. Thanks, Jason. So again, we are taking aggressive pricing across the Hill's business, as you've seen through the recent quarters and we continue to see some inflationary prices on ag prices. Now do we think that's going to continue into '24? Unlikely, but we want to assure we continue to take pricing this year to recover that. Is there a number that we're targeting? No. We want to continue to do this in a very thoughtful way. We see real opportunities to continue to grow both gross profit and operating margin at Hill's in a healthy way quarter-to-quarter moving out, particularly given the pricing that we'll see flow through the back half of the P&L and hopefully a more benign cost environment. We also have mixed opportunities that we're very focused on as we get the new Tonganoxie up and running and the wet -- and we get wet capacity building that will allow a little bit of margin accretion on mix. So we're pleased with that. We're getting the productivity through the plants operating more efficiently. So we'll see that. And obviously, as the private label business comes off, that will be a natural organic accretion to both gross profit and operating profit at the end. So good aspects to \u2013 as we see the business projecting over time. We're going to ensure that we're competitive relative to pricing in the market. We're going to continue to ensure that we keep the high levels of advertising there on the Hill's business, which you saw in the quarter. So overall, we feel pretty good about the phasing of gross profit accretion moving forward. Yeah. Thanks, Steve and good morning. I'll take you back to CAGNY, when Eve (ph) presented a lot of our digital advancement and the digital transformation and ultimately how our focus on digital advertising is yielding a much higher ROI, we have the ability to analytically measure that much more effectively than we have in the past. Our copy effectiveness is getting much better. So we're seeing the efficacy delivered there through the brand health measures that I talked about earlier. We're obviously spending more money on generating first-party data. That allows us to obviously look more holistically across the market and get more targeted media that's more personalized and effective, which has been terrific. And as I mentioned upfront, the non-promoted volume share in the U.S. is a big metric for us because that clearly indicates that our advertising is driving more non-promoted share. So we were up about 100 basis points in non-promoted share and that's excellent. That's exactly what we want. Now we may have pulled back, as I mentioned, a little too much on the promotion, but we'll get the balance right as we move forward. So the efficacy overall, we're very pleased. And that's clearly demonstrated in some of the market share performances as we have around the world, where we've had elevated advertising to support that, particularly across some of the brands -- non-Colgate brands. I mentioned Sanex in Europe. We talked about the Suavitel business and the Axion business in Mexico, which is obviously well supported. So overall, we see a more healthy balance of advertising across our categories. And over time, this is going to lead to more sustainable growth. Yeah. Thanks, Rob and good morning. So on the volume, particularly in the U.S., as I mentioned already, we saw some -- our promoted share fall-off across a couple of our categories in the U.S., as we pulled back on some of the promotions and established some of the new pricing. Where it's gone to is a multitude of the competitors, obviously, where they have not pulled back on their promotional levels as much. And therefore, we saw a little bit of migration to them. But clearly, that consumer typically responds to promotions, whether it's couponing or otherwise. And they're not that difficult to get back, but we want to get -- we want to get those consumers back in a much healthier way moving forward. So the overall structure of the U.S. P&L improves and that's pretty consistent around the world. When you pull back on promotions, you're going to have a highly driven consumer that looks at pricing and value, and you need to ensure that you're obviously providing that value moving forward. So we'll get the balance right. Our digital -- on that, we've talked a lot about our digital transformation, yeah, three years ago, we weren't where we needed to be. And I would say we're very, very pleased with where we are today. We do an external study with BCG, which assesses all of our peer group vis-a-vis their digital capabilities. And three years ago, we were below the peer group. Today, we are above the peer group. And we're not best-in-class yet, so we feel we've got more room to go. And Brigitte and Diana and Prabha and all the operating units are very focused on this, and we feel we've got good plans in place to continue to advance that. And our goal is absolutely to become best-in-class. Yeah. Thanks, Lauren and good morning. So you saw the results, another really strong organic sales growth for Latin America. And pleasingly, after five quarters of double-digit pricing, we saw volume improve in Latin America. And I think this is a good proxy for as we think about pricing in other markets and coupling that with strong advertising, ultimately the volume will come back. It's a quite resilient consumer. They're accustomed to inflationary pricing. But as long as you're bringing a collection of strong innovation and continuing their brand support, which is vitally important to come out of these tougher times with stronger brands, you see the volume return to category. So both Mexico and Brazil delivered volume growth in the quarter and both had very strong growth organically given the fact that they also took pricing. So overall, really pleased with what we're seeing in Latin America. And likewise, we're seeing the velocity and the turns improve more than we anticipated given some of the inflationary pressures in those markets. Now we shall watch it very carefully as the inflation continues to mount. But overall, structurally the P&Ls are in good shape, and the consumer seems to be quite responsive to the innovation and the pricing that we're putting in the market. So overall, we feel we're in a very good place. Yeah. Thanks, Mark. So clearly, another strong quarter for Hill's, double-digit organic sales growth despite lapping. And I remind everyone that we're lapping 18% growth in the year ago period. So obviously, a really strong quarter. And the quarter a year ago was mid-single digit volume, so ultimately, a good quarter. And on a two-year stack, we were up. So looking quite strong. Categories softened a little bit towards the end of the category -- I mean, excuse me, the end of the quarter. You would expect that given the amount of pricing that's gone into that over the last three or four quarters. But overall, Europe continues to be very strong. U.S., strong despite very high comps. We anticipate that we'll see a little bit of sluggishness as we move forward in the categories, only because of all the pricing that's been taken. But that will be more around the discretionary items in pet specialty than food. Nutrition seems to be okay. I walked stores with some of the CEOs of the big pet specialty retailers recently, and they seem quite bullish relative to the nutritional and particularly the premium segment of the market, where you don't see a live elasticity in terms of when consumers trade off of diets, particularly on our prescription side. But we're going to have to watch that quite carefully because there's been a lot of pricing that's going into the category. Emerging markets continues to be a real growth opportunity for us. It's small for us right now, but we need to continue to focus on those opportunities, particularly in Latin America and in Southeast Asia, to a certain extent. So overall, you'll see us focus on those moving forward. But the categories continue to be quite robust, particularly given the growth headwind \u2013 growth head space that we have in emerging markets given we don't have high penetration there. So overall, we feel pretty good, but we're cautious on ultimately how the category continues to evolve from a volume standpoint as we see a lot of pricing going in those categories. But again, getting the P&L structured right, getting gross margin up consistently over the next couple of quarters will be very important for us to maintain the high advertising levels that are so critical to drive penetration in that category. Let me -- Stan answer the logistics question, then I'll get back to your North American question. Chris, on North America, so I think you said it well. I mean, we're looking very deliberately to improve the structure of that P&L as we move forward. Again, it's -- the inherent objective there is to improve brand health. So we will clearly continue to fund advertising. We will be very choiceful on where we start to look at elevating promotions to recover some of that promotional share. Our focus is driving non-promoted share moving forward. But we need to be careful that we're not pulling back too much there. So we'll monitor that moving forward. And we'll see, I think from quarter-to-quarter, there will be a little bit of volatility in the gross margin line as we move forward as we see costs ultimately level out and where the pricing and the mix ends up. But we feel good about the back half relative to our ability to continue to drive operating margin expansion. I remind everyone that North America -- the North America HPC business is about 20% of our total business. And what is so nice about the Colgate business is that we have such diversity of our business around the world that as we need to fund opportunities in North America or Asia, we will have the ability to pull from certain regions around the world. So we're well balanced in that regard. And I think North America has a good plan for the back half and we'll be very deliberate on their spending and their focus on recovering some of the share loss that we've had in the quarter. Yeah. So it's tough to nail down exactly how the balance will end up. I mean, we'll have to watch it very carefully. It's going to differ by category and by geography. But clearly, the comps get easier from a volume standpoint in the back half. You heard me mention around 500 basis points. So that will certainly be a nice tailwind for us. And obviously, the comps on pricing get a little bit more challenging in the back half as we move forward. But we feel very good relative to the guidance that we provided and comfortable that we can achieve that. But we'll see how the categories behave, if the consumer continues to be rather fickle around the world. But as I mentioned, it's been very constructive promotionally. And so far, the resilience, particularly in markets like Latin America, and to a certain extent, Africa, had been very, very good where we've taken a lot of pricing. We'll watch North America quite closely. And obviously, we think we continue to have a lot of hedge based on the Hill's business as we continue to drive penetration and share growth, which, incidentally, I didn't talk shares on Hill's. They continue to respond very, very well with share growth in the quarter across most of our recipes, which is terrific. So we feel good about where we are in the guidance and we'll see where it ultimately ends up. Obviously, if there's upside, we'll take it. But we feel good that we're in a range that is responsible to continuing to keep the structure of the P&L the way it is. Relative to -- the second part of your question was on -- was on advertising, Peter or what was it on? Yeah, exactly. And you said it well. I think we'll start to see a return to volume growth in the back half of the year. The two-year stacks, as I mentioned upfront have continued to accelerate. We'll have to -- my expectation, you'd probably see that moderate a bit as we move through the back half, but volumes will improve. And as I mentioned, we still have some pricing coming through that we've taken this year, so we'll see the benefit of that and a little bit of the flow-through from last year. So overall, I think we'll have a more balanced composition as we move through the back half of the year. Great. Well, thank you, everyone, and thanks for the questions this morning. We continue to appreciate your interest in our company. Clearly, we had a strong quarter and I hope you agree, the strategies and the plans in place to deliver consistent compounded profitable growth are there and that will allow us to drive increased shareholder value. We couldn't do this without the incredible efforts from Colgate people all over the world who continue to focus on execution of our strategy and the consistency of delivery. So I thank them and I look forward to talking to everyone in the third quarter."

            "name": "Stan Sutula",
            "content": "Thanks, Noel. So raw materials, as we look towards the second half, we will see these moderate. But there are pockets that actually are going up, and predominantly, they're impacting Hill's. So around ag and proteins, those continue to escalate. So while on a year-on-year basis, these will moderate slightly coming off of the first half, they still will be a headwind in the second half of the year. Now we continue to drive funding the growth savings. The teams have done a really nice job on driving that productivity and we will carry that through the back half of the year as well. So we do expect margin to improve in the second half and continue that momentum. And then obviously, just as we look at FX, it's going to bounce around here a bit. And in particular, we've seen pressure in Africa, Eurasia countries as well as Asia-Pacific. So overall, we do expect margins to improve in the back half of the year. Yeah. So logistics is playing out like we expected and improved slightly from the previous quarter. And we expect that, that improvement will also continue in the second half."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&A, John Faucher.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Allison. Good morning, and welcome to our 2023 first quarter earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Table 6 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q1 results and our 2023 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can tell from our press release and the earnings materials, we had a strong start to 2023, and the momentum on our business gives us confidence to raise our net and organic sales growth guidance and to raise the lower end of our base business earnings per share growth guidance for the year. We did this because with the quarter of the year gone, we see less risk from some of the macroeconomic and geopolitical issues that we were concerned about earlier in the year. That said, there is still notable uncertainty surrounding the balance of the year, particularly in the second half. Since the commentary focuses on the results, I want to focus my remarks on three of our priorities that Colgate people are focused on. Priority one is driving organic sales growth as we face tougher comparisons. We will utilize our enterprise-wide capabilities in innovation and revenue growth management, along with a firm commitment to marketing spending to return to a balanced algorithm of pricing and volume growth. The pricing we have taken over the past two years helps provide us with the flexibility to fund increased brand investment to support our pricing, build brand health, and drive volume and household penetration. We know that the competitive environment is going to be difficult, but we have a brand portfolio that is built for times like these, and we look forward to driving growth and market share performance moving now. Priority two is delivering our productivity to fund the brand investment while we're also delivering on our earnings targets. We had a strong start to the year for both Funding the Growth and our 2022 global productivity initiative and we are laser-focused on delivering against or exceeding our goals for the year. We still foresee year-over-year headwinds to earnings per share growth from raw and packaging materials, foreign exchange and below-the-line items, so driving productivity in the middle of our P&L is vital. And finally, we are focused on improving our cash flow performance. Again, we had a strong start to the year with both operating cash flow and free cash flow up and we know there is still opportunity for further improvement. We will utilize this cash flow to fund the growth in capital expenditures to return cash to shareholders through dividends and to drive earnings leverage through paying down debt and repurchasing shares.  So I'm pleased with how we started the year, but I'm also well aware of the challenges and uncertainty ahead for us. Colgate-Palmolive, however, has the brands, the capabilities and the people to deliver in this environment. So with that, I'll take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys, good morning. So clearly, strong top line results in Q1, but we're also obviously in a period of outsized pricing. And the question is sort of where do we land as the pricing trails off? So just A, just can you discuss your confidence that volume will recover going forward as pricing drops off? I know it's a bit of an unanswerable question at this point, but how do you think about that dynamic ahead of time and manage your business to drive sustained volume growth as you look out longer term? And B, maybe as a bit of a window into that performance when category pricing drops off, can you just talk about your market share performance in Q1 in some of your key regions and product categories and if the strategies are working in terms of driving improved market share trends?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Dara. Let me come back again to the strategy that we've been deploying over obviously the last couple of years and continues to execute against the initiatives that we've talked about, particularly at CAGNY, and that's driving the core and adjacencies and channels. And you see the progress we're making against all three of those, obviously delivering sequential volume growth in the quarter. So we had five of the six divisions sequentially up in the first quarter. North America was down. But if you pull the Fabuloso recall out of the North America business, North America would have been up sequentially as well. And all of this plays back to our belief that the strategy clearly is working to deliver improved volume despite the fact that we continue to take significant pricing across all of our geographies and our categories. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing, and we expect sequential volume improvement as we move through the year to go fear. Now that is contemplated on a consumer environment that remains where it is. We shall see where the consumer goes relative to the level of inflation being absorbed in the marketplace, but we feel strongly that we've got the right portfolio of brands across price points, the right innovation, the right channel strategies, particularly where consumers are shopping today to continue to drive growth. Importantly, as we saw in the quarter, our Oral Care business was up double digit, and that's both positive pricing and positive volume in toothpaste, and we saw good share growth in the first quarter on toothpaste in North America. Good -- very strong share growth across Europe. Flat shares in Europe -- excuse me, in Latin America, and good share growth in Asia. So overall, we feel good about where we are from a consumption standpoint and the strategies that we're executing and expect sequential volume improvement as we move through the back half of the year. And as you said, pricing will get more challenging as we lap the back half. And certainly, in the second quarter, which was a strong quarter for us, where we had strong pricing and volume in that quarter, we'll expect a little bit of pullback from there. But overall, we feel good about the momentum we're behind the business right now.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi.\nFilippo Falorni : Can you talk about the consumer health in your key emerging markets? What are you seeing in terms of response to recent price increases? And then as you mentioned, like the second half, obviously, a lot of uncertainty. Maybe can you compare and contrast how do you see the consumer environment evolving in emerging markets compared to your more developed markets like the U.S. and Europe?\nNoel Wallace : Yes. Emerging was strong. You saw obviously double-digit organic in the quarter. Sequentially, again, volumes performing better than they did in the first quarter. And if you look at the pricing that we've taken in emerging markets, over the last three quarters, quite frankly, we're pretty pleased with the fact that the volume sequentially continues to improve. Now that being said, we've got strong innovation in emerging markets and you've seen the level of advertising that we're putting back into the business. That gives us, again, confidence that we're able to sustain that advertising as we move into the back half of the year, and we intend to continue to do everything we can to increase that advertising support in the back half, particularly in emerging markets in order to: one, support the innovation we have; second, drive the pricing into the market and continue to accelerate volume growth in the category. So overall, emerging pretty good. We were really pleased with the progress in both Latin America, Africa and Asia, particularly in China, strong growth in all three of those regions, particularly in the key markets of Mexico, Brazil and China and South Africa. So good progress across emerging markets and shares holding up, a little more elasticity as you would expect given the level of pricing that we've taken in emerging markets. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we stand in that regard. As it relates to the second half, time will tell. As I mentioned upfront, we'll see the compounding impact of pricing across many categories as we move into the back half. And I expect a better balance between pricing and volume as we move through the back half, but we shall see. The good news is we've got strong innovation. We've got the pricing in the P&L, which is really important in order to get the flexibility that we need to drive the business in the back half of the year. And we feel we've got a good channel strategy to ensure, as I mentioned upfront, that we're capturing the omnichannel impact of how consumers are shopping today.\nOperator: Next question will come from Peter Grom of UBS.\nPeter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So I appreciate all the commentary on inflation in the prepared remarks. But maybe as a point of reference, Stan, is the $300 million to $400 million headwind that we discussed on the last call, is that still a reasonable range? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is the dollar impact from the 770 basis point headwind in the bridge, this morning you\u2019re you pretty close to that range from a dollar perspective. So -- and I realize there's more than just inflation in that line. But is there just any way to frame either what inflation was within that number? Or how to think about that component of the bridge more broadly as we move through the balance of the year?\nStan Sutula: Yes. Thanks, Peter. So first, as we look at that inflation level, that $300 million to $400 million range is still the range that we're seeing on commodities. But there's really a tail underneath this. And in particular, around ag that affects predominantly Hill's, those prices still remain elevated. We don't see a lot of relief coming on those, and we see that kind of continuing as we go through the year. That's the main driver of our range, which is why we haven't seen it come down more. If you look at the other categories, like we do for toothpaste, Home Care, Oral Care and Personal Care, those have moderated more, and that was reflected in our guidance for the year, and they stayed reasonably balanced. So as we look out -- remember, we're essentially locked in here for Q2. We have locking already in place for Q3 and a little bit less for Q4, I still that as the viable range going into the back end of the year.  Now what happens is on a year-on-year impact, we wrap around on the very significant increases last year. The pricing that we've taken helps to moderate this. And then as you saw, we had an exceptionally good start to Funding the Growth this year, and that has also helped to mitigate that. That gives us the confidence to say that we will increase margins as we go through the year despite the fact that we expect that the commodities are still going to be in this range due to inflation.\nOperator: The next question will come from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.\nKevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congrats on a strong result here. Noel, question for you on reinvestment. So obviously, strong results here. You guys are getting the top line payback that you'd hoped for. You're seeing gross profit come through. You've made it a point since you come in -- since you came in, just increased advertising levels and seen that. The advertising and marketing as a percent of sales was high even by historical standards. That's a good thing, of course. How are you thinking about reinvestment levels should you exceed on gross profit? Number one. And then number two, realizing that it's top line payback and profit growth that's sort of driving the decisions and not necessarily as a percent of sales, but are you comfortable with where you are? I mean, it's high, 12% of sales is high relative to historical standards, which dipped to 9% at -- if we go back here to '15, '16 how are you thinking about that? How should we think about that as gross margin begins to improve?\nNoel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, we're really pleased with the level of advertising we're getting in the P&L, and that is obviously driven by the circular nature of how we're driving the business, obviously, more advertising is driving the top line, and we're able to get more leverage to the P&L to continue to support that. And we feel as we move out getting the pricing in the P&L was critically important to sustaining and increasing our levels of advertising. We've obviously moved more money into digital. We're seeing great ROIs on digital and our programmatic and the personalized content that we're delivering in the market. We're seeing growth in market shares relative to where we're spending the money, particularly around the Hill's business, and our Oral Care and Skin Health businesses. So we're really pleased with the fact that the advertising levels continue to deliver against the expectations that we have. And we balance that off with obviously a broad portfolio of offerings that we think are attracting and building the brands that we speak. We have high household penetration, with many of the brands around the world, our ability to drive reach and continue to sustain that reach is very, very important to the growth that we're seeing in the business. As we look forward, we would anticipate to continue to spend behind those businesses. We still have some businesses, in my view, need more support, particularly businesses in parts of Europe and some of the categories in the U.S., and we would expect to continue to fund those as we get more gross margin accretion through the back half of the year because we're seeing the results. And ultimately, the brand equity, which is obviously the big testament to the brand support and how are we getting what we want out of it continues to show a strengthening of our brands, and that bodes well for continuity and sustainability of the growth moving forward, and that's how we're kind of running that flywheel right now, continue to invest, drive leverage in the middle of the P&L, accelerate the top line and ultimately deliver better margins, better earnings per share for our shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong : I wanted to talk a little bit about gross margin. Clearly, Funding the Growth start of the year materially better than expected. I imagine it's a function of supply chains improving a bit, if you could expand on that a bit. And then usually, your savings contribution build as the year progresses. So should we assume sort of a regular quarterly cadence from here? Or is there something onetime-ish that happened this quarter to result in the strong Funding the Growth contribution?\nNoel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Olivia. This was very intentional. As we went through the back half of last year, we were deliberately looking to make sure that we have projects in place for the first half of this year in order to accelerate gross margin accretion given the inflationary pressures that we were seeing. In addition, I would say that we've done a lot of work on getting our facilities to run far more efficiently, whether that's the Hill's facilities where capacity utilization has come down, which has allowed us to put more funding to growth projects onto the line to determine their feasibility. We've had the teams, obviously, very much focused on the opportunities that we see in the first half in order to ensure that we get that gross margin back in quickly to once again sustain the advertising and the increases we want to see in the back half of the year. So it was deliberate and strategic to make sure that we got more of that funding to growth up front. And the teams have really done a wonderful job in that regard as you saw in the numbers and we would certainly expect that focus to continue as we move through the balance of the year. Let me throw it over to Stan. He'll give you a little bit more color on what we're seeing again around commodities and some of the other projects that we have underway, particularly around our global productivity initiative.\nStan Sutula: Yes. Thanks, Noel. And just a quick comment on the FTG. Noel highlighted that we had a very strong start here. That SKU, I think, is going to be a little bit different than prior years. In prior years, you saw build through the year. This was very deliberate. Supply chain has moderated in terms of the volatility around that. In particular, the Hill's team has actually had time to work on some of these as we've had a little bit better improvement in capacity utilization. So the strong start we have to the year, I think you should think that this will be more equal as you go through the year versus growing through the year, so from a SKU point of view. And this is important because as we look at the material cost, there's still going to be a headwind as we go through the year. So we need that to help offset that impact. And then we have our GPI program, we continue to get benefit from that. You saw a small charge in the quarter, but the team is driving productivity throughout the P&L, not just in the GP line, but also in the MBO line as we look for things to offset that material headwind.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey : Good morning. So Stan, I just wanted to confirm one comment about commodities. I think it was somewhat clear. But to Peter's question, just around the $300 million to $400 million range, is that what you're expecting for the full year from an inflation standpoint? And then just a little bit related on the North American operating margin that has been stepping up kind of sequentially and then slowed a little bit this quarter, obviously. I would have thought maybe with the transportation and logistics relief and building productivity and a little bit of easing inflation, maybe that can keep going, but I know there was obviously some noise with the North America business this quarter with recall and otherwise. So is there any way you can maybe just unpack that North America margin performance and where you see things going? So thanks for that clarification on commodities and the comment on North America.\nStan Sutula : So why don't I start here? North -- first, let's start with the commodities. So as we said, still $300 million to $400 million range on that impact. I don't see that moving a lot in the short term. And keep in mind, our locking, right? So we're already into almost May, so 2Q is largely locked. And as we go into the back half of the year, hopefully, we'll see a little bit of relief come through. But keep in mind, the closer we get, the more we lock in order to ensure we have supply. If we think about the North America margin and go through, so North America margins here still improved on a year-on-year basis. They also improved on a sequential basis. So as you look at the progress on what we're doing from a GP point of view, that's important. We do see some logistics benefits here. Logistics have come down versus the start of the year. But again, we start to lock in some of that activity. We've seen it mostly in the ocean side of logistics, which will certainly help the overall margin. And if you think about North America in total, clearly, Fabuloso recall had a impact in the quarter. That's getting largely behind us, so we expect that we'll see improvement as we go through the year.\nNoel Wallace : Yes. Maybe a couple of things. So as Stan said, obviously, operating profit was up nicely, which has been the big focus for our North America business. We were up roughly 300 basis points on operating profit in the first quarter. So we feel we're making the right step, taking the right decisions and making the right progress against the middle of the P&L, particularly around gross profit and controlling our overheads and managing logistics. So that was an important element, and we're making sure that, that progress has been reinvested in the business. So a couple of other highlights on North America. Obviously, ex-Fabuloso, volume would have been up on the quarter, great quarter for toothpaste. Toothpaste was up double digit in the quarter for North America with growth, including volume growth on that business. Toothbrush is a little softer. You remember, we were lapping a resupply of our product last year and some out of stock from some of our competitors. So volumes were a bit down there. Personal Care, up high single digits. Home Care was soft, as we mentioned, due to the Fabuloso recall. But overall, really good progress. The other aspect to North America that I would call out is the significant progress we're making in non-measured channels. And again, this is part of our strategy of growing in faster-growth channels, where we saw significant growth in non-Nielsen channels, which was terrific for North America and has obviously helped to drive some of that top line growth. So overall, a good quarter for North America, very focused on the middle of the P&L moving forward, and we see opportunities, but the good news is we're seeing good progress on the top line, and that's translating to the P&L.\nJohn Faucher : Just one point of clarification on that. North America volume would have been up sequentially from Q4 to Q1 performance from Q4 to Q1, not up year-over-year ex Fabuloso. And then, Stan, on the...\nStan Sutula : Yes, on the operating margin, it's up year-to-year versus fourth quarter, you see it's down about 100 basis points or so. And that's really driven by the Fabuloso impact, combined with the increased investment in advertising as we're bringing both innovation to market and supporting the pricing that we've taken in the market.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: If I could just ask a quick clarification on the raw material, the ag stuff. Stan, can you just give us any more detail on exactly what ags are causing the pressure and what's driving that? And then my broader question is Noel on the whitening innovation and just the whitening strategy. I'm just curious if you've done any halo work on the impact it has on the core Oral Care franchising or toothpaste. Any perspective around that would be helpful.\nNoel Wallace : Sure. Let me -- Nik, let me take that, and then we'll have Stan get to some more specifics around the Hill's commodities and particularly the ag prices. Yes, the strategy that we have on whitening is very much about building the brand, particularly here if you take North America, the Optic White brand. And as we expanded into at-home whitening at very significant premium prices and the significant efficacy that those products deliver in the market and to the consumer, we've seen very nice halo impacts across the entire Optic White range as well as the Colgate brand. So the short answer to your question is, clearly, the halo effect is transferring to the entire Optic franchise as well as improving the Colgate brand.\nStan Sutula : Yes. And Nik, on the commodities, it's kind of across the board with most of the ag. So corn, wheat, soybean, the risk of the drought in the U.S. and the effect on crops, even though some other areas of the world are a little bit better, the risk of Ukraine, all has been pushing pressure on that. Don't forget as well that the protein side of this, things like chicken livers, et cetera, with some of the impacts that have been out there has all put pressure on Hill's. That remains the real driver of that $300 million to $400 million range.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.\nJason English : Hey. Good morning, folks, and that's a great segue because I wanted to talk about Hill's actually on it. Good quarter, obviously, enough for Hill's with the profitability and the margins. We've lost over 1,000 basis points in margin in the last few years. I was hoping you could unpack the components of it, and the cadence at which you can recover, if you were to recover them. So how much are we looking at from the mix effects of recent acquisitions? And what's the cadence of bringing your capacity on there and improving that? How much is related to like the slack capacity, the underutilization of the assets that you're standing up and maybe some of the stress in the supply chain as a result of past utilization?  And then I think the third bucket and tell me if there's other buckets, I think the third bucket is the pricing at the cost. How large is that bucket of the roughly 1,000, and is it reasonable to think that could come back? And if so, when? Sorry for the multipart.\nNoel Wallace : No. Thank you, Jason. So let me top line Hill's a bit, and then Stan can provide a little more of the specificity that you were looking for. But structurally and strategically, this business continues to perform very well, continued sequential improvement in volume and strong organic growth despite the difficult comps that we continue to come up again. So overall, pleased with the 14%. And again, that's 14% on 13% last year and pricing of 11.4% on 9% last year and obviously sequentially improvements in volumes. So a couple of things there. Stan will get into, obviously, the key drivers of the operating margin dilution, which would be the following. Obviously, ag cost, the manufacturing integration of the three Red Collar facilities plus the Italian facility that we have as we move through the variances associated with that. Red Collar in the current quarter is a significant portion of that, the private label business. We've continued to obviously significantly increased our advertising support. We said we would do that as we built up more capacity. That is very strategic and deliberate and we're seeing the results of that in the marketplace, particularly as we drive new innovation into the market, and we drive pricing in the market, the ability to sustain and elevate that moving forward is going to be largely driven by our ability to sustain the strong levels or even increase our advertising levels. As we look forward, strategically, margins will improve sequentially as we move through the back half of the year. Plant efficiencies will continue to deliver progress in that regard. We'll get the constraints out of our existing plants, which we're running at full throttle that will allow us to be far more efficient in those plants, put more Funding the Growth into those plants as we look forward. So overall, strategically, the business is doing very, very well, and we feel all the steps we've taken to improve capacity ultimately delivering good, strong line growth. We need to focus on the middle of the P&L, as you rightfully say, and the progress is there to do that.\nStan Sutula : Yes. Let me pick up here. So first, if you take a look, these investments in the business and if you look at the net sales, keep in mind, you go back just a couple of years ago, we're up well over $200 million quarter versus first quarter of 2021. So the investment in the brand is paying off. If we look at margin, the private label has -- what we said as a 90 basis point impact to the total company has slightly over 400 basis points impact to Hill's. So as you take a look at that margin impact, that is a material impact to Hill's on a GP basis. Now through time, that private label will wind down, and that will be over the next couple of years as we slowly wind down that contract and then backfill it with Hill's volume at Hill's margin. Now as we've already talked about, all of the raw material impact inflation has predominantly been against Hill's also impacting their margins. But keep in mind, they've taken significant pricing here over the last several quarters, and that is helping to mitigate this. And the fact that we're now, as the Red Collar facilities have come on, that's helping us manage utilization, not just a Red Collar but of the entire manufacturing footprint. That's enabled Hill's to contribute materially to the funding of the growth savings. So I think where Hill's is right now is well positioned. I think we'll see sequential improvement in margin as we go through the year. We're going to manage that carefully so we can continue to supply our clients and we saw material improvement in case fill rates coming out of first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane : I just -- I've got a quick clarification first for Stan. I think in the guidance, we talk about net interest expense maybe going higher than your original plan. So could you put some -- maybe if you can just put some color, put a number on that. And I'm assuming -- is this related to the refinancing? I think you refinanced some debt in March. So is it just related to the refinancing of the debt? Or is it exposure to like short-term financing variable rates? And then I have a follow-up.\nStan Sutula : Sure, Bryan. Thanks for the question. So first, on interest here as we look, this is -- well, we want to call it out because we saw rates going up, this is not a large number. So you should think around $20 million for the year. It's not really related to the first quarter debt issuance. We are very happy with that. We had very good demand on that bond. It's really the assumptions on the number of rate increases and predominantly in Europe. So as we look at the ECB and the changes there, the slight difference to what we had anticipated coming into the year. As we all know, that's a moving target, and it's going to depend on inflation moves to central banks, but that's our best guess right now. So that's a modest impact for the year.\nBryan Spillane : Okay. Great. And then a question for Noel. Just you talked about, I guess, risks in the second half. And maybe if we just kind of think about that at a higher level, it sounded to me from listening to the Q&A and reading the prepared remarks that a lot of that risk is what the consumer may or not do, less so than concerns about volatility in input costs or supply chains? And risk has got a lot of definitions, right? So if you could just maybe talk a little bit about like what the specific risks are and maybe how Colgate is in a position to manage that risk maybe a little bit more -- with a little bit more agility than maybe was the case two years ago?\nNoel Wallace : Bryan, thank you. So clearly, the consumer environment is the one that's the big unknown, I think, to everyone. And that's been a consistent theme through the first quarter print by most in terms of what's really going to happen in the back half and the compounding impact of pricing. I'll address the fact that historically, when we've seen significant inflation in our categories, we weathered those periods really, really well, a combination of great value-oriented innovation and the fact that our -- the breadth of our portfolio at various price points affords us the opportunity to really push different segments at the appropriate time anywhere around the world. So we're pleased with that. We're also pleased with the fact that you tend to see in times like this, a squeeze in the middle of the category with premium growing and the value growing, and that's been our focus, quite frankly. Premium has been the key focus for us, and we're seeing great progress, particularly across our Toothpaste business in new channels and at the premium end of the market, and we obviously have a very strong base business that is well positioned based on some of the relaunches we have. Raw and packing materials, we shall see, we've seen a stabilization across at least the Colgate side, you've heard a lot about the ag prices that continue to elevate, but we've seen a stabilization on those as we move. So we've got more predictability on that. Hence, the reason why we felt more confident the raise in guidance across multiple dimensions there because we see a little bit more transparency to that. As Stan mentioned, we've got some contracts that will obviously come off. Now the unknown there is what our suppliers would do. They're facing rising wage inflation, and we'll have to deal with that as it comes, particularly in the second half of the year relative to how they decide to adjust pricing on some of the key commodities that we will ultimately be purchasing. The other aspect is China. We will see where China impacts not only the Asia business, but the world, quite frankly. We expect obviously a slow progress in that market. I don't expect it to be vertical. I expect it to be a progress from quarter-to-quarter. We have not seen the travel retail business come back yet, and that is an expectation that we will probably see in the second half of 2023, not in the first half, but we shall see. Now we'll get into Asia and China, I'm sure as the Q&A progresses, but we had obviously a very strong quarter there, and we think we're well positioned as that economy comes back to deliver on it. The last is foreign exchange. That clearly is always a risk. We -- as you saw in the prepared remarks with low single-digit foreign exchange impact through the P&L, we'll see where that moves. The Latin American currencies have come back a little bit here as has the euro, but it's been very volatile, and we'll adjust to that going forward. But that has been a big driver in the past as you know, but we think we're well positioned right now from the fact again, of getting strong pricing into the P&L, both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman : Two questions sort of like everybody else. But the first was is just pretty basic. And I was curious if you could offer any perspective on volume performance by category that you've seen? I know that's not typically something you discuss. But as we kind of think about that path forward and that shift in the -- towards a more balanced revenue algorithm, I was just curious where you stand on kind of volume growth by segment. And then the other question was, Noel, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about knowing the competitive environment would be difficult. And I just -- we haven't heard that from a lot of other companies, and I didn't know if it was sort of a particularly pointed comments or just a general commentary on your ability to compete and confidence in the innovation pipeline and advertising support. So just curious on a little bit more color behind that -- I mean, sorry, on the competitive environment.\nNoel Wallace : Sure. Thanks, and good morning, Lauren. Let me take the second question first. The competitive environment will likely intensify particularly as you see costs come down, and that will be a function of both local brands and private label getting more aggressive. The good news is our categories. If you take North America and private label, we're benign, no progress in private label shares. So to speak, with the exception of a little bit in liquid hand soap and a little bit cleaner, a little bit more acute of private label growth in Europe. As you saw price discrepancies or the gap between private label and global brands increase, we'll see how that translates in the back half as we expect them to have to take pricing in the first quarter as we did as well. So we think local brands in private label likely to elevate in terms of their competitive nature in the back half. And as costs to stay flat in the back half, which is what I think we're hearing from most, we expect the competitive environment to increase in that regard. Obviously, you'll see more promotional volumes probably come into the category, but it's been quite constructive so far. I will say that, but we need to anticipate that things could worsen based on where the costs are, and we're well prepared for that. On your first question, volumes. So category volumes, if I take just the market volumes in general, flat to slightly negative across most of the world on the volume side, obviously, driven by the fact that there's so much pricing that's gone into both Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care. If you look at us specifically, really strong growth on the Oral Care side, as I talked about, double-digit growth across most markets in Toothpaste, good volume progress in most markets on Toothpaste. So we're really pleased with what we're seeing there. Personal Care up mid- to high single digits depending on the marketplace. Both from a pricing standpoint, a little bit more challenged on the volume side given the strong pricing we've taken there, particularly in categories like liquid hand soap and bar soap. And on Home Care, mid-single digits to low single digits in terms of growth, depending on the marketplace. And that one has experienced a little more elasticity, particularly around the cleaner side of the business where we've seen more price competitiveness in that side of the business and a little bit more trade down. But overall, again, sequentially up and really pleased with sequentially up, given the fact that we had a lot more pricing in this quarter than we had in the fourth quarter. So good progress overall. We'll have to watch the volumes carefully, and we're all over that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.\nMark Astrachan : I wanted to ask about EBIT margin in North America and Europe. If you take a look at where you are today versus where you were a few years ago, it seems like it's outside of Hill's, one of the biggest drop-offs relative to historical levels. I appreciate inflation, FX, et cetera, but it also seems like maybe those markets are a little bit more competitive than some of the others. Is it levels of spend that is potentially impacted that? And kind of how do you think about progression of margins? Is it realistic to think that you could eventually know sort of timeline around that to get back to those levels? Why or why not would be helpful.\nNoel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, Mark. Yes, your answer is clearly around the spending. That's the answer. The spending is up quite notably in North America, that's very strategic. We see that as a growth market for us moving forward, not only on the top line but on the bottom line. We really wanted to reinvest behind the business in some of our brands, and we're clearly demonstrating that as we've gone through the last couple of quarters. Getting gross profit in the middle of the P&L sorted out in North America. It's clearly been a key focus, and we've had good gross profit progress in North America. We're getting better overhead leverage through the P&L. We're getting a lot better efficiency in our plants, and so we'll see that translating moving forward. But we will continue to invest behind that business moving forward to drive the top line. Europe, a little bit driven, obviously, by the foreign exchange environment to a certain extent and obviously, more increased inflation in Europe than we've seen in other markets around the world, particularly around the high gas prices and the fall-off effects of higher gas prices, and some of the raw materials that we purchased into our European plants. So overall, there's been a little bit more pressure there. But again, we've taken strong pricing in the back half of 2022, and pleased that we were able to execute our pricing in the first quarter of 2023 towards the latter end of the quarter, and we'll see that benefit us as we move forward. So overall, your observation is correct. We feel -- we've got a good handle of getting the gross margins and the operating profits up sequentially as we move through the back half of the year and importantly, sustaining or increasing our advertising levels to continue to drive the top line.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers : Just a couple of cleanups, I guess. Just the first one on -- just on the Fabuloso recall just because I've received some confusion in my inbox during the call. Just is there a way to quantify what the impact was in the quarter? And does that reverse out as a benefit in the second quarter? That's question number one. Question number two, on the logistics topic. I don't know if there's a way to quantify what the benefit was or how you're thinking about the expected benefit over the course of the year, but that would be helpful as well.  And then the last piece is I guess it kind of builds on Jason's question on Hill's margins, but I was -- specifically on the Tonganoxie plant, just where that is and what the time line is to get that up to scale? And just is that a material driver of the margin bridge as well? Or is it more on the margin?\nNoel Wallace : Great. Thanks, Stephen. Let me take the Fabuloso and the Hill's question, and I'll have Stan come back to you on logistics. So the Fabuloso impact was Q1. It was a material impact to the North America volume line. We're not going to quantify that, but it was quite significant to the volume performance in North America. That is behind us as we move through into the second quarter. So we'll see the benefits of the Fabuloso business coming back into the P&L as we move forward. Again, if you take the Fabuloso business out of the North America number, they were up sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2022 in volume. So it was a very time-driven event in the first quarter. And the good news is that's behind us. Tonganoxie progressing, as you know, strategically, that's a very important plant for us given the strong demand we have on the wet side of the business at Hill's and our inability to supply the current demand for wet products all around the world. So getting that plant up and running will be strategic for the continued growth of that business. That will happen towards the tail end of the third quarter. And we anticipate, obviously, we'll have some start-up costs associated with that as we move through the transition of that facility. But overall, we should see that benefit us moving into 2024, particularly at the margin line as our wet business is margin accretive to us and will certainly benefit the Hill's business longer term.\nStan Sutula : Yes. So let me pick up on logistics here. So you saw logistics was 9.5% of sales. And if we look -- it's been incremental headwind to our overheads. Remember, it's in our overheads and SG&A for several years. And in Q4, we saw the first year-on-year decline as a percent of sales in 12 quarters, and it was down again this quarter, and we expect it to be down for the year. I expect as we kind of look out through the remainder of the year, it's going to come down slightly. I don't see it coming down materially. So we're at 9.5% now. I still think it will probably start with the 9% as we go through the remainder of the year. So certainly a help year-on-year, but as we kind of look out through the rest of the year, I think that's how you should think about as a percent of sales, it will moderate and stay just above 9%.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.\nRobert Ottenstein : Great. Two follow-ups. First one, a quick one. You mentioned that the -- you were very strong in non-measured channels in North America. Was that more e-commerce or club stores? And can you give us some metrics around that? That would be helpful. And then my core question is really on the advertising spend pickup, 14%, it's a big number. You mentioned for the full year that you would be up absolutely and as a percent of sales, so can you give us a little bit more sense of where that money is going? Is it more innovation and longer-term focused or maybe more short term? And then following into that, do you expect to see this elevated level going forward, either because you have very high return projects or you need to catch up, just trying to get a sense of what the income statement may look like longer term?\nNoel Wallace : Sure, yes. Good morning, Rob. Let me take both those questions. First, on the non-measured channels. Again, this plays back to the strategy that we've been talking about for quite a few years now. And certainly, I highlighted again at CAGNY that we are very focused on growing channels that particularly are not measured by Nielsen, which are the faster growth channels, as you mentioned, e-commerce, club stores, discount stores, value discount stores. Some of the big box stores that we're seeing emerge in Latin America. So overall, in some of the new obviously platforms that we're seeing coming out of China, so this has been strategic and deliberate for us. And if you take the North America number, we've seen significant growth in non-measured channels to the tune of 4x to 5x what we're getting in measured channels. So obviously, good growth there. The key is to sustain that growth. Our e-commerce business was up double digit in the quarter, now roughly 14% of our total sales. So overall, and we're seeing good share growth in those businesses. In fact, if you take some of the progress we're seeing in China, very much driven by the strong e-commerce shares that we had. I demonstrated that at CAGNY. And in fact, since CAGNY, we've continued to increase our e-commerce shares in China, and likewise, in the brick-and-mortar business. So overall, we feel the strategy is working for us. Again, largely driven by the fact that we're supporting our businesses. We're using a wide spread of different mediums to grow brand awareness and brand penetration. Obviously, TV for a lot of reach and frequency given the scale and scope of our brands in many markets, but really fine-tuning behind our digital transformation, our ability to drive higher ROI spending in the digital space. And clearly, as we see more ROI coming, we see continued growth in terms of penetration, in terms of consumption, and in terms of ultimately delivering share growth and category growth for our retailers, we'll continue to elevate our spending. We're measuring it very quickly. This is not just for the sake of increasing spending. We want to be sure and absolutely deliberate and making sure that the spending is returning back to the brands, driving category growth. So there's not a specific number we're aimed at, Rob. We're looking to obviously continue to accelerate and sustain the top line and grow the health of our brands and we're seeing good results from the strategy we've put in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Fulvio Cazzol of Berenberg.\nFulvio Cazzol : Mine is on the medium-term outlook for the Pet Nutrition category. How should we think about the medium-term growth prospects as the tailwinds ease from increased pet ownership during COVID, et cetera. And I was also interested in your view on the competitive standpoint, like if you're making some investments on capacity. And I think some of your peers are making significant investments. I think Nestle is doing quite a bit on manufacturing. Is there a risk that the supply-demand balance turns less favorable in the coming years and result in softening industry pricing power? So that's my question.\nNoel Wallace : Yes. Thank you very much. Let me take -- let me answer a couple of ways on the first part. First, obviously, coming through COVID, pet adoptions increased quite significantly. Those pets will continue to obviously age, and we will have, obviously, therapeutic and wellness products delivered for an aging pet population. So we feel good about that. You will recall, we've talked about the low brand penetration and brand awareness of the Hill's franchise. So we feel even if the market softens a bit, which we have not necessarily seen a little softness in volume, but not necessarily in value, as you see premiumization continuing to grow the market today. We feel we have the right portfolio of brands to continue to grow in the right investment strategy, hence, the aggressiveness of the advertising to ensure we're building brand awareness and penetration off the lower levels that we have today. And we also feel we've got opportunities internationally that we have yet to exploit given some of the capacity constraints that we have. And so we'll continue to obviously go after those moving forward. We feel -- I can't address the capacity issues or where the capacity is in the market. We're obviously putting capacity for our business. And we see that, obviously, as a real plus for us as we move forward, not only to drive better efficiencies in the plants that we currently produce in. But as we bring Tonganoxie up to line as we bring the Italian facility up to speed relative to our recipes, we feel we have real growth opportunities to continue to expand those segments where we weren't competing nearly as aggressively in the past. And so overall, that will not only drive our business but will drive the category as well, given the levels of support that we'll continue to bring to our retailers.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira : Noel, Stan, I appreciate the sequential improvement in volumes that you called out worldwide. Are you still seeing a premiumization playing out, starting to see consumer down trade into the entry level price points in some parts of the world. I know mix is part of your volume numbers. So I was wondering if you can speak apples-to-apples into the volume increase that you're seeing sequentially. And then a clarification on the Latin America and in European, including EMEA. I understood the share stabilized, especially in LatAm. But assuming it was mostly value share, given that, obviously, you're the leader and you're leading in pricing. So how about the volume share in those regions? And how are you seeing that play out as you progress, especially as you over SKU in Personal Care, in particular hand soap and the other categories within that sub-category?\nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks for the question. Clearly, as we've seen in prior challenging the markets with a lot of inflation, you kind of have the tale of two cities, which is the premium segment continues to grow and that's the area where we're under-indexed in. So clearly, that's fueling a lot of our advertising investment and our channel strategies, particularly in Oral Care and in the Skin Health business. So we see that segment continuing to grow. The middle getting squeezed a bit and the lower end with the point you made, a little bit more trade down into the lower end. Now remember that some of our lower end businesses, while the absolute margin dollars might be lower, the margin percent might be as good or better than some of our premium segments. So overall, we feel pretty good about the mix of our business, and that continues to be, in our view, a real advantage for our portfolio relative to the breadth of our portfolio. Relative to volume shares, particularly in the emerging markets, we have taken significant pricing in emerging markets. And we clearly done that to ensure we get the flexibility in the P&L as quickly as we possibly can, that we sustain the advertising numbers or increase them to drive the innovation and deliver the pricing, particularly for the premium side of the market. We've seen a little trade down, particularly more in the Home Care businesses. The cleaners segment, I would point out in the dish segment, a little bit of trade down, particularly in Latin America. Personal Care, holding up okay. Bar soap tends to be more price elastic than many of our categories. But we've seen a lot of constructive pricing from our competition. So there hasn't been a significant amount of trade down to private label as of yet, but we'll watch that very carefully. So Home Care a little bit more challenged, particularly around the Cleaner segment worldwide and Personal Care in the Bar Soap segment. Oral Care looks okay, as I mentioned, were up by double digit in Toothpaste with both positive pricing and positive volume.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I will now return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.\nNoel Wallace : Yes. Thanks, everyone, for your interest in our company. And let me just extend a personal thanks to the 34,000 Colgate people who have worked tirelessly to deliver a stronger momentum in the first quarter, getting us off to a strong start for the year. We greatly appreciate their steadfast resolve and the innovation that they're bringing to the market and the strong execution. So I look forward to talking to everyone in the second quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can tell from our press release and the earnings materials, we had a strong start to 2023, and the momentum on our business gives us confidence to raise our net and organic sales growth guidance and to raise the lower end of our base business earnings per share growth guidance for the year. We did this because with the quarter of the year gone, we see less risk from some of the macroeconomic and geopolitical issues that we were concerned about earlier in the year. That said, there is still notable uncertainty surrounding the balance of the year, particularly in the second half. Since the commentary focuses on the results, I want to focus my remarks on three of our priorities that Colgate people are focused on. Priority one is driving organic sales growth as we face tougher comparisons. We will utilize our enterprise-wide capabilities in innovation and revenue growth management, along with a firm commitment to marketing spending to return to a balanced algorithm of pricing and volume growth. The pricing we have taken over the past two years helps provide us with the flexibility to fund increased brand investment to support our pricing, build brand health, and drive volume and household penetration. We know that the competitive environment is going to be difficult, but we have a brand portfolio that is built for times like these, and we look forward to driving growth and market share performance moving now. Priority two is delivering our productivity to fund the brand investment while we're also delivering on our earnings targets. We had a strong start to the year for both Funding the Growth and our 2022 global productivity initiative and we are laser-focused on delivering against or exceeding our goals for the year. We still foresee year-over-year headwinds to earnings per share growth from raw and packaging materials, foreign exchange and below-the-line items, so driving productivity in the middle of our P&L is vital. And finally, we are focused on improving our cash flow performance. Again, we had a strong start to the year with both operating cash flow and free cash flow up and we know there is still opportunity for further improvement. We will utilize this cash flow to fund the growth in capital expenditures to return cash to shareholders through dividends and to drive earnings leverage through paying down debt and repurchasing shares.  So I'm pleased with how we started the year, but I'm also well aware of the challenges and uncertainty ahead for us. Colgate-Palmolive, however, has the brands, the capabilities and the people to deliver in this environment. So with that, I'll take your questions. Yes. Thanks, Dara. Let me come back again to the strategy that we've been deploying over obviously the last couple of years and continues to execute against the initiatives that we've talked about, particularly at CAGNY, and that's driving the core and adjacencies and channels. And you see the progress we're making against all three of those, obviously delivering sequential volume growth in the quarter. So we had five of the six divisions sequentially up in the first quarter. North America was down. But if you pull the Fabuloso recall out of the North America business, North America would have been up sequentially as well. And all of this plays back to our belief that the strategy clearly is working to deliver improved volume despite the fact that we continue to take significant pricing across all of our geographies and our categories. So quite frankly, we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing, and we expect sequential volume improvement as we move through the year to go fear. Now that is contemplated on a consumer environment that remains where it is. We shall see where the consumer goes relative to the level of inflation being absorbed in the marketplace, but we feel strongly that we've got the right portfolio of brands across price points, the right innovation, the right channel strategies, particularly where consumers are shopping today to continue to drive growth. Importantly, as we saw in the quarter, our Oral Care business was up double digit, and that's both positive pricing and positive volume in toothpaste, and we saw good share growth in the first quarter on toothpaste in North America. Good -- very strong share growth across Europe. Flat shares in Europe -- excuse me, in Latin America, and good share growth in Asia. So overall, we feel good about where we are from a consumption standpoint and the strategies that we're executing and expect sequential volume improvement as we move through the back half of the year. And as you said, pricing will get more challenging as we lap the back half. And certainly, in the second quarter, which was a strong quarter for us, where we had strong pricing and volume in that quarter, we'll expect a little bit of pullback from there. But overall, we feel good about the momentum we're behind the business right now. Yes. Emerging was strong. You saw obviously double-digit organic in the quarter. Sequentially, again, volumes performing better than they did in the first quarter. And if you look at the pricing that we've taken in emerging markets, over the last three quarters, quite frankly, we're pretty pleased with the fact that the volume sequentially continues to improve. Now that being said, we've got strong innovation in emerging markets and you've seen the level of advertising that we're putting back into the business. That gives us, again, confidence that we're able to sustain that advertising as we move into the back half of the year, and we intend to continue to do everything we can to increase that advertising support in the back half, particularly in emerging markets in order to: one, support the innovation we have; second, drive the pricing into the market and continue to accelerate volume growth in the category. So overall, emerging pretty good. We were really pleased with the progress in both Latin America, Africa and Asia, particularly in China, strong growth in all three of those regions, particularly in the key markets of Mexico, Brazil and China and South Africa. So good progress across emerging markets and shares holding up, a little more elasticity as you would expect given the level of pricing that we've taken in emerging markets. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we stand in that regard. As it relates to the second half, time will tell. As I mentioned upfront, we'll see the compounding impact of pricing across many categories as we move into the back half. And I expect a better balance between pricing and volume as we move through the back half, but we shall see. The good news is we've got strong innovation. We've got the pricing in the P&L, which is really important in order to get the flexibility that we need to drive the business in the back half of the year. And we feel we've got a good channel strategy to ensure, as I mentioned upfront, that we're capturing the omnichannel impact of how consumers are shopping today. Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, we're really pleased with the level of advertising we're getting in the P&L, and that is obviously driven by the circular nature of how we're driving the business, obviously, more advertising is driving the top line, and we're able to get more leverage to the P&L to continue to support that. And we feel as we move out getting the pricing in the P&L was critically important to sustaining and increasing our levels of advertising. We've obviously moved more money into digital. We're seeing great ROIs on digital and our programmatic and the personalized content that we're delivering in the market. We're seeing growth in market shares relative to where we're spending the money, particularly around the Hill's business, and our Oral Care and Skin Health businesses. So we're really pleased with the fact that the advertising levels continue to deliver against the expectations that we have. And we balance that off with obviously a broad portfolio of offerings that we think are attracting and building the brands that we speak. We have high household penetration, with many of the brands around the world, our ability to drive reach and continue to sustain that reach is very, very important to the growth that we're seeing in the business. As we look forward, we would anticipate to continue to spend behind those businesses. We still have some businesses, in my view, need more support, particularly businesses in parts of Europe and some of the categories in the U.S., and we would expect to continue to fund those as we get more gross margin accretion through the back half of the year because we're seeing the results. And ultimately, the brand equity, which is obviously the big testament to the brand support and how are we getting what we want out of it continues to show a strengthening of our brands, and that bodes well for continuity and sustainability of the growth moving forward, and that's how we're kind of running that flywheel right now, continue to invest, drive leverage in the middle of the P&L, accelerate the top line and ultimately deliver better margins, better earnings per share for our shareholders. Yes. Thanks, Olivia. This was very intentional. As we went through the back half of last year, we were deliberately looking to make sure that we have projects in place for the first half of this year in order to accelerate gross margin accretion given the inflationary pressures that we were seeing. In addition, I would say that we've done a lot of work on getting our facilities to run far more efficiently, whether that's the Hill's facilities where capacity utilization has come down, which has allowed us to put more funding to growth projects onto the line to determine their feasibility. We've had the teams, obviously, very much focused on the opportunities that we see in the first half in order to ensure that we get that gross margin back in quickly to once again sustain the advertising and the increases we want to see in the back half of the year. So it was deliberate and strategic to make sure that we got more of that funding to growth up front. And the teams have really done a wonderful job in that regard as you saw in the numbers and we would certainly expect that focus to continue as we move through the balance of the year. Let me throw it over to Stan. He'll give you a little bit more color on what we're seeing again around commodities and some of the other projects that we have underway, particularly around our global productivity initiative. Yes. Maybe a couple of things. So as Stan said, obviously, operating profit was up nicely, which has been the big focus for our North America business. We were up roughly 300 basis points on operating profit in the first quarter. So we feel we're making the right step, taking the right decisions and making the right progress against the middle of the P&L, particularly around gross profit and controlling our overheads and managing logistics. So that was an important element, and we're making sure that, that progress has been reinvested in the business. So a couple of other highlights on North America. Obviously, ex-Fabuloso, volume would have been up on the quarter, great quarter for toothpaste. Toothpaste was up double digit in the quarter for North America with growth, including volume growth on that business. Toothbrush is a little softer. You remember, we were lapping a resupply of our product last year and some out of stock from some of our competitors. So volumes were a bit down there. Personal Care, up high single digits. Home Care was soft, as we mentioned, due to the Fabuloso recall. But overall, really good progress. The other aspect to North America that I would call out is the significant progress we're making in non-measured channels. And again, this is part of our strategy of growing in faster-growth channels, where we saw significant growth in non-Nielsen channels, which was terrific for North America and has obviously helped to drive some of that top line growth. So overall, a good quarter for North America, very focused on the middle of the P&L moving forward, and we see opportunities, but the good news is we're seeing good progress on the top line, and that's translating to the P&L. Sure. Let me -- Nik, let me take that, and then we'll have Stan get to some more specifics around the Hill's commodities and particularly the ag prices. Yes, the strategy that we have on whitening is very much about building the brand, particularly here if you take North America, the Optic White brand. And as we expanded into at-home whitening at very significant premium prices and the significant efficacy that those products deliver in the market and to the consumer, we've seen very nice halo impacts across the entire Optic White range as well as the Colgate brand. So the short answer to your question is, clearly, the halo effect is transferring to the entire Optic franchise as well as improving the Colgate brand. No. Thank you, Jason. So let me top line Hill's a bit, and then Stan can provide a little more of the specificity that you were looking for. But structurally and strategically, this business continues to perform very well, continued sequential improvement in volume and strong organic growth despite the difficult comps that we continue to come up again. So overall, pleased with the 14%. And again, that's 14% on 13% last year and pricing of 11.4% on 9% last year and obviously sequentially improvements in volumes. So a couple of things there. Stan will get into, obviously, the key drivers of the operating margin dilution, which would be the following. Obviously, ag cost, the manufacturing integration of the three Red Collar facilities plus the Italian facility that we have as we move through the variances associated with that. Red Collar in the current quarter is a significant portion of that, the private label business. We've continued to obviously significantly increased our advertising support. We said we would do that as we built up more capacity. That is very strategic and deliberate and we're seeing the results of that in the marketplace, particularly as we drive new innovation into the market, and we drive pricing in the market, the ability to sustain and elevate that moving forward is going to be largely driven by our ability to sustain the strong levels or even increase our advertising levels. As we look forward, strategically, margins will improve sequentially as we move through the back half of the year. Plant efficiencies will continue to deliver progress in that regard. We'll get the constraints out of our existing plants, which we're running at full throttle that will allow us to be far more efficient in those plants, put more Funding the Growth into those plants as we look forward. So overall, strategically, the business is doing very, very well, and we feel all the steps we've taken to improve capacity ultimately delivering good, strong line growth. We need to focus on the middle of the P&L, as you rightfully say, and the progress is there to do that. Bryan, thank you. So clearly, the consumer environment is the one that's the big unknown, I think, to everyone. And that's been a consistent theme through the first quarter print by most in terms of what's really going to happen in the back half and the compounding impact of pricing. I'll address the fact that historically, when we've seen significant inflation in our categories, we weathered those periods really, really well, a combination of great value-oriented innovation and the fact that our -- the breadth of our portfolio at various price points affords us the opportunity to really push different segments at the appropriate time anywhere around the world. So we're pleased with that. We're also pleased with the fact that you tend to see in times like this, a squeeze in the middle of the category with premium growing and the value growing, and that's been our focus, quite frankly. Premium has been the key focus for us, and we're seeing great progress, particularly across our Toothpaste business in new channels and at the premium end of the market, and we obviously have a very strong base business that is well positioned based on some of the relaunches we have. Raw and packing materials, we shall see, we've seen a stabilization across at least the Colgate side, you've heard a lot about the ag prices that continue to elevate, but we've seen a stabilization on those as we move. So we've got more predictability on that. Hence, the reason why we felt more confident the raise in guidance across multiple dimensions there because we see a little bit more transparency to that. As Stan mentioned, we've got some contracts that will obviously come off. Now the unknown there is what our suppliers would do. They're facing rising wage inflation, and we'll have to deal with that as it comes, particularly in the second half of the year relative to how they decide to adjust pricing on some of the key commodities that we will ultimately be purchasing. The other aspect is China. We will see where China impacts not only the Asia business, but the world, quite frankly. We expect obviously a slow progress in that market. I don't expect it to be vertical. I expect it to be a progress from quarter-to-quarter. We have not seen the travel retail business come back yet, and that is an expectation that we will probably see in the second half of 2023, not in the first half, but we shall see. Now we'll get into Asia and China, I'm sure as the Q&A progresses, but we had obviously a very strong quarter there, and we think we're well positioned as that economy comes back to deliver on it. The last is foreign exchange. That clearly is always a risk. We -- as you saw in the prepared remarks with low single-digit foreign exchange impact through the P&L, we'll see where that moves. The Latin American currencies have come back a little bit here as has the euro, but it's been very volatile, and we'll adjust to that going forward. But that has been a big driver in the past as you know, but we think we're well positioned right now from the fact again, of getting strong pricing into the P&L, both in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Sure. Thanks, and good morning, Lauren. Let me take the second question first. The competitive environment will likely intensify particularly as you see costs come down, and that will be a function of both local brands and private label getting more aggressive. The good news is our categories. If you take North America and private label, we're benign, no progress in private label shares. So to speak, with the exception of a little bit in liquid hand soap and a little bit cleaner, a little bit more acute of private label growth in Europe. As you saw price discrepancies or the gap between private label and global brands increase, we'll see how that translates in the back half as we expect them to have to take pricing in the first quarter as we did as well. So we think local brands in private label likely to elevate in terms of their competitive nature in the back half. And as costs to stay flat in the back half, which is what I think we're hearing from most, we expect the competitive environment to increase in that regard. Obviously, you'll see more promotional volumes probably come into the category, but it's been quite constructive so far. I will say that, but we need to anticipate that things could worsen based on where the costs are, and we're well prepared for that. On your first question, volumes. So category volumes, if I take just the market volumes in general, flat to slightly negative across most of the world on the volume side, obviously, driven by the fact that there's so much pricing that's gone into both Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care. If you look at us specifically, really strong growth on the Oral Care side, as I talked about, double-digit growth across most markets in Toothpaste, good volume progress in most markets on Toothpaste. So we're really pleased with what we're seeing there. Personal Care up mid- to high single digits depending on the marketplace. Both from a pricing standpoint, a little bit more challenged on the volume side given the strong pricing we've taken there, particularly in categories like liquid hand soap and bar soap. And on Home Care, mid-single digits to low single digits in terms of growth, depending on the marketplace. And that one has experienced a little more elasticity, particularly around the cleaner side of the business where we've seen more price competitiveness in that side of the business and a little bit more trade down. But overall, again, sequentially up and really pleased with sequentially up, given the fact that we had a lot more pricing in this quarter than we had in the fourth quarter. So good progress overall. We'll have to watch the volumes carefully, and we're all over that. Yes. Thanks, Mark. Yes, your answer is clearly around the spending. That's the answer. The spending is up quite notably in North America, that's very strategic. We see that as a growth market for us moving forward, not only on the top line but on the bottom line. We really wanted to reinvest behind the business in some of our brands, and we're clearly demonstrating that as we've gone through the last couple of quarters. Getting gross profit in the middle of the P&L sorted out in North America. It's clearly been a key focus, and we've had good gross profit progress in North America. We're getting better overhead leverage through the P&L. We're getting a lot better efficiency in our plants, and so we'll see that translating moving forward. But we will continue to invest behind that business moving forward to drive the top line. Europe, a little bit driven, obviously, by the foreign exchange environment to a certain extent and obviously, more increased inflation in Europe than we've seen in other markets around the world, particularly around the high gas prices and the fall-off effects of higher gas prices, and some of the raw materials that we purchased into our European plants. So overall, there's been a little bit more pressure there. But again, we've taken strong pricing in the back half of 2022, and pleased that we were able to execute our pricing in the first quarter of 2023 towards the latter end of the quarter, and we'll see that benefit us as we move forward. So overall, your observation is correct. We feel -- we've got a good handle of getting the gross margins and the operating profits up sequentially as we move through the back half of the year and importantly, sustaining or increasing our advertising levels to continue to drive the top line. Great. Thanks, Stephen. Let me take the Fabuloso and the Hill's question, and I'll have Stan come back to you on logistics. So the Fabuloso impact was Q1. It was a material impact to the North America volume line. We're not going to quantify that, but it was quite significant to the volume performance in North America. That is behind us as we move through into the second quarter. So we'll see the benefits of the Fabuloso business coming back into the P&L as we move forward. Again, if you take the Fabuloso business out of the North America number, they were up sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2022 in volume. So it was a very time-driven event in the first quarter. And the good news is that's behind us. Tonganoxie progressing, as you know, strategically, that's a very important plant for us given the strong demand we have on the wet side of the business at Hill's and our inability to supply the current demand for wet products all around the world. So getting that plant up and running will be strategic for the continued growth of that business. That will happen towards the tail end of the third quarter. And we anticipate, obviously, we'll have some start-up costs associated with that as we move through the transition of that facility. But overall, we should see that benefit us moving into 2024, particularly at the margin line as our wet business is margin accretive to us and will certainly benefit the Hill's business longer term. Sure, yes. Good morning, Rob. Let me take both those questions. First, on the non-measured channels. Again, this plays back to the strategy that we've been talking about for quite a few years now. And certainly, I highlighted again at CAGNY that we are very focused on growing channels that particularly are not measured by Nielsen, which are the faster growth channels, as you mentioned, e-commerce, club stores, discount stores, value discount stores. Some of the big box stores that we're seeing emerge in Latin America. So overall, in some of the new obviously platforms that we're seeing coming out of China, so this has been strategic and deliberate for us. And if you take the North America number, we've seen significant growth in non-measured channels to the tune of 4x to 5x what we're getting in measured channels. So obviously, good growth there. The key is to sustain that growth. Our e-commerce business was up double digit in the quarter, now roughly 14% of our total sales. So overall, and we're seeing good share growth in those businesses. In fact, if you take some of the progress we're seeing in China, very much driven by the strong e-commerce shares that we had. I demonstrated that at CAGNY. And in fact, since CAGNY, we've continued to increase our e-commerce shares in China, and likewise, in the brick-and-mortar business. So overall, we feel the strategy is working for us. Again, largely driven by the fact that we're supporting our businesses. We're using a wide spread of different mediums to grow brand awareness and brand penetration. Obviously, TV for a lot of reach and frequency given the scale and scope of our brands in many markets, but really fine-tuning behind our digital transformation, our ability to drive higher ROI spending in the digital space. And clearly, as we see more ROI coming, we see continued growth in terms of penetration, in terms of consumption, and in terms of ultimately delivering share growth and category growth for our retailers, we'll continue to elevate our spending. We're measuring it very quickly. This is not just for the sake of increasing spending. We want to be sure and absolutely deliberate and making sure that the spending is returning back to the brands, driving category growth. So there's not a specific number we're aimed at, Rob. We're looking to obviously continue to accelerate and sustain the top line and grow the health of our brands and we're seeing good results from the strategy we've put in the marketplace. Yes. Thank you very much. Let me take -- let me answer a couple of ways on the first part. First, obviously, coming through COVID, pet adoptions increased quite significantly. Those pets will continue to obviously age, and we will have, obviously, therapeutic and wellness products delivered for an aging pet population. So we feel good about that. You will recall, we've talked about the low brand penetration and brand awareness of the Hill's franchise. So we feel even if the market softens a bit, which we have not necessarily seen a little softness in volume, but not necessarily in value, as you see premiumization continuing to grow the market today. We feel we have the right portfolio of brands to continue to grow in the right investment strategy, hence, the aggressiveness of the advertising to ensure we're building brand awareness and penetration off the lower levels that we have today. And we also feel we've got opportunities internationally that we have yet to exploit given some of the capacity constraints that we have. And so we'll continue to obviously go after those moving forward. We feel -- I can't address the capacity issues or where the capacity is in the market. We're obviously putting capacity for our business. And we see that, obviously, as a real plus for us as we move forward, not only to drive better efficiencies in the plants that we currently produce in. But as we bring Tonganoxie up to line as we bring the Italian facility up to speed relative to our recipes, we feel we have real growth opportunities to continue to expand those segments where we weren't competing nearly as aggressively in the past. And so overall, that will not only drive our business but will drive the category as well, given the levels of support that we'll continue to bring to our retailers. Yes. Thanks for the question. Clearly, as we've seen in prior challenging the markets with a lot of inflation, you kind of have the tale of two cities, which is the premium segment continues to grow and that's the area where we're under-indexed in. So clearly, that's fueling a lot of our advertising investment and our channel strategies, particularly in Oral Care and in the Skin Health business. So we see that segment continuing to grow. The middle getting squeezed a bit and the lower end with the point you made, a little bit more trade down into the lower end. Now remember that some of our lower end businesses, while the absolute margin dollars might be lower, the margin percent might be as good or better than some of our premium segments. So overall, we feel pretty good about the mix of our business, and that continues to be, in our view, a real advantage for our portfolio relative to the breadth of our portfolio. Relative to volume shares, particularly in the emerging markets, we have taken significant pricing in emerging markets. And we clearly done that to ensure we get the flexibility in the P&L as quickly as we possibly can, that we sustain the advertising numbers or increase them to drive the innovation and deliver the pricing, particularly for the premium side of the market. We've seen a little trade down, particularly more in the Home Care businesses. The cleaners segment, I would point out in the dish segment, a little bit of trade down, particularly in Latin America. Personal Care, holding up okay. Bar soap tends to be more price elastic than many of our categories. But we've seen a lot of constructive pricing from our competition. So there hasn't been a significant amount of trade down to private label as of yet, but we'll watch that very carefully. So Home Care a little bit more challenged, particularly around the Cleaner segment worldwide and Personal Care in the Bar Soap segment. Oral Care looks okay, as I mentioned, were up by double digit in Toothpaste with both positive pricing and positive volume. Yes. Thanks, everyone, for your interest in our company. And let me just extend a personal thanks to the 34,000 Colgate people who have worked tirelessly to deliver a stronger momentum in the first quarter, getting us off to a strong start for the year. We greatly appreciate their steadfast resolve and the innovation that they're bringing to the market and the strong execution. So I look forward to talking to everyone in the second quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Stan Sutula",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Peter. So first, as we look at that inflation level, that $300 million to $400 million range is still the range that we're seeing on commodities. But there's really a tail underneath this. And in particular, around ag that affects predominantly Hill's, those prices still remain elevated. We don't see a lot of relief coming on those, and we see that kind of continuing as we go through the year. That's the main driver of our range, which is why we haven't seen it come down more. If you look at the other categories, like we do for toothpaste, Home Care, Oral Care and Personal Care, those have moderated more, and that was reflected in our guidance for the year, and they stayed reasonably balanced. So as we look out -- remember, we're essentially locked in here for Q2. We have locking already in place for Q3 and a little bit less for Q4, I still that as the viable range going into the back end of the year.  Now what happens is on a year-on-year impact, we wrap around on the very significant increases last year. The pricing that we've taken helps to moderate this. And then as you saw, we had an exceptionally good start to Funding the Growth this year, and that has also helped to mitigate that. That gives us the confidence to say that we will increase margins as we go through the year despite the fact that we expect that the commodities are still going to be in this range due to inflation. Yes. Thanks, Noel. And just a quick comment on the FTG. Noel highlighted that we had a very strong start here. That SKU, I think, is going to be a little bit different than prior years. In prior years, you saw build through the year. This was very deliberate. Supply chain has moderated in terms of the volatility around that. In particular, the Hill's team has actually had time to work on some of these as we've had a little bit better improvement in capacity utilization. So the strong start we have to the year, I think you should think that this will be more equal as you go through the year versus growing through the year, so from a SKU point of view. And this is important because as we look at the material cost, there's still going to be a headwind as we go through the year. So we need that to help offset that impact. And then we have our GPI program, we continue to get benefit from that. You saw a small charge in the quarter, but the team is driving productivity throughout the P&L, not just in the GP line, but also in the MBO line as we look for things to offset that material headwind. So why don't I start here? North -- first, let's start with the commodities. So as we said, still $300 million to $400 million range on that impact. I don't see that moving a lot in the short term. And keep in mind, our locking, right? So we're already into almost May, so 2Q is largely locked. And as we go into the back half of the year, hopefully, we'll see a little bit of relief come through. But keep in mind, the closer we get, the more we lock in order to ensure we have supply. If we think about the North America margin and go through, so North America margins here still improved on a year-on-year basis. They also improved on a sequential basis. So as you look at the progress on what we're doing from a GP point of view, that's important. We do see some logistics benefits here. Logistics have come down versus the start of the year. But again, we start to lock in some of that activity. We've seen it mostly in the ocean side of logistics, which will certainly help the overall margin. And if you think about North America in total, clearly, Fabuloso recall had a impact in the quarter. That's getting largely behind us, so we expect that we'll see improvement as we go through the year. Yes, on the operating margin, it's up year-to-year versus fourth quarter, you see it's down about 100 basis points or so. And that's really driven by the Fabuloso impact, combined with the increased investment in advertising as we're bringing both innovation to market and supporting the pricing that we've taken in the market. Yes. And Nik, on the commodities, it's kind of across the board with most of the ag. So corn, wheat, soybean, the risk of the drought in the U.S. and the effect on crops, even though some other areas of the world are a little bit better, the risk of Ukraine, all has been pushing pressure on that. Don't forget as well that the protein side of this, things like chicken livers, et cetera, with some of the impacts that have been out there has all put pressure on Hill's. That remains the real driver of that $300 million to $400 million range. Yes. Let me pick up here. So first, if you take a look, these investments in the business and if you look at the net sales, keep in mind, you go back just a couple of years ago, we're up well over $200 million quarter versus first quarter of 2021. So the investment in the brand is paying off. If we look at margin, the private label has -- what we said as a 90 basis point impact to the total company has slightly over 400 basis points impact to Hill's. So as you take a look at that margin impact, that is a material impact to Hill's on a GP basis. Now through time, that private label will wind down, and that will be over the next couple of years as we slowly wind down that contract and then backfill it with Hill's volume at Hill's margin. Now as we've already talked about, all of the raw material impact inflation has predominantly been against Hill's also impacting their margins. But keep in mind, they've taken significant pricing here over the last several quarters, and that is helping to mitigate this. And the fact that we're now, as the Red Collar facilities have come on, that's helping us manage utilization, not just a Red Collar but of the entire manufacturing footprint. That's enabled Hill's to contribute materially to the funding of the growth savings. So I think where Hill's is right now is well positioned. I think we'll see sequential improvement in margin as we go through the year. We're going to manage that carefully so we can continue to supply our clients and we saw material improvement in case fill rates coming out of first quarter. Sure, Bryan. Thanks for the question. So first, on interest here as we look, this is -- well, we want to call it out because we saw rates going up, this is not a large number. So you should think around $20 million for the year. It's not really related to the first quarter debt issuance. We are very happy with that. We had very good demand on that bond. It's really the assumptions on the number of rate increases and predominantly in Europe. So as we look at the ECB and the changes there, the slight difference to what we had anticipated coming into the year. As we all know, that's a moving target, and it's going to depend on inflation moves to central banks, but that's our best guess right now. So that's a modest impact for the year. Yes. So let me pick up on logistics here. So you saw logistics was 9.5% of sales. And if we look -- it's been incremental headwind to our overheads. Remember, it's in our overheads and SG&A for several years. And in Q4, we saw the first year-on-year decline as a percent of sales in 12 quarters, and it was down again this quarter, and we expect it to be down for the year. I expect as we kind of look out through the remainder of the year, it's going to come down slightly. I don't see it coming down materially. So we're at 9.5% now. I still think it will probably start with the 9% as we go through the remainder of the year. So certainly a help year-on-year, but as we kind of look out through the rest of the year, I think that's how you should think about as a percent of sales, it will moderate and stay just above 9%."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President, M&A, John Faucher.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the third quarter 2024 earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the third quarter 2024 earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our results and our 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining us, as we report another strong quarter of top line and bottom line performance. Our strategy of delivering more impactful core and premium innovation, increasing our advertising spending and scaling capabilities to drive improved brand health and higher household penetration is paying-off through strong volume-led organic sales growth. You're seeing this best represented in the fact that we have delivered volume growth in all six divisions for the second straight quarter with 3% growth in developed markets and 4.6% growth in emerging markets. It won't be every division every quarter, but we believe our geographic breadth and category mix will enable us to better weather volatility over time, whether that's from economic, geopolitical or other factors and deliver organic sales growth in line with our long-term targets despite difficult comparisons. This will be well considered in our plans and it's why we've been talking about building our business model to deliver sustained, profitable growth even as category growth decelerates as pricing growth recedes. Our commitment to reestablishing our gross margin is paying-off in gross profit dollar growth even as we lap more difficult comparisons. We have used this gross margin expansion to continue funding the investment in advertising and capabilities, enabling us to deliver best-in-class volume growth, which is driving strong organic sales growth. And we believe the flexibility we have built into our P&L gives us the ability to turn that organic sales growth into consistent compounding earnings per share growth to deliver top tier TSR over the long-term. And with that, I'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So I just wanted to drill down into North America. NA pricing was down significantly for the second quarter in a row, you\u2019d warned us about that last quarter. But just take a step back and help us understand the competitive environment you're facing and what your strategy is from a pricing standpoint? And how much volume payback you think you're getting, given a muted result in the quarter, albeit with some timing caveats? And just how that business is set up going forward as we look forward to 2025 and beyond? And hopefully, this isn't cheating, but I wanted to slip in a second question on Pet, which is mostly North America actually. But the Hill's performance is really striking relative to industry trends. Can you just talk about the sustainability of low-single digit Pet pricing going forward, given that difficult industry pricing environment and the market share gains with your volume performance, again, in light of that difficult industry environment? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Good morning, Dara. Thank you. So North America, structurally, we came in exactly where we more or less expected, a little soft on the volume, which I'll explain in just a moment. But what we're seeing is as category growth decelerates a little bit as expected and what we talked about in the second quarter. Volumes returning, but not necessarily as fast as we would like, but I think there's more normalization on the volume line. We expect that to continue to inch up moving forward. Pricing was in line with Q2, as you mentioned, and as we talked about in the second quarter with similar adjustments that we expect to continue as we move through the balance of this year into the first quarter. I talked about volume being a little bit softer than it was expected. This was, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, due to shipment timing on a couple of orders. We had the benefit of some promo moves from the third quarter, which we'll see a little bit more in the fourth quarter. And as you've noted that we've -- with the skin health business now in the North America, we obviously had the impact of lower skin health volumes, principally driven by China and a little bit of reduction due to some e-commerce business that didn't come through in the quarter. But overall, more or less where we expected. The team is very focused on obviously setting ourselves up for a really strong '25, a strong innovation growth plan that we have in place. And we'll see, obviously, the volume start to inch back as we've seen the category start to normalize more. But overall, the good news is, we've been able to weather some of the softness in North America with really strong broad-based growth across the business. You talked about Hill's coming in exceptionally strong. It was a strong performance for Hill's in the quarter. Strong volume, which was really encouraging given the impact of lower private label. So you take the private label up, we were up mid-single digits on volume and a really strong margin performance on the business. And we've been consistent with what we've articulated in the past, which is that we want to continue to reinvest that margin into driving category growth, and that's exactly what we're doing. A little bit of pricing that came through in the quarter. And we think we've got the ability as ag prices move around to take some pricing given the strength, again, of the brand in the market. We're gaining market share. We're the fastest-growing brand, global brand in pet specialty and neighborhood pet stores. So we feel good about where we are. We're continuing to expand that business into segments that we weren't aggressively competing in below, specifically wet. So overall, we feel very good about where the Hill's business is, and our ability to continue to drive strong, sustained growth behind strong advertising levels.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So Noel, I wanted to ask you some initial perspective as you start thinking about next year. I know you're not going to give guidance today, but you mentioned you feel confident in your ability to be in the long-term algorithm on a multiyear basis. So as you think about cycling those tough comparisons, what are the areas of the business that you expect could accelerate? Is it more innovation -- contribution from innovation and be better volume in developed markets, or maybe the pet food business? Just any perspective on how you're thinking about cycling those comps and areas of the business that could accelerate? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Filippo for the question. We've been talking for, I think, the better part of three years now on how important it is to invest in the long-term capabilities that we think are going to be essential to drive sustained growth. And I really attribute that -- ability to do that to the flexibility that we've built into the P&L. So what we're focused on right now is elevating and accelerating innovation, particularly H2 and H3. We think we have a continued very strong new product grid moving into '25 and '26. We've built gross margin flexibility into the P&L that allows us to invest back behind the business, that advertising level, we will continue to do that. That's the way you improve brand health and drive long-term sustainable share growth. You've seen the share growth really inflect over the last couple of years, as you\u2019ve seen global shares, particularly in toothpaste and toothbrushes continue to move upwards. That's a reflection of the innovation and the sustained growth that we have -- the sustained advertising growth that we have in the P&L. So a lot of the same, Filippo, continuing to invest back behind the business, drive household penetration where we're getting much better with the analytical work that we're doing to understand where those growth opportunities are, building per capita consumption in those markets where we see real opportunities, driving our brand through advocacy. So all the things that we've been talking about, clearly will play out in '25 and into '26.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you. I want to know about Europe. Obviously, a very strong quarter, and a lot of your peers have been delivering strong results in Europe as well. But one of your peers said not to expect this on an ongoing basis. So I wanted to know if -- what's driving it? What were your market shares like, in Europe during the quarter and what do you expect going forward?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Robert. Again, a great quarter for Europe. My congratulations to the team out there which is doing an exceptional job really focusing on the fundamentals. We've clearly put significant investment back into Europe, which we're seeing really play out in that sustained top line growth. Volume growth was terrific. We're getting a little bit of pricing. Pricing, we're not immune to the challenges of pricing in Europe. But the good news is, we move into '25 with much stronger market shares, good penetration across our categories, and a very strong level of advertising that's improved brand health. So again, very consistent with the theme that we've been talking about, reinvest behind those growth opportunities. Our Oral Care shares are at record high levels now. We continue to see growth opportunities there, particularly building penetration amongst very specific targets. The advertising levels across the business, not just in Oral Care or coming back in. So we're seeing more broad-based growth across the European business. But we're not immune to some of the softness and challenges that always seem to plague the European market long term. But the good news is the business is in very good shape. Gross margins are at very high levels. Advertising strong and market shares have been reflected very positively.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Good morning, Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: Good morning. I wanted to ask about your emerging markets business. Organic sales growth has been strong in these markets, but most of its been driven by pricing to offset FX pressures. And I guess, as a result, this isn't necessarily translating into significant growth on a net basis. So I guess, I'd be curious to better understand how you're thinking about these businesses, and ultimately, how we should think about the contribution of volume mix going forward?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Bonnie. Listen, the emerging market numbers were terrific. Even ex-Argentina, very positive volume and positive pricing ex-Argentina. So we're encouraged very much so. Some of our larger markets, particularly Brazil, India and Mexico continue to perform very, very strongly. And if you look long-term strategically, this is where the growth is going to come from. I mean, there continues to be per cap opportunities, premiumization opportunities in those markets, which we think we're executing very well. I'm sure, we'll get into some discussions on Latin America, but they continue to perform exceptionally well despite some of the choppiness that we've seen in some of those markets, particularly Mexico in post-elections. But overall, the emerging market strategy that we have in place continues to deliver. So you go across the board, Asia, strong performance this quarter, particularly China. Our Colgate China business performed exceptionally well. India strong. Africa, Eurasia, despite some of the volatility of that division is going through, again, quite strong. So we think the refocus on some of the real basic fundamentals that we had to put back into the business on driving household penetration, making sure we\u2019re looking at the premiumization opportunities, getting gross margin back into the P&L has allowed us to get a lot more flexibility in targeting some of those markets. Now as you well know, there\u2019s significant volatility in emerging markets. We\u2019ve seen some of the exchange rates move negatively over the recent periods, and we\u2019ll have to adjust accordingly to that moving forward. But overall, we feel very good about it, but we\u2019re not immune to some of the economic and political issues that I outlined earlier that impact those markets. But overall, the underlying performance is kind of right where we\u2019d like to see it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Grundy with BNP. Please go ahead.\nKevin Grundy: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congratulations on the really strong quarter and results year-to-date. Stan, I was hoping maybe we could pivot to gross margin. Again, strong in the quarter. We're seeing the pricing contribution start to step down here commensurately with lower level of cost inflation. Funding the growth continues to be quite good, has been for a very long time at the company. Without giving guidance for next year, can you maybe just help us think about the building blocks and how you're thinking about gross margin development over the next 12 months or so? And then relatedly, what that may mean as you're thinking about reinvestment further down the P&L? Thank you for that.\nStanley Sutula: Hey. Good morning, Kevin. Thanks for the question. So gross profit, we're very pleased with the gross profit margin here in third quarter. And candidly, it was better than our expectations, up 270 basis points year-on-year and improved sequentially. As we've disclosed before, we continue to see raw material inflation, and you saw that in our gross margin roll forward. Also, we're going to wrap around on even tougher compares here on a year-on-year basis in Q4. So as we think about the components, I think the teams have done a really nice job of looking and driving, funding the growth to drive productivity, which will help us on the margin. And then openly, we also get benefit from volume. So as the volumes have been increasing, we get the ability to get more overhead absorption, and that's always a benefit when we think about the variances. Now as Noel talked about earlier, we expect that the pricing contribution will mitigate over time. So we're not going to give '25 guidance here. But I think if you look at our history, you would see that we drive funding the growth. We have a great program here to drive that productivity over time. And that funding the growth, combined with revenue growth management, will help us balance out that P&L. The model we continue to expect, which would be gross margin dollars will drive that profitable growth. We'll invest that back in the business through innovation, through advertising to deliver both top and bottom line.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was just curious, if you could talk a little bit about the philosophy on advertising and reinvestment spending. Like, how high can you go? Is there a point at which there's sort of a diminishing rate of return? So whether it's not about '25, but let's call it '25 and beyond, as you've created this flexibility, Stan just spoke to ongoing productivity programs, funding the growth continues. So how do you think about that spending and making sure it's still coming back with that same ROI and it's not diminishing? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. We've talked about for quite some time. And the fundamental strategy within the company is obviously building that flexibility so we can reinvest in building our brands. I mean we've got great penetration opportunities. We've got brand equity and health opportunities. And ultimately, that's how you drive sustained growth over the long-term, is making sure that consumers understand our product benefits and are excited about using our products. And so we find -- as you see through the volume line, particularly, and we have a lot of internal measurements to assess ROI. But if you take it at the simplest level, continuing to drive volume growth and broad-based penetration around the world is the most important benchmark for us to ascertain whether our advertising is working for us or not. How high is high? We continue to assess this on a geographic basis. Are we getting the returns? Do we need to move money, which is new for us from one division to another where we're seeing better returns on that. I talked about Europe earlier. We're seeing exceptional return on investment with our advertising investments, particularly in Oral Care. We obviously have the flexibility to now put some more money into the North America business, which I think will benefit from that. But overall, we're getting better at understanding what's working for us. And particularly, as we look at some of the work we're doing around analytics and using AI to really improve our digital impact, that's going to have a better ROI for us moving forward. I would very much like to find even more efficiency in the advertising P&L. That will be a primary focus for us as we move into '25 and '26, is really beefing up the analytical capabilities we have around our media buys and making sure that we're really understanding what's working for us on a much more fluid basis than we've had before, so we can make decisions on an intelligent basis as quickly as possible. So overall, we're pleased with the advertising investment. We've been able to now support more of our brands broadly across the business, that is certainly helping drive overall health. And most importantly, again, we're seeing good penetration numbers and good premiumization opportunities through some of our innovations. So overall, we feel good about that. We're going to continue to invest as long as we see the top line and penetration moving.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKaumil Gajrawala: I'd like to follow up on that a little bit. I think it was interesting when you said better at some of the things that are working. Can you maybe just talk about some of the changes that you've made, maybe it's in being tactical on the advertising versus longer-term brand building? If you could just maybe get into some of the tweaks because when we see such a good result, especially, in some markets where CPG peers have struggled. It feels like there's a lot more going on, and if you could just give a little more detail on what's behind that, I think it would be helpful.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Sure, Kaumil. Thank you. Listen, over the last three or four years, our team here in New York, working really closely with our operating heads, has spent a significant amount of time in the strategy of the company. And what that really entails is making sure that we are collectively working together on prioritizing where we see the biggest growth opportunities. Historically, I\u2019d say, we were a bit democratic in our spending. We\u2019re now much more strategic and we are able to pinpoint where we\u2019re getting the best ROI, where we see the best growth opportunities. And the division presidents aren\u2019t afraid to move money around within their divisions and across divisions to ensure that we\u2019re putting our money in areas where we\u2019re going to get the best return for that. And that clearly is demonstrated through the volume growth that we\u2019re seeing across all six divisions. I think it really comes down to not only just Oral Care and Pet Health and Skin Health, but now looking at opportunities both in the Personal Care businesses, the classical Personal Care businesses. Bodywash had a great performance in Europe this quarter. They\u2019re supporting some relaunches with great innovation and advertising. Likewise, we\u2019re seeing some great opportunities in Home Care across Latin America, which had a nice Home Care result in the quarter. So it\u2019s broad-based support and it\u2019s making sure strategically that we\u2019re very thoughtful about where we\u2019re putting the money in terms of geographic. The second aspect of that is exactly how we spend our money. The media environments become far more complex. There are various platforms to choose from. We\u2019re being very selective and focused on how we spend that money. It\u2019s easy to get enamored with a lot of shiny objects out there in terms of media opportunities, but we\u2019re focused on where we can build reach and build the frequency accordingly to build brand health. And the digital teams here in New York, helping to share best practices around the world and getting that ROI up, specifically in the digital area across different mediums, has really paid out nicely for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. Can you expand a bit on what you're seeing in Latin America? You made a comment about Mexico and the elections, but in the prepared remarks there was also a comment about stabilizing and still positive. So just what's the direction of travel in Latin America, specifically Mexico and perhaps Brazil? And then just connected to that, you talked about some currency volatility and needing to respond in different ways. How do you think about pricing in this market, specifically, if the macros are stable, but maybe not as strong as they were a year ago? Just any thoughts on how you'd approach strategy in these markets over the 12 months? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, Chris. Thank you. Good morning. So again, as you mentioned, really strong performance in Latin America, notably against tougher volume comps. We did expect some slowdown in organic sales growth, and that's what we're seeing, but very much in line with our expectations. So we feel very good about that. And the underlying health of the business, i.e., specifically market shares, Latin America had a terrific quarter. Pleasingly, if you look at that business on a two year stack basis, volume has increased sequentially for four consecutive quarters. So despite the fact that there's a lot of volatility, we're seeing volume come back into the categories. And you'll remember that we took significant pricing in those geographies over the last two years. So to see volume come back as quickly as it did and sustained is important. Now post elections, we've seen some choppiness in Mexico, particularly around the category that may be more of a normalization. We're going to have to watch that carefully and make sure that we're thinking about our spending accordingly in that market. But we've got a really strong innovation plan. You saw in the prepared remarks, we've relaunched Colgate Total, which is a very significant business across Latin America and affords us a very important opportunity to continue to drive premiumization. But behind, what we think is the best formula that we've ever put in the market on Colgate Total and one that we are very excited about seeing the results of that across Latin America. But again, pricing up ex Argentina. So if foreign exchange continues to move against us, the strength of the brands and the support that we put behind that business, we think we can take more pricing in those markets to help offset that. But we're not immune to some of the sluggish and the foreign exchange that hits those markets, as you well know. I talked about Mexico at Barclays. And overall, I think we continue to have a very strong performance there. But the sluggishness that we're seeing across some of the categories as we ended the quarter, we need to watch that carefully. And I think, again, the team is very well positioned to execute based on what we see. So overall, good. Brazil, a terrific quarter for Brazil despite obviously some -- a little bit of uncertainty in those markets that continues to plague them, but I feel good about what we're seeing coming out of Brazil across the rest of the region. The performance continues to be quite strong. This is the team that knows how to execute in volatile environments, knows how to continue to drive penetration and premiumization. So I feel pretty confident that while \u2013 despite the lack of aggressive pricing, given the inflationary pressures, we will still get some foreign exchange pricing in the business over the subsequent quarters.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask you broadly about affordability given the macro environment, particularly in North America, but I think this is relevant to all markets. And as consumers continue to scrutinize your spending, can you talk about some of the initiatives that you have that help with respect to either promotional plans or at mid-tier price points with product? Just sort of thinking about the broader picture and how consumers are thinking about their total basket spend and actions that you're taking to maintain, if not grow share in that backdrop? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Olivia. So again, let me come back to strategy. Our strategy has been to accelerate our innovation, particularly on the premium side of the business, which providing value add benefits to the big core businesses that we have around the world, supporting that with advertising and ultimately, getting the brand penetration and share growth. Our volume shares performed well in the quarter in general across the world. Likewise, our value shares. We saw, obviously, toothpaste performed quite well in that regard. So overall, again, the consumer may be a little bit challenged, particularly in North America, it's making sure that we continue to dial up our innovation and provide real added value for -- across the multiple price tiers in which we compete. The other aspect of that is making sure that you are very thoughtfully thinking about your promotional cadence and how you promote your digital coupon strategy, your paper coupon strategy, your promotions, on-pack promotions, your price pack architectures. All of those are critically important in making sure that we have the analytics to really determine what's going to drive category growth for our retailers and continue to drive performance for our business. I was just reviewing the other day some incredible work that we're doing with some of the retailers in the U.S. with real AI and analytics around our promotions and seeing great results for that. So I think the point is, yes, the environment is a little bit more competitive. Coupon redemption rates are up. Promotions seem to be more or less in line, which I would say, normalized. Still not back to the pre-COVID levels, which is good, but more or less normalized. And ultimately, it\u2019s making sure that we\u2019re spending our money as thoughtfully as we possibly can to get the best ROI. But I would say a more normalized consumer, slightly higher promotional redemption rates behind coupons. But across the world, it\u2019s pretty consistent in terms of where we were post COVID.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. Terrific results, Noel. So if you, I think, stand back and listen to at least three or four of the questions, I think the underlying question is, why are you guys doing so well in so many places? And it's -- and I think is it just that, hey, you're spending more -- you can spend more money, you've got the data, so you're spending it in the right places. And that's kind of a very broad sort of the answer. But what I'd like to do is drill down a little bit more on that point and see -- and maybe just talk about Oral Care. How much of your success is driven by technology, by the whitening initiatives and then marketing that or other specialties? Just trying to get a sense of things that can drive sustainable, continued market share gains that go beyond just spending more money in marketing. And I know that's going on, but I just want to give you the chance to talk about that a little bit more. And then also, if we had the time, looking at what you're doing in China, which is just -- you're just being much more successful than anybody else at this point and how that model applies to that very tough market. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Great. Good morning, Rob. Thanks. Thanks for the question. So again, it comes back, I think, with just consistency of performance in our focused categories around the world and our ability to really dial in on where we see the growth opportunities. We've spent a lot of time talking about building capabilities. And I really want to emphasize that because you don't necessarily see the immediate impact in the quarter, but those capabilities are all intended on building long-term, sustainable health behind our business. So it's innovation. It's digital, It's our advertising return on investment. It's our data acquisition and using data to drive better decision-making. It's making sure that our innovation across H2 and H3 is where it needs to be. Making sure the core is where it needs to be. Making sure that we're addressing new channel behaviors. But it's all the basics that we've been talking about and making sure then that we invest accordingly. And we had to get the middle of the P&L addressed to do that. So we deliberately took a lot of pricing over the last three years to get our categories where they needed to get to. And then ultimately, that is paid out in allowing us to really invest consistently behind our brands. And we measure internally our brand health, the health of our equities, and they are in a really good place, and that's what we want to continue to build. Now we're not immune to what everyone is talking about. Clearly, we're going to see some divisions take a step back. But the breadth of our business and our geographic footprint, we believe, allows us to weather some of these -- the volatility that you're seeing referring to Better than Most, and we want to continue to do that. But we can't be complacent. We need to build more capabilities and sharpen those as we move forward. We need to continue to address the opportunities we see in certain geographies where we think there's real growth for us there. But again, it's a deliberate, thoughtful approach to this business. We're going to be consistent. We're not going to necessarily try to hit home runs, a lot of singles to take a sports analogy. But making sure that we do that in a way that drives broad-based growth over time. So again, a lot of the strategy, Rob, particularly on Oral Care. To your question, we think the focus on premiumization, the great new product innovations that we brought on whitening adjacencies, we now have Colgate Total rolling out in Latin America with some significant new innovation behind the core. You heard about some of the great technology that we're bringing into Max Fresh across India and some of the Southeast Asia markets, that will continue to roll out. So again, the stepped-up innovation and resources that we're putting behind that will ultimately play out. On China specifically, it should be said that we had some pretty easy comps. But that being said, our China business continues to perform really, really well. I'll talk to Colgate first and then the Hawley & Hazel business. The Colgate business continues to do very well, up high single digits, driven primarily by premiumization. Great innovation across the calendar moving forward. We're improving our brand health behind some of the investment that I referred to. And overall, we're getting a good mix of volume and pricing against tougher comps on the Colgate side. Hawley & Hazel, as you know, has come out of quite a few quarters of challenged growth. We're starting to see that come back nicely, which is good, but not where we need to be yet. So we still have room for opportunity. We are looking at our go-to-market approach on Hawley & Hazel moving forward. That team is really deliberately thinking about how we want to be structured over the next couple of years to ensure that we can continue to invest in a very competitive market and drive sustained volume and value growth for the business. But overall, pleased with the China performance, but we\u2019re not immune to the slowdown that we\u2019re seeing across that business. But we think the consistent performance behind our innovation and supporting those business will drive sustained growth moving forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Hi, good morning. My question is what was the exit rate for organic sales growth in the quarter and what is embedded in your guidance for Q4? Because even if the guidance raise is a wide range. And Noel, from your tone on this call, it seems that you're supposed to keep the pace of 6% globally. So in other words, if you current trends continue, is that the way we should be thinking, that the top of the range would be that embedded around 6%? And if I can squeeze a clarification on Hill\u2019s. Can you comment now on the potential for more international expansion with more capacity into 2025? Thank you for both.\nNoel Wallace: Great. Andrea, good morning. Thank you. Listen, we don't guide by quarter, so I don't want to get into the specifics. But I do think we're -- we feel pretty good about the underlying health of where the quarter came in. So overall, we're good. And as I said in my upfront comments, we think we're positioned for consistent growth. But we're not, again, as I mentioned, immune to some of the issues that many of the CPG companies have talked about throughout the earnings season. But that's reflected in our guidance. And I think you see that in our numbers and the guidance for itself in terms of where we think we\u2019ll be. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen a little slowdown, a little move in foreign exchange. We\u2019ll see ultimately where the categories unfold as we exit the year. But overall, we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty good position. On Hill\u2019s capacity, that is continuing to obviously allow a lot of good things on the Hill\u2019s business. It\u2019s allowing us to build more flex in the middle of the P&L. We continue to find ways to truly optimize that supply chain and build more positive variances to those factories. Secondly, it\u2019s allowing us to obviously expand into higher growth segments in the wet segment, which we saw a nice growth in the wet business in quarter and continuing to drive overall share in that segment. So it\u2019s giving us a lot more flexibility. There\u2019s more work to be done. We\u2019ll continue to obviously be very, very diligent about how we think about allocating volumes across the world and addressing some of the growth opportunities that we see, particularly internationally. But overall, a terrific quarter and the supply chain team at Hill\u2019s is doing just an exceptional job integrating the new facilities and finding ways to really optimize the network.\nOperator: The next question comes Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So I have just maybe one point of clarification and then a question. And the clarifying, Noel, I think earlier you talked a little bit about gross profit dollars and gross dollar profit growth. And I think it's maybe created a little bit of a question about whether there's a signal here that the focus maybe more shifting to gross profit dollar growth versus gross margin percentages. And I know you've had a view on that in the past, so if you could just sort of clarify that? Just is there any sort of message that you're trying to send or we still leave gross margin expand?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Let me maybe throw it to Stan, Bryan. No message whatsoever here. We could -- as I think we've been quite consistent, we understand the importance of gross margin, both gross margin percent and gross margin dollars. Encouragingly, in the quarter, we saw both and that's important for us. But again, as we strategically look at the growth opportunities, whether it's innovation, geographically, we're thoughtfully thinking through exactly how the impacts on gross margin will be. But ultimately, what we're looking for is our ability to continue to drive gross margin dollars to invest in the business. And it's hard to get there without gross margin percent. We're not just going to chase volume to drive dollars is what I'm saying, it has to be very deliberate choice. But let me give it to Stan, he can provide a little bit more color.\nStanley Sutula: Yeah, Bryan. So first of all, it is obviously a combination of the two. And if you think about the business, we have -- you saw a great margin improvement in a number of businesses, particularly in Hill's. And as we look, the only part we're trying to -- point we're trying to make is how we deliver that margin improvement in those -- in that dollar growth is going to shift. So pricing will be less of a benefit, volume has been a help here going in and productivity will continue to be a driver as we look at that. But obviously, as we look at both margin and dollars it's a combination of both. And that is part of our overall business model on how we drive the investment back into the business and deliver top and bottom line growth.\nJohn Faucher: Bryan, if I can just add one point to Stan's point. The bottom line growth piece, key, right? We need EPS growth in dollars, right, because that's what creates long-term TSR at the top end of our peer group. So we talk about organic sales growth, but we're focused on driving dollar-based sales growth. We talked about driving gross margin percentage, but we also know we need to drive those gross profit dollars to drive EPS growth in dollars to drive TSR. So it's a very thoughtful way to look at it, but as Stan said, you need both to drive that bottom line growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to get a little bit more clarity on some of the dynamics that were going on in North America in the quarter. I mean it sounds like some shipments were pushed from Q3 to Q4. Can you just clarify what that was due to? And then the pullback in the eCommerce, what that was attributable to? And then how should we be thinking about some of the macro dynamics in Q4, especially in the U.S. as some retailers are talking about pulling back into orders? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Noel Wallace: Yeah, Korinne. Thank you. Again, we talked about three specific things. Obviously, there\u2019s some shipment timing that moved from third to the fourth quarter, that was just due to some disruptions in our network and ultimately getting that order out in time. But ultimately, it will move into the fourth quarter. But nothing systemic there that we feel would be reoccurring. The eCommerce issue was specifically on the skin health business. We\u2019ve seen a little \u2013 obviously, there\u2019s some softness coming out of Asia, specifically China. But this one was more specific to the U.S. market, where we saw some of our big online retailers pull back a little bit on orders at the end of the quarter. We think those were inventory adjustments more than anything. But in any case, we need to watch that carefully and see if that\u2019s going to be sustained or not moving forward. And overall, the macro dynamics in the North America, I would say, more stabilization. We haven\u2019t seen anything deeply unusual on the promotion side. I think the percent sold on promotion is more or less pretty consistent. Still not back to where it was, as high as it was, pre-COVID. So overall, I would say more normalization, as I did mention, a little higher redemption rates coming through on couponing, and a little bit more broad-based activity in terms of the number of promotions. But overall depth and proportion to what we\u2019ve seen in the past seems pretty normalized right now.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask Noel on Skin Care. I guess, first, just mechanically and following up to Dara in North America, are you able to quantify how much of a drag the restatement was on growth in that segment this quarter to the extent that it was? But then more generally, I guess, you've talked a little bit about it, but maybe could you expand on what you're seeing in skin care trends across key markets because I'm assuming there's a good deal of variability. And do any of the reporting structure changes that you've made this year carried with them give some strategy with respect to how you approach Skin Care or skin health opportunities longer term? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. So overall, let me just generalize. North America was, with the order changes and the skin, if you take skin out was closer to flat for the quarter. But I'm not going to quantify any more specifics on that. But specifically around the skin sector, I think you've heard from others, there's been some sluggishness, particularly in Asia. Likewise in Europe, and to a certain extent in the U.S. as well. So we're not necessarily immune to that. But what we have been doing very specifically is we are thinking about that business quite differently. We brought in some outside talent, somebody with over 20 years\u2019 experience at L\u2019Oreal. We\u2019re getting very clear and articulate about what we \u2013 where we want to compete and how we want to compete in that space. We feel very good about that organization now being much more centralized here in the U.S. in order to drive global decisions from the center and making very deliberate choices on how you invest and where we invest. We had to clean up some of the market expansion opportunities there that we didn\u2019t think were sustainable for the business. But overall, the economics and long-term health aspects of where we see that business growing continue to be very favorable. And we\u2019re encouraged, obviously, by the long-term strategy. We\u2019ve got some short-term issues with, obviously, Asia and some of the softness that we\u2019re seeing in some of the European markets to address. But overall, again, we feel the strategy we\u2019re putting in place will get us back to the sustained growth that we expect.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to U.S. Oral Care and kind of ask more of a deep dive question there. So as we look at the market trends over a long period of time, there were four or five quarters where it was actually growth '22 to '23 (ph). But largely, it's been in a decelerating or share loss situation going back quite a long time. I guess the question is, what contributes to that period of outperformance? What has contributed to this state of back to share loss? And maybe if you kind of like a deep dive on what you think competitors are doing well, where they're gaining share? Where do you think Colgate could do a better job from a share perspective and how do you broadly kind of think about it? Because I know there's a lot of thought innovation around this total relaunch is to refocus on whitening, and yet, the general trajectory remains kind of where it is? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Listen, overall, shares are roughly flat, down 20 basis points on toothpaste and up on toothbrushes. And clearly, we\u2019ve seen some impact of our refocus on some of the untracked channels that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years and seeing good performance in those untracked channels. So overall, business is good. It\u2019s not exactly where we want it right now, and we\u2019re very focused on getting the innovation strategy dialed up. We\u2019ve got to get the premiumization side of that business addressed. We\u2019ve got strong core businesses that we\u2019re seeing benefited as you see the consumer to a certain extent, some of the consumers trading more into the mid-tier. But overall, it\u2019s getting the premiumization side of the business addressed moving forward. And we\u2019re very focused on that in the strategy. Toothbrush business continues to perform very, very well. So again, putting more investment into that market, getting the innovation right, executing the fundamentals around distribution and shelf sets, all the basics that we think are necessary. And the plans that we have in \u201825 were some of the big core relaunches that were not privy to talk about, we think we\u2019re set up for stronger success moving forward. We\u2019ve seen some, again, choppiness with some of the retail environments, particularly the drug class of trade, where we hire shares, has struggled to drive traffic and turn in their retail environment. So we\u2019re having to shift accordingly. But we still feel the channel long term provides a growth opportunity for us, but you\u2019ve seen some sluggishness in that retail environment in the short term.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Edward Lewis with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\nEdward Lewis: Yeah. Thanks very much. I guess just looking back when you launched your sort of new strategy a few years ago. You talked about the core product of CPG doing a lot around that. You talked about adjacent categories. And you also talked about adjacent channels, the opportunities there. And just looking at the results today, I mean, we've seen the success for a number of years now on eCommerce in China. But how much of the channel mix changed in regions like, say, Latin America and Asia, ex-China relative to where it was before? And how much is that helping the success you're seeing with the premiumization strategy?\nNoel Wallace: Yeah. Good morning, Ed. Thank you. Interesting question. It's back on the channel expansion. I mean the initial focus on that was predominantly eCommerce, but we identified real unique opportunities in the expansion of very innovative discount formats around the world. The expansion of the club store format in certain parts of the world, you're seeing club stores particularly in Asia, and more specifically, China, grow quite significantly a couple of years. So it's making sure that as we think strategically around where we want to invest, we're investing in those retailers that are going to drive long-term growth for the business. And we've been very quick to adopt to new formats. And that's been one of the successes we've had here in North America when we initially guided to the Dollar Stores decades ago and ultimately, we've got strong leads there. But it's making sure that we are working with our retailers, all of our retailers to bring products to drive innovative growth for their sectors. And that's the key focus for us, category growth across all channels. And making sure that as we see new retail environments come on stream, that we're thinking very thoughtfully on how to do that in a way that drives growth for our retailers for the category and for the whole market. So I think it's just being very attuned to what we're seeing in the markets. You're seeing a lot of very innovative things happening at the retailer level. I think that's to be expected given some of the challenges in the move to eCommerce. So there's big box retailers that are having to change their shopping experience. And we're very much working in tandem with them to ensure that we have the products they need, the price pack architectures and configurations that they need in order to drive excitement at the shelf.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion.\nNoel Wallace: Thanks. Thanks to everyone. Again, a strong quarter. We're having a good year so far through three quarters. Net sales were up 4.5%. Organic, up 8.5%. With again, a very strong balance between volume at 3.3% and pricing at 5.2%, and EPS double-digit on a year-to-date basis. And importantly, getting that flexibility across the income statement and the balance sheet. But this is the hard work of Colgate people all around the world aligned to our growth strategy and executing extraordinarily well. So thanks, everyone, for the questions today, and thanks to all the Colgate people for delivering a strong quarter.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stanley Sutula",
            "content": "Hey. Good morning, Kevin. Thanks for the question. So gross profit, we're very pleased with the gross profit margin here in third quarter. And candidly, it was better than our expectations, up 270 basis points year-on-year and improved sequentially. As we've disclosed before, we continue to see raw material inflation, and you saw that in our gross margin roll forward. Also, we're going to wrap around on even tougher compares here on a year-on-year basis in Q4. So as we think about the components, I think the teams have done a really nice job of looking and driving, funding the growth to drive productivity, which will help us on the margin. And then openly, we also get benefit from volume. So as the volumes have been increasing, we get the ability to get more overhead absorption, and that's always a benefit when we think about the variances. Now as Noel talked about earlier, we expect that the pricing contribution will mitigate over time. So we're not going to give '25 guidance here. But I think if you look at our history, you would see that we drive funding the growth. We have a great program here to drive that productivity over time. And that funding the growth, combined with revenue growth management, will help us balance out that P&L. The model we continue to expect, which would be gross margin dollars will drive that profitable growth. We'll invest that back in the business through innovation, through advertising to deliver both top and bottom line. Yeah, Bryan. So first of all, it is obviously a combination of the two. And if you think about the business, we have -- you saw a great margin improvement in a number of businesses, particularly in Hill's. And as we look, the only part we're trying to -- point we're trying to make is how we deliver that margin improvement in those -- in that dollar growth is going to shift. So pricing will be less of a benefit, volume has been a help here going in and productivity will continue to be a driver as we look at that. But obviously, as we look at both margin and dollars it's a combination of both. And that is part of our overall business model on how we drive the investment back into the business and deliver top and bottom line growth."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining us, as we report another strong quarter of top line and bottom line performance. Our strategy of delivering more impactful core and premium innovation, increasing our advertising spending and scaling capabilities to drive improved brand health and higher household penetration is paying-off through strong volume-led organic sales growth. You're seeing this best represented in the fact that we have delivered volume growth in all six divisions for the second straight quarter with 3% growth in developed markets and 4.6% growth in emerging markets. It won't be every division every quarter, but we believe our geographic breadth and category mix will enable us to better weather volatility over time, whether that's from economic, geopolitical or other factors and deliver organic sales growth in line with our long-term targets despite difficult comparisons. This will be well considered in our plans and it's why we've been talking about building our business model to deliver sustained, profitable growth even as category growth decelerates as pricing growth recedes. Our commitment to reestablishing our gross margin is paying-off in gross profit dollar growth even as we lap more difficult comparisons. We have used this gross margin expansion to continue funding the investment in advertising and capabilities, enabling us to deliver best-in-class volume growth, which is driving strong organic sales growth. And we believe the flexibility we have built into our P&L gives us the ability to turn that organic sales growth into consistent compounding earnings per share growth to deliver top tier TSR over the long-term. And with that, I'll open it up for questions. Good morning, Dara. Yeah. Good morning, Dara. Thank you. So North America, structurally, we came in exactly where we more or less expected, a little soft on the volume, which I'll explain in just a moment. But what we're seeing is as category growth decelerates a little bit as expected and what we talked about in the second quarter. Volumes returning, but not necessarily as fast as we would like, but I think there's more normalization on the volume line. We expect that to continue to inch up moving forward. Pricing was in line with Q2, as you mentioned, and as we talked about in the second quarter with similar adjustments that we expect to continue as we move through the balance of this year into the first quarter. I talked about volume being a little bit softer than it was expected. This was, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, due to shipment timing on a couple of orders. We had the benefit of some promo moves from the third quarter, which we'll see a little bit more in the fourth quarter. And as you've noted that we've -- with the skin health business now in the North America, we obviously had the impact of lower skin health volumes, principally driven by China and a little bit of reduction due to some e-commerce business that didn't come through in the quarter. But overall, more or less where we expected. The team is very focused on obviously setting ourselves up for a really strong '25, a strong innovation growth plan that we have in place. And we'll see, obviously, the volume start to inch back as we've seen the category start to normalize more. But overall, the good news is, we've been able to weather some of the softness in North America with really strong broad-based growth across the business. You talked about Hill's coming in exceptionally strong. It was a strong performance for Hill's in the quarter. Strong volume, which was really encouraging given the impact of lower private label. So you take the private label up, we were up mid-single digits on volume and a really strong margin performance on the business. And we've been consistent with what we've articulated in the past, which is that we want to continue to reinvest that margin into driving category growth, and that's exactly what we're doing. A little bit of pricing that came through in the quarter. And we think we've got the ability as ag prices move around to take some pricing given the strength, again, of the brand in the market. We're gaining market share. We're the fastest-growing brand, global brand in pet specialty and neighborhood pet stores. So we feel good about where we are. We're continuing to expand that business into segments that we weren't aggressively competing in below, specifically wet. So overall, we feel very good about where the Hill's business is, and our ability to continue to drive strong, sustained growth behind strong advertising levels. Yeah. Thanks, Filippo for the question. We've been talking for, I think, the better part of three years now on how important it is to invest in the long-term capabilities that we think are going to be essential to drive sustained growth. And I really attribute that -- ability to do that to the flexibility that we've built into the P&L. So what we're focused on right now is elevating and accelerating innovation, particularly H2 and H3. We think we have a continued very strong new product grid moving into '25 and '26. We've built gross margin flexibility into the P&L that allows us to invest back behind the business, that advertising level, we will continue to do that. That's the way you improve brand health and drive long-term sustainable share growth. You've seen the share growth really inflect over the last couple of years, as you've seen global shares, particularly in toothpaste and toothbrushes continue to move upwards. That's a reflection of the innovation and the sustained growth that we have -- the sustained advertising growth that we have in the P&L. So a lot of the same, Filippo, continuing to invest back behind the business, drive household penetration where we're getting much better with the analytical work that we're doing to understand where those growth opportunities are, building per capita consumption in those markets where we see real opportunities, driving our brand through advocacy. So all the things that we've been talking about, clearly will play out in '25 and into '26. Yeah. Thanks, Robert. Again, a great quarter for Europe. My congratulations to the team out there which is doing an exceptional job really focusing on the fundamentals. We've clearly put significant investment back into Europe, which we're seeing really play out in that sustained top line growth. Volume growth was terrific. We're getting a little bit of pricing. Pricing, we're not immune to the challenges of pricing in Europe. But the good news is, we move into '25 with much stronger market shares, good penetration across our categories, and a very strong level of advertising that's improved brand health. So again, very consistent with the theme that we've been talking about, reinvest behind those growth opportunities. Our Oral Care shares are at record high levels now. We continue to see growth opportunities there, particularly building penetration amongst very specific targets. The advertising levels across the business, not just in Oral Care or coming back in. So we're seeing more broad-based growth across the European business. But we're not immune to some of the softness and challenges that always seem to plague the European market long term. But the good news is the business is in very good shape. Gross margins are at very high levels. Advertising strong and market shares have been reflected very positively. Good morning, Bonnie. Yeah. Thanks, Bonnie. Listen, the emerging market numbers were terrific. Even ex-Argentina, very positive volume and positive pricing ex-Argentina. So we're encouraged very much so. Some of our larger markets, particularly Brazil, India and Mexico continue to perform very, very strongly. And if you look long-term strategically, this is where the growth is going to come from. I mean, there continues to be per cap opportunities, premiumization opportunities in those markets, which we think we're executing very well. I'm sure, we'll get into some discussions on Latin America, but they continue to perform exceptionally well despite some of the choppiness that we've seen in some of those markets, particularly Mexico in post-elections. But overall, the emerging market strategy that we have in place continues to deliver. So you go across the board, Asia, strong performance this quarter, particularly China. Our Colgate China business performed exceptionally well. India strong. Africa, Eurasia, despite some of the volatility of that division is going through, again, quite strong. So we think the refocus on some of the real basic fundamentals that we had to put back into the business on driving household penetration, making sure we're looking at the premiumization opportunities, getting gross margin back into the P&L has allowed us to get a lot more flexibility in targeting some of those markets. Now as you well know, there's significant volatility in emerging markets. We've seen some of the exchange rates move negatively over the recent periods, and we'll have to adjust accordingly to that moving forward. But overall, we feel very good about it, but we're not immune to some of the economic and political issues that I outlined earlier that impact those markets. But overall, the underlying performance is kind of right where we'd like to see it. Yeah. Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. We've talked about for quite some time. And the fundamental strategy within the company is obviously building that flexibility so we can reinvest in building our brands. I mean we've got great penetration opportunities. We've got brand equity and health opportunities. And ultimately, that's how you drive sustained growth over the long-term, is making sure that consumers understand our product benefits and are excited about using our products. And so we find -- as you see through the volume line, particularly, and we have a lot of internal measurements to assess ROI. But if you take it at the simplest level, continuing to drive volume growth and broad-based penetration around the world is the most important benchmark for us to ascertain whether our advertising is working for us or not. How high is high? We continue to assess this on a geographic basis. Are we getting the returns? Do we need to move money, which is new for us from one division to another where we're seeing better returns on that. I talked about Europe earlier. We're seeing exceptional return on investment with our advertising investments, particularly in Oral Care. We obviously have the flexibility to now put some more money into the North America business, which I think will benefit from that. But overall, we're getting better at understanding what's working for us. And particularly, as we look at some of the work we're doing around analytics and using AI to really improve our digital impact, that's going to have a better ROI for us moving forward. I would very much like to find even more efficiency in the advertising P&L. That will be a primary focus for us as we move into '25 and '26, is really beefing up the analytical capabilities we have around our media buys and making sure that we're really understanding what's working for us on a much more fluid basis than we've had before, so we can make decisions on an intelligent basis as quickly as possible. So overall, we're pleased with the advertising investment. We've been able to now support more of our brands broadly across the business, that is certainly helping drive overall health. And most importantly, again, we're seeing good penetration numbers and good premiumization opportunities through some of our innovations. So overall, we feel good about that. We're going to continue to invest as long as we see the top line and penetration moving. Yeah. Sure, Kaumil. Thank you. Listen, over the last three or four years, our team here in New York, working really closely with our operating heads, has spent a significant amount of time in the strategy of the company. And what that really entails is making sure that we are collectively working together on prioritizing where we see the biggest growth opportunities. Historically, I'd say, we were a bit democratic in our spending. We're now much more strategic and we are able to pinpoint where we're getting the best ROI, where we see the best growth opportunities. And the division presidents aren't afraid to move money around within their divisions and across divisions to ensure that we're putting our money in areas where we're going to get the best return for that. And that clearly is demonstrated through the volume growth that we're seeing across all six divisions. I think it really comes down to not only just Oral Care and Pet Health and Skin Health, but now looking at opportunities both in the Personal Care businesses, the classical Personal Care businesses. Bodywash had a great performance in Europe this quarter. They're supporting some relaunches with great innovation and advertising. Likewise, we're seeing some great opportunities in Home Care across Latin America, which had a nice Home Care result in the quarter. So it's broad-based support and it's making sure strategically that we're very thoughtful about where we're putting the money in terms of geographic. The second aspect of that is exactly how we spend our money. The media environments become far more complex. There are various platforms to choose from. We're being very selective and focused on how we spend that money. It's easy to get enamored with a lot of shiny objects out there in terms of media opportunities, but we're focused on where we can build reach and build the frequency accordingly to build brand health. And the digital teams here in New York, helping to share best practices around the world and getting that ROI up, specifically in the digital area across different mediums, has really paid out nicely for us. Sure, Chris. Thank you. Good morning. So again, as you mentioned, really strong performance in Latin America, notably against tougher volume comps. We did expect some slowdown in organic sales growth, and that's what we're seeing, but very much in line with our expectations. So we feel very good about that. And the underlying health of the business, i.e., specifically market shares, Latin America had a terrific quarter. Pleasingly, if you look at that business on a two year stack basis, volume has increased sequentially for four consecutive quarters. So despite the fact that there's a lot of volatility, we're seeing volume come back into the categories. And you'll remember that we took significant pricing in those geographies over the last two years. So to see volume come back as quickly as it did and sustained is important. Now post elections, we've seen some choppiness in Mexico, particularly around the category that may be more of a normalization. We're going to have to watch that carefully and make sure that we're thinking about our spending accordingly in that market. But we've got a really strong innovation plan. You saw in the prepared remarks, we've relaunched Colgate Total, which is a very significant business across Latin America and affords us a very important opportunity to continue to drive premiumization. But behind, what we think is the best formula that we've ever put in the market on Colgate Total and one that we are very excited about seeing the results of that across Latin America. But again, pricing up ex Argentina. So if foreign exchange continues to move against us, the strength of the brands and the support that we put behind that business, we think we can take more pricing in those markets to help offset that. But we're not immune to some of the sluggish and the foreign exchange that hits those markets, as you well know. I talked about Mexico at Barclays. And overall, I think we continue to have a very strong performance there. But the sluggishness that we're seeing across some of the categories as we ended the quarter, we need to watch that carefully. And I think, again, the team is very well positioned to execute based on what we see. So overall, good. Brazil, a terrific quarter for Brazil despite obviously some -- a little bit of uncertainty in those markets that continues to plague them, but I feel good about what we're seeing coming out of Brazil across the rest of the region. The performance continues to be quite strong. This is the team that knows how to execute in volatile environments, knows how to continue to drive penetration and premiumization. So I feel pretty confident that while \u2013 despite the lack of aggressive pricing, given the inflationary pressures, we will still get some foreign exchange pricing in the business over the subsequent quarters. Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Olivia. So again, let me come back to strategy. Our strategy has been to accelerate our innovation, particularly on the premium side of the business, which providing value add benefits to the big core businesses that we have around the world, supporting that with advertising and ultimately, getting the brand penetration and share growth. Our volume shares performed well in the quarter in general across the world. Likewise, our value shares. We saw, obviously, toothpaste performed quite well in that regard. So overall, again, the consumer may be a little bit challenged, particularly in North America, it's making sure that we continue to dial up our innovation and provide real added value for -- across the multiple price tiers in which we compete. The other aspect of that is making sure that you are very thoughtfully thinking about your promotional cadence and how you promote your digital coupon strategy, your paper coupon strategy, your promotions, on-pack promotions, your price pack architectures. All of those are critically important in making sure that we have the analytics to really determine what's going to drive category growth for our retailers and continue to drive performance for our business. I was just reviewing the other day some incredible work that we're doing with some of the retailers in the U.S. with real AI and analytics around our promotions and seeing great results for that. So I think the point is, yes, the environment is a little bit more competitive. Coupon redemption rates are up. Promotions seem to be more or less in line, which I would say, normalized. Still not back to the pre-COVID levels, which is good, but more or less normalized. And ultimately, it's making sure that we're spending our money as thoughtfully as we possibly can to get the best ROI. But I would say a more normalized consumer, slightly higher promotional redemption rates behind coupons. But across the world, it's pretty consistent in terms of where we were post COVID. Great. Good morning, Rob. Thanks. Thanks for the question. So again, it comes back, I think, with just consistency of performance in our focused categories around the world and our ability to really dial in on where we see the growth opportunities. We've spent a lot of time talking about building capabilities. And I really want to emphasize that because you don't necessarily see the immediate impact in the quarter, but those capabilities are all intended on building long-term, sustainable health behind our business. So it's innovation. It's digital, It's our advertising return on investment. It's our data acquisition and using data to drive better decision-making. It's making sure that our innovation across H2 and H3 is where it needs to be. Making sure the core is where it needs to be. Making sure that we're addressing new channel behaviors. But it's all the basics that we've been talking about and making sure then that we invest accordingly. And we had to get the middle of the P&L addressed to do that. So we deliberately took a lot of pricing over the last three years to get our categories where they needed to get to. And then ultimately, that is paid out in allowing us to really invest consistently behind our brands. And we measure internally our brand health, the health of our equities, and they are in a really good place, and that's what we want to continue to build. Now we're not immune to what everyone is talking about. Clearly, we're going to see some divisions take a step back. But the breadth of our business and our geographic footprint, we believe, allows us to weather some of these -- the volatility that you're seeing referring to Better than Most, and we want to continue to do that. But we can't be complacent. We need to build more capabilities and sharpen those as we move forward. We need to continue to address the opportunities we see in certain geographies where we think there's real growth for us there. But again, it's a deliberate, thoughtful approach to this business. We're going to be consistent. We're not going to necessarily try to hit home runs, a lot of singles to take a sports analogy. But making sure that we do that in a way that drives broad-based growth over time. So again, a lot of the strategy, Rob, particularly on Oral Care. To your question, we think the focus on premiumization, the great new product innovations that we brought on whitening adjacencies, we now have Colgate Total rolling out in Latin America with some significant new innovation behind the core. You heard about some of the great technology that we're bringing into Max Fresh across India and some of the Southeast Asia markets, that will continue to roll out. So again, the stepped-up innovation and resources that we're putting behind that will ultimately play out. On China specifically, it should be said that we had some pretty easy comps. But that being said, our China business continues to perform really, really well. I'll talk to Colgate first and then the Hawley & Hazel business. The Colgate business continues to do very well, up high single digits, driven primarily by premiumization. Great innovation across the calendar moving forward. We're improving our brand health behind some of the investment that I referred to. And overall, we're getting a good mix of volume and pricing against tougher comps on the Colgate side. Hawley & Hazel, as you know, has come out of quite a few quarters of challenged growth. We're starting to see that come back nicely, which is good, but not where we need to be yet. So we still have room for opportunity. We are looking at our go-to-market approach on Hawley & Hazel moving forward. That team is really deliberately thinking about how we want to be structured over the next couple of years to ensure that we can continue to invest in a very competitive market and drive sustained volume and value growth for the business. But overall, pleased with the China performance, but we're not immune to the slowdown that we're seeing across that business. But we think the consistent performance behind our innovation and supporting those business will drive sustained growth moving forward. Great. Andrea, good morning. Thank you. Listen, we don't guide by quarter, so I don't want to get into the specifics. But I do think we're -- we feel pretty good about the underlying health of where the quarter came in. So overall, we're good. And as I said in my upfront comments, we think we're positioned for consistent growth. But we're not, again, as I mentioned, immune to some of the issues that many of the CPG companies have talked about throughout the earnings season. But that's reflected in our guidance. And I think you see that in our numbers and the guidance for itself in terms of where we think we'll be. Obviously, we've seen a little slowdown, a little move in foreign exchange. We'll see ultimately where the categories unfold as we exit the year. But overall, we feel like we're in a pretty good position. On Hill's capacity, that is continuing to obviously allow a lot of good things on the Hill's business. It's allowing us to build more flex in the middle of the P&L. We continue to find ways to truly optimize that supply chain and build more positive variances to those factories. Secondly, it's allowing us to obviously expand into higher growth segments in the wet segment, which we saw a nice growth in the wet business in quarter and continuing to drive overall share in that segment. So it's giving us a lot more flexibility. There's more work to be done. We'll continue to obviously be very, very diligent about how we think about allocating volumes across the world and addressing some of the growth opportunities that we see, particularly internationally. But overall, a terrific quarter and the supply chain team at Hill's is doing just an exceptional job integrating the new facilities and finding ways to really optimize the network. Yeah. Let me maybe throw it to Stan, Bryan. No message whatsoever here. We could -- as I think we've been quite consistent, we understand the importance of gross margin, both gross margin percent and gross margin dollars. Encouragingly, in the quarter, we saw both and that's important for us. But again, as we strategically look at the growth opportunities, whether it's innovation, geographically, we're thoughtfully thinking through exactly how the impacts on gross margin will be. But ultimately, what we're looking for is our ability to continue to drive gross margin dollars to invest in the business. And it's hard to get there without gross margin percent. We're not just going to chase volume to drive dollars is what I'm saying, it has to be very deliberate choice. But let me give it to Stan, he can provide a little bit more color. Yeah. Thanks, Steve. So overall, let me just generalize. North America was, with the order changes and the skin, if you take skin out was closer to flat for the quarter. But I'm not going to quantify any more specifics on that. But specifically around the skin sector, I think you've heard from others, there's been some sluggishness, particularly in Asia. Likewise in Europe, and to a certain extent in the U.S. as well. So we're not necessarily immune to that. But what we have been doing very specifically is we are thinking about that business quite differently. We brought in some outside talent, somebody with over 20 years' experience at L'Oreal. We're getting very clear and articulate about what we \u2013 where we want to compete and how we want to compete in that space. We feel very good about that organization now being much more centralized here in the U.S. in order to drive global decisions from the center and making very deliberate choices on how you invest and where we invest. We had to clean up some of the market expansion opportunities there that we didn't think were sustainable for the business. But overall, the economics and long-term health aspects of where we see that business growing continue to be very favorable. And we're encouraged, obviously, by the long-term strategy. We've got some short-term issues with, obviously, Asia and some of the softness that we're seeing in some of the European markets to address. But overall, again, we feel the strategy we're putting in place will get us back to the sustained growth that we expect. Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Listen, overall, shares are roughly flat, down 20 basis points on toothpaste and up on toothbrushes. And clearly, we've seen some impact of our refocus on some of the untracked channels that we've had over the last couple of years and seeing good performance in those untracked channels. So overall, business is good. It's not exactly where we want it right now, and we're very focused on getting the innovation strategy dialed up. We've got to get the premiumization side of that business addressed. We've got strong core businesses that we're seeing benefited as you see the consumer to a certain extent, some of the consumers trading more into the mid-tier. But overall, it's getting the premiumization side of the business addressed moving forward. And we're very focused on that in the strategy. Toothbrush business continues to perform very, very well. So again, putting more investment into that market, getting the innovation right, executing the fundamentals around distribution and shelf sets, all the basics that we think are necessary. And the plans that we have in \u201825 were some of the big core relaunches that were not privy to talk about, we think we're set up for stronger success moving forward. We've seen some, again, choppiness with some of the retail environments, particularly the drug class of trade, where we hire shares, has struggled to drive traffic and turn in their retail environment. So we're having to shift accordingly. But we still feel the channel long term provides a growth opportunity for us, but you've seen some sluggishness in that retail environment in the short term. Yeah. Good morning, Ed. Thank you. Interesting question. It's back on the channel expansion. I mean the initial focus on that was predominantly eCommerce, but we identified real unique opportunities in the expansion of very innovative discount formats around the world. The expansion of the club store format in certain parts of the world, you're seeing club stores particularly in Asia, and more specifically, China, grow quite significantly a couple of years. So it's making sure that as we think strategically around where we want to invest, we're investing in those retailers that are going to drive long-term growth for the business. And we've been very quick to adopt to new formats. And that's been one of the successes we've had here in North America when we initially guided to the Dollar Stores decades ago and ultimately, we've got strong leads there. But it's making sure that we are working with our retailers, all of our retailers to bring products to drive innovative growth for their sectors. And that's the key focus for us, category growth across all channels. And making sure that as we see new retail environments come on stream, that we're thinking very thoughtfully on how to do that in a way that drives growth for our retailers for the category and for the whole market. So I think it's just being very attuned to what we're seeing in the markets. You're seeing a lot of very innovative things happening at the retailer level. I think that's to be expected given some of the challenges in the move to eCommerce. So there's big box retailers that are having to change their shopping experience. And we're very much working in tandem with them to ensure that we have the products they need, the price pack architectures and configurations that they need in order to drive excitement at the shelf. Thanks. Thanks to everyone. Again, a strong quarter. We're having a good year so far through three quarters. Net sales were up 4.5%. Organic, up 8.5%. With again, a very strong balance between volume at 3.3% and pricing at 5.2%, and EPS double-digit on a year-to-date basis. And importantly, getting that flexibility across the income statement and the balance sheet. But this is the hard work of Colgate people all around the world aligned to our growth strategy and executing extraordinarily well. So thanks, everyone, for the questions today, and thanks to all the Colgate people for delivering a strong quarter."

This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Now for opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher.\nJohn Faucher: Thanks Drew. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today\u2019s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the second quarter 2024 earnings press release and related prepared materials, and our most recent filings with the SEC including our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate\u2019s website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in Tables 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the second quarter 2024 earnings press release and is available on Colgate\u2019s website. Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q2 results and our 2024 outlook. We will then open it up for Q&A. Noel?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks John, and thanks for joining us this morning. I look forward to taking your questions in regards to our strong Q2 results. As part of our ambition to deliver consistent compounded earnings growth, we have talked about the importance of driving balanced organic sales growth - all six divisions, all four categories, and with a combination of volume and pricing growth. We have re-vamped our innovation model, leveraged our global strength across price tiers, invested in marketing spend, and scaled new exciting capabilities across the organization, all of which is driving brand health and household penetration. This is particularly important given the pricing we have taken over the past few years. Our return to mid single-digit volume growth this quarter, including growth at both Hill\u2019s and Hawley & Hazel highlights some early success from this strategy, and this is well timed. We are returning to strong volume growth as gross margins are expanding, which will drive the incremental gross profit that funds the investment in brands and capabilities while still delivering compelling bottom line growth. We\u2019re also using data and analytics tools, including AI, to track the effectiveness of these activities as we look to further optimize the return on our increased spending. This is a topic we\u2019ll be discussing more over time. With this combination of increased penetration and the continued success of our revenue growth management strategy, we have the plans in place to drive consistent, balanced top line growth. We combine that with the benefits of operating leverage, productivity and cost discipline to turn that into consistent compounded earnings per share growth. Along with strong cash flow to fund investment, dividends and share repurchases, we believe this leaves us well positioned to drive top tier TSR. Our recent results show the strength and effectiveness as we continue to execute against this strategy, and with that, I\u2019ll open it up to questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question today comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Please go ahead.\nPeter Grom: Thank you Operator, and good morning everyone. Noel, I was hoping you could give us a deeper understanding of the levels of investment and what drives the confidence that the changes you\u2019ve made over the past several years can sustain this improvement we\u2019ve seen. Obviously from an outsider perspective, it seems to be working given the market share is in the mid single digit volume growth today, but just as you look ahead, how do you sustain this momentum and continue to build household penetration from here? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks Peter, and first of all, happy birthday!\nStan Sutula: Happy birthday!\nJohn Faucher: Happy birthday Peter!\nPeter Grom: Thanks guys.\nNoel Wallace: So let\u2019s get into the heart of the strategy, which I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistently communicating over the past few years, and that\u2019s really getting the middle of that P&L in a place where we could have a lot more flexibility to invest behind the brands. That investment certainly is helping to drive the strong volume performance, but more importantly household penetration, which ultimately drives category growth and market share. It\u2019s keeping that flexibility in the middle of the P&L, allowing us to pinpoint the advertising in areas where we see real growth. The international exposure of our business obviously is giving us opportunities to allocate money in regions and areas where we see great growth opportunities, and that was delivered in the quarter with category growth across all of our categories and all of our divisions. Keeping those investment levels where they are, continuing to find ways to drive the effectiveness of that investment likewise is very important. As I\u2019ve mentioned before and as you saw down at CAGNY, we\u2019re using AI and other tools to really drive improved ROI. We\u2019re getting much better at our innovation - that\u2019s certainly helping drive that consistent growth around the world, and the execution of the strategy, we think is far better than it has been in previous years. Overall, keeping the flex in the middle of the P&L, strong gross margins, and allocating that in areas around the world where we\u2019re seeing real opportunities for growth, we think will drive sustained, consistent compounded growth moving forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey guys.\nNoel Wallace: Hey Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: Just wanted to focus on the long term top line growth opportunity in Hill\u2019s from here on the volume and pricing side. First, maybe just on volume, you\u2019ve added a lot of capacity in the last couple of years, you\u2019ve also got a lot of areas you\u2019re still under-penetrated in, in theory internationally - wet foods, small paws, etc., so just some perspective at this point as we look out over the next three to five years, is there incrementality in volume as you pursue these areas more aggressively, and how should we think about that? Then on pricing, obviously you\u2019ve had very strong penetration increases, market share gains on the Hill\u2019s business. In theory, that should support higher pricing over time, but you\u2019re also in a category environment with industry trade-down in pet and probably a tough CPG environment in general for pricing, so how should we think about pricing going forward? Can you take consistent pricing, maybe to recapture some of the margin compression if you strip out the higher marketing in recent years, and just how would you juxtapose that sort of internal momentum versus the external environment in terms of your ability to take pricing longer term, looking out over the next few years?\nNoel Wallace: Thanks Dara. You know, clearly a great quarter for Hill\u2019s, a strong performance across the board, quite frankly, and we\u2019re particularly pleased with the strong volume in light of the significant pricing we\u2019ve taken historically. I\u2019ll come back and talk about pricing in a moment. But obviously ex-private label, to see the strength of the volume and the pricing move through the P&L is extremely encouraging, particularly given the advertising investment that we\u2019ve put into the business, which continues to strengthen the brand. I think what\u2019s important to call out in the quarter is the real inflection on the margin line, strong gross margin, strong operating margin, and this is a reflection, I think of getting more volume running through the business and obviously seeing the leverage move through the P&L. But if I take a step back again and characterize the marketplace, clearly as we\u2019ve talked about before, low household awareness and low brand penetration overall of the Hill\u2019s business clearly supporting the strong advertising investment, and we\u2019re seeing that delivered in the quarter - penetration up, market share\u2019s up. We\u2019re were one of the fastest growing global brands in some of the pet specialty stores this quarter, so again I think a reflection of the upside potential we still have. When you look at segment opportunities, we\u2019ve talked about that in the past, obviously wet an area that we\u2019re under-indexed in, clearly seeing the ramped up capacity we have in wet delivering better penetration, better growth, better execution in stores as we\u2019re getting more wet SKUs on the shelf. That\u2019s obviously translating into more upside potential as we consumers obviously shifting into those categories. Overall, we think the balance of the business is where we want it, and we\u2019re continuing to invest aggressively to drive that household penetration. You couple that with a really strong innovation pipeline, we see that in the first half of this year and we see that moving into \u201925 as well, so we think quite frankly the flywheel of the business is working very effectively for us right now. Low penetration, low awareness, we\u2019re working on that and getting more effectiveness in our advertising spend, which we\u2019re increasing, and importantly getting the gross margins and operating margins back to where we\u2019d like them is allowing for the increased gross margin dollars to invest behind the business. International, likewise - we\u2019ve talked about the opportunities that we still see globally in the long term to take this brand around the world. We\u2019re very focused on the big core markets right now, but long term we see opportunities to expand into new markets. The last I\u2019d say is obviously the mix between Science Diet and Prescription Diet, we saw a good inflection on Prescription Diet this quarter - that\u2019s been deliberate, that\u2019s been a function of partly due to the capacity expansion that we\u2019ve had has allowed us to get more diets on the shelf, allowed us to provide more sustained, consistent deliver to the vet professionals on the Prescription Diet business, and we saw a good mix benefit of that in the quarter as well, so overall we\u2019re pleased with it. The category is a little soft right now, as you mentioned, as household starts come down, but as we see hopefully the U.S. economy starting to show some vibrancy, or at least for a softer landing, we think that will bode well for us. Pricing is an opportunity, given the strength of the brand. We\u2019ll continue to take pricing where we have necessity to do that. The good news is we\u2019ve seen a little bit of flattening on commodity pricing in the Hill\u2019s business, which is excellent for us as we get that pricing we\u2019ve had historically. We\u2019ve seen the benefit of a more moderate inflationary environment on input costs, and we get more leverage through the P&L as we see the volume come back. So overall, we feel like we\u2019re in a good position to sustain that moving forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead.\nFilippo Falorni: Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the North America business - great to see the volume return to solid growth, but you also called out a more promotional environment, so maybe one, you can talk about the general promotional environment in your categories from your competitors and private label? Also from a cycling standpoint, I know last year you were cycling lower promotional levels. Is it fair to think that\u2019s going to continue in Q3 and then by Q4, you\u2019re going to have a more normal comparison from a promotional level? Any color on the balance between pricing and volume in the back half for North America would be helpful, thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Sure, thank you Filippo. Overall, organic growth in North America was roughly in line with our expectations, albeit more volume, which was really pleasing - I\u2019ll come back to that in just a moment, and a little less pricing than expected, although as you rightfully point out and as we said in the prepared commentary, this was due to comparisons with the year ago. If you remember, really strong pricing in the second quarter, high single digits - I think it was around 9%. We talked about it in the call in the second quarter last year, the fact that we perhaps may have pulled back a bit too far on promotions. We saw some of those promotions come back in the quarter this year, particularly in one retail environment where we didn\u2019t promote at all in the year-ago period, a little bit of mix change between some of the higher price retailers to lower price retailers also impacting price. But pleasingly on the volume side, which we think is very important for us in North America right now, we saw great improvement, and what was particularly encouraging there is we saw household penetration as a result of that. We\u2019ve talked a lot about that over the last four quarters, the importance of driving household penetration, and the North America numbers are terrific. Market share is more or less flat in value, but up quite considerably on the volume side - that reflects, I think, a much more targeted approach and a thoughtful approach in how we\u2019re utilizing promotional dollars to be very effective and prudent without going too far down the trap of over-promoting. But right now, we feel we\u2019re in a very good place with that. We did see some of the retailers lean in. There\u2019s been a little bit more lift on promotional coupons, a little bit higher but expected as we move through the quarter, and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year. As I continually say, at least if you look outside of scanner data, our non-Nielsen business continued to track at multiples higher than the Nielsen tracked channels, so again really, really pleased with the overall context of how the quarter we delivered. We\u2019re going to watch the pricing carefully, but encouraged to see the volume coming back quite nicely.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you, good morning to all. My question is on Europe - obviously nothing short of impressive that you capped your [indiscernible] there, but with that, some of your peers have been calling a broader deceleration similar to what has been happening in the U.S., so wanted to see if you are--as you exit the quarter and as you negotiated some of the shelf space and [indiscernible] in Europe as well, and how you just described some of the shifts into the channels in the U.S. into the low income or more affordable channels, or discounters, are you seeing this happening in Europe or just as you said, your pricing ladders and your innovation has been able to sustain momentum there, and how we should be thinking to the back end. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, good morning Andrea. Much around the latter, obviously. I think we have seen some shift in the retail environments there, but again we\u2019re through the negotiations and I think what\u2019s particularly pleasing in Europe is the breadth of the innovation across price tiers and the breadth of innovation across various channels. That\u2019s allowed us, in our view, the deliver that sustained very strong growth. What\u2019s particularly pleasing is obviously the balance between pricing and volume there. We\u2019ll see pricing obviously come down as we lap some of the strong pricing we took last year, but the volume coming back into the P&L at such healthy levels was particularly encouraging for the business, and that\u2019s reflected in market share and in household penetration, as I said. The market share on toothpaste is at record high levels. I think the balance and effectiveness we have between the Colgate and the Elmex and Meridol brands is really taking stride now in the sense of getting that promotional mix right between the three brands, and we\u2019re seeing likewise on the home care and the personal care brands, some of the innovation coming to the market and drive good sustained growth. Overall, a great performance for Europe. We\u2019ll watch it in the back half, but right now we think the sustained market share growth that we\u2019ve had across all of our categories is going to bode well for the back half, and the volume coming back in across multiple price tiers is a good indication that we\u2019re in a good place to set us up for a strong back half as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question. Noel, you mentioned sequentially higher commodity costs as the year progresses, and I was wondering if you could help us quantify it or tell us, is it material enough that you would have to make any kind of pricing actions, and if so, where would the hot spots be?\nNoel Wallace: Yes, let me let Stan get into the details, but strategically, obviously we think with the pricing that we\u2019ve taken and strong productivity moving through the P&L, particularly with the volume starting to inflect much more positively, we think we\u2019re set up well for the back half. We will see some inflationary commodity increases, at least in terms of where commodities are in the back half, but nothing that gives us tremendous concern, particularly given the strong margin profile that we have across the business and where we\u2019re seeing the growth. Let me have Stan give you a little bit more color there\nStan Sutula: Thanks Noel. What we saw in the first quarter, we talked about coming out was that we had general easing on commodities, but as we\u2019re looking into the back half of the year, we do see some raw material inflation in commodity costs, as well as an impact from transactional FX. As we think about the components of that, there are some pieces here that are going through, but we do feel confident in our ability to offset those with funding the growth and productivity. I don\u2019t see the need, unless they move more dramatically, to take large incremental pricing. In addition on our margin as we look, even anticipating these, we expect that our second half gross margin should be up year on year at levels probably more similar to Q2, so overall I think the teams keep a good eye on this. We look at it on a forward basis, we\u2019ve already locked in a significant proportion of Q3 and we\u2019ll look at that obviously in Q4 as we go ahead, so while we\u2019re aware of it, we feel pretty well positioned.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, the one unknown there is probably foreign exchange, and you\u2019ve seen that obviously move a bit against us in the last three weeks, particularly the Latin currencies, so we\u2019ll have to watch that carefully, but we\u2019re on it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Excuse me, Mr. Gajrawala, your line is open. Okay, we\u2019ll go to the next questioner. The next questioner is Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBonnie Herzog: All right, thank you. Good morning everyone.\nNoel Wallace: Hey, good morning Bonnie.\nBonnie Herzog: Good morning Noel. I\u2019m just curious to hear if you\u2019ve seen any noticeable changes in consumer behavior in any of your key markets, especially from the low income consumer; and then if so, what initiatives have you guys been implementing to ultimately offer more value for consumer to drive this faster volume growth that we\u2019re seeing? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks. I think overall, quite constructive around the world, and that\u2019s obviously reflected in the strong volume growth, and likewise the penetration and market share growth; but overall, constructive. I think a lot of the strategy that we\u2019ve put in place over the last couple years, and that\u2019s innovating against some of our big core businesses and making sure that we\u2019re deliberate about the innovation by retail environment, has played out well relative to ensuring that those consumers looking for more value-oriented offerings, that we have that disposable opportunity in our portfolio, and we\u2019ve seen that. I think outside of the U.S, the consumer has been quite constructive. We\u2019ve seen a little bit more price value shopping in North America, but nothing too unusual right now, but we\u2019ll have to watch that carefully as we move through the back half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve seen a little bit more volume on deal coming through North America, but nothing that\u2019s not in line with historical numbers, quite frankly. Overall, U.S., watchful; Europe seems to be okay; Latin America, again you\u2019ve seen the really strong volume growth over the last three or four quarters despite significant pricing, and so we\u2019re seeing a good consumer environment there. Africa, Asia, Eurasia, strong, again good volume growth, and pleasingly starting to see some good volume growth coming back out of Asia and India specifically, which is encouraging.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning.\nNoel Wallace: Morning Chris.\nChris Carey: I just wanted to go back to the North America business, specifically around volume and investment posture, so just two parts to this. I guess first, the negative pricing in the quarter, is there a way to dimensionalize how much of that you think is the year-ago compare versus, say, actions that you\u2019re taking in market a bit more offensively? Then just from a volume perspective, when does this volume number feel sustainable going into the back half? I know you have some compare dynamics in Fabuloso and in hand soap, but at the same time, I think in your prepared remarks you called out double-digit volume growth in toothpaste, which was quite a bit ahead of what we can see in the consumption data, so I\u2019m just wondering if they\u2019re both timing and also durable dynamics that you see in Q2 as we go into the back half. Thanks for those two.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, let me start with, I guess, the volume numbers overall. We feel obviously good strong growth in the quarter, largely toothpaste driven, but we saw it across all categories, which is terrific. We expect that to continue as comparisons in North America will be favorable for us in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, so volumes should continue to track well. Let me get into a little bit of dimensionalizing the pricing. As you said, most of it was the comp, as you recall we had 10% price in Q1, 9% price in Q2 last year, and we talked specifically, as I mentioned earlier, that we may have pulled back a little bit too much on promotions in the second quarter, so the comparison was obviously very, very favorable, and we needed to get the promotion cadence back to where we need to. We had one particular retailer, as I mentioned, that we had pulled out of last year that came back online this year, which was encouraging to help drive some of the strong volume growth, but again I think the promotional cadence that we\u2019ll see will be--or the pricing will be somewhat consistent with where we were in the second quarter as we move through the back half of the year, off a very strong year in 2023. Overall, what\u2019s most encouraging is to see the elasticity there as we put a little bit more pricing in the market relative to coupon and promotion. We\u2019re obviously seeing a great return on that relative to volume. Encouraging likewise, gross profit percent and gross margin dollars were up in North America, which is allowing us to continue to invest strongly behind the business, and we are encouraged by that particularly as we move in the back half of the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to Latin America, given that continues to be a very strong driver of your total company growth - obviously very strong volume, very strong price. But you called out Brazil and Mexico, so can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing, any incremental concerns within the macros there, your sense of how the consumer is behaving in those key markets, as well as some of the other countries given the overall resonating of the growth in Latin America? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, great. Thank you Olivia. We\u2019re encouraged in our two largest businesses, LatAm and Hill\u2019s, both delivering really strong quarters, particularly at the EBIT line - LatAm up 50% on EBIT, Hill\u2019s up 20%, so getting the big businesses growing at that level is encouraging for us. LatAm obviously continues to be such a consistently strong performer for us. Organic sales growth was strong, we saw good volume growth across all of our businesses. Every country was positive in volume with the exception of Argentina. This was led by Brazil, which was high single digits, which is really, really strong, and four quarters of mid-single digit volume growth in LatAm, so overall a pretty good consumer environment. I would say Brazil seems to be quite strong. Mexico slowed a little bit in the quarter, we\u2019ll have to watch that carefully, but the rest of the region performed quite strongly. Oral care, as you mentioned, really strong performance, our market shares were up 90 basis points across the division, volume shares were up likewise across the division, so encouraged by that. The strong marketing and innovation that we put in, in the first half seems to be taking hold, so we think we\u2019re well set up for continued, consistent growth as we move through the back half. I would characterize the consumer environment as pretty good, and the innovation that we have, particularly at the premium side, seems to be taking hold on whitening and some of the core re-launches seem to be driving some good success in terms of household penetration. So overall, we\u2019re encouraged by LatAm and continue to believe it will be a great growth driver for us moving forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hi guys, good morning. Thank you. Noel, I was hoping we could talk about pricing more broadly. It\u2019s been a topic already, but it\u2019s been the number one focus that I\u2019ve heard from investors today, and really not just for Colgate, not just for North America, but for the industry at large, given what we\u2019ve seen and heard from others, where arguably pricing is coming down faster than might have previously been expected, at least in significant pockets. It\u2019s not hurting your performance today - you know, volumes and gross margins are great, strong reinvestment in the middle of the P&L, as you discussed. But I guess the question is, if the direction of travel is lower on pricing, again not just for Colgate but for the competitive set, is that volume and full P&L performance sustainable, and how do you think about that?\nNoel Wallace: Yes, well listen, we know the market\u2019s been focused on getting back to volume growth, but we\u2019ve consistently talked about, and I talked about it certainly at Deutsche Bank in Paris, on the importance of that growth being balanced, that we were going to continue to focus on the strong revenue growth management principles we have in place, the price pack architecture work that we\u2019re doing, and the necessity to continue to get pricing in the P&L. Now, as the inflationary environment becomes more benign, obviously we\u2019ll see some foreign exchange transactional pricing that needs to go into the P&L, but we\u2019re going to continue to be very focused on finding ways to drive some balanced pricing through the P&L, and we think we\u2019ll continue to see that obviously in the back half of the year across most of our divisions. As I mentioned earlier, our revenue growth management capabilities are very, very strong right now, and that\u2019s encouraging for us, to find ways where we\u2019re seeing less inflationary pricing, to find ways to optimize category growth from a dollar standpoint. But we\u2019ve talked about it consistently that we would see particularly this year inflect more towards volume than pricing, but that being said, the 4.2% pricing that we generated in the second quarter continues to be very, very strong in the context of the marketplace. I think that talks to the strength of our brands and our need to continue to offset some of the inflationary pressures that we saw in the business. So overall, we\u2019ll see pricing in the second half come--be a little bit lower than where we were in the second quarter, but given the levels of raw material inflation and the benefit of FTG, we still feel good about where we are from a gross profit standpoint.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, thanks Operator, and good morning everyone.\nNoel Wallace: Morning Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: First, I just wanted to extend a happy birthday to Peter Grom - we all love Pete. Second, just a question, I guess, as we go into looking at the first half and going into the balance of the year, and thinking about just as we fill in our models, kind of the base that we\u2019re using for \u201924 for next year. I guess Noel, you\u2019ve had upside in the first half, and I think last year there was some reinvestment, and I think as you started this year, you also spoke a bit about a bias, right, to balance the driving earnings growth but at the same time taking the opportunity when you have it, right, when things are good and you\u2019ve got upside to reinvest. Can you give us a sense of just maybe the scope of reinvestment that\u2019s occurred in the first half, and then as we\u2019re thinking about the second half, would that be your bias? Have you identified potential areas to spend some money back that you hadn\u2019t planned, and then finally in that, as we\u2019re thinking about that for a base for \u201925, is there anything we should consider with regards to the level of investment in \u201925, whether this would be a good base off \u201924? Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks Bryan. Again, very consistent with what we\u2019ve spoken about in the past, and that is getting the flexibility in the middle of the P&L to give us the opportunities to really direct advertising in areas where we\u2019re going to get the best return on that investment. With the continued growth in gross margin dollars with the strong top line growth, that affords us that flexibility around the world, and at the same time, as I\u2019ve mentioned, we are all over trying to improve the ROI of that spend in terms of getting more bang for the buck and being very deliberate in terms of how we approach the advertising, not increased advertising for the sake of increased advertising. The ROI culture that we\u2019re implementing across the organization is very, very strong. Our intention is to continue to invest where we see a return on investment, and we see real opportunities for continued volume growth opportunities, particularly around household penetration and to build brand awareness, and we\u2019ll continue to invest opportunistically where we see those opportunities. I don\u2019t think there will be anything changing in the back half of this year. Our intention is to continue to invest behind the business and drive that top line consistently to drive the bottom compounding growth that we\u2019ve talked about over the last three or four quarters.\nStan Sutula: Bryan, just to add onto that, if you look, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated a good track record here with our ROIC back over 33%. We\u2019re on a mission for consistent, compounded EPS growth, and we\u2019ll make those investments where we see the ROI, and I think our track record is pretty good here. We\u2019ll look to continue that going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you. First, a quick follow-up, just on North America. Given that you\u2019re returning to historical or normal promotional levels, would it be fair to say that you don\u2019t expect any kind of particular competitive response? Would just love to get color on that. Then my bigger picture question is it seems to us, and I think we see it in your results, that the consumer, at least certain groups of consumers are more willing perhaps than in the past to pay up for innovation and performance, perhaps more than pre-COVID levels. Is that in fact something that is true, that you\u2019re seeing? Why would that be the case, and is it perhaps in combination with better communications on your part in terms of making clear exactly how the performance is better, and maybe what\u2019s driving that better communications? Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, good morning Robert, thank you. Again, I think the overall promotional environment is constructive. As I mentioned, we may have pulled back a little bit too far last year as we pulled promotions out to get some pricing in the categories, and we\u2019ve simply re-balanced that to, more importantly, probably match promotional pricing than certainly to lead it. Our intention is not to lead the category on a promotional cadence that can\u2019t be sustained. Overall, we feel like it\u2019s more or less consistent with where we are. We\u2019ll continue to be very prudent and mindful on where we invest those dollars, and making sure that we see the volume and the gross margin where we need it to be to continue to sustain what we want to focus on, which is strong advertising building the brands and leveraging the strong innovation pipeline that we have. Now if I extend onto innovation, clearly we will continue to operate with a real focus on the premium side of the business, and we\u2019re seeing great results from that across most of our divisions, where some of our premium innovation, particularly in whitening, now with the re-launch of Total going into Latin America, obviously Elmex and Meridol at the premium side with some of their innovations, we\u2019re seeing great inflection on the premium side of the business. If you couple that with the strong core business innovation that we\u2019ve had - Max Fresh in India, a great example of that, we\u2019re seeing great core innovation that\u2019s driving real value oriented points of difference versus our competitors, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll focus on, making sure that consumers are willing to trade up based on the real strong proposition and the big selling idea behind that. We\u2019ve talked about the science and the superiority of our brands, and we\u2019re really trying to incorporate that much more into our messaging, to your point, to get the messaging stronger and the content delivery stronger. Overall, it\u2019s a combination of all of what you discussed, making us be focused on ensuring that we have the innovation pipeline and the pricing in place to continue to sustain that strong top line growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I know you just mentioned Elmex and Meridol on the last question, but I wanted to ask a bit about that three-brand strategy in Europe and get just maybe a bit of an update on how you\u2019re managing channel reach, if you\u2019ve taken those more premium brands beyond the pharmacy channel in Europe, more countries that have been added maybe in the last few years that we\u2019ve kind of lost sight of, and how applicable that strategy in particular may be to other markets, because I think I recall that you were launching one of the premium brands in Latin America a few years ago. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s progressed at all. Thanks.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks Lauren, and you\u2019re absolutely right - we launched Elmex in Brazil, and I\u2019ll come back to that here at the end of my answer. But overall, it\u2019s been a very deliberate strategy for us to really flex our portfolio far more than we have done historically and making sure that we\u2019re capturing what are the unique needs and the consumer journey in the marketplace, and what are the growing parts of the category and particularly the therapeutic side of the category, which is where we were not seeing the level of growth that we needed. Using Elmex and Meridol particularly across Europe to capitalize on that growth has been very successful. You combine that with the strong focus we\u2019ve had on whitening and multi-benefit in Total, as well as the Optic across the world, that gives us a unique combination of offerings to both the retail environments that we compete in as well as the consumer. The retail environment, we\u2019ve been very disciplined about how we take Elmex and Meridol around the world, first and foremost. We\u2019ve been very deliberate and selective on what markets we\u2019re going to put that into, we\u2019re not going to put it in for opportunity\u2019s sake alone. We\u2019re going to be strategic about where we do that, particularly where the pharmacy channel is strong and the therapeutic benefits are growing, and we have a unique offering to go get some of our competitors in that space. We\u2019re going to be very selective on how we continue to take that around the world, but we will take it to new markets around the world where we see that opportunity. The point is, I think, getting the balance between Elmex, Meridol and Colgate right, and Europe has been a great test market for that, where we\u2019re seeing very significant incremental growth across the whole entire franchise by being very focused on where we\u2019re going to take those brands and how we advertise them. So overall, we feel good about that. Professional was the other aspect, and really focusing on the professional heritage of the Elmex and the Meridol brands. We\u2019ve been very deliberate about going back to the profession, educating them on the science and the key point of difference behind the Elmex and the Meridol brands, and that\u2019s certainly led to stronger endorsement levels from the profession, which obviously improve the premium-ness of the brand and the loyalty that we have behind those franchises. Oh, and you had a question in regards to--let me come back on LatAm, Lauren, quickly. Brazil was where we decided to take that brand - again, a very strong pharmacy class of trade, where we were not seeing the incremental growth that we wanted just with the Colgate franchise. We came in with the Elmex brand in LatAm, launched it in pharmacies in Sao Paulo only, and then decided to expand that based on the success that we had around the country, and we\u2019ve seen that drive very significant incremental share in the pharmacy class of trade, so a great combination of portfolio offerings to the pharmacist in terms of being high end therapeutic with the Elmex brand, and making sure that we had the core offerings for the pharmacist as well with the Colgate brand, so it\u2019s been a great combination for us to leverage that portfolio. We\u2019ll use that as a proxy as we think about new markets around the world, but again a very consistent and disciplined go-to-market strategy, only launching in pharmacy, building the brand through the profession, and then finding ways to potentially democratize that brand as we move forward, but we\u2019re going to be very deliberate and very cautious as we do that to ensure that the brand is well established and well seated in the marketplace, based on its credentials.\nOperator: The last question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan : Yes, thanks, and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask a couple of questions, one more of a clarification on the North America commentary and the shift to lower priced channels. We can see in the scanner data these days the shift to Costco and Amazon, as an example, and the growth is eight, nine times what it is in the legacy tracked channels. Are you referring to those as lower priced channels? If not, I guess I\u2019m curious what\u2019s driving the growth. It\u2019s been there for at least a number of quarters now, so what\u2019s driving the share shift into those channels? Then separately, unrelatedly on Prescription Diet and your commentary around the supply chain flexibility increasing shelf space and volume, we started to see some of it in the pet specialty channel, but you still have a sign up there that says you need to have a prescription to buy the product, so I guess I\u2019m curious how that works in terms of to get on shelf, you increase brand awareness and it sort of sells from there, and if you could provide just the mix of the Prescription versus the rest of the business, that\u2019d be helpful too. Thank you.\nNoel Wallace: Yes, thanks Mark. Let me take the retail channel. This has been, I think, nothing new here, quite frankly. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been a huge inflection in terms of shift. You\u2019ve seen the non-tracked Nielsen channels consistently growing faster than the tracked Nielsen channels, and there is a value play there obviously with some of the club offerings. But overall, I think all the channels are looking very, very carefully at their value proposition and the price pack architectures and finding ways to ensure that there\u2019s a value orientation back to the consumer without losing, obviously, the great pricing that\u2019s come through the P&Ls or the categories over the last couple years. I don\u2019t anticipate those shifts will be anything different moving forward. We\u2019ll continue to see, I think, more consistent with where we\u2019ve been in the past, and we\u2019re well prepared to continue to capitalize on those shifts. But the encouraging aspect is growing the Nielsen tracked channels as you\u2019ve seen, as I mentioned earlier, the strong volume share growth that we\u2019ve had in the Nielsen tracked channels. We\u2019re encouraged by that -it suggests that obviously the innovation and the value proposition that we\u2019re offering to our trade customers to grow their categories continues to be quite solid. On Prescription Diet, again a great opportunity for us to continue to grow the Prescription Diet business. We\u2019ve talked about it in the past, where the Prescription Diet opportunity with only--less than 5% of pets are using a therapeutic nutrition today, and while our studies show, as you\u2019ve heard me saying--talk about in the past, that 80% of pets can benefit from the therapeutic nutrition, so we\u2019re very focused on making sure pet specialty, our vet partners, etc. have the plethora of offerings that we bring to the market, and the increased capacity that we have with Tonganoxie coming online and allowing us to optimize our network and provide more of our offerings to the retail environment on a consistent basis is playing out quite nicely for the brand, getting more of those recipes into pet specialty and neighborhood pet stores, as well as making sure we have consistent supply to our veterinary professions, where they recommend and provide that recommendation to their pet owners has been terrific for it, so we will continue to make sure that offering expands and making sure that we continue to look for ways to increase the mix towards Prescription Diet, which is a real benefit for the pet owner.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I will now return the call to Noel Wallace, Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO for any closing remarks.\nNoel Wallace: Well, thank you all for joining us today, and I just want to applaud all the Colgate-Palmolive team around the world for the exceptional efforts to deliver strong top and bottom line growth. Importantly, we\u2019re doing that while we\u2019re building capabilities we need to stay strong moving forward, so that\u2019s terrific work by all the team. But I remind us, as always, that we\u2019re only halfway through the year and we still have a lot of work to be done, so thanks to everyone and appreciate the great discussion this morning.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks John, and thanks for joining us this morning. I look forward to taking your questions in regards to our strong Q2 results. As part of our ambition to deliver consistent compounded earnings growth, we have talked about the importance of driving balanced organic sales growth - all six divisions, all four categories, and with a combination of volume and pricing growth. We have re-vamped our innovation model, leveraged our global strength across price tiers, invested in marketing spend, and scaled new exciting capabilities across the organization, all of which is driving brand health and household penetration. This is particularly important given the pricing we have taken over the past few years. Our return to mid single-digit volume growth this quarter, including growth at both Hill's and Hawley & Hazel highlights some early success from this strategy, and this is well timed. We are returning to strong volume growth as gross margins are expanding, which will drive the incremental gross profit that funds the investment in brands and capabilities while still delivering compelling bottom line growth. We're also using data and analytics tools, including AI, to track the effectiveness of these activities as we look to further optimize the return on our increased spending. This is a topic we'll be discussing more over time. With this combination of increased penetration and the continued success of our revenue growth management strategy, we have the plans in place to drive consistent, balanced top line growth. We combine that with the benefits of operating leverage, productivity and cost discipline to turn that into consistent compounded earnings per share growth. Along with strong cash flow to fund investment, dividends and share repurchases, we believe this leaves us well positioned to drive top tier TSR. Our recent results show the strength and effectiveness as we continue to execute against this strategy, and with that, I'll open it up to questions. Yes, thanks Peter, and first of all, happy birthday! So let's get into the heart of the strategy, which I think we've been pretty consistently communicating over the past few years, and that's really getting the middle of that P&L in a place where we could have a lot more flexibility to invest behind the brands. That investment certainly is helping to drive the strong volume performance, but more importantly household penetration, which ultimately drives category growth and market share. It's keeping that flexibility in the middle of the P&L, allowing us to pinpoint the advertising in areas where we see real growth. The international exposure of our business obviously is giving us opportunities to allocate money in regions and areas where we see great growth opportunities, and that was delivered in the quarter with category growth across all of our categories and all of our divisions. Keeping those investment levels where they are, continuing to find ways to drive the effectiveness of that investment likewise is very important. As I've mentioned before and as you saw down at CAGNY, we're using AI and other tools to really drive improved ROI. We're getting much better at our innovation - that's certainly helping drive that consistent growth around the world, and the execution of the strategy, we think is far better than it has been in previous years. Overall, keeping the flex in the middle of the P&L, strong gross margins, and allocating that in areas around the world where we're seeing real opportunities for growth, we think will drive sustained, consistent compounded growth moving forward. Hey Dara. Thanks Dara. You know, clearly a great quarter for Hill's, a strong performance across the board, quite frankly, and we're particularly pleased with the strong volume in light of the significant pricing we've taken historically. I'll come back and talk about pricing in a moment. But obviously ex-private label, to see the strength of the volume and the pricing move through the P&L is extremely encouraging, particularly given the advertising investment that we've put into the business, which continues to strengthen the brand. I think what's important to call out in the quarter is the real inflection on the margin line, strong gross margin, strong operating margin, and this is a reflection, I think of getting more volume running through the business and obviously seeing the leverage move through the P&L. But if I take a step back again and characterize the marketplace, clearly as we've talked about before, low household awareness and low brand penetration overall of the Hill's business clearly supporting the strong advertising investment, and we're seeing that delivered in the quarter - penetration up, market share's up. We're were one of the fastest growing global brands in some of the pet specialty stores this quarter, so again I think a reflection of the upside potential we still have. When you look at segment opportunities, we've talked about that in the past, obviously wet an area that we're under-indexed in, clearly seeing the ramped up capacity we have in wet delivering better penetration, better growth, better execution in stores as we're getting more wet SKUs on the shelf. That's obviously translating into more upside potential as we consumers obviously shifting into those categories. Overall, we think the balance of the business is where we want it, and we're continuing to invest aggressively to drive that household penetration. You couple that with a really strong innovation pipeline, we see that in the first half of this year and we see that moving into '25 as well, so we think quite frankly the flywheel of the business is working very effectively for us right now. Low penetration, low awareness, we're working on that and getting more effectiveness in our advertising spend, which we're increasing, and importantly getting the gross margins and operating margins back to where we'd like them is allowing for the increased gross margin dollars to invest behind the business. International, likewise - we've talked about the opportunities that we still see globally in the long term to take this brand around the world. We're very focused on the big core markets right now, but long term we see opportunities to expand into new markets. The last I'd say is obviously the mix between Science Diet and Prescription Diet, we saw a good inflection on Prescription Diet this quarter - that's been deliberate, that's been a function of partly due to the capacity expansion that we've had has allowed us to get more diets on the shelf, allowed us to provide more sustained, consistent deliver to the vet professionals on the Prescription Diet business, and we saw a good mix benefit of that in the quarter as well, so overall we're pleased with it. The category is a little soft right now, as you mentioned, as household starts come down, but as we see hopefully the U.S. economy starting to show some vibrancy, or at least for a softer landing, we think that will bode well for us. Pricing is an opportunity, given the strength of the brand. We'll continue to take pricing where we have necessity to do that. The good news is we've seen a little bit of flattening on commodity pricing in the Hill's business, which is excellent for us as we get that pricing we've had historically. We've seen the benefit of a more moderate inflationary environment on input costs, and we get more leverage through the P&L as we see the volume come back. So overall, we feel like we're in a good position to sustain that moving forward. Sure, thank you Filippo. Overall, organic growth in North America was roughly in line with our expectations, albeit more volume, which was really pleasing - I'll come back to that in just a moment, and a little less pricing than expected, although as you rightfully point out and as we said in the prepared commentary, this was due to comparisons with the year ago. If you remember, really strong pricing in the second quarter, high single digits - I think it was around 9%. We talked about it in the call in the second quarter last year, the fact that we perhaps may have pulled back a bit too far on promotions. We saw some of those promotions come back in the quarter this year, particularly in one retail environment where we didn't promote at all in the year-ago period, a little bit of mix change between some of the higher price retailers to lower price retailers also impacting price. But pleasingly on the volume side, which we think is very important for us in North America right now, we saw great improvement, and what was particularly encouraging there is we saw household penetration as a result of that. We've talked a lot about that over the last four quarters, the importance of driving household penetration, and the North America numbers are terrific. Market share is more or less flat in value, but up quite considerably on the volume side - that reflects, I think, a much more targeted approach and a thoughtful approach in how we're utilizing promotional dollars to be very effective and prudent without going too far down the trap of over-promoting. But right now, we feel we're in a very good place with that. We did see some of the retailers lean in. There's been a little bit more lift on promotional coupons, a little bit higher but expected as we move through the quarter, and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year. As I continually say, at least if you look outside of scanner data, our non-Nielsen business continued to track at multiples higher than the Nielsen tracked channels, so again really, really pleased with the overall context of how the quarter we delivered. We're going to watch the pricing carefully, but encouraged to see the volume coming back quite nicely. Yes, good morning Andrea. Much around the latter, obviously. I think we have seen some shift in the retail environments there, but again we're through the negotiations and I think what's particularly pleasing in Europe is the breadth of the innovation across price tiers and the breadth of innovation across various channels. That's allowed us, in our view, the deliver that sustained very strong growth. What's particularly pleasing is obviously the balance between pricing and volume there. We'll see pricing obviously come down as we lap some of the strong pricing we took last year, but the volume coming back into the P&L at such healthy levels was particularly encouraging for the business, and that's reflected in market share and in household penetration, as I said. The market share on toothpaste is at record high levels. I think the balance and effectiveness we have between the Colgate and the Elmex and Meridol brands is really taking stride now in the sense of getting that promotional mix right between the three brands, and we're seeing likewise on the home care and the personal care brands, some of the innovation coming to the market and drive good sustained growth. Overall, a great performance for Europe. We'll watch it in the back half, but right now we think the sustained market share growth that we've had across all of our categories is going to bode well for the back half, and the volume coming back in across multiple price tiers is a good indication that we're in a good place to set us up for a strong back half as well. Yes, let me let Stan get into the details, but strategically, obviously we think with the pricing that we've taken and strong productivity moving through the P&L, particularly with the volume starting to inflect much more positively, we think we're set up well for the back half. We will see some inflationary commodity increases, at least in terms of where commodities are in the back half, but nothing that gives us tremendous concern, particularly given the strong margin profile that we have across the business and where we're seeing the growth. Let me have Stan give you a little bit more color there Yes, the one unknown there is probably foreign exchange, and you've seen that obviously move a bit against us in the last three weeks, particularly the Latin currencies, so we'll have to watch that carefully, but we're on it. Hey, good morning Bonnie. Yes, thanks. I think overall, quite constructive around the world, and that's obviously reflected in the strong volume growth, and likewise the penetration and market share growth; but overall, constructive. I think a lot of the strategy that we've put in place over the last couple years, and that's innovating against some of our big core businesses and making sure that we're deliberate about the innovation by retail environment, has played out well relative to ensuring that those consumers looking for more value-oriented offerings, that we have that disposable opportunity in our portfolio, and we've seen that. I think outside of the U.S, the consumer has been quite constructive. We've seen a little bit more price value shopping in North America, but nothing too unusual right now, but we'll have to watch that carefully as we move through the back half of the year. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen a little bit more volume on deal coming through North America, but nothing that's not in line with historical numbers, quite frankly. Overall, U.S., watchful; Europe seems to be okay; Latin America, again you've seen the really strong volume growth over the last three or four quarters despite significant pricing, and so we're seeing a good consumer environment there. Africa, Asia, Eurasia, strong, again good volume growth, and pleasingly starting to see some good volume growth coming back out of Asia and India specifically, which is encouraging. Morning Chris. Yes, let me start with, I guess, the volume numbers overall. We feel obviously good strong growth in the quarter, largely toothpaste driven, but we saw it across all categories, which is terrific. We expect that to continue as comparisons in North America will be favorable for us in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, so volumes should continue to track well. Let me get into a little bit of dimensionalizing the pricing. As you said, most of it was the comp, as you recall we had 10% price in Q1, 9% price in Q2 last year, and we talked specifically, as I mentioned earlier, that we may have pulled back a little bit too much on promotions in the second quarter, so the comparison was obviously very, very favorable, and we needed to get the promotion cadence back to where we need to. We had one particular retailer, as I mentioned, that we had pulled out of last year that came back online this year, which was encouraging to help drive some of the strong volume growth, but again I think the promotional cadence that we'll see will be--or the pricing will be somewhat consistent with where we were in the second quarter as we move through the back half of the year, off a very strong year in 2023. Overall, what's most encouraging is to see the elasticity there as we put a little bit more pricing in the market relative to coupon and promotion. We're obviously seeing a great return on that relative to volume. Encouraging likewise, gross profit percent and gross margin dollars were up in North America, which is allowing us to continue to invest strongly behind the business, and we are encouraged by that particularly as we move in the back half of the year. Yes, great. Thank you Olivia. We're encouraged in our two largest businesses, LatAm and Hill's, both delivering really strong quarters, particularly at the EBIT line - LatAm up 50% on EBIT, Hill's up 20%, so getting the big businesses growing at that level is encouraging for us. LatAm obviously continues to be such a consistently strong performer for us. Organic sales growth was strong, we saw good volume growth across all of our businesses. Every country was positive in volume with the exception of Argentina. This was led by Brazil, which was high single digits, which is really, really strong, and four quarters of mid-single digit volume growth in LatAm, so overall a pretty good consumer environment. I would say Brazil seems to be quite strong. Mexico slowed a little bit in the quarter, we'll have to watch that carefully, but the rest of the region performed quite strongly. Oral care, as you mentioned, really strong performance, our market shares were up 90 basis points across the division, volume shares were up likewise across the division, so encouraged by that. The strong marketing and innovation that we put in, in the first half seems to be taking hold, so we think we're well set up for continued, consistent growth as we move through the back half. I would characterize the consumer environment as pretty good, and the innovation that we have, particularly at the premium side, seems to be taking hold on whitening and some of the core re-launches seem to be driving some good success in terms of household penetration. So overall, we're encouraged by LatAm and continue to believe it will be a great growth driver for us moving forward. Yes, well listen, we know the market's been focused on getting back to volume growth, but we've consistently talked about, and I talked about it certainly at Deutsche Bank in Paris, on the importance of that growth being balanced, that we were going to continue to focus on the strong revenue growth management principles we have in place, the price pack architecture work that we're doing, and the necessity to continue to get pricing in the P&L. Now, as the inflationary environment becomes more benign, obviously we'll see some foreign exchange transactional pricing that needs to go into the P&L, but we're going to continue to be very focused on finding ways to drive some balanced pricing through the P&L, and we think we'll continue to see that obviously in the back half of the year across most of our divisions. As I mentioned earlier, our revenue growth management capabilities are very, very strong right now, and that's encouraging for us, to find ways where we're seeing less inflationary pricing, to find ways to optimize category growth from a dollar standpoint. But we've talked about it consistently that we would see particularly this year inflect more towards volume than pricing, but that being said, the 4.2% pricing that we generated in the second quarter continues to be very, very strong in the context of the marketplace. I think that talks to the strength of our brands and our need to continue to offset some of the inflationary pressures that we saw in the business. So overall, we'll see pricing in the second half come--be a little bit lower than where we were in the second quarter, but given the levels of raw material inflation and the benefit of FTG, we still feel good about where we are from a gross profit standpoint. Morning Bryan. Yes, thanks Bryan. Again, very consistent with what we've spoken about in the past, and that is getting the flexibility in the middle of the P&L to give us the opportunities to really direct advertising in areas where we're going to get the best return on that investment. With the continued growth in gross margin dollars with the strong top line growth, that affords us that flexibility around the world, and at the same time, as I've mentioned, we are all over trying to improve the ROI of that spend in terms of getting more bang for the buck and being very deliberate in terms of how we approach the advertising, not increased advertising for the sake of increased advertising. The ROI culture that we're implementing across the organization is very, very strong. Our intention is to continue to invest where we see a return on investment, and we see real opportunities for continued volume growth opportunities, particularly around household penetration and to build brand awareness, and we'll continue to invest opportunistically where we see those opportunities. I don't think there will be anything changing in the back half of this year. Our intention is to continue to invest behind the business and drive that top line consistently to drive the bottom compounding growth that we've talked about over the last three or four quarters. Yes, good morning Robert, thank you. Again, I think the overall promotional environment is constructive. As I mentioned, we may have pulled back a little bit too far last year as we pulled promotions out to get some pricing in the categories, and we've simply re-balanced that to, more importantly, probably match promotional pricing than certainly to lead it. Our intention is not to lead the category on a promotional cadence that can't be sustained. Overall, we feel like it's more or less consistent with where we are. We'll continue to be very prudent and mindful on where we invest those dollars, and making sure that we see the volume and the gross margin where we need it to be to continue to sustain what we want to focus on, which is strong advertising building the brands and leveraging the strong innovation pipeline that we have. Now if I extend onto innovation, clearly we will continue to operate with a real focus on the premium side of the business, and we're seeing great results from that across most of our divisions, where some of our premium innovation, particularly in whitening, now with the re-launch of Total going into Latin America, obviously Elmex and Meridol at the premium side with some of their innovations, we're seeing great inflection on the premium side of the business. If you couple that with the strong core business innovation that we've had - Max Fresh in India, a great example of that, we're seeing great core innovation that's driving real value oriented points of difference versus our competitors, and that's what we'll focus on, making sure that consumers are willing to trade up based on the real strong proposition and the big selling idea behind that. We've talked about the science and the superiority of our brands, and we're really trying to incorporate that much more into our messaging, to your point, to get the messaging stronger and the content delivery stronger. Overall, it's a combination of all of what you discussed, making us be focused on ensuring that we have the innovation pipeline and the pricing in place to continue to sustain that strong top line growth. Yes, thanks Lauren, and you're absolutely right - we launched Elmex in Brazil, and I'll come back to that here at the end of my answer. But overall, it's been a very deliberate strategy for us to really flex our portfolio far more than we have done historically and making sure that we're capturing what are the unique needs and the consumer journey in the marketplace, and what are the growing parts of the category and particularly the therapeutic side of the category, which is where we were not seeing the level of growth that we needed. Using Elmex and Meridol particularly across Europe to capitalize on that growth has been very successful. You combine that with the strong focus we've had on whitening and multi-benefit in Total, as well as the Optic across the world, that gives us a unique combination of offerings to both the retail environments that we compete in as well as the consumer. The retail environment, we've been very disciplined about how we take Elmex and Meridol around the world, first and foremost. We've been very deliberate and selective on what markets we're going to put that into, we're not going to put it in for opportunity's sake alone. We're going to be strategic about where we do that, particularly where the pharmacy channel is strong and the therapeutic benefits are growing, and we have a unique offering to go get some of our competitors in that space. We're going to be very selective on how we continue to take that around the world, but we will take it to new markets around the world where we see that opportunity. The point is, I think, getting the balance between Elmex, Meridol and Colgate right, and Europe has been a great test market for that, where we're seeing very significant incremental growth across the whole entire franchise by being very focused on where we're going to take those brands and how we advertise them. So overall, we feel good about that. Professional was the other aspect, and really focusing on the professional heritage of the Elmex and the Meridol brands. We've been very deliberate about going back to the profession, educating them on the science and the key point of difference behind the Elmex and the Meridol brands, and that's certainly led to stronger endorsement levels from the profession, which obviously improve the premium-ness of the brand and the loyalty that we have behind those franchises. Oh, and you had a question in regards to--let me come back on LatAm, Lauren, quickly. Brazil was where we decided to take that brand - again, a very strong pharmacy class of trade, where we were not seeing the incremental growth that we wanted just with the Colgate franchise. We came in with the Elmex brand in LatAm, launched it in pharmacies in Sao Paulo only, and then decided to expand that based on the success that we had around the country, and we've seen that drive very significant incremental share in the pharmacy class of trade, so a great combination of portfolio offerings to the pharmacist in terms of being high end therapeutic with the Elmex brand, and making sure that we had the core offerings for the pharmacist as well with the Colgate brand, so it's been a great combination for us to leverage that portfolio. We'll use that as a proxy as we think about new markets around the world, but again a very consistent and disciplined go-to-market strategy, only launching in pharmacy, building the brand through the profession, and then finding ways to potentially democratize that brand as we move forward, but we're going to be very deliberate and very cautious as we do that to ensure that the brand is well established and well seated in the marketplace, based on its credentials. Yes, thanks Mark. Let me take the retail channel. This has been, I think, nothing new here, quite frankly. I wouldn't say it's been a huge inflection in terms of shift. You've seen the non-tracked Nielsen channels consistently growing faster than the tracked Nielsen channels, and there is a value play there obviously with some of the club offerings. But overall, I think all the channels are looking very, very carefully at their value proposition and the price pack architectures and finding ways to ensure that there's a value orientation back to the consumer without losing, obviously, the great pricing that's come through the P&Ls or the categories over the last couple years. I don't anticipate those shifts will be anything different moving forward. We'll continue to see, I think, more consistent with where we've been in the past, and we're well prepared to continue to capitalize on those shifts. But the encouraging aspect is growing the Nielsen tracked channels as you've seen, as I mentioned earlier, the strong volume share growth that we've had in the Nielsen tracked channels. We're encouraged by that -it suggests that obviously the innovation and the value proposition that we're offering to our trade customers to grow their categories continues to be quite solid. On Prescription Diet, again a great opportunity for us to continue to grow the Prescription Diet business. We've talked about it in the past, where the Prescription Diet opportunity with only--less than 5% of pets are using a therapeutic nutrition today, and while our studies show, as you've heard me saying--talk about in the past, that 80% of pets can benefit from the therapeutic nutrition, so we're very focused on making sure pet specialty, our vet partners, etc. have the plethora of offerings that we bring to the market, and the increased capacity that we have with Tonganoxie coming online and allowing us to optimize our network and provide more of our offerings to the retail environment on a consistent basis is playing out quite nicely for the brand, getting more of those recipes into pet specialty and neighborhood pet stores, as well as making sure we have consistent supply to our veterinary professions, where they recommend and provide that recommendation to their pet owners has been terrific for it, so we will continue to make sure that offering expands and making sure that we continue to look for ways to increase the mix towards Prescription Diet, which is a real benefit for the pet owner. Well, thank you all for joining us today, and I just want to applaud all the Colgate-Palmolive team around the world for the exceptional efforts to deliver strong top and bottom line growth. Importantly, we're doing that while we're building capabilities we need to stay strong moving forward, so that's terrific work by all the team. But I remind us, as always, that we're only halfway through the year and we still have a lot of work to be done, so thanks to everyone and appreciate the great discussion this morning."

            "content": "Happy birthday! Thanks Noel. What we saw in the first quarter, we talked about coming out was that we had general easing on commodities, but as we're looking into the back half of the year, we do see some raw material inflation in commodity costs, as well as an impact from transactional FX. As we think about the components of that, there are some pieces here that are going through, but we do feel confident in our ability to offset those with funding the growth and productivity. I don't see the need, unless they move more dramatically, to take large incremental pricing. In addition on our margin as we look, even anticipating these, we expect that our second half gross margin should be up year on year at levels probably more similar to Q2, so overall I think the teams keep a good eye on this. We look at it on a forward basis, we've already locked in a significant proportion of Q3 and we'll look at that obviously in Q4 as we go ahead, so while we're aware of it, we feel pretty well positioned. Bryan, just to add onto that, if you look, I think we've demonstrated a good track record here with our ROIC back over 33%. We're on a mission for consistent, compounded EPS growth, and we'll make those investments where we see the ROI, and I think our track record is pretty good here. We'll look to continue that going forward."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. \n Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn this call over to Chief Investor Relations Officer and Executive Vice President, M&A, John Faucher. \nJohn Faucher: Thanks, Betty. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. This is John Faucher. Today's conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please refer to the first quarter 2024 earnings press release and related prepared materials and our most recent filings with the SEC, including our first quarter 2024 quarterly report on Form 10-Q and subsequent SEC filings, all available on Colgate's website, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. \n This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, including those identified in tables 3, 5 and 6 of the earnings press release. A full reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures is included in the first quarter 2024 earnings press release and is available on Colgate's website. \n Joining me on the call this morning are Noel Wallace, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stan Sutula, Chief Financial Officer. Noel will provide you with some thoughts on our Q1 results and our 2024 outlook, and we will then open it up for Q&A. Noel? \nNoel Wallace: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our strong start to 2024. I would like to make 2 points today on why we think we are well positioned to continue to drive shareholder value through delivering consistent, compounded earnings per share growth. \n The first is the importance of balanced top line growth. You've heard me speak over the past several years of our focus on delivering balanced organic sales growth, growth in all of our categories, growth in all of our divisions and growth in both volume and pricing. That's what we did this quarter. We delivered organic sales growth in all 4 of our categories, all 6 of our divisions and volume and pricing growth on a total company basis. The balance allowed us to deliver on a base business, 6% net sales growth on top of 6.5% net sales growth in Q1 2023 despite a nearly 4% headwind from foreign exchange. \n The focus on balance between pricing and volume growth allowed us to deliver solid volume growth this quarter, even with the continued volume softness in China and the expected headwind from lower private label growth as we transferred more Hill's volume into our Pet Nutrition manufacturing network. Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care each grew volume in the quarter with volume growth of 3% for all 3 categories combined. \n Our revamped strategy and increased advertising spending have allowed us to drive growth across a greater percentage of our portfolio and our focus on core innovation is keeping our biggest brands relevant and vibrant in consumers' minds. We still have work to do, but our balanced strategy continues to yield results, including continued growth in our Global Oral Care shares, which leads me to my second point, which is flexibility in the P&L. Our focus on revenue growth management and driving our Funding-the-Growth initiatives enable us to achieve a 60% gross margin in the quarter despite significant headwinds from transactional foreign exchange. \n Our commitment to productivity in the middle of the P&L allowed us to drive 30 basis points of overhead leverage while still continuing to invest in strategic capabilities like digital, data and analytics, all topics we discussed at CAGNY, and prudent balance sheet management allow us to deliver 18% base business earnings growth despite the year-over-year increase in interest expense and the impact from devaluations around the globe. \n And most importantly, despite an expected mid-single-digit negative impact from foreign exchange, we're guiding to mid- to high single-digit base business earnings per share growth. And we're doing this in the context of meaningful increases in brand investment that will set the stage for growth in the future. This is a testament to the ability of our team to consistently execute our strategy and seize growth opportunities while also preparing to better withstand the inevitable headwinds of running a global business. \n So with that, I'll take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: So really exceptional business performance this quarter, more or less on all fronts. But I wanted to drill down into your organic growth guidance raise for the year. It seems about half of that, that 2-point increase is being driven by inflationary pricing as an offset to FX and fair enough on that. But there also seems to be at least a point beyond that attributable to upside that you're seeing in real terms across the portfolio. \n So I'm curious if you could expand on where that upside is coming from versus your prior expectations. And if you'd say more of that is being driven by category growth or it's more being driven by your own market share momentum? \nNoel Wallace: Great. Thanks, Steve. I'd come back to the points I made in my upfront comments around balanced organic sales growth. I mean we're getting really good quality coming through on the volume line. You saw the 1.3. That was with the headwind of private label that we're obviously exiting on the Hill's business. and strong pricing across the board, mid-single-digit pricing ex the impact of Argentina. And as you point out, we're seeing nice share growth consistently around the world that's driving obviously that top line organic growth and the top line sales growth. But we're most pleased with, I think, is the balance we're getting both on volume and price. We're able to still get pricing, not just inflationary pricing, but we still have pricing going through the categories, particularly in some of the markets where we've had more inflationary impact from raw materials. \n Hill's would be a good example of that. We took some more pricing in the first quarter. The pricing has obviously led to good value accretion in the category and allowed us to drive some value shares. The other important point is we've seen really good momentum in our volume shares. The U.S. had good growth on volume share in toothpaste. We've seen consistent volume share growth, both in Europe and in Latin America across our portfolio. \n So it's really broad-based across the strategy that we're trying to execute, balanced volume, balance price, good initiatives through the innovation that we're putting into the market. And then importantly, is the continued robust investment. We're seeing that really pay out in terms of driving not only category growth in the markets where we're spending, but most importantly, allowing us to grow share in the categories where we're spending money. \n So overall, it's, I think, a reflection of the strategy and a reflection of the balance that we have across both price and volume. \nOperator: The next question comes from Melanie Schultz with Evercore ISI. \nRobert Ottenstein: Robert Ottenstein here. Noel, let's kind of maybe do a deep dive on Oral Care. Can you talk a little bit about the market share trends by region? And more -- a little bit more specifically, are you gaining share more from other international players that may have more similar type of products or local players that are maybe more idiosyncratic? And what are the key drivers to the share growth. Is it more the fact that you're increasing share of voice? Or are there particular product areas like whitening that are really engaging consumers now more than they did in the past. \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Rob. It's a little bit of all of what you've just said. So overall, really pleased with the growth and the acceleration of market shares globally. You saw that -- in the prepared remarks. You saw that in some of the slides that we provided, particularly on the Whitening segment. And it's really a function of the strategy that we've been executing for the last couple of years and really starting to see the fruits of all that effort.  \n So the growth is coming, obviously, from a good growth in Europe, which we talked about, we're at record shares in Europe, that's a balance between Colgate and our therapeutic brands of elmex and meridol, so good spending behind those businesses. And we're seeing, obviously, that translate into good share growth, particularly in some of the big markets across Europe.  \n Likewise, we're seeing the benefits of that deployed across Africa, where we've launched some of those high-end therapeutic brands as well. North America, the scanner data has been improving as you've seen. But the shares will continue to be a bit choppy there as we move forward, given some of the strategic changes we've taken with some of the drug class that trade on the promotional environment. Latin America had growth in both value and volume. That was driven both from, I think, the mix and diversity of our portfolio across Latin America, both at the high end and at the entry price point, given the breadth of portfolio offerings that we have there, and obviously, the increased spending that we're putting behind some of the good innovation.  \n So it's really broad-based, good spending, good innovation, across the board and importantly, a credit to the teams and their execution on the ground. And so we see that obviously continuing as we continue to hold investment through the balance of the year, and that share growth is coming from both the multinational competitors as well as local competitors. So broad-based across the board. We're pleased with where we are. We have more work to do, particularly in North America, but overall, a good performance. \nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. \nPeter Grom: I had a question on the gross margin performance. And just kind of how to think about the path from here. We've kind of seen the sequential margin progression over the last 6 quarters or so. But in the prepared remarks, you touched on certain costs will increase as you move through the year. So just any thoughts on how we should think about the gross margin progression from here would be helpful. And then just within that cost savings, any commentary you can share in terms of how we should be thinking about funding the growth is in the context of a very solid start to the year. \nNoel Wallace: Great. Let me talk about more conceptually strategically, and I'll let Stan handle some of the more specifics on your question. So overall, as we think about the year unfolding, as we've talked about, I think, quite consistently, we'll see pricing start to ladder down as we move through the balance of the year, although we will get inflationary pricing, we still have some pricing that we're taking in some markets. \n And I would say we're deeply pleased with the revenue growth management efforts that we have around the world and the -- what that's delivering for us in terms of pricing in the market and driving category value.  \n You've seen, obviously, the impact on raw materials in the first quarter. We'll start to see that elevate a bit more in the back half. And obviously, the significant impact from transactional due to the foreign exchange headwinds that we face. That being said, we feel very good about the guidance that we provided, strategically about growing gross margins in 2024. We'll get that through, obviously, the funding the growth efforts that we have, good mix in terms of how we're deploying some of our therapeutic brands around the world. Taking pricing where we need to take to offset particularly inflationary foreign exchange and obviously, a very focused on the middle of the P&L, making sure we continue to get leverage there.  \n So overall, strategically, we feel good, but we'll see pricing ladder down. It won't have as much impact in the year to go as it just had in the first half, but overall, we feel good about where we are. Stan? \nStanley Sutula: Yes. So I'd pick up that -- look, we're very pleased with the margin performance in Q1, up 310 basis points year-to-year and improved sequentially. We had a slight benefit from Argentina, but the overall underlying margin improvement was quite good. We've guided for margin expansion for the year, and we're confident we can deliver. There's a couple of headwinds in here and tailwinds. We talked about the modest raw material inflation, as you've heard from others as well. We expect that will slightly escalate as we go through the year.  \n And then we've all watched FX. FX, the transactional impact has been bouncing around, but that will be a headwind as we go into the year as well. On the tailwinds, Noel mentioned earlier, we've got great revenue growth management programs in place globally, and we're seeing the benefit from all of those. And we have a proven track record on our funding the growth. We had a very good start to funding the growth. We've got a very good pipeline for funding the growth and the teams, I think, have that dialed in here as we go forward.  \n And then importantly, we've talked about the return to volume growth. And in that, we get some scale benefits and leverage as that volume flows through our manufacturing facilities. So overall, we expect to expand margin. You'll see that on a year-on-year basis. I think as you think sequentially, that will be more modest, but we expand margin for the year, and the efforts around RGM and FTG will be able to compensate for the headwinds that we see in FX transactional and raw materials. \nOperator: The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. \nFilippo Falorni: So Noel, you mentioned in the prepared remarks for the Hill's pet food business that you're expecting sequential volume improvement throughout the year. Maybe can you give us some color on the puts and takes with the less impact from private label volumes in top line? And also, just any sense of the contribution from innovation expansion into wet pet food and any color on the trajectory of the business, would be helpful. \nNoel Wallace: So as we said in the prepared remarks, really pleased with the performance at Hill's in the quarter in what's a pretty tough operating environment. Volume was closer to flat ex the impact of private label and that was sequentially up, which is good. And we had very good pricing, as we discussed, coming out of the year in 2023 and our need to continue to offset some of the agricultural inflation that we saw in the back half of '23 moving into '24.  \n Category volume overall has been a bit sluggish in the category, but I think what's most important is to see that the sluggishness has been more of a decline in treats and a little bit of conversion from wet to dry, and that's obviously important for us to think about as we strategically move some of the bigger part of our businesses, which are in the dry segment going forward.  \n Really importantly, though, is the fact that we generated really strong share growth in the first quarter of the year behind the Hill's business. We're cross up in pet specialty, up in neighborhood pet, penetration continues to grow. We had both share growth in our Science Diet business as well as Prescription Diet. And I think this is a reflection of the continued strategy that we're deploying, great innovation, great partnership with pet specialty in terms of driving their categories and making sure that we have ample advertising to talk about the science-driven nutrition that we provide to the market.  \n So overall, we feel very good about where the Hill's business is, that business grew high single digits ex the impact of private label. So we feel we're well positioned, but we're not immune to some of the sluggishness in the category. But again, as we've talked about in the past, we have low brand awareness and low brand penetration. So a lot of upside to continue to go after as we execute our strategy. \nStanley Sutula: The only thing I'd add there is that the investment in capacity has also enabled us to bring in some product that was being co-manufactured before, which improves reliability and delivery and also will improve our margins over time. \nNoel Wallace: And to your point on, Filippo, on wet, obviously, there's some opportunities for us as we're very low indexed in wet. And particularly in segments like cat, where there's a lot of wet food consumed, we have an opportunity to leverage the new manufacturing that we have and get more formulas into the market and obviously, more growth for the business. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. \nAndrea Teixeira: Noel, we spoke to the underlying volume growth in all regions and your revenue growth management definitely sets you apart, but can you comment on how you see the consumer behavior, in particular in the low-end consumer in the U.S. and China, which seems to be a concern to some of your peers. \n And you have historically protect your price points and keeping consumers in the category, but I would love to see the examples that you may highlight by your team in the U.S. and in China and how they've been using this portfolio management to barbell between affordability and premiumization. \nNoel Wallace: Yes. I think as we've talked about, thanks for the question, the consumer has been quite constructive. I mean, we've seen obviously the significant inflation move through the category over the last year. We expected that we would see a return to volume growth as inflation became more benign and as pricing started to stabilize in the categories, and that's principally what's happened. Interesting to note that as you take the aggregate of our categories, by and large, the categories are still negative. So the volume growth that we had and delivered in the quarter, which suggests obviously, that we're growing good volume share. And I think that's a reflection of the broad-based strategy that we're deploying.  \n One, we have good innovation at the top end of the category, particularly on the therapeutic side, whether that's in whitening, in the premium side, whether that's the Total Plaque that we've launched, whether that's therapeutic with meridol and elmex as well as a lot of big core innovation. We talked about the fact that a lot of our big core portfolio, particularly in toothpaste, is at that entry or mid-price level. And so we've spent a lot of time innovating at the core to ensure that we keep those brands vibrant and we offer consumers real value and real benefits as they come into the category or they're trading down from mid-price to perhaps entry.  \n You've seen some of the sluggishness in China, to your point, come from the rural segment. Clearly, that consumer is a bit more challenged in China right now. The premium segment continues to be quite robust. But our Darlie franchise is well positioned longer term, we think, to continue to leverage some of the rural softness that we're seeing in the category and make sure that we drive share. \n The Colgate business had a terrific quarter in China. And that's, I think, a reflection of the move to the premium side of the business as we've really gone a lot more on to e-commerce with premium offerings, but overall, we're seeing, I think, a balanced consumer. The key is making sure that we're providing the reasons to use our products and the advertising that we're executing across the market is very, very important to, one, justify the price increases that came through the category last year, but really to drive trade-up in the categories to ensure consumers see the real value and science-driven benefits of our products in our portfolio. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. \nBonnie Herzog: I had a question on your ad spend, which is one of the highest as a percentage of sales among your peers. Noel, you touched on this, but hoping you could talk a little further about your strategy to continue to increase spend. And then ultimately, what you believe is the right level of marketing spend moving forward as well as maybe opportunities to improve ROI. \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Bonnie. I'll start with the end of your question, which is we're seeing terrific ROI in the business. And I think that's translated into the results in the quarter. Obviously, good volume growth, helping to -- certainly above the category, share growth pretty consistently around the world in both value and volume. We're seeing our premium innovations take share, and we're obviously spending a disproportionate amount of our advertising to drive premiumization and category value.  \n You heard Diana talk at CAGNY about I think a lot of the discipline that we're putting into our media spend on using data and analytics to really justify the spend everywhere we are, drive more personalization and return on that investment. So again, we're very pleased with the increase in advertising and ultimately what it's delivering.  \n As I mentioned in my upfront, what's also terrific for the business right now is the broad-based spending we have on the portfolio. And what I mean by that is we've moved from exclusively Oral Care and Pet, which was getting a significant amount of spend over the last couple of years to making sure that some of our strong brands around the world are getting their fair share of the advertising, and we've seen a great return on that investment.  \n Europe would be a great example of that. We're spending behind our Personal Care business in Europe. Sanex is just an extraordinarily strong brand there, the spending behind some of our innovations driving good share growth and good execution in store. So overall, that's having a pretty systematic impact on the business, and we're pleased with the results that we're getting.  \n Moving forward, as I've said, consistently, I think, over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we will continue to invest in this business for the long term and building brand saliency and keeping our brands vibrant is the best way to driving that consistency. \nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. \nOlivia Tong Cheang: I wanted to ask you a little bit about your organic sales guide for the rest of the year. Obviously, contextually understand why you wouldn't flow the 10 points continuing. But why would organic sales decelerate as the comp fees? Presumably, you're getting more pricing? Clearly, we understand that this is a very dynamic environment, but would love to get a little bit more color in terms of your expectations for the rest of the year because it sounds like you're very bullish on innovation, on pricing capabilities, and volume acceleration, et cetera. I would appreciate a little bit more color there. \nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So clearly, some of the comps get more difficult as we go through the year to go. We took obviously a lot of pricing. We'll see that pricing become more benign or slow in the back half of the year that will -- to be determined how much of that comes back into volume. The good news is the first quarter and some of the success that we saw in the fourth quarter, give us confidence that the volume is returning as we expected. The elasticities are in line with as we expected. \n So we feel pretty good about where we are. Again, I think the biggest differentiator here in terms of how we think about is we're only in the first quarter. There's a lot of economic uncertainty out there in terms of what's happening. We still see foreign exchange being a headwind. That will certainly have an impact as we have to take pricing in some markets. Interest is going to stay stubbornly high. We expect through the balance of the year. \n So overall, we're still early in the year, very confident in the guidance we've provided and the strategy that we're executing, but we want to make sure we maintain operational flexibility through the balance of the year to ensure we continue to execute the strategy that we've been communicating to drive consistent compounded earnings share growth. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. \nChristopher Carey: One quick follow-up on gross margin and then a question on North America. So on gross margin, I think there was an expectation that Q1 would be down quarter-over-quarter relative to Q4, clearly, very strong delivery in the quarter. Stan, you mentioned a bit of benefit from Argentina. Or are you seeing better developments elsewhere, whether that's in commodities, perhaps some of the new pricing on Hill's or maybe you're over-delivering on productivity. So just maybe contextualize what seems to have come in a bit better there? \n And just on North America, it was the best volume growth in nearly 2 years. I realize Fabuloso was a benefit there. But Noel, you also mentioned needing to work on market shares. Can you maybe just help us understand the underlying momentum of the business right now and how to think about this going forward? \nNoel Wallace: Sure. Thanks for the question. Let me take the North America and then I'll let Stan jump into some of your questions around gross profit. Overall, the strategy in North America that we're executing, we feel good about it. We've been very focused, as we've talked about before on improving the middle of the P&L, getting gross margins back to where they needed to get to, getting operating margins where they need to get back to and reinvesting that into the business in order to drive market shares. \n The value shares, as I mentioned, we have been a little bit choppy and will continue to be a little bit choppy for the reasons I stated earlier. However, we are seeing better execution of our innovation and our promotional strategies, and that's helping to drive nice volume share in the quarter, both across toothpaste, which was up nicely and toothbrushes from a volume standpoint. \n So again, we feel good about that, and we still have a lot of work to do across the business, as we've talked about on prior calls, and I've got great confidence in Jesper and his team and the strategy that we're deploying with real patience because we know it's going to take some time, but we feel in the long term, we're going to end up in a much better place from that. \n The other thing I'd say is that non-Nielsen business in the North America business continues to grow at multiples of the Nielsen business. And obviously, that's not captured in the market share. So we feel good about overall health in the business, but we'll consistently continue to drive the opportunities that we see in the Nielsen-based accounts. \nStanley Sutula: And Chris, your question on the sequential margin improvement, first of all, I'm pleased with that sequential margin improvement. Argentina was a little bit less of a headwind. And as you watch that FX, it's been very volatile. We've taken actions to address it, including sourcing changes, pricing changes et cetera. And then the team candidly executed really well. \n I mean we get a little bit of scale benefit from volume we get some improvement from RGM and the funding the growth was great execution starting the year. So we love the start to the year, and we know FX is going to continue to be volatile, not just in Argentina but in many areas around the world. So a solid start to the year, slightly better than we anticipated on a sequential basis, but pleased with the progress. \nOperator: The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. \nLauren Lieberman: I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about Europe. Numbers were super strong. A little bit of context around where you're seeing particular areas of strength and volume would be great. And then just any recent thoughts on private label Unilever brought up yesterday seeing a little more incremental pressure from private label in Europe. So I was just curious to hear your perspective on that as well. \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Lauren. A great quarter for Europe. And again, a terrific execution from the team on the ground. Overall, really, really strong with growth across the vast majority of our business, and it wasn't just Oral Care, it was pretty broad-based. And obviously, as you saw, volumes inflected positively given that we're still getting pricing in the category. \n So pricing will ramp down as we move through the balance of the year. The big change, I think, is our investment strategy in Europe. We see real opportunities for growth, particularly in the Oral Care and Personal Care segment, as we execute some of the innovations that we have there, the meridol and elmex shares broad-based across Europe are at record levels and growing really, really nicely. \n Again, that is a shift in strategy and what's nice is we're getting the complementary growth on the Colgate side of the business, particularly as we're more focused on the whitening opportunity that we have. So a great portfolio of brands that we're leveraging, we think, more strategically around the region. So the market shares overall look pretty good. \n In terms of private label, as you know, private label has higher penetration in Europe than it does anywhere else in the world. We have seen some acceleration in some of the home care categories, whether it's dish liquid or fabric softeners or floor cleaners, but that being said, we continue to have good growth across our business, particularly as we -- as I mentioned earlier, broadened the investment strategy across a wider array of our brands in Europe. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: Stan, just had a couple of questions just related to cash flow. One, I don't know -- maybe I missed it, but if we have a guide for capital spending for the year? And then I think you refinanced or you funded a maturity in the middle of the quarter with commercial paper, just kind of curious there, did you just looking to pay it down? Or will you look to refinance that or term it out at some point? \n And then maybe just more broadly, as you're thinking about cash flow given where exchange rates have moved, interest rates have moved, just any other thoughts on how we should be thinking about like free cash flow conversion this year and uses of free cash flow. \nStanley Sutula: Yes. Bryan, thanks for the question. So first, we're pleased with the cash flow performance, a really solid start for the quarter. We're down a little bit year-over-year, but I remind you, last year was a terrific cash quarter, and this was really driven by receivables, which were impacted by the timing of Easter. In fact, we've looked at the first couple of days of the quarter and that collection period completely brought DSO back in line. So we're very comfortable with that. \n So our cash profits really have been helped from the top line growth. And the net working capital execution, I was very pleased with what the team accomplished here in first quarter, particularly around inventory. So even with the Red Sea challenges and building up a little safety stock in certain areas, great execution on inventory. We saw the inventory days improve, DSO strictly timing. \n In regards to your question on CapEx, we had said previously that we expect CapEx as a percent of sales to be lower than last year. And it's really driven by [ Tide ] and Oxy, kind of coming online and that investment dollar is dropping off. If we look at our leverage, the strong cash flow and execution has allowed us to bring our leverage using the S&P methodology down to 1.8x, so an improvement from year-end. \n And to your point, we did pay back a bond here in first quarter of $500 million, and we did that with CP and 2 reasons. One, we had very good strong cash flow; and two, at some point, we expect interest rates will come down, though that appears to be sliding further out to the right, and that will help us keep our fixed floating back in balance. \n So again, as we look at cash flow, strong performance and as we think about that, it kind of goes back into the capital allocation, and I think you've seen that manifest ourselves in our strategy, that capital allocation hasn't changed, invest in the business, and you're going to see CapEx go up and down, we're investing in advertising. Return to shareholders, we had a dividend increase, and you saw our share buyback in the quarter and then M&A, where we look at options to improve our overall portfolio. \nNoel Wallace: Yes, Bryan, the only thing I would add is, again, picking up on the theme of flexibility, it's not only flexibility throughout the P&L, but it's having a really strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to deploy capital as we see the best return on that investment. And I give Stan and the finance organization huge credit and the discipline that they're bringing around the world to ensure that the cash generation continues to be robust. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. \nMark Astrachan: I wanted to go back to North America and the outperformance of these untracked channels. We can now start to see in some of the data, the distinction between the new and the legacy channels, and it's pretty stark in your business, in particular, Hill's specifically, but overall, there's just a lot more growth in those channels, I guess that they're smaller. \n But curious on your take on what is driving that, that exceptional outperformance. And how sustainable is it in terms of these other places like Costco, Amazon, et cetera, that's contributing to that growth overall, and I'm specifically looking to at Hill's, which is really doing quite well in those new channels. \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks. So again, we've been talking about that for quite some time, and that has been, I think, a reflection of the strategy that we've talked about for 3 years, which is core adjacencies and channels and getting back to real focus and understanding the consumer journey across all of the markets in which we compete has been fundamental to making sure that we have strategies to capture and deploy our investments in areas where we think we're going to get the best return for that. \n And some of these emerging channels that are not captured by Nielsen are very, very important, whether that's hard discount stores in parts of the world. Whether that's the club store environment, where the value pack in large sizes continue to be a big growth driver, whether that's the ease and convenience of shopping online and some of the digital execution and understanding the digital shelf and the discipline that we brought to that, that ultimately is being seen through the success that we're having in those alternative channels. \n We don't anticipate that, that will change. I think as some of the classical brick-and-mortar retailers really up their game, and we're certainly seeing that across the U.S. markets where the big players are certainly becoming far more sophisticated and progressive with their offerings and their shopper experience. We're partnering with them to ensure that we're -- our brands are involved in that journey that they're on, and making sure that we're bringing our digital capabilities to the entire omnichannel environment and making sure that Colgate and the brands that we offer at the forefront of that. \n So it's, again, shopper journey the experience that the shoppers are getting, the value orientation on some of those channels and our ability to be much more targeted with some of our spend, and that's particularly related to the online retailers. \nOperator: Next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. \nBrett Cooper: A question for you on the competitive environment and outlook. It would appear to date that promotional activity and competition hasn't ramped to the extent that some of your peers and some of your large peers are looking to accelerate growth via reinvestments. So would love to hear first whether that assessment on the environment is accurate generally. And then your perspective on whether there's enough opportunity to elevate category growth via things like household penetration growth, premiumization and share gain to net higher levels of growth? Or is all of this reinvestment just the new cost of doing business? \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Brett. What's interesting is you're seeing -- I think you're hearing that a lot of the competitive set has focused on building healthy category growth, and that's two ways: one, with increased media investment and the second is with increased innovation. We have not seen a fundamental shift around the world to more volume sold on promotion. It's still below where we were pre-COVID. Now as volume becomes the important aspect here, you may see some players move to that strategy of doing more promotions. But overall, the category has been very constructive in terms of big players spending money on media, driving value to the categories through innovation, and offerings that are differentiated in the marketplace. And so it's incumbent upon us to ensure that our innovations continue to drive real value to the category and the differentiation in a very competitive market and making sure that we're using the analytics and the data that we have to drive balanced promotional strategies in the categories. \n We'll be competitive where we need to be. I mentioned we've made some difficult decisions in the U.S. business to not chase a lot of deep down in promotions, particularly in certain retail environments that will have a short-term impact on the Nielsen shares, but long term, we feel we're going to deploy that money in an effective way. And again, it's making sure that we continue to drive saliency of our brands and the health of our brands long term, and we do that through media and innovation, not necessarily through promotions. \nOperator: The next question comes from Alejandro Zamacona with HSBC. \nAlejandro Zamacona Urquiza: Just a kind of follow-up on Latin America. So given the strong organic sales growth in the last few quarters, what should we expect going forward? I mean, to what extent the consumer is willing to continue to accept meaningful price increases without giving up volumes. \nNoel Wallace: Yes. Again, let me contextualize Latin America. Obviously, a really strong organic sales growth quarter, with and without Argentina, there was good volume growth across every single hub led by Brazil, which was up double digits. If I take the last 4 quarters of Latin America in terms of volume, 0.5, 5.4, 8, and 6.2. So again, very consistent with what we talked about. \n Our ability to get pricing early in the market has allowed us now to see the volume return to the categories and ultimately into our business. Our marketing is really strong and innovation is very strong on the ground, and so we feel very good about where we're seeing. And that's been translated into really positive share growth for the business. \n So ex Argentina, very good organic growth. Organic up significantly in the region. I think you saw double-digit growth in Brazil, which has been terrific. Oral Care, particularly has been really strong in the quarter. That was up double digits, excluding Argentina. Shares in value and volume up. It's been quite some time since we saw both of those move in the right direction, and again, a reflection, I believe, of the strategy of increased investment and making sure that we have a breadth of offerings in that market. \n That is a market that's accustomed to inflationary pricing across many of the markets in which we compete. Being key for us is making sure that we continue to advertise strongly in the markets, and we bring real innovation across the entire portfolio that keeps the categories vibrant, allows us to work with our retailers to drive category growth and hopefully capture share at the same time. \n So overall, we think Latin America is well positioned for continued growth, and we like what we're seeing there. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Noel Wallace, Colgate's Chairman, President and CEO, for closing remarks. \nNoel Wallace: Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Obviously, we're really pleased with the quarter and how we've gotten off to a strong start that we believe sets us up for continued sustainable growth moving forward and generating that long-term algorithm that we've been talking about for quite some time for our shareholders. \n Let me particularly reach out to all of the Colgate employees around the world for their incredible dedication and resilience and their hard work in really executing a strategy around the world and for getting us off to a great start. So thanks, everyone. We'll see you and talk to you soon. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stanley Sutula",
            "content": "Yes. So I'd pick up that -- look, we're very pleased with the margin performance in Q1, up 310 basis points year-to-year and improved sequentially. We had a slight benefit from Argentina, but the overall underlying margin improvement was quite good. We've guided for margin expansion for the year, and we're confident we can deliver. There's a couple of headwinds in here and tailwinds. We talked about the modest raw material inflation, as you've heard from others as well. We expect that will slightly escalate as we go through the year.  \n And then we've all watched FX. FX, the transactional impact has been bouncing around, but that will be a headwind as we go into the year as well. On the tailwinds, Noel mentioned earlier, we've got great revenue growth management programs in place globally, and we're seeing the benefit from all of those. And we have a proven track record on our funding the growth. We had a very good start to funding the growth. We've got a very good pipeline for funding the growth and the teams, I think, have that dialed in here as we go forward.  \n And then importantly, we've talked about the return to volume growth. And in that, we get some scale benefits and leverage as that volume flows through our manufacturing facilities. So overall, we expect to expand margin. You'll see that on a year-on-year basis. I think as you think sequentially, that will be more modest, but we expand margin for the year, and the efforts around RGM and FTG will be able to compensate for the headwinds that we see in FX transactional and raw materials. The only thing I'd add there is that the investment in capacity has also enabled us to bring in some product that was being co-manufactured before, which improves reliability and delivery and also will improve our margins over time. And Chris, your question on the sequential margin improvement, first of all, I'm pleased with that sequential margin improvement. Argentina was a little bit less of a headwind. And as you watch that FX, it's been very volatile. We've taken actions to address it, including sourcing changes, pricing changes et cetera. And then the team candidly executed really well. \n I mean we get a little bit of scale benefit from volume we get some improvement from RGM and the funding the growth was great execution starting the year. So we love the start to the year, and we know FX is going to continue to be volatile, not just in Argentina but in many areas around the world. So a solid start to the year, slightly better than we anticipated on a sequential basis, but pleased with the progress. Yes. Bryan, thanks for the question. So first, we're pleased with the cash flow performance, a really solid start for the quarter. We're down a little bit year-over-year, but I remind you, last year was a terrific cash quarter, and this was really driven by receivables, which were impacted by the timing of Easter. In fact, we've looked at the first couple of days of the quarter and that collection period completely brought DSO back in line.

Return to shareholders, we had a dividend increase, and you saw our share buyback in the quarter and then M&A, where we look at options to improve our overall portfolio."

            "name": "Noel Wallace",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to discuss our strong start to 2024. I would like to make 2 points today on why we think we are well positioned to continue to drive shareholder value through delivering consistent, compounded earnings per share growth. \n The first is the importance of balanced top line growth. You've heard me speak over the past several years of our focus on delivering balanced organic sales growth, growth in all of our categories, growth in all of our divisions and growth in both volume and pricing. That's what we did this quarter. We delivered organic sales growth in all 4 of our categories, all 6 of our divisions and volume and pricing growth on a total company basis. The balance allowed us to deliver on a base business, 6% net sales growth on top of 6.5% net sales growth in Q1 2023 despite a nearly 4% headwind from foreign exchange. \n The focus on balance between pricing and volume growth allowed us to deliver solid volume growth this quarter, even with the continued volume softness in China and the expected headwind from lower private label growth as we transferred more Hill's volume into our Pet Nutrition manufacturing network. Oral Care, Personal Care and Home Care each grew volume in the quarter with volume growth of 3% for all 3 categories combined. \n Our revamped strategy and increased advertising spending have allowed us to drive growth across a greater percentage of our portfolio and our focus on core innovation is keeping our biggest brands relevant and vibrant in consumers' minds. We still have work to do, but our balanced strategy continues to yield results, including continued growth in our Global Oral Care shares, which leads me to my second point, which is flexibility in the P&L. Our focus on revenue growth management and driving our Funding-the-Growth initiatives enable us to achieve a 60% gross margin in the quarter despite significant headwinds from transactional foreign exchange. \n Our commitment to productivity in the middle of the P&L allowed us to drive 30 basis points of overhead leverage while still continuing to invest in strategic capabilities like digital, data and analytics, all topics we discussed at CAGNY, and prudent balance sheet management allow us to deliver 18% base business earnings growth despite the year-over-year increase in interest expense and the impact from devaluations around the globe. \n And most importantly, despite an expected mid-single-digit negative impact from foreign exchange, we're guiding to mid- to high single-digit base business earnings per share growth. And we're doing this in the context of meaningful increases in brand investment that will set the stage for growth in the future. This is a testament to the ability of our team to consistently execute our strategy and seize growth opportunities while also preparing to better withstand the inevitable headwinds of running a global business. \n So with that, I'll take your questions. Great. Thanks, Steve. I'd come back to the points I made in my upfront comments around balanced organic sales growth. I mean we're getting really good quality coming through on the volume line. You saw the 1.3. That was with the headwind of private label that we're obviously exiting on the Hill's business. and strong pricing across the board, mid-single-digit pricing ex the impact of Argentina. And as you point out, we're seeing nice share growth consistently around the world that's driving obviously that top line organic growth and the top line sales growth. But we're most pleased with, I think, is the balance we're getting both on volume and price. We're able to still get pricing, not just inflationary pricing, but we still have pricing going through the categories, particularly in some of the markets where we've had more inflationary impact from raw materials. \n Hill's would be a good example of that. We took some more pricing in the first quarter. The pricing has obviously led to good value accretion in the category and allowed us to drive some value shares. The other important point is we've seen really good momentum in our volume shares. The U.S. had good growth on volume share in toothpaste. We've seen consistent volume share growth, both in Europe and in Latin America across our portfolio. \n So it's really broad-based across the strategy that we're trying to execute, balanced volume, balance price, good initiatives through the innovation that we're putting into the market. And then importantly, is the continued robust investment. We're seeing that really pay out in terms of driving not only category growth in the markets where we're spending, but most importantly, allowing us to grow share in the categories where we're spending money. \n So overall, it's, I think, a reflection of the strategy and a reflection of the balance that we have across both price and volume. Yes. Thanks, Rob. It's a little bit of all of what you've just said. So overall, really pleased with the growth and the acceleration of market shares globally. You saw that -- in the prepared remarks. You saw that in some of the slides that we provided, particularly on the Whitening segment. And it's really a function of the strategy that we've been executing for the last couple of years and really starting to see the fruits of all that effort.  \n So the growth is coming, obviously, from a good growth in Europe, which we talked about, we're at record shares in Europe, that's a balance between Colgate and our therapeutic brands of elmex and meridol, so good spending behind those businesses. And we're seeing, obviously, that translate into good share growth, particularly in some of the big markets across Europe.  \n Likewise, we're seeing the benefits of that deployed across Africa, where we've launched some of those high-end therapeutic brands as well. North America, the scanner data has been improving as you've seen. But the shares will continue to be a bit choppy there as we move forward, given some of the strategic changes we've taken with some of the drug class that trade on the promotional environment. Latin America had growth in both value and volume. That was driven both from, I think, the mix and diversity of our portfolio across Latin America, both at the high end and at the entry price point, given the breadth of portfolio offerings that we have there, and obviously, the increased spending that we're putting behind some of the good innovation.  \n So it's really broad-based, good spending, good innovation, across the board and importantly, a credit to the teams and their execution on the ground. And so we see that obviously continuing as we continue to hold investment through the balance of the year, and that share growth is coming from both the multinational competitors as well as local competitors. So broad-based across the board. We're pleased with where we are. We have more work to do, particularly in North America, but overall, a good performance. Great. Let me talk about more conceptually strategically, and I'll let Stan handle some of the more specifics on your question. So overall, as we think about the year unfolding, as we've talked about, I think, quite consistently, we'll see pricing start to ladder down as we move through the balance of the year, although we will get inflationary pricing, we still have some pricing that we're taking in some markets. \n And I would say we're deeply pleased with the revenue growth management efforts that we have around the world and the -- what that's delivering for us in terms of pricing in the market and driving category value.  \n You've seen, obviously, the impact on raw materials in the first quarter. We'll start to see that elevate a bit more in the back half. And obviously, the significant impact from transactional due to the foreign exchange headwinds that we face. That being said, we feel very good about the guidance that we provided, strategically about growing gross margins in 2024. We'll get that through, obviously, the funding the growth efforts that we have, good mix in terms of how we're deploying some of our therapeutic brands around the world. Taking pricing where we need to take to offset particularly inflationary foreign exchange and obviously, a very focused on the middle of the P&L, making sure we continue to get leverage there.  \n So overall, strategically, we feel good, but we'll see pricing ladder down. It won't have as much impact in the year to go as it just had in the first half, but overall, we feel good about where we are. Stan? So as we said in the prepared remarks, really pleased with the performance at Hill's in the quarter in what's a pretty tough operating environment. Volume was closer to flat ex the impact of private label and that was sequentially up, which is good. And we had very good pricing, as we discussed, coming out of the year in 2023 and our need to continue to offset some of the agricultural inflation that we saw in the back half of '23 moving into '24.  \n Category volume overall has been a bit sluggish in the category, but I think what's most important is to see that the sluggishness has been more of a decline in treats and a little bit of conversion from wet to dry, and that's obviously important for us to think about as we strategically move some of the bigger part of our businesses, which are in the dry segment going forward.  \n Really importantly, though, is the fact that we generated really strong share growth in the first quarter of the year behind the Hill's business. We're cross up in pet specialty, up in neighborhood pet, penetration continues to grow. We had both share growth in our Science Diet business as well as Prescription Diet. And I think this is a reflection of the continued strategy that we're deploying, great innovation, great partnership with pet specialty in terms of driving their categories and making sure that we have ample advertising to talk about the science-driven nutrition that we provide to the market.  \n So overall, we feel very good about where the Hill's business is, that business grew high single digits ex the impact of private label. So we feel we're well positioned, but we're not immune to some of the sluggishness in the category. But again, as we've talked about in the past, we have low brand awareness and low brand penetration. So a lot of upside to continue to go after as we execute our strategy. And to your point on, Filippo, on wet, obviously, there's some opportunities for us as we're very low indexed in wet. And particularly in segments like cat, where there's a lot of wet food consumed, we have an opportunity to leverage the new manufacturing that we have and get more formulas into the market and obviously, more growth for the business. Yes. I think as we've talked about, thanks for the question, the consumer has been quite constructive. I mean, we've seen obviously the significant inflation move through the category over the last year. We expected that we would see a return to volume growth as inflation became more benign and as pricing started to stabilize in the categories, and that's principally what's happened. Interesting to note that as you take the aggregate of our categories, by and large, the categories are still negative. So the volume growth that we had and delivered in the quarter, which suggests obviously, that we're growing good volume share. And I think that's a reflection of the broad-based strategy that we're deploying.  \n One, we have good innovation at the top end of the category, particularly on the therapeutic side, whether that's in whitening, in the premium side, whether that's the Total Plaque that we've launched, whether that's therapeutic with meridol and elmex as well as a lot of big core innovation. We talked about the fact that a lot of our big core portfolio, particularly in toothpaste, is at that entry or mid-price level. And so we've spent a lot of time innovating at the core to ensure that we keep those brands vibrant and we offer consumers real value and real benefits as they come into the category or they're trading down from mid-price to perhaps entry.  \n You've seen some of the sluggishness in China, to your point, come from the rural segment. Clearly, that consumer is a bit more challenged in China right now. The premium segment continues to be quite robust. But our Darlie franchise is well positioned longer term, we think, to continue to leverage some of the rural softness that we're seeing in the category and make sure that we drive share. \n The Colgate business had a terrific quarter in China. And that's, I think, a reflection of the move to the premium side of the business as we've really gone a lot more on to e-commerce with premium offerings, but overall, we're seeing, I think, a balanced consumer. The key is making sure that we're providing the reasons to use our products and the advertising that we're executing across the market is very, very important to, one, justify the price increases that came through the category last year, but really to drive trade-up in the categories to ensure consumers see the real value and science-driven benefits of our products in our portfolio. Yes. Thanks, Bonnie. I'll start with the end of your question, which is we're seeing terrific ROI in the business. And I think that's translated into the results in the quarter. Obviously, good volume growth, helping to -- certainly above the category, share growth pretty consistently around the world in both value and volume. We're seeing our premium innovations take share, and we're obviously spending a disproportionate amount of our advertising to drive premiumization and category value.  \n You heard Diana talk at CAGNY about I think a lot of the discipline that we're putting into our media spend on using data and analytics to really justify the spend everywhere we are, drive more personalization and return on that investment. So again, we're very pleased with the increase in advertising and ultimately what it's delivering.  \n As I mentioned in my upfront, what's also terrific for the business right now is the broad-based spending we have on the portfolio. And what I mean by that is we've moved from exclusively Oral Care and Pet, which was getting a significant amount of spend over the last couple of years to making sure that some of our strong brands around the world are getting their fair share of the advertising, and we've seen a great return on that investment.  \n Europe would be a great example of that. We're spending behind our Personal Care business in Europe. Sanex is just an extraordinarily strong brand there, the spending behind some of our innovations driving good share growth and good execution in store. So overall, that's having a pretty systematic impact on the business, and we're pleased with the results that we're getting.  \n Moving forward, as I've said, consistently, I think, over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we will continue to invest in this business for the long term and building brand saliency and keeping our brands vibrant is the best way to driving that consistency. Sure. Thanks, Olivia. So clearly, some of the comps get more difficult as we go through the year to go. We took obviously a lot of pricing. We'll see that pricing become more benign or slow in the back half of the year that will -- to be determined how much of that comes back into volume. The good news is the first quarter and some of the success that we saw in the fourth quarter, give us confidence that the volume is returning as we expected. The elasticities are in line with as we expected. \n So we feel pretty good about where we are. Again, I think the biggest differentiator here in terms of how we think about is we're only in the first quarter. There's a lot of economic uncertainty out there in terms of what's happening. We still see foreign exchange being a headwind. That will certainly have an impact as we have to take pricing in some markets. Interest is going to stay stubbornly high. We expect through the balance of the year. \n So overall, we're still early in the year, very confident in the guidance we've provided and the strategy that we're executing, but we want to make sure we maintain operational flexibility through the balance of the year to ensure we continue to execute the strategy that we've been communicating to drive consistent compounded earnings share growth. Sure. Thanks for the question. Let me take the North America and then I'll let Stan jump into some of your questions around gross profit. Overall, the strategy in North America that we're executing, we feel good about it. We've been very focused, as we've talked about before on improving the middle of the P&L, getting gross margins back to where they needed to get to, getting operating margins where they need to get back to and reinvesting that into the business in order to drive market shares. \n The value shares, as I mentioned, we have been a little bit choppy and will continue to be a little bit choppy for the reasons I stated earlier. However, we are seeing better execution of our innovation and our promotional strategies, and that's helping to drive nice volume share in the quarter, both across toothpaste, which was up nicely and toothbrushes from a volume standpoint. \n So again, we feel good about that, and we still have a lot of work to do across the business, as we've talked about on prior calls, and I've got great confidence in Jesper and his team and the strategy that we're deploying with real patience because we know it's going to take some time, but we feel in the long term, we're going to end up in a much better place from that. \n The other thing I'd say is that non-Nielsen business in the North America business continues to grow at multiples of the Nielsen business. And obviously, that's not captured in the market share. So we feel good about overall health in the business, but we'll consistently continue to drive the opportunities that we see in the Nielsen-based accounts. Yes. Thanks, Lauren. A great quarter for Europe. And again, a terrific execution from the team on the ground. Overall, really, really strong with growth across the vast majority of our business, and it wasn't just Oral Care, it was pretty broad-based. And obviously, as you saw, volumes inflected positively given that we're still getting pricing in the category. \n So pricing will ramp down as we move through the balance of the year. The big change, I think, is our investment strategy in Europe. We see real opportunities for growth, particularly in the Oral Care and Personal Care segment, as we execute some of the innovations that we have there, the meridol and elmex shares broad-based across Europe are at record levels and growing really, really nicely. \n Again, that is a shift in strategy and what's nice is we're getting the complementary growth on the Colgate side of the business, particularly as we're more focused on the whitening opportunity that we have. So a great portfolio of brands that we're leveraging, we think, more strategically around the region. So the market shares overall look pretty good. \n In terms of private label, as you know, private label has higher penetration in Europe than it does anywhere else in the world. We have seen some acceleration in some of the home care categories, whether it's dish liquid or fabric softeners or floor cleaners, but that being said, we continue to have good growth across our business, particularly as we -- as I mentioned earlier, broadened the investment strategy across a wider array of our brands in Europe. Yes, Bryan, the only thing I would add is, again, picking up on the theme of flexibility, it's not only flexibility throughout the P&L, but it's having a really strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to deploy capital as we see the best return on that investment. And I give Stan and the finance organization huge credit and the discipline that they're bringing around the world to ensure that the cash generation continues to be robust. Yes. Thanks. So again, we've been talking about that for quite some time, and that has been, I think, a reflection of the strategy that we've talked about for 3 years, which is core adjacencies and channels and getting back to real focus and understanding the consumer journey across all of the markets in which we compete has been fundamental to making sure that we have strategies to capture and deploy our investments in areas where we think we're going to get the best return for that. \n And some of these emerging channels that are not captured by Nielsen are very, very important, whether that's hard discount stores in parts of the world. Whether that's the club store environment, where the value pack in large sizes continue to be a big growth driver, whether that's the ease and convenience of shopping online and some of the digital execution and understanding the digital shelf and the discipline that we brought to that, that ultimately is being seen through the success that we're having in those alternative channels. \n We don't anticipate that, that will change. I think as some of the classical brick-and-mortar retailers really up their game, and we're certainly seeing that across the U.S. markets where the big players are certainly becoming far more sophisticated and progressive with their offerings and their shopper experience. We're partnering with them to ensure that we're -- our brands are involved in that journey that they're on, and making sure that we're bringing our digital capabilities to the entire omnichannel environment and making sure that Colgate and the brands that we offer at the forefront of that. \n So it's, again, shopper journey the experience that the shoppers are getting, the value orientation on some of those channels and our ability to be much more targeted with some of our spend, and that's particularly related to the online retailers. Yes. Thanks, Brett. What's interesting is you're seeing -- I think you're hearing that a lot of the competitive set has focused on building healthy category growth, and that's two ways: one, with increased media investment and the second is with increased innovation. We have not seen a fundamental shift around the world to more volume sold on promotion. It's still below where we were pre-COVID. Now as volume becomes the important aspect here, you may see some players move to that strategy of doing more promotions. But overall, the category has been very constructive in terms of big players spending money on media, driving value to the categories through innovation, and offerings that are differentiated in the marketplace. And so it's incumbent upon us to ensure that our innovations continue to drive real value to the category and the differentiation in a very competitive market and making sure that we're using the analytics and the data that we have to drive balanced promotional strategies in the categories. \n We'll be competitive where we need to be. I mentioned we've made some difficult decisions in the U.S. business to not chase a lot of deep down in promotions, particularly in certain retail environments that will have a short-term impact on the Nielsen shares, but long term, we feel we're going to deploy that money in an effective way. And again, it's making sure that we continue to drive saliency of our brands and the health of our brands long term, and we do that through media and innovation, not necessarily through promotions. Yes. Again, let me contextualize Latin America. Obviously, a really strong organic sales growth quarter, with and without Argentina, there was good volume growth across every single hub led by Brazil, which was up double digits. If I take the last 4 quarters of Latin America in terms of volume, 0.5, 5.4, 8, and 6.2. So again, very consistent with what we talked about. \n Our ability to get pricing early in the market has allowed us now to see the volume return to the categories and ultimately into our business. Our marketing is really strong and innovation is very strong on the ground, and so we feel very good about where we're seeing. And that's been translated into really positive share growth for the business. \n So ex Argentina, very good organic growth. Organic up significantly in the region. I think you saw double-digit growth in Brazil, which has been terrific. Oral Care, particularly has been really strong in the quarter. That was up double digits, excluding Argentina. Shares in value and volume up. It's been quite some time since we saw both of those move in the right direction, and again, a reflection, I believe, of the strategy of increased investment and making sure that we have a breadth of offerings in that market. \n That is a market that's accustomed to inflationary pricing across many of the markets in which we compete. Being key for us is making sure that we continue to advertise strongly in the markets, and we bring real innovation across the entire portfolio that keeps the categories vibrant, allows us to work with our retailers to drive category growth and hopefully capture share at the same time. \n So overall, we think Latin America is well positioned for continued growth, and we like what we're seeing there. Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. Obviously, we're really pleased with the quarter and how we've gotten off to a strong start that we believe sets us up for continued sustainable growth moving forward and generating that long-term algorithm that we've been talking about for quite some time for our shareholders. \n Let me particularly reach out to all of the Colgate employees around the world for their incredible dedication and resilience and their hard work in really executing a strategy around the world and for getting us off to a great start. So thanks, everyone. We'll see you and talk to you soon."
