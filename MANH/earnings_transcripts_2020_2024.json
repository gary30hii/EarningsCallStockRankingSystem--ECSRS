[Operator Instructions] After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, February 2, 2021.  I would now like to introduce Eddie Capel, CEO; Dennis Story, CFO; and Michael Bauer, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Bauer, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Thank you, May, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates 2020 fourth quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly on our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note in particular that uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel : Great. Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our fourth quarter 2020 results and discuss our outlook and guidance for 2021. Also, given our journey toward being a cloud-first company, the long-term nature of our newer SaaS contracts and the visibility and momentum that we're seeing, we thought it might be helpful to provide you with our initial thinking around a 3-year trajectory of our business in terms of RPO, cloud revenue, and adjusted operating margins through 2023. So, we'll cover that a bit later. But for the quarter, Manhattan reported Q4 revenue of $147 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.45, both of which exceeded our expectations. Broad revenue outperformance across our business lines, combined with a continued focus on expense management, once again drove earnings leverage for the quarter. Fortunately for Manhattan, our business is entering 2021 with accelerating velocity and growing opportunities. Now 2020 was a very successful year for Manhattan Associates, arguably the best year ever in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic. Beyond the numbers, 2020 was a benchmark year of resolve, performance, and growth for our employees and our customers. We strengthened our company significantly in 2020 and have substantially improved our market leadership position. In May, we launched our cloud-native Manhattan Active Warehouse Management solution, which we believe is the most significant advancement in WMS technology in over a decade. And the market reaction to this new product has been equally impressive with already a double-digit number of deals closed to date, and our pipeline is growing. In fact, we signed the largest Manhattan Active Warehouse Management deal to date and the enthusiasm from both new and existing customers for Manhattan Active WM is certainly surpassing our original expectations. At no time in our company's history is our product strategy being in complete synergistic alignment with customer and market demand. Across our full suite of cloud solutions, we're seeing solid and growing demand. Pipeline bookings are at record levels, with about 90% of the pipe consisting of cloud opportunities, and net new potential customers representing almost 40% of the demand. We entered 2021 with increasing momentum and greater visibility because there\u2019s a growing market need for modern, adaptable supply chain, inventory and omnichannel products, and that collection of cloud-native solutions positions us well. Our unified platform is industry-leading and provides our customers with the ability to efficiently adapt to changes in consumer behavior, while simultaneously helping elevate the entire consumer experience. Simply put, our commitment to investing in market-leading innovation and focus on customer success strategically positions us for long-term sustainable growth. Demand for our supply chain and omnichannel products and services has been pretty solid, and while the near-term timing of and continued pace of economic recovery remains somewhat unclear, recent signs have been encouraging. And as such, we're raising the 2021 full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance that we provided on our Q3 call. And furthermore, our dedication to innovation remains. We expect to invest nearly $90 million in research and development this year, even with a potentially choppy macro backdrop. And as I mentioned earlier, with our business visibility strengthening, later in the call, Dennis will provide details of how we see our 3-year trajectory. He'll provide you with guidance for 2021 and guideposts with much broader ranges for '22 and 2023. Dennis will provide insights into how we see RPO, cloud revenue, and adjusted operating margins shaping up for the next 3 years. And with RPO as the leading indicator of cloud revenue performance, our objective is to exit 2023 with roughly $1 billion in remaining performance obligation, representing a 3-year CAGR of about 45%. Now on the sales front, competitive win rates remained strong at about 70% as our innovation is being recognized as the best in the industry. In Q4, about 20% of our licensing cloud deals closed were from new customers. From a vertical perspective, retail, consumer goods, food and beverage and grocery drove more than 50% of our cloud and license revenue in the quarter. Now regarding services, we conducted over 100 go-lives in the quarter and anticipate a return to services revenue growth in 2021. While the rate of this services growth will be influenced by the broader economic recovery, demand for our expertise remains high, and we're aggressively hiring talent to meet the forecasted demand. And more broadly, we expect to hire 200 to 300 new associates company-wide in 2021, including R&D, cloud ops, sales, and marketing. If I can, let me provide you just a few specifics on some of our product innovation. First, I'd like to start by providing a quick update on one of the biggest product launches in Manhattan's history, Manhattan Active Warehouse Management. As you recall, we announced Manhattan Active WM in Q2 at our Virtual Annual User Conference. And since then, we've seen strong market interest and adoption, frankly surpassing even our own ambitious goals. While the customer mix has undoubtedly been affected by the global pandemic, I'm happy to report that we're seeing broad demand across many industries and all parts of the globe. In fact, we now have customers spanning 10 different industries in eight different countries. They're all currently implementing Manhattan Active WM. And with a very busy and aggressive go-live schedule lined up for 2021, our selling and implementation teams are at full strength across the geographies that drive the majority of our revenue, and we're seeing a nice pipeline for Manhattan Active WM too as we head into 2021. And in addition to a healthy balance we're seeing across geographies and industries, our Manhattan Active WM implementations strike a nice balance between existing customers and entirely new, net new. Of our Manhattan Active WM projects in-flight right now, we're seeing about a 50-50 split between those 2 categories. And as you recall, one of the key benefits of Manhattan Active WM is it that it's completely versionless. It's updated in the background for our customers with zero downtime. And we provide them with new feature functions every single quarter. In fact, since we announced this new solution in May, we've already added a host of new innovative capabilities in the past couple of quarterly releases. Now turning to Transportation Management. We closed out 2020 with some great wins and further progress on our goal of evolving TMS at Manhattan Associates from being a great domestic business for us being a truly global business. And to that end, we now have a live customer in Europe successfully using TMS and have additional projects in-flight in that region. When we continue to see the pipeline build in a number of countries across EMEA, we're building capacity to support those projects in expectations of their closing in 2021. And our cloud TMS solution continues to compete very effectively, both home and abroad. Now I'll close my product update this afternoon with our Manhattan Active Omni Solution Suite. We've just completed taking our customers through their third retail peak season of Manhattan Active Omni. And as you would guess, we processed an all-time record high number of orders, shipments and payments. The ongoing channel shift from bricks-and-mortar to digital commerce continues to benefit our omnichannel business and as we help more customers successfully capture and deliver on their direct-to-consumer orders.  Our particular note this year was the surge in store-related digital activity. Almost all of our Manhattan Active Omni customers use that technology to power a pretty vibrant ship-from-store program. But now, we're seeing an increasing number of those customers actually prefer to ship from their stores, actually up 300% over 2009 retail peak. And this is in order to speed up customer delivery and manage the parcel network constraints much more effectively. And as you might imagine, in-store pickup programs continue to accelerate at a rapid rate, with activity both in curbside and traditional store pickup. Both the in-store pickup and curbside delivery programs clearly are here to stay, and we continue to leverage our advanced version of technology to provide these kinds of innovative solutions to our customers at a very rapid rate. On a related note, by the way, one of the byproducts that are booming digital business is, unfortunately, very often, booming volumes and returns. And all of our customers grapple with this so-called reverse logistics problem. But fortunately, Manhattan offers technology to optimize that full life cycle with best-in-class capabilities in the contact center, digital self-service for the end consumer. And purpose-design capabilities for the distribution center for processing the physical goods. And while the volume of returns in many ways is inevitable, a greater customer experience isn't always the same. So delivering that great experience to returns and exchanges at high-volume really does take a fully integrated order management system and WMS to effectively process those returns. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and discuss our outlook, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before moving into Q&A. Dennis?\nDennis Story : Okay. Thanks, Eddie. Everyone strap on your suspenders. I have a lot of information to cover here. So as Eddie mentioned, fourth quarter total revenue was $147 million, down 4% over the prior year, exceeding our guidance. Full year 2020 total revenue of $586 million was down 5% compared to 2019, as you know, solely due to COVID. Q4 adjusted earnings per share was $0.45. GAAP earnings per share was $0.32 with stock-based compensation accounting for the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS. Cloud revenue for the quarter was $23 million, up 9% sequentially and 46% over prior year. For full year 2020, cloud revenue increased 70% to $80 million. For the first quarter 2021, we estimate cloud revenue to be approximately $24 million, up 39% over 2020. For full year 2021, we estimate cloud revenue to be in the range of $108 million to $110 million, growing at about 36.5% at the midpoint and accounting for approximately 85% of total software revenue, up from less than 50% in 2019. Starting with Q2, we expect cloud revenue to grow roughly at $2 million sequentially per quarter for the balance of 2021. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, for the quarter totaled $309 million, up 20% sequentially and 80% over prior year. Recall, RPO is the leading proxy for our cloud revenue performance and represents the value of contractual obligations required to be performed, otherwise referred to as unearned revenue or bookings. For Manhattan, this disclosed value represents our cloud bookings value of unearned revenue under non-cancelable contracts greater than 1 year. Contracts with a non-cancelable term of 1 year or less are excluded from the reported amount. As Eddie previously highlighted, demand and pipeline growth for our cloud solutions continue to be strong from both new and existing customers. Reflective of this strength, we anticipate 2021 RPO to be in the range of $450 million to $550 million, up from our prior estimate of $385 million to $390 million, representing growth of approximately 60% at the $500 million midpoint. One important point on flow-through from RPO to cloud revenue. As previously stated, as you know, our performance continues to depend on the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter. Furthermore, some customers have longer implementation cycles, associated with large projects requiring a multiyear annual subscription ramp built into the contract term. For example, the record Manhattan Active Warehouse Management deal closed in the quarter will have much higher levels of contracted and recognized revenue in the out years of the contract compared to year 1. These revenue ramps are common for larger cloud deals and with larger opportunities becoming more prevalent in our pipeline, we expect RPO growth to accelerate first, followed by a gradual steepening ramp in cloud revenue growth, providing us with very good visibility into future subscription revenue. Regarding license revenue, Q4 was roughly $10 million. Overall, for 2020, license totaled $38 million and was down 22% over prior year as our full suite of cloud solutions have come online. We expect license attrition to accelerate in 2021, with license revenue declining about 50% or $18 million, over 2020. For full year 2021, we estimate license revenue to be in the range of $18 million to $22 million, averaging about $5 million per quarter. As a yard marker for cloud demand, license will be about 3% of total revenue exiting 2021. Shifting to maintenance. Revenue for the quarter totaled $39 million, up 2% versus the prior year on strong cash collections. For the full year, maintenance revenue declined 1% to $148 million. The decline primarily reflects demand from our WMS installed base, converting to cloud subscription and lower license revenue, which we expect this trend to continue in 2021 and beyond. Our full year 2021 maintenance revenue forecast is $138 million to $142 million, representing an $8 million or 5.5% decline. For Q1 and all subsequent quarters, we estimate maintenance revenue to be approximately $35 million per quarter. Turning to services. In line with our expectations, Professional Services revenue for the quarter totaled $71 million, down 18% year-over-year. Excluding build travel, services were down approximately 14%. As discussed on our Q3 call, we expect our Services segment to return to growth in 2021 and build from our Q1 results. As a reminder, Q1 2020 was a record comp quarter with subsequent quarter run rates dramatically impacted by the pandemic. So for the first quarter, we are targeting services revenue in the $74 million to $76 million range, down 14% over prior year, but up 4% to 7% sequentially over Q4 2020. On a year-over-year basis, we estimate Q2 revenue growth of about 14%, Q3 about 17% to 18% and 15% to 16% in Q4. For 2021, we are targeting a services revenue range of $315 million to $336 million, representing 7% midpoint growth dictated by the pace and cadence of economic recovery. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 52.7%. The better-than-expected result was driven by revenue performance and cloud operating leverage. We expect Q1 2021 subscription, maintenance and services margin to be approximately 50.2% and full year 2021 to be 51.3%. With historical seasonality, we expect first half to be approximately 51.2% and second half margin slightly higher at 51.5%, with Q4 at 50.2% accounting for retail peak seasonality. Now turning to operating income and margin. Q4 adjusted operating income totaled $38 million, equating to an adjusted operating margin of 25.6%. The better-than-expected result was driven by broad revenue outperformance combined with continued expense management. For Q1 2021, we are estimating adjusted operating income of $26 million to $28 million and an operating margin range of 18.8% to 19.2%, with a 19% midpoint. That's precision booming right there. For full year 2021, we are estimating an operating income range of $122 million to $134 million, that's full year, with a midpoint of $128 million and an operating margin range of 20.5% to 21.5%, with a 21% midpoint. Four primary drivers for our investment in our operating margin. Number one, hiring to meet growth demand; number two, cloud-driven decline in license and maintenance revenue; number three, the reversal of prior cost actions taken in 2020 due to COVID; and number four, continued strategic investments in innovation and cloud transition. As we continue to grow and scale the business, we are confident in our ability to make strong progress on achieving the rule of 40 over time. Moving on to income taxes. Our Q4 adjusted effective income tax rate was 22%, with our full year rate at 23.1%. We expect our Q1 and full year 2021 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. We expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 21.5% for the full year and 7% in Q1 due to tax benefits on stock vesting. Regarding our capital structure. In January, our Board of Directors lifted the suspension of our share repurchase program and authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million. For 2021, we are estimating 65.0 million diluted shares outstanding with 64.5 million diluted shares for Q1, which does not assume any share repos. Turning to cash. We closed the quarter with cash and investments of $205 million and zero debt. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled $114 million. Q4 cash flow from operations totaled $38 million, up 10% over 2020. And full year operating cash flow totaled $141 million, down just 4% over 2020. Finally, full year capital expenditures totaled $3 million. And for 2021, we estimate CapEx investment to be in the range of about $6 million to $10 million. That covers 2020. Now I'll provide full year 2021 guidance and 2022, 2023 guidepost. Then we'll turn it back to Eddie for his closing remarks. Let's go big picture. Manhattan's cloud transition is now entering its fourth year. We continue to accelerate investments in innovation with customer demand validating our strategy. Our cloud solutions are impacting all of our major revenue lines. That's cloud, license, maintenance and services now driving 50-plus percent of our overall total revenue and growing. The underlying fundamentals of our total revenue model is shifting dramatically. 2021 will be another record year for cloud revenue and RPO, driving approximately 85% of total software revenue while fueling services pipeline and revenue growth. In 2021, we will absorb a $27 million drag on total revenue masking our growth by 5 percentage points as license attrits in favor of cloud and maintenance revenue declines as installed base customers convert to our cloud solutions. Our total revenue yard markers for success are cloud revenue, RPO bookings and services revenue. Our guidance calls for 4% total revenue growth. To best gauge overall underlying revenue growth of our company, we compare total revenue, ex license and maintenance, which we expect to be 10% to 15% growth in 2021 with a midpoint of 12.5%. By comparison, 2020 was down 5% over 2019. Now for guidance. For total revenue, we expect a range of $595 million to $625 million. First half, second half total revenue splits are 48% first half, 52% second half. For Q1 2021, we estimate our total revenue range to be $141 million to $146 million, with a midpoint of $143 million. For operating profit and margin, as previously highlighted, we are estimating an operating income range of $122 million to $134 million, with a midpoint of $128 million, and an operating margin range of 20.5% to 21.5% with a 21% midpoint. For earnings per share, our adjusted EPS target is $1.44 to $1.59 per share, with a 47%, 53% first half-second half split. Our GAAP EPS range is estimated to be $0.96 to $1.11. For Q1, our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.31 to $0.33 and GAAP EPS range is $0.25 to $0.27. That covers our 2021 guidance. So lastly, I'll summarize our 2022 and 2023 guideposts that should better assist investors' assessment of our future cloud growth and earnings trajectory. So entering 2021, visibility into the business is strengthening and benefiting from over 3 years of data in our cloud transition, coupled with the revenue ramp deals becoming more common. As such, we are providing 2022 and 2023 directional guidepost for RPO, cloud revenue and adjusted operating margin. With revenue ramp deals becoming more prevalent, we expect RPO to accelerate, followed by a gradual steepening ramp in cloud revenue. As such, you will see 2022 RPO growth exceed cloud revenue growth. In 2023, we expect cloud revenue growth to outpace RPO as we benefit from our subscription revenue ramp. Regarding adjusted operating margin, we are forecasting adding 100 basis points annually from 2021 forward to '23, with the objective of driving long-term sustainable double-digit top line growth in top quartile operating margins. So here are the metrics. For 2022, we are targeting RPO of $625 million to $775 million with a $700 million midpoint, equaling 40% growth over 2021; cloud revenue of $135 million to $150 million with $143 million midpoint, equaling 31% growth; an adjusted operating margin of about 22% at the midpoint. For 2023, we are targeting RPO of $850 million to $1.1 billion with a $950 million midpoint, equaling 36% growth over 2022; cloud revenue of $190 million to $215 million with a $203 million midpoint, equaling 42% growth; an adjusted operating margin of about 23% at the midpoint. We will update 2022 and 2023 annually. And as Eddie mentioned, we are targeting RPO to approach $1 billion by the end of 2023, equating to a 3-year RPO CAGR of 40% to 50%. Our 3-year cloud revenue CAGR estimate is 34% to 39%, reflecting the impact of ramp deals in our RPO. So that covers the financial update. Thank you very much, and back to Eddie for some closing comments.\nEddie Capel : Terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well, look, we're pleased with our 2020 performance, and we're committed to driving operational and financial results as we progress toward our 3-year financial targets. And as we do so, we're continuing to innovate in advance of market demand, leveraging our technical and demand expertise in order to provide our customers solutions that position them for success in a dynamic and rapidly changing world. With the convergence of our cloud strategy and the customer demand tightening, we see no shortage of opportunities to expand our addressable market while further strengthening our competitive position. And to wrap up, I want to thank all of our employees globally. Your relentless dedication and commitment to our customers' ongoing success is inspirational. And it's a key differentiator in driving long-term sustainable growth for our company and for our shareholders. And your resourcefulness and perseverance in the face of a worldwide pandemic has resulted in what I believe to be our best year ever. So thank you, and May, we're now ready to take any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist Securities.\nTerry Tillman : Okay. I got a preamble here. So nice to hear you, Eddie and Dennis, and welcome aboard, Mike. We do got the suspenders on, and thanks for the precision guidance there, Dennis. Two questions. The first one is a 2-part question for you, Eddie. The idea of Active Omni and kind of the multiyear cycle of bringing all the innovation together, I'm curious how the conversations are going with these Tier 1 companies. Can you talk about like a platform now? Are the conversations more elevated? Is it C-level discussions? And just kind of how this plays out now being able to kind of tie all this together, your WMS, your TMS, et cetera, are the conversations changing? And then I have a second part to that question.\nEddie Capel : Yes. I would say the answer to that is definitely yes, Terry. At the end of the day, I do feel like that the -- a lot of the elevated conversations come from the fact that a sizable portion of our suite these days is driving revenue for our customers. The WMS and the TMS, obviously, great facilitators and imperative parts of the supply chain network and the business operations. At the end of the day, they are cost-savers, right? They are cost-savers. And -- but when you cross the bridge and start talking about omnichannel solutions, point-of-sale solutions, store solutions to really drive revenue growth, that's really when the conversations begin to elevate even higher into the CEO office.\nTerry Tillman : Yes. The second part of the question is, we heard some aspirational goals of a pretty dramatic growth in the RPO over time over $1 billion. I mean, how do you feel, though, right now, Eddie, about just the sales capacity and where you are now with your capacity and what you need to get to, to be able to make good on a $1 billion-plus RPO? And then I have a follow-up for Dennis.\nEddie Capel : Yes. We feel great. Really terrific about the sales capacity. We think we're very well aligned to be able to meet those growth rates. We are continuing to selectively hire the best of the best in the supply chain market and so forth. But that is -- as sales capacity will certainly not be an inhibitor to the growth trajectory that we laid out, I'm very confident about that.\nTerry Tillman: Okay. And Dennis, so if I have this right, you took your guidance for the RPO ending balance at the end of '21 385 million to 390 million up to 450 million to 550 million. If that's right, what I'm curious about is, well, first, that's a large range, and I guess that's -- you want to have some cushion there, kind of upside, downside case and base case. But how do we think about the progression of RPO through the year? I don't want to mismodel this kind of each quarter because it is such an important metric now we're focused on. So how do I think about it progressing through the year? \nDennis Story : Yes. The yard marker is going to be the full year target, Terry, at $450 million to the $550 million. Each quarter, we're going to give an RPO update, so you'll be able to see that progression. But suffice to say, we're targeting a pretty strong growth rate at about 60% at the midpoint.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird.\nJoe Vruwink: I wanted to start on just the thinking of RPO over the next couple of years and Eddie and Dennis, you both drew out a couple of things. Just having more time in this transition, so a better understanding, some familiarity with ramp structures and how that's going to play out. And then just seeing, I think, Eddie, you said, better-than-expected interest and demand for the new Active Warehouse Management product. Are any of those individual areas driving this RPO number out in 2023 to a higher level than you would have thrown out if we were kind of having this discussion, I don't know, it's 3 or 6 months ago, I'm just trying to gauge how much is maybe new to reflect the new kind of imperative around supply chain as a category versus your new product versus you just have a little more experience under your belt?\nEddie Capel : I think it's all of those 3 things, and certainly the visibility that we have now, selling the full suite of solutions, the enthusiasm that we've seen for Manhattan Active WM. And no question, I think over the last 3 quarters at least, there has been some reticence on our part to do too much predicting of the future. I think, along with everybody else on the planet, we optimistically see some light on the horizon in terms of the situation that we have with the pandemic and the economic recovery, so feel a little more comfortable talking about our future trajectory.\nJoe Vruwink: And then just on employing these ramp structures, obviously, we understand kind of the ramification for 2021 revenue growth, but looking at RPO as the better indicator, I'm just wondering are the ramps, I guess, a mechanism where you're starting to see, whether it's new accounts or existing accounts, engage with Manhattan across a bigger total contract value opportunities. So you mentioned the fact that you have this unified platform now, are ramps a mechanism where you're truly getting the full buy-in across on the inventory warehouse management, and so there's maybe a near-term revenue ramification, but otherwise these are much bigger scopes and engagements that Manhattan traditionally would have secured?\nEddie Capel : No. No, not really, Joe. There's still a huge amount of opportunity for upsell and cross-sell across the suite of solutions. The ramp, we've seen the -- say, ramp accelerate, I'm not sure if that's the right term, but it seems to ramp phenomenal increase as we've introduced where Manhattan Active WM, right, because it by nature is sort of distributed. We service Tier 1 as you know. Many, many of our customers have 5, 10, even 20 distribution centers across the planet. And it takes time to roll out all of those, again, 10, 20, or 50 distribution centers. And so that's why in this particular WM space, you see a little bit more of an acute, if that's the right word, acute ramp philosophy.\nJoe Vruwink: And maybe just as a follow-up, so more a question then on the multi-product bookings activity, are you see leaving the ramp structure aside? Are you starting to see more customer interest and truly unifying their full supply chain execution suite? And then I'll turn it back over.\nEddie Capel: I think we see interest. But Joe, in all reality, we've been in the market for 6 months with Manhattan Active WM so it would be wrong of me to say that we're starting to see that really be a very popular phenomenon. Obviously, it's our strategy, but we're about 6 months in. There is certainly is interest as customers acquire either Manhattan Active WM Manhattan and Active Omni. Certainly, they've got the future in mind, but we're not yet seeing those larger multiproduct deals that you speak of.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yun Kim of Loop Capital Markets.\nYun Kim: RPO growth came in very strong again, Eddie, Dennis and Mike. How much of that was driven by Active Omni versus Active WM? And if you can remind us what the RPO mix is between the 2 products? And where do you expect that mix to be in 2023, since we're talking about 2023 this call? And Dennis, you don't have to be precise with the estimate, the ballpark number should be good.\nEddie Capel : Yun, it's a great question, interesting one. But at this particular juncture, we're not breaking out RPO by product line. So I really can't give you any guidance there.\nYun Kim : Can you just give us qualitatively what's really driving the RPO growth this past quarter? I am assuming the sequential growth is coming from the WMS, right? Active WM?\nDennis Story : Yes. I would say Active WM is -- it's a mix. So it probably was a subtle comment, but now we have the full suite of solutions in the market. So Omni was a little more challenged, as you can imagine in 2020, but we're seeing nice pickup there in the pipeline. And AWM, strong as well. We're seeing solid pipeline with TMS. So it's -- the pipeline has got good diversity to it.\nYun Kim : Okay. Great. And then Eddie, can you just revisit your acquisition strategy? Obviously, you guys have the Active WM adoption gaining momentum. You have a lot of visibility driven by the ramp deals, and your -- you just laid out a 3-year plan. How should we think about your acquisition strategy going forward since, obviously, it's much easier to cross-sell additional modules and products on the cloud?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Same acquisition strategy that we've had, Yun, that frankly has not born fruit for us. The number 1 use of our capital is to drive intrinsic innovation. And for us, that is represented by research and development. We certainly are very interested in acquisitions, but we've got a reasonably high bar, right? They've got to be gap fillers for us and really be able to give us the ability to be able to expand our reach. And our current strategy really drives us into what is essentially white space, okay? The solutions that we're developing don't really exist out there. So it's very hard for us to invoke an acquisition strategy of that type. Again, we are very interested in the right opportunities. But in the absence of acquisition opportunities, as the Board has authorized here in January, we will reinstitute a share buyback program.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz of Rosenblatt Securities.\nMark Zgutowicz : Thank you. Two quick ones for both of you. Curious if you've had or seen any prospect conversations within the omnichannel POS segment perhaps accelerate now that we've sort of exited the holiday season, and we've seen likely the lights of the strains on those channels. And perhaps, if curbside is sort of being viewed as less of a pandemic service and more as a staple going forward? But just curious, maybe post-holiday conversations you've had, some have accelerated. And then just a macro question. As it relates to your guidance, 3-year guidance and the range is sort of what the contemplations are there in terms of macro relative to pipeline conversion those types of things would be helpful?\nEddie Capel: Yes, sure. Well, in terms of the first question, yes, stores have become open again, foot traffic has begun to pick up a little bit. What we've seen is this, again, this synergistic alignment of our strategy and market demands. Simply put, for the last number of years, frankly, we've been banging the table talking about the benefits of omnichannel strategies, buy anywhere, ship from anywhere, sell from anywhere and all of those capabilities. And clearly, some of our customers have taken up those opportunities and said -- and essentially said, yes, those are interesting capabilities, and we think we'd like to offer them to our consumers. What's happened, and those include buy online, pickup in store, curbside pickup, buy online return from store, all of those capabilities. What we've seen happen in the last 6 months or so, interestingly, is consumers are now essentially demanding those capabilities. It's no longer the retailers saying, we've got this if you want it. Consumers are essentially saying look, if I can't buy online, come and pick up the store or pick up at the curbside, I'm not going to shop with you. So we're seeing a pull versus a push, right, of those capabilities. And we do believe that BOPUS curbside, ROPUS, return at store, all of those capabilities are announced here to stay and going to be very prevalent going forward. So we're excited about that.  With regard to the specific question you asked about point of sale, there is certainly a growing interest, right? We really do feel like the point-of-sale -- our point of sale, go-to-market initiatives in 2020 is kind of a gap year, right, for obvious reasons. There are a lot of stores closed. But as they reopen and stores are continuing to become more multifunction, more multifunction, more multifunction that old traditional glorified calculator in the corner of the store doesn't get the job done when you've got all of these different capabilities if you got to handle inside the retail stores. So certainly, we're seeing interest and conversation pick up in that space.\nMark Zgutowicz : Thanks, Eddie. Maybe on the just the guidance question, the range, sort of what might be contemplated, I'm thinking about the ranges of your 3-year guidance. Is it some of that macro versus conversion or what are some of those contemplations?\nEddie Capel: You mean why are the ranges so broad?\nMark Zgutowicz: Right.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, it's 3 years out. We're providing, as Dennis said, pretty precision guidance, we think, for 2021. And but we've obviously started just expanding the ranges for 2022 and 2023. And I think that's pretty commonplace, frankly. We've got a lot of opportunity in front of us. And we'll keep updating that 3-year guidance on an annual basis. Our intra-year guidance, of course, will update on a quarterly basis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson of Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: And welcome, Mike. So two questions for me. So first off, maybe a higher level, Eddie. So there's been a lot of investments over the last few years. I think the product innovation is evident to everyone. As we look forward into kind of that 2- to 5-year road map, do the investments shift at all, right? We heard about innovation today, but does it pivot more towards go-to-market now that you have some of these product investments in the rearview mirror? Or should we still see kind of that cadence on R&D through the next 2 to 3 years?\nEddie Capel: Yes. You should expect to see R&D continuing and frankly, continuing to grow. We've got a very long list of innovative capabilities that we still have planned for the market. Always, you've got a balance to make sure you're not too far ahead of the market. Otherwise, you'll be the Apple Newton, right? There was a little ahead of its time there. So we've got to pace that out, but we've got a long list of capabilities that we think will bring real value to the market. So no plans for any slowdown in R&D investment, Brian.\nBrian Peterson: Okay. Got it. And maybe just I wanted to maybe look at the ramp deal dynamic from a different perspective. I'm curious, does that cadence change, if you're looking at Active WM versus Active Omni? And just at a higher level, what are the ramifications on gross margins of having these ramp deals kind of step up over a couple of year period?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Yes, definitely a different profile, Manhattan Active Omni and Manhattan Active WM. Manhattan Active Omni, sort of that singular corporate application where all orders are flowing through. And as we've talked about, distribution centers tend to be, by definition, distributed around the world, and it takes time to get those systems rolled out. So that's why you see that kind of that ramp profile change. Not a big impact on margin. We've got this WM rollout strategy, then to a pretty good science. We ramp infrastructure accordingly. We ramp support accordingly. So really not much of an impact on GM.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau of William Blair.\nMatt Pfau: I wanted to ask on the existing customers that are upgrading to Active WM, maybe you could just give us some idea about what is driving them to move from the on-premise to cloud deployment model? And are these older deployments? Or are some of these customers that have deployed in the past several years?\nEddie Capel: Yes, pretty good range there, actually. Actually, Matt, none of which are -- have got too many barnacles growing on them. Maybe nothing really old. But the primary driver is really 2, I would say. One, the clear head and shoulders is more immediate access to innovation, right? So we've -- obviously, we've been serial investors in innovation. But just like every other enterprise application company on the planet, we released annually. And it's just sort of the way of the world, right? Our customers would buy a solution, implement a version and come to our customer conference for the next year and hear about all the new capabilities that we have invested in and released knowing that they just implemented and frankly, probably 2, 3, 4, maybe even 5 years away from getting their hands on those new capabilities. And in the fast-moving space that we're operating in a supply chain, that can be quite detrimental to business process, velocity, customer service and an overall efficiency of the business.  So number one, head and shoulders is access to innovation. But secondly, remember, we -- when we take on running in the cloud, we take over the maintenance of the system, of course, and the overall operations. So that frees up their very valuable IT resources to be able to focus on differentiating their company, right, versus maintaining systems and so forth. And so that combination of access to innovation and freeing up their valuable resources is really, I think are the 2 primary drivers for the interest.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. And last one, if I can fit it in here. Just on the increase in the RPO guidance, which seemed quite large. Just sort of wondering, any more details on what's behind that? Is it just you have a better confidence that cloud is the preferred deployment model now that you have 90% of your pipeline or deals in that form? Is there improvement in macro expectations or perhaps something else in there?\nEddie Capel: Well, so the near-term raise in RPO, I mean, honest -- I mean, I think you and everybody know this, Matt. It's the near-term raise in RPO is essentially analogous with strong but would have been strong license sales, right? Because we've accumulated new deals, which has driven near-term RPO level. In terms of the long-term RPO expectations that a trajectory that we put out there, we see a strong market demand. We're very confident in the innovation that we're delivering to the marketplace. Our win rates are strong and the enthusiasm is very good. And as Dennis always points out, we have got great opportunity for cross-sell and upsell across what then will be our existing customer base, given that solutions are on a common, very modern platform.\nDennis Story: Hey, Matt, let me piggyback on that. It's in large part, going into our fourth year, we have great visibility, forward visibility into our pipeline. Number two, your question about whether or not there's demand for cloud, 90% of our pipeline bookings is for cloud. And as you can imagine, licenses, as I commented in the script, is attriting pretty rapidly. We'll exit 2021 and our estimate is this license will be 3% of total revenue in a 4-year transition.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel of Benchmark.\nMark Schappel: Nice job on the quarter and for the year for that matter. Eddie, question for you. Could you provide some additional details around the large Active WM deal that were signed in the quarter? Was this a new customer? Was it a competitive deal?\nEddie Capel: It was an existing customer, but I can't go into too much detail name of the customers and so forth. But it was an existing customer, and there was a competitive nature to it as well. They had, frankly, in an acquisition that they had done some other competitive solutions. So it was a little bit of both, but what we would certainly call an existing Tier 1 customer, but definitely had a competitive nature to it.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Great. And then just shifting gears to your Transportation solutions. Again, if you could just provide some additional color on the relatively large TMS customer that was signed in Europe. And also too, I read it, if you could just talk about some of your ongoing initiatives to kind of reposition the solution overseas or just call attention to the solution?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Really, the lack of penetration overseas was right or wrong through our choice. We focused on the U.S. market. We have really not released the product to be sold overseas. I think that we tend to be, some would say, a little conservative. If we're not comfortable that we can very satisfactorily execute on a first-class implementation and provide first-class post-implementation support, we won't sell a solution in a particular market. But we chose to release a TMS solution for sale in Europe because we're ready, trained -- hired and trained a workforce. There is no question that offering it in the cloud added, provided a little bit of simplicity into the program. So we didn't need all of the technical resources in market and so forth. But of course, we had to do some product enhancements to be able to support those international markets as well. So all of those things come together, and we're seeing a nice growing demand. As I said, we've got one nice customer live over there. We signed a couple of more there in-flight of implementation and interest is certainly gaining. We might look back in the rearview mirror and say, maybe we should have released those solutions into Europe a little bit earlier, but we didn't. So now we're -- but now we're pedal to the metal as it were marketing, selling and successfully implemented in Europe.\nOperator: We don't have any questions on the line, Mr. Eddie Capel, please continue for the final remarks.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Very good. Thank you, May. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. As you can tell, we're quite pleased with our performance in 2020. We're very excited about 2021 and in the next few years. We think it's going to be a very exciting time for Manhattan Associates. So we'll look forward to reporting out on Q1 in about 90 days. And in the meantime, everybody stays safe. And thank you for your time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our fourth quarter 2020 results and discuss our outlook and guidance for 2021. Also, given our journey toward being a cloud-first company, the long-term nature of our newer SaaS contracts and the visibility and momentum that we're seeing, we thought it might be helpful to provide you with our initial thinking around a 3-year trajectory of our business in terms of RPO, cloud revenue, and adjusted operating margins through 2023. So, we'll cover that a bit later. But for the quarter, Manhattan reported Q4 revenue of $147 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.45, both of which exceeded our expectations. Broad revenue outperformance across our business lines, combined with a continued focus on expense management, once again drove earnings leverage for the quarter. Fortunately for Manhattan, our business is entering 2021 with accelerating velocity and growing opportunities. Now 2020 was a very successful year for Manhattan Associates, arguably the best year ever in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic. Beyond the numbers, 2020 was a benchmark year of resolve, performance, and growth for our employees and our customers. We strengthened our company significantly in 2020 and have substantially improved our market leadership position. In May, we launched our cloud-native Manhattan Active Warehouse Management solution, which we believe is the most significant advancement in WMS technology in over a decade. And the market reaction to this new product has been equally impressive with already a double-digit number of deals closed to date, and our pipeline is growing. In fact, we signed the largest Manhattan Active Warehouse Management deal to date and the enthusiasm from both new and existing customers for Manhattan Active WM is certainly surpassing our original expectations. At no time in our company's history is our product strategy being in complete synergistic alignment with customer and market demand. Across our full suite of cloud solutions, we're seeing solid and growing demand. Pipeline bookings are at record levels, with about 90% of the pipe consisting of cloud opportunities, and net new potential customers representing almost 40% of the demand. We entered 2021 with increasing momentum and greater visibility because there's a growing market need for modern, adaptable supply chain, inventory and omnichannel products, and that collection of cloud-native solutions positions us well. Our unified platform is industry-leading and provides our customers with the ability to efficiently adapt to changes in consumer behavior, while simultaneously helping elevate the entire consumer experience. Simply put, our commitment to investing in market-leading innovation and focus on customer success strategically positions us for long-term sustainable growth. Demand for our supply chain and omnichannel products and services has been pretty solid, and while the near-term timing of and continued pace of economic recovery remains somewhat unclear, recent signs have been encouraging. And as such, we're raising the 2021 full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance that we provided on our Q3 call. And furthermore, our dedication to innovation remains. We expect to invest nearly $90 million in research and development this year, even with a potentially choppy macro backdrop. And as I mentioned earlier, with our business visibility strengthening, later in the call, Dennis will provide details of how we see our 3-year trajectory. He'll provide you with guidance for 2021 and guideposts with much broader ranges for '22 and 2023. Dennis will provide insights into how we see RPO, cloud revenue, and adjusted operating margins shaping up for the next 3 years. And with RPO as the leading indicator of cloud revenue performance, our objective is to exit 2023 with roughly $1 billion in remaining performance obligation, representing a 3-year CAGR of about 45%. Now on the sales front, competitive win rates remained strong at about 70% as our innovation is being recognized as the best in the industry. In Q4, about 20% of our licensing cloud deals closed were from new customers. From a vertical perspective, retail, consumer goods, food and beverage and grocery drove more than 50% of our cloud and license revenue in the quarter. Now regarding services, we conducted over 100 go-lives in the quarter and anticipate a return to services revenue growth in 2021. While the rate of this services growth will be influenced by the broader economic recovery, demand for our expertise remains high, and we're aggressively hiring talent to meet the forecasted demand. And more broadly, we expect to hire 200 to 300 new associates company-wide in 2021, including R&D, cloud ops, sales, and marketing. If I can, let me provide you just a few specifics on some of our product innovation. First, I'd like to start by providing a quick update on one of the biggest product launches in Manhattan's history, Manhattan Active Warehouse Management. As you recall, we announced Manhattan Active WM in Q2 at our Virtual Annual User Conference. And since then, we've seen strong market interest and adoption, frankly surpassing even our own ambitious goals. While the customer mix has undoubtedly been affected by the global pandemic, I'm happy to report that we're seeing broad demand across many industries and all parts of the globe. In fact, we now have customers spanning 10 different industries in eight different countries. They're all currently implementing Manhattan Active WM. And with a very busy and aggressive go-live schedule lined up for 2021, our selling and implementation teams are at full strength across the geographies that drive the majority of our revenue, and we're seeing a nice pipeline for Manhattan Active WM too as we head into 2021. And in addition to a healthy balance we're seeing across geographies and industries, our Manhattan Active WM implementations strike a nice balance between existing customers and entirely new, net new. Of our Manhattan Active WM projects in-flight right now, we're seeing about a 50-50 split between those 2 categories. And as you recall, one of the key benefits of Manhattan Active WM is it that it's completely versionless. It's updated in the background for our customers with zero downtime. And we provide them with new feature functions every single quarter. In fact, since we announced this new solution in May, we've already added a host of new innovative capabilities in the past couple of quarterly releases. Now turning to Transportation Management. We closed out 2020 with some great wins and further progress on our goal of evolving TMS at Manhattan Associates from being a great domestic business for us being a truly global business. And to that end, we now have a live customer in Europe successfully using TMS and have additional projects in-flight in that region. When we continue to see the pipeline build in a number of countries across EMEA, we're building capacity to support those projects in expectations of their closing in 2021. And our cloud TMS solution continues to compete very effectively, both home and abroad. Now I'll close my product update this afternoon with our Manhattan Active Omni Solution Suite. We've just completed taking our customers through their third retail peak season of Manhattan Active Omni. And as you would guess, we processed an all-time record high number of orders, shipments and payments. The ongoing channel shift from bricks-and-mortar to digital commerce continues to benefit our omnichannel business and as we help more customers successfully capture and deliver on their direct-to-consumer orders.  Our particular note this year was the surge in store-related digital activity. Almost all of our Manhattan Active Omni customers use that technology to power a pretty vibrant ship-from-store program. But now, we're seeing an increasing number of those customers actually prefer to ship from their stores, actually up 300% over 2009 retail peak. And this is in order to speed up customer delivery and manage the parcel network constraints much more effectively. And as you might imagine, in-store pickup programs continue to accelerate at a rapid rate, with activity both in curbside and traditional store pickup. Both the in-store pickup and curbside delivery programs clearly are here to stay, and we continue to leverage our advanced version of technology to provide these kinds of innovative solutions to our customers at a very rapid rate. On a related note, by the way, one of the byproducts that are booming digital business is, unfortunately, very often, booming volumes and returns. And all of our customers grapple with this so-called reverse logistics problem. But fortunately, Manhattan offers technology to optimize that full life cycle with best-in-class capabilities in the contact center, digital self-service for the end consumer. And purpose-design capabilities for the distribution center for processing the physical goods. And while the volume of returns in many ways is inevitable, a greater customer experience isn't always the same. So delivering that great experience to returns and exchanges at high-volume really does take a fully integrated order management system and WMS to effectively process those returns. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and discuss our outlook, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before moving into Q&A. Dennis? Terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well, look, we're pleased with our 2020 performance, and we're committed to driving operational and financial results as we progress toward our 3-year financial targets. And as we do so, we're continuing to innovate in advance of market demand, leveraging our technical and demand expertise in order to provide our customers solutions that position them for success in a dynamic and rapidly changing world. With the convergence of our cloud strategy and the customer demand tightening, we see no shortage of opportunities to expand our addressable market while further strengthening our competitive position. And to wrap up, I want to thank all of our employees globally. Your relentless dedication and commitment to our customers' ongoing success is inspirational. And it's a key differentiator in driving long-term sustainable growth for our company and for our shareholders. And your resourcefulness and perseverance in the face of a worldwide pandemic has resulted in what I believe to be our best year ever. So thank you, and May, we're now ready to take any questions. Yes. I would say the answer to that is definitely yes, Terry. At the end of the day, I do feel like that the -- a lot of the elevated conversations come from the fact that a sizable portion of our suite these days is driving revenue for our customers. The WMS and the TMS, obviously, great facilitators and imperative parts of the supply chain network and the business operations. At the end of the day, they are cost-savers, right? They are cost-savers. And -- but when you cross the bridge and start talking about omnichannel solutions, point-of-sale solutions, store solutions to really drive revenue growth, that's really when the conversations begin to elevate even higher into the CEO office. Yes. We feel great. Really terrific about the sales capacity. We think we're very well aligned to be able to meet those growth rates. We are continuing to selectively hire the best of the best in the supply chain market and so forth. But that is -- as sales capacity will certainly not be an inhibitor to the growth trajectory that we laid out, I'm very confident about that. I think it's all of those 3 things, and certainly the visibility that we have now, selling the full suite of solutions, the enthusiasm that we've seen for Manhattan Active WM. And no question, I think over the last 3 quarters at least, there has been some reticence on our part to do too much predicting of the future. I think, along with everybody else on the planet, we optimistically see some light on the horizon in terms of the situation that we have with the pandemic and the economic recovery, so feel a little more comfortable talking about our future trajectory. No. No, not really, Joe. There's still a huge amount of opportunity for upsell and cross-sell across the suite of solutions. The ramp, we've seen the -- say, ramp accelerate, I'm not sure if that's the right term, but it seems to ramp phenomenal increase as we've introduced where Manhattan Active WM, right, because it by nature is sort of distributed. We service Tier 1 as you know. Many, many of our customers have 5, 10, even 20 distribution centers across the planet. And it takes time to roll out all of those, again, 10, 20, or 50 distribution centers. And so that's why in this particular WM space, you see a little bit more of an acute, if that's the right word, acute ramp philosophy. I think we see interest. But Joe, in all reality, we've been in the market for 6 months with Manhattan Active WM so it would be wrong of me to say that we're starting to see that really be a very popular phenomenon. Obviously, it's our strategy, but we're about 6 months in. There is certainly is interest as customers acquire either Manhattan Active WM Manhattan and Active Omni. Certainly, they've got the future in mind, but we're not yet seeing those larger multiproduct deals that you speak of. Yun, it's a great question, interesting one. But at this particular juncture, we're not breaking out RPO by product line. So I really can't give you any guidance there. Yes. Same acquisition strategy that we've had, Yun, that frankly has not born fruit for us. The number 1 use of our capital is to drive intrinsic innovation. And for us, that is represented by research and development. We certainly are very interested in acquisitions, but we've got a reasonably high bar, right? They've got to be gap fillers for us and really be able to give us the ability to be able to expand our reach. And our current strategy really drives us into what is essentially white space, okay? The solutions that we're developing don't really exist out there. So it's very hard for us to invoke an acquisition strategy of that type. Again, we are very interested in the right opportunities. But in the absence of acquisition opportunities, as the Board has authorized here in January, we will reinstitute a share buyback program. Yes, sure. Well, in terms of the first question, yes, stores have become open again, foot traffic has begun to pick up a little bit. What we've seen is this, again, this synergistic alignment of our strategy and market demands. Simply put, for the last number of years, frankly, we've been banging the table talking about the benefits of omnichannel strategies, buy anywhere, ship from anywhere, sell from anywhere and all of those capabilities. And clearly, some of our customers have taken up those opportunities and said -- and essentially said, yes, those are interesting capabilities, and we think we'd like to offer them to our consumers. What's happened, and those include buy online, pickup in store, curbside pickup, buy online return from store, all of those capabilities. What we've seen happen in the last 6 months or so, interestingly, is consumers are now essentially demanding those capabilities. It's no longer the retailers saying, we've got this if you want it. Consumers are essentially saying look, if I can't buy online, come and pick up the store or pick up at the curbside, I'm not going to shop with you. So we're seeing a pull versus a push, right, of those capabilities. And we do believe that BOPUS curbside, ROPUS, return at store, all of those capabilities are announced here to stay and going to be very prevalent going forward. So we're excited about that.  With regard to the specific question you asked about point of sale, there is certainly a growing interest, right? We really do feel like the point-of-sale -- our point of sale, go-to-market initiatives in 2020 is kind of a gap year, right, for obvious reasons. There are a lot of stores closed. But as they reopen and stores are continuing to become more multifunction, more multifunction, more multifunction that old traditional glorified calculator in the corner of the store doesn't get the job done when you've got all of these different capabilities if you got to handle inside the retail stores. So certainly, we're seeing interest and conversation pick up in that space. You mean why are the ranges so broad? Yes. Well, it's 3 years out.

Otherwise, you'll be the Apple Newton, right? There was a little ahead of its time there. So we've got to pace that out, but we've got a long list of capabilities that we think will bring real value to the market. So no plans for any slowdown in R&D investment, Brian. Yes. Yes, definitely a different profile, Manhattan Active Omni and Manhattan Active WM. Manhattan Active Omni, sort of that singular corporate application where all orders are flowing through. And as we've talked about, distribution centers tend to be, by definition, distributed around the world, and it takes time to get those systems rolled out. So that's why you see that kind of that ramp profile change. Not a big impact on margin. We've got this WM rollout strategy, then to a pretty good science. We ramp infrastructure accordingly.

And in the fast-moving space that we're operating in a supply chain, that can be quite detrimental to business process, velocity, customer service and an overall efficiency of the business.  So number one, head and shoulders is access to innovation.

But we chose to release a TMS solution for sale in Europe because we're ready, trained -- hired and trained a workforce. There is no question that offering it in the cloud added, provided a little bit of simplicity into the program. So we didn't need all of the technical resources in market and so forth. But of course, we had to do some product enhancements to be able to support those international markets as well. So all of those things come together, and we're seeing a nice growing demand. As I said, we've got one nice customer live over there. We signed a couple of more there in-flight of implementation and interest is certainly gaining. We might look back in the rearview mirror and say, maybe we should have released those solutions into Europe a little bit earlier, but we didn't. So now we're -- but now we're pedal to the metal as it were marketing, selling and successfully implemented in Europe. Okay. Very good. Thank you, May. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. As you can tell, we're quite pleased with our performance in 2020. We're very excited about 2021 and in the next few years. We think it's going to be a very exciting time for Manhattan Associates. So we'll look forward to reporting out on Q1 in about 90 days. And in the meantime, everybody stays safe. And thank you for your time."

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Eddie. Everyone strap on your suspenders. I have a lot of information to cover here. So as Eddie mentioned, fourth quarter total revenue was $147 million, down 4% over the prior year, exceeding our guidance. Full year 2020 total revenue of $586 million was down 5% compared to 2019, as you know, solely due to COVID. Q4 adjusted earnings per share was $0.45. GAAP earnings per share was $0.32 with stock-based compensation accounting for the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS. Cloud revenue for the quarter was $23 million, up 9% sequentially and 46% over prior year. For full year 2020, cloud revenue increased 70% to $80 million. For the first quarter 2021, we estimate cloud revenue to be approximately $24 million, up 39% over 2020. For full year 2021, we estimate cloud revenue to be in the range of $108 million to $110 million, growing at about 36.5% at the midpoint and accounting for approximately 85% of total software revenue, up from less than 50% in 2019. Starting with Q2, we expect cloud revenue to grow roughly at $2 million sequentially per quarter for the balance of 2021. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, for the quarter totaled $309 million, up 20% sequentially and 80% over prior year. Recall, RPO is the leading proxy for our cloud revenue performance and represents the value of contractual obligations required to be performed, otherwise referred to as unearned revenue or bookings. For Manhattan, this disclosed value represents our cloud bookings value of unearned revenue under non-cancelable contracts greater than 1 year. Contracts with a non-cancelable term of 1 year or less are excluded from the reported amount. As Eddie previously highlighted, demand and pipeline growth for our cloud solutions continue to be strong from both new and existing customers. Reflective of this strength, we anticipate 2021 RPO to be in the range of $450 million to $550 million, up from our prior estimate of $385 million to $390 million, representing growth of approximately 60% at the $500 million midpoint. One important point on flow-through from RPO to cloud revenue. As previously stated, as you know, our performance continues to depend on the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter. Furthermore, some customers have longer implementation cycles, associated with large projects requiring a multiyear annual subscription ramp built into the contract term. For example, the record Manhattan Active Warehouse Management deal closed in the quarter will have much higher levels of contracted and recognized revenue in the out years of the contract compared to year 1. These revenue ramps are common for larger cloud deals and with larger opportunities becoming more prevalent in our pipeline, we expect RPO growth to accelerate first, followed by a gradual steepening ramp in cloud revenue growth, providing us with very good visibility into future subscription revenue. Regarding license revenue, Q4 was roughly $10 million. Overall, for 2020, license totaled $38 million and was down 22% over prior year as our full suite of cloud solutions have come online. We expect license attrition to accelerate in 2021, with license revenue declining about 50% or $18 million, over 2020. For full year 2021, we estimate license revenue to be in the range of $18 million to $22 million, averaging about $5 million per quarter. As a yard marker for cloud demand, license will be about 3% of total revenue exiting 2021. Shifting to maintenance. Revenue for the quarter totaled $39 million, up 2% versus the prior year on strong cash collections. For the full year, maintenance revenue declined 1% to $148 million. The decline primarily reflects demand from our WMS installed base, converting to cloud subscription and lower license revenue, which we expect this trend to continue in 2021 and beyond. Our full year 2021 maintenance revenue forecast is $138 million to $142 million, representing an $8 million or 5.5% decline. For Q1 and all subsequent quarters, we estimate maintenance revenue to be approximately $35 million per quarter. Turning to services. In line with our expectations, Professional Services revenue for the quarter totaled $71 million, down 18% year-over-year. Excluding build travel, services were down approximately 14%. As discussed on our Q3 call, we expect our Services segment to return to growth in 2021 and build from our Q1 results. As a reminder, Q1 2020 was a record comp quarter with subsequent quarter run rates dramatically impacted by the pandemic. So for the first quarter, we are targeting services revenue in the $74 million to $76 million range, down 14% over prior year, but up 4% to 7% sequentially over Q4 2020. On a year-over-year basis, we estimate Q2 revenue growth of about 14%, Q3 about 17% to 18% and 15% to 16% in Q4. For 2021, we are targeting a services revenue range of $315 million to $336 million, representing 7% midpoint growth dictated by the pace and cadence of economic recovery. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 52.7%. The better-than-expected result was driven by revenue performance and cloud operating leverage. We expect Q1 2021 subscription, maintenance and services margin to be approximately 50.2% and full year 2021 to be 51.3%. With historical seasonality, we expect first half to be approximately 51.2% and second half margin slightly higher at 51.5%, with Q4 at 50.2% accounting for retail peak seasonality. Now turning to operating income and margin. Q4 adjusted operating income totaled $38 million, equating to an adjusted operating margin of 25.6%. The better-than-expected result was driven by broad revenue outperformance combined with continued expense management. For Q1 2021, we are estimating adjusted operating income of $26 million to $28 million and an operating margin range of 18.8% to 19.2%, with a 19% midpoint. That's precision booming right there. For full year 2021, we are estimating an operating income range of $122 million to $134 million, that's full year, with a midpoint of $128 million and an operating margin range of 20.5% to 21.5%, with a 21% midpoint. Four primary drivers for our investment in our operating margin. Number one, hiring to meet growth demand; number two, cloud-driven decline in license and maintenance revenue; number three, the reversal of prior cost actions taken in 2020 due to COVID; and number four, continued strategic investments in innovation and cloud transition. As we continue to grow and scale the business, we are confident in our ability to make strong progress on achieving the rule of 40 over time. Moving on to income taxes. Our Q4 adjusted effective income tax rate was 22%, with our full year rate at 23.1%. We expect our Q1 and full year 2021 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. We expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 21.5% for the full year and 7% in Q1 due to tax benefits on stock vesting. Regarding our capital structure. In January, our Board of Directors lifted the suspension of our share repurchase program and authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million. For 2021, we are estimating 65.0 million diluted shares outstanding with 64.5 million diluted shares for Q1, which does not assume any share repos. Turning to cash. We closed the quarter with cash and investments of $205 million and zero debt. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled $114 million. Q4 cash flow from operations totaled $38 million, up 10% over 2020. And full year operating cash flow totaled $141 million, down just 4% over 2020. Finally, full year capital expenditures totaled $3 million. And for 2021, we estimate CapEx investment to be in the range of about $6 million to $10 million. That covers 2020. Now I'll provide full year 2021 guidance and 2022, 2023 guidepost. Then we'll turn it back to Eddie for his closing remarks. Let's go big picture. Manhattan's cloud transition is now entering its fourth year. We continue to accelerate investments in innovation with customer demand validating our strategy. Our cloud solutions are impacting all of our major revenue lines. That's cloud, license, maintenance and services now driving 50-plus percent of our overall total revenue and growing. The underlying fundamentals of our total revenue model is shifting dramatically. 2021 will be another record year for cloud revenue and RPO, driving approximately 85% of total software revenue while fueling services pipeline and revenue growth. In 2021, we will absorb a $27 million drag on total revenue masking our growth by 5 percentage points as license attrits in favor of cloud and maintenance revenue declines as installed base customers convert to our cloud solutions. Our total revenue yard markers for success are cloud revenue, RPO bookings and services revenue. Our guidance calls for 4% total revenue growth. To best gauge overall underlying revenue growth of our company, we compare total revenue, ex license and maintenance, which we expect to be 10% to 15% growth in 2021 with a midpoint of 12.5%. By comparison, 2020 was down 5% over 2019. Now for guidance. For total revenue, we expect a range of $595 million to $625 million. First half, second half total revenue splits are 48% first half, 52% second half. For Q1 2021, we estimate our total revenue range to be $141 million to $146 million, with a midpoint of $143 million. For operating profit and margin, as previously highlighted, we are estimating an operating income range of $122 million to $134 million, with a midpoint of $128 million, and an operating margin range of 20.5% to 21.5% with a 21% midpoint. For earnings per share, our adjusted EPS target is $1.44 to $1.59 per share, with a 47%, 53% first half-second half split. Our GAAP EPS range is estimated to be $0.96 to $1.11. For Q1, our adjusted EPS estimate is $0.31 to $0.33 and GAAP EPS range is $0.25 to $0.27. That covers our 2021 guidance. So lastly, I'll summarize our 2022 and 2023 guideposts that should better assist investors' assessment of our future cloud growth and earnings trajectory. So entering 2021, visibility into the business is strengthening and benefiting from over 3 years of data in our cloud transition, coupled with the revenue ramp deals becoming more common. As such, we are providing 2022 and 2023 directional guidepost for RPO, cloud revenue and adjusted operating margin. With revenue ramp deals becoming more prevalent, we expect RPO to accelerate, followed by a gradual steepening ramp in cloud revenue. As such, you will see 2022 RPO growth exceed cloud revenue growth. In 2023, we expect cloud revenue growth to outpace RPO as we benefit from our subscription revenue ramp. Regarding adjusted operating margin, we are forecasting adding 100 basis points annually from 2021 forward to '23, with the objective of driving long-term sustainable double-digit top line growth in top quartile operating margins. So here are the metrics. For 2022, we are targeting RPO of $625 million to $775 million with a $700 million midpoint, equaling 40% growth over 2021; cloud revenue of $135 million to $150 million with $143 million midpoint, equaling 31% growth; an adjusted operating margin of about 22% at the midpoint. For 2023, we are targeting RPO of $850 million to $1.1 billion with a $950 million midpoint, equaling 36% growth over 2022; cloud revenue of $190 million to $215 million with a $203 million midpoint, equaling 42% growth; an adjusted operating margin of about 23% at the midpoint. We will update 2022 and 2023 annually. And as Eddie mentioned, we are targeting RPO to approach $1 billion by the end of 2023, equating to a 3-year RPO CAGR of 40% to 50%. Our 3-year cloud revenue CAGR estimate is 34% to 39%, reflecting the impact of ramp deals in our RPO. So that covers the financial update. Thank you very much, and back to Eddie for some closing comments. Yes. The yard marker is going to be the full year target, Terry, at $450 million to the $550 million. Each quarter, we're going to give an RPO update, so you'll be able to see that progression. But suffice to say, we're targeting a pretty strong growth rate at about 60% at the midpoint. Yes. I would say Active WM is -- it's a mix. So it probably was a subtle comment, but now we have the full suite of solutions in the market. So Omni was a little more challenged, as you can imagine in 2020, but we're seeing nice pickup there in the pipeline. And AWM, strong as well. We're seeing solid pipeline with TMS. So it's -- the pipeline has got good diversity to it. Hey, Matt, let me piggyback on that. It's in large part, going into our fourth year, we have great visibility, forward visibility into our pipeline. Number two, your question about whether or not there's demand for cloud, 90% of our pipeline bookings is for cloud. And as you can imagine, licenses, as I commented in the script, is attriting pretty rapidly. We'll exit 2021 and our estimate is this license will be 3% of total revenue in a 4-year transition."

[Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Eddie Capel, CEO; Dennis Story, CFO; and Matt Humphries, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Humphries, you may begin your conference.\nMatt Humphries: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements, regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. We caution that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance, and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019 and the risk factor discussion in that report, as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note in particular that uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Terrific. Thanks, Matt. Well, good afternoon everybody and thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter 2020 results, discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year and provide at least some initial thinking around 2021. So for the quarter, Manhattan reported total revenue of $150 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.51. Both of these exceeded our expectations. Broad revenue outperformance across -- really all of our business lines, combined with a continued focus on expense management, also drove strong earnings leverage in the quarter. Now, using our markets and our customer base as reference points. We're starting to see some modest improvement in the global macro economic situation. Whilst, clearly there is still a very long way to go in terms of reaching back to a normal operating environment, we are encouraged by the level of activity we're seeing in our pipeline. Specifically with our new Manhattan Active Warehouse Management solution. In fact we closed a record multi-million dollar Manhattan Active WM deal in Q3 with a large national beverage distributor. And while early, we're off to a solid start in Q4 as well. And as such, we're raising our full-year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance to reflect our views for the balance of the year. Additionally, despite the turmoil globally, we remain committed to organic growth. We're on track to invest nearly $80 million into research and development this year, furthering our competitive positioning through new innovation, while growing our addressable market. And through our ongoing engagement with customers and prospects, we continue to see business fundamentally rethinking the future state of their supply chains, distribution footprints and omni-channel commerce strategies. Some of this rethinking is being driven by consumer demand with nine out of 10 consumers wanting our omni-channel experience with seamless service levels between sales channels. Other reasons are more growth oriented, as average omni-channel customers spend 4% more in-store and 10% more online than single-channel consumers. These changes will now -- that require a thoughtful approach to implementing modern, agile and scalable software solutions. The growing demands placed on legacy systems and software and no longer are going to be suited to a multi-channel digital world. And we feel the long-term opportunity set in front of us based on these favorable demand trends is robust. And we'll continue to provide meaningful opportunity for us to grow and scale our business. And as a result of these asymmetrical tail of headwinds, coupled with our market leading solutions and applications, we see our global pipeline opportunities trending favorably. Our recently released Manhattan Active Warehouse Management solution is driving very positive market interest, validation for the countless mandates and the many millions of dollars in R&D that we've invested in developing the product over the past several years. And at the end of the third quarter, over 80% of our global bookings pipeline is comprised of cloud opportunities and about 45% of our deal opportunities continue to be represented by net new logos globally. And this is certainly should provide ample opportunity to land new business for us, while we also focus on expanding our relationships with existing customers and speaking of customers. You may recall a few weeks ago, we announced that part of a very rigorous selection process L'Oreal, the world's leading beauty company chose to implement a Manhattan Active WMS solution across its distribution footprint globally. L'Oreal was looking for an agile, cloud native solution that could provide the necessary adaptability and scalability to their business demands, as it continues to grow with a positive trajectory. We're obviously honored and humbled by their choice, and our professional services teams certainly is looking forward to implementing this solution into this -- into their distribution network over the next several years. Now regarding services, despite the challenges that have been closed by the global pandemic, we are delivering on our promises to our customers around the world. In the third quarter, we conducted 161 go lives globally, once again showcasing our flexibility and expertise at delivering technical implementation work through really any delivery channel. Now it is worth maybe reminding you that billed travel, which is margin neutral, but contributes to the overall services revenue was about 5% of a headwind year-over-year to our services revenue growth. Now turning to sales and marketing, our teams remain very active and engaged, pursuing opportunities across our installed base, while simultaneously moving brand new business opportunities forward across all of our product portfolio. Of note, we've recently hosted EMEA Exchange Connect, our virtual customer conference for that particular region. And feedback from the conference participants was overwhelmingly positive and participation from our partners and customers was very well received. Our competitive win rates remain very strong at 70 plus percent against head-to-head competition, with about 25% of our license and cloud deals representing net new customers in the quarter. Verticals that collectively drove more than 50% of our cloud and license revenues in the quarter were retail, consumer goods, government, food and beverage and grocery. Now, if I can. I'll just turn the discussion little toward our product pipeline. Last quarter I do updated you on the launch of arguably the most important product in Manhattan's history, Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, the next generation of Warehouse Management software. We announced this new cloud native version of WMS at our virtual user conference in May of this year. And today, I'd like to provide an update on Manhattan Active WM along really three key dimensions: customer success, new customer acquisition and ongoing product development. So, let's start with firstly with customer success. So you'll recall, now that at the time of launch Pet Supplies Plus was already live on Manhattan Active WM and since then they've reported some really exciting accomplishments, they're shipping record volumes using our application, the on-boarding times for new associates, who have been cut in half, using our all-new mobile app for the distribution center associates and they have actually already taken the second site live and in the process of planning to turn-on a third site as well. And I'm happy to report that Q3 was a strong quarter for customer acquisition, we now have several additional projects in flight across a variety of industries and regions. And we are seeing strong activity in the grocery, food and beverage, health and beauty sectors with Manhattan Active Warehouse Management. Our message of a next generation versionless cloud native WMS, certainly seems to be resonating well with the market. And finally, I'm happy to report that per our plan, we shipped our first quarterly follow-on release of Manhattan Active WM on time. Our 2020.3 release hit our customers environments in August delivering additional innovation and functional capability and we're on track to deliver our 20.4 release next month in November as well. So in short, we're off to a great start executing on our vision of providing the industry's only cloud native fully extensible, versionless warehouse management system. And we continue to compete pretty effectively in the TMS space as well, evidenced by our signing among other deals, a large TMS contract in the quarter with a global distributor, the combination of our best-in-class optimization technology, international capabilities and strong sales and delivery teams, we're really the keys to this win. And we continue to make progress outside of supply chain execution as well. This quarter, Q3 we introduced Manhattan Active Allocation as part of our suite of inventory optimization solutions, built on our Manhattan Active Application Architecture. This new Allocation solution is purpose designed and built for the fashion and apparel businesses. Historically speaking, our inventory solutions have been very strong for hardline replenishment based businesses, where sophisticated demand forecast and mathematically optimize replenishment plans are key. But the world of fast fashion is quite different, it requires a different set of technology for calculating how much inventory to forward position in each store in any given season. And Manhattan Active Allocation solved this inventory positioning problem and it's -- crucially it's solves it with omni-channel in mind, ensuring both digital and standard footfall demand are particularly well served. And finally, I'd like to close out my product related marks with a quick update on Manhattan Active Omni, our collection of cloud native order management, customer engagement and store technologies. This quarter we announced interactive inventory, really significant advancement for our order management customers, interactive inventory provides ultra high-speed delivery date projections for digital customers regardless of where they are in the buying journey. And unlike other solutions, which rely -- really on historical averages for projected delivery time, interactive inventory factors the customer's delivery location, other items in their cart, the current position of every unit of inventory into the network and the merchants optimize fulfillment plan for that eventual order. The interactive inventory combines really everything that set us apart historically, a curated view of enterprise inventory, the industry's best fulfillment optimization algorithm, cutting edge cloud-based technology and access to real-time operational data all while making that delivery promise to the consumer. And speaking of delivery, I am proud to report that in the quarter, we also took a leading footwear brand live in six weeks on our order management and store fulfillment applications. This particular customer who is looking to enable both standard pickup in-store and curbside pickup with time to spare before the holiday season. And our professional services organization really delivered for them, and neither live with pickup and curbside across the U.S. and Canada and they're beginning to roll these capabilities are internationally as well. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance, discuss our updated 2020 full-year guidance and provide you with our initial view of 2021, and then I'll close our prepared remarks today with a brief summary. Before we move into Q&A. So, Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. As mentioned, third quarter total revenue was $150 million, down 8% over prior year, due pretty much solely to COVID-19. Our total revenue estimate for the fourth quarter is a range of $135 million to $140 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.51 in the quarter. GAAP earnings per share was $0.39 with stock-based compensation accounting for the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS. Our adjusted earnings per share target for the fourth quarter is $0.32 within a range of $0.30 to $0.34. Starting with cloud, revenue for the quarter was $21.1 million, up 14% sequentially and up 48% year-over-year, despite a tough comp due to our Q3 2019 FEMA cloud deal. We signed two new Manhattan Active Warehouse Management deals in the third quarter, both global Tier 1 customers and continue to see strong pipeline demand for our cloud solutions with notable strength in Manhattan Active WM, Manhattan Active Omni and TMS solutions. About 50% of our deals in the quarter came from Active DM products and over 20% of our bookings were from new customers. For Q4, we estimate our cloud revenue will be about $22 million, which represents about 40% growth year-over-year. For the full-year, we estimate our cloud revenue will be $78 million to $79 million, up 68% year-over-year from the midpoint. License revenue was solid in the quarter at $13.2 million, well above our expectations, as several Q4 pipeline opportunities accelerated into Q3. Overall license is down 28% year-to-date and continues to attrite as strong demand for our solutions continues to shift to cloud. We signed three $1 million plus deals in the quarter with roughly 30% of our license deals coming from new customers. For the fourth quarter, we expect between $4 million and $5 million in license revenue. And for the full-year, we now estimate license revenue will be approximately $33 million to $34 million. Of course, as we've pointed out in our release and earlier in the call, uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic could affect our performance against our estimates. Cloud and license software mix will be approximately 70% cloud to 30% license for the full-year with total software revenue of $111 million to $113 million, up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. A record number, despite a 31% or $15 million decline in license revenue versus 2019. Turning to bookings. As we've discussed remaining performance obligation or RPO is the leading proxy for our cloud bookings performance and represents the value of contractual obligations required to be performed otherwise referred to as unearned revenue or bookings. Our RPO for the quarter totaled $257 million, up 69% over prior year and at 14% sequentially. We now expect that our year-end RPO will fall within a range of $275 million to $290 million, driven by booking strength in cloud, particularly with Manhattan Active WM. For Manhattan, this disclosed value represents our cloud bookings value of unearned revenue under non-cancelable contracts greater than one-year. Contracts with a non-cancelable term of one year or less are excluded from the reported amount. One last point on license and cloud. Our performance continues to depend on the number and relative value of large deals we closed in any quarter. Further some customers have longer implementation cycles associated with large projects requiring a multi-year annual subscription, ramp built into the contract term. As an example for a five year contract, the ramp results in year five of contracted revenue being significantly larger than year one. In the near-term as Manhattan scales large ramp deals will impact sequential and year-over-year revenue growth percentages. Now shifting to maintenance. Revenue for the quarter totaled $37.3 million, down 1% versus the prior year. Our customer retention rates remain strong at greater than 95%-plus. And for the fourth quarter, we estimate our maintenance revenue will be between $36 million and $37 million and for full-year 2020, our estimate is $145.5 million. Turning to services. Our professional services revenue for the quarter totaled $73.5 million, down 20% year-over-year as expected. Again, I would like to point out that excluding billed travel, were down about 15% year-over-year. We expect near-term services revenue trends will be tied to the pace and degree of global economic improvement. And we estimate our services revenue for Q4 will be approximately $71 million. And our full-year 2020 services revenue will be in the range of $303 million to $305 million. At the midpoint, this is really difficult math, but $304 million, services will be down about 16% versus 2019. Excluding billed travel, services revenue was down 12%. These estimates include our expected seasonal fourth quarter sequential decline over Q3, due to retail peak season. Regarding consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin. For the quarter, we generated 53% margins, driven by continued operating leverage in cloud. Our fourth quarter estimate is approximately 51.9% about 100 basis points higher than 2019. Our full-year estimate is approximately 51.4%. Turning to operating income and margin. Q3 adjusted operating income totaled $44.1 million with an adjusted operating margin of 29.4%, driven by higher license revenue performance, combined with very strong expense management. For the fourth quarter, we estimate our adjusted operating margin to be within a range of 19.2% to 20.2%. Our Q3 adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.5%, we estimate our fourth quarter rate to be 24% and full-year tax rate will be approximately 23.6%. Regarding our capital structure, our share repurchase program remains suspended and our repurchase authority limit remains at $50 million. We continue to assess the appropriate timing for a resumption of buyback activities, dictated primarily by broader macroeconomic improvement. For the fourth quarter and full-year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 64.4 million shares. Turning to cash, we closed the quarter with cash and investments of $166 million and zero debt, that's right, $166 million and zero debt. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled $113 million, down 5% sequentially on just timing of revenue recognition. Q3 cash flow from operations totaled $42 million, up 6% over prior year. Year-to-date, operating cash flow totaled $103 million, down just 8%. And finally, capital expenditures totaled $200,000 in Q3, we estimate full-year capital expenditures to be between $3 million and $5 million. Now turning to our updated annual guidance, we continue to model and review multiple scenarios in order to provide investors with our best estimate of financial performance for the remainder of the year. Of note, there are certain external factors that are out of our control and may produce results that are different from expectations. So specifically for 2020 annual guidance, our full-year total revenue range is now expected to be between $574 million to $579 million. Our target objective is $576.5 million in total revenue versus prior guidance of $562 million. Our full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share range is expected to be between a $1.62 to $1.66, our target objective midpoint is $1.64, compared to our previous guidance midpoint of $1.56. Our full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share range is expected to be $1.23 to $1.27 with a midpoint of $1.25. And we expect our full-year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. That covers the 2020 guidance. Before discussing our preliminary 2021 targets, we want to remind you that the views we have today are subject to a variety of factors that may manifest themselves over the upcoming months. And hence, are subject to change, so appropriately conservative for the environment in which we are operating. We expect to provide formal 2021 guidance on our 4Q, 2020 call next year. One final note before going further, our preliminary 2021 targets reflect year-over-year growth rates that are based on the midpoint of our updated 2020 guidance for the respective metrics. So at a high level, we view 2021 currently as a tale of two halves. Specifically we expect H2 will be stronger than H1 provided an economic recovery picks up steam in the back half of the year. Our continued business transition is masking our underlying growth and value creation, due to both license are trading to cloud and global Tier 1 customers ramping up their global footprints over multiple periods. We continue to believe RPO is the best go-forward metric in tracking the progress of our transition. Our 2021 full-year total revenue range is now expected to be between $585 million to $625 million, representing a 1% to 8% year-over-year growth range. Our target objective is to achieve $605 million, representing 5% growth, excluding our declining license impact year-over-year total revenue growth is 8%. As you know Q1, 2020 was an all-time record Q1 revenue performance pre-COVID creating a tough comp for Q1 2021. We expect Q1, 2021 total revenue to be down 7% to 9% over Q1, 2020. We expect our H1 total revenue split to be about $292 million with 1% year-over-year growth given the Q1 COVID comp and H2 split to be about $313 million, this is the revenue split with a 9% growth rate. For software revenue, we are estimating $123 million to $130 million with a midpoint growth of 13%. We are targeting a $108 million to $110 million in cloud growth with midpoint growth of about 40%. Importantly, we expect license revenue to decline, almost 50% in 2021, as customers and prospects choose our cloud solutions. License revenue will be in the $15 million to $20 million range with a midpoint of $17.5 million. Regarding 2021, RPO our preliminary estimate is between $385 million to $390 million, up about 40% over 2020. And as Eddie mentioned we are off to a very good start in Q4 on strong cloud demand. With the backdrop of COVID, government elections and retail peak season in play and a second full selling quarter of Manhattan Active WM under our belt, this will certainly help us calibrate the camshafts on our RPO entering 2021. For consulting services, we are targeting $306 million to $334 million with a $320 million midpoint, representing about 5% year-over-year growth. We expect H1 revenue to be down about 3% to 5% year-over-year with Q1 being down 15% against 2020's record services comp. The rate of year-over-year growth in services will be dictated by the pace and cadence of economic recovery for the balance of 2021. And for maintenance, we are estimating $140 million to $145 million or 4% decline to flat growth year-over-year, as we expect more existing customers to convert to cloud subscriptions. That covers the critical revenue targets. Our full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share range is $1.37 to $1.54 with a midpoint of $1.46. H1 to H2 percentage splits will be 45% H1 and 55% H2 for the annual EPS splits. Q1 will be our lowest EPS quarter totaling about 21% of full-year EPS or $0.31. The primary drivers of lower year-over-year earnings per share is related to three major components. First, the continued decline of license revenue. Second, the reversal of prior cost actions we took in April of this year. And third, continued strategic investments in innovation and tooling for cloud ops to execute on the cloud growth we see in front of us. Adjusted operating margin is expected to decline year-over-year to 20% to 21%, reflecting the operating imperatives covered in our outlook for EPS. You may recall in our Q4, 2019 call, we guided to an adjusted operating margin range of 20% to 20.5% with a trough of 20%. Unfortunately in our Q1, 2020 call the pandemic required us to downshift a few gears to protect liquidity, customers and our employees without sacrificing investments in R&D. With business conditions improving, we are refocused on the same objective with 2021 now representing our margin trough. Overall, our objective is to achieve long-term sustainable double-digit top line growth with top quartile operating margins. Manhattan's effective tax rate is expected to run at approximately 24.5% subject to any changes to federal state or foreign tax legislation. And finally, we expect that our share count will be approximately $65 million, which assumes no buyback activity and either Q4 '20 or fiscal year 2021. That covers the financial update, back to Eddie for some closing comments.\nEddie Capel: Alright. Thanks, Dennis. Well, look, we're overall -- we're very pleased with our performance this quarter and well -- clearly we're operating in challenging times, we continue to focus on driving operational and financial results as we progress further on our cloud journey. With a strong business foundation, we expect to further extend our market leading position with the supply chain and omni-channel commerce solutions. And we do so, we'll be continuing to innovate to advance -- in advance of market demand, leveraging our technical and domain expertise in order to provide our customer solutions, which position them for success in a dynamically and a rapidly changing world. We certainly see no shortage of opportunities to expand our addressable market, while further strengthening our competitive position. So, in closing today's call, I did want to take a brief moment to thank all of our customers, thank our employees and our shareholders around the world for all of your patients, focus and engagement over the past seven months or so. It's been nothing short of remarkable and for one I'm grateful for it. So again I expect Manhattan will continue to push possible expanding our industry leading product portfolio, while driving revenue growth and profitable execution for years to come as we benefit from the growing tailwinds within supply chain and omni-channel commerce. So Mike, over to you. And we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities.\nTerry Tillman: Yes. Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter and the strength of the cloud WMS. Eddie, maybe, the first question just for you is, as we go back and look at historical, kind of, cycles around WMS upgrades, and we look at currently this e-commerce megatrend. Maybe could you talk about are we starting to see a WMS upgrade cycle? And if so, how is that compared to prior upgrade cycle, just would love a little -- learn a little bit more about that potential and in relationship to e-commerce?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, I mean, there's a couple of dynamics, Terry, .you pointed the e-commerce dynamic, no question that we've all seen that accelerate -- it's been accelerating for the last several years. But over the last seven months or so a real acceleration there. I think we would all agree. We don't see it turning back, you look at there at a distribution center construction, it's still very, very vibrant for sure, the need for modern facilities to the highly automated, driven with a balance of robotics and human capital, certainly drive the need for a modern flexible agile Warehouse Management System and that's where we've positioned our self. So, we've got, kind of, two dynamics going here, the growth of e-commerce, but also as you pointed out that replacement cycle in -- frankly some of the industries that have not seen strong replacement cycles, historically, particularly grocery, food and beverage that have been, pretty static from a technology -- distribution technology perspective over a number of years, now starting to see the need and driven by consumer demand to drive, through modern Warehouse Management Systems. And we feel like we're on the forefront of that. The fact that we're now delivering our Warehouse Management System versionless and in the cloud is really an added advantage, right? It's access to open near immediate, that innovation and speed of deployment in a world that certainly requires that. And as we pointed out, certainly the market enthusiasm certainly seems to be strong.\nTerry Tillman: Understood. And I guess, Dennis just a follow-up question as it relates to the guidance. When we're looking at '21, I guess, I'd like to hear a little bit more perspective, one of the prepared remarks you made was with some of these transactions in the cloud side, you're five of the relationship to be much larger than year one. So what I'm curious about, your launch cloud WMS, the native WMS cloud product in May. If you're signing large deals, whether it was in 2Q or 3Q or even 4Q. Is it safe to say there is actually just not a lot of subscription revenue impact into '21 and it's really starts to ramp more into '22. Just trying to understand, kind of, how that would phase-in. Thank you.\nDennis Story: Yes, that's correct, Terry. It will phase-in, it will actually phase-in into the first, second and third year of the contract as a general rule, but short-term, short-term drag on cloud revenue, but long-term values created for Manhattan on the go forward.\nEddie Capel: And you see that in the RPO.\nDennis Story: Yes.\nTerry Tillman: Yes. One, and then just last question is on the RPO. Has there been any duration change just how if the consumption coming along from a contracting standpoint. What is the duration like compared to prior quarters, so we can, kind of, look at that in the RPO? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Yes, thanks for saying. In the very early days, we're seeing little bit shorter contract, contract values, but it seems to be stabilizing, kind of, a roundabout five year mark on the average, Terry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Pfau from William Blair.\nMatthew Pfau: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask on -- I think a lot of retailers are getting geared up for the holiday season earlier than normal this year. Just wondering, if that dynamic had any impact on either your third quarter results or how you're sort of thinking about the fourth quarter?\nEddie Capel: No, not really Matt, frankly I agree with you. And we're certainly seeing, folks get geared up little earlier, I think we as consumers, we can expect to see some promotions and so forth earlier in the season indications are that Black Friday will be not quite and Cyber Monday will not be quite the peaks that we've seen in prior years, yet the season will start 10 days to 14 days earlier. So agree with all of that, but frankly we've really not seen much impact from that, retailer start preparing really in March and April for peak season. So that couple week variability hasn't really had much effect on us.\nMatthew Pfau: Got it. And then with the accelerated shift to e-commerce. I think, we're most likely going to see a lot of fulfillment in last mile challenges here in the upcoming holiday season. And one way to relieve that right is through BOPUS and curbside pickup, but I didn't really hear you talk too much about those in your prepared remarks, but just sort of wondering if that dynamics having any impact on your business either?\nEddie Capel: Yes. No it is, there's no question. Those capabilities are kind of associated with our omni-channel suite of solutions, their extensions thereof. I did point out there was one particular customer that saw exactly the dynamic, we're talking about and say, hey, we have got to have particularly curbside in this case, up and running well before the holiday season and we were able to implement order management in that capability in six weeks, which we were pleased about is not the only circumstance, but six weeks from start to finish is pretty impressive, we were pleased with that. But certainly BOPUS and curbside are big parts of what all retailers are looking for, given the capacity constraints that everybody expect to see in parcel and home delivery.\nMatthew Pfau: Got it. Last one for me, you guys are guiding for license to be down significantly next year. But I guess the question would be, why would anybody buy a license for WMS now down that you have the cloud version. Just sort of wondering what the rationale on the customer side would be there?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, let's see, so first of all you've got existing customers that certainly have an on-premise solution, they're frankly want to roll that out to additional facilities, they need to buy more users, because of capacity. Those types of scenarios, look, and they're all are not many, but there are a few customers that are still have our propensity for on-premise solutions, they are again few and far between there, but there are few. There are some of our other solutions, while we offer, I mean, in the cloud, our demand forecasting and inventory optimization solutions that still have a balance of cloud and on-premise demand to them. So, there is a number of reasons and the kind of the final one I would say that geographically around the world, there are still some spots where on-premise currently makes sense.\nMatthew Pfau: Great, thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Vruwink from Baird.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I wanted to go back to the go-live activity, because I think, I heard a 160 in the quarter there. So that's the second straight quarter where it's -- in above normal level and I'd imagine that you're seeing a lot of activity to \"get\" the easy extension, adding BOPUS and curbside onto order management, things like that. The question is are you seeing follow-on activity come from these engagements? And now that everything is on the cloud. If, let's say, these engagement are starting out more short-term in nature, can you use this as an opportunity to circle back? And maybe get customers thinking about an upgrade cycle going back to things like Warehouse Management?\nEddie Capel: It's great question, Joe. It does depend, certainly to kind of the first part of your question. There is and there is opportunity for ongoing deployments. So, just to use the examples that you talked about there with BOPUS and curbside, there is certainly some enthusiasm around those two strategies for the reasons that we've already discussed and particularly prior to peak and so forth. There are follow-on activities and capabilities around BOPUS and curbside with digital self service that is a -- typically is kind of a fast follower to those capabilities. Customer engagement strategies around those delivery mechanisms tend to be fast followers. So there is quite a bit of ongoing activity and ongoing cross-sell, upsell capability associated with those. Now as it relates to sort of -- if you want to call this going back -- backwards down the supply chain to whether it'd be Transportation Management solutions and Warehouse Management solutions. They're not -- it's not so much, I wouldn't characterize it as a natural, kind of, extension of BOPUS and curbside at all. But, as noted in some of the previous conversations, the modernization of distribution centers is frankly becoming imperative a combination of the need to be able to execute on smaller orders, e-commerce orders and the level of automation in robotics is being driven into Warehouses to drive both throughput and accommodate for the challenging labor market in that particular segment.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, great. And just on the last point Eddie, in terms of some of the early adopters, where you've seen interest on Active Warehouse Management. It strikes me as segments that have probably been comparatively resilient this year, thinking about food and beverage grocery, CPG. And so you're launching new technology into a pretty healthy demand environment. These are also applications where there is a lot of variety on SKUs, very high volume. And so I suppose the question is when you launch the Active Warehouse Management, did you feel like there were certain customer segments where if you got traction early, it would drive maybe better referenceability later on and are you seeing that so far with the early awards?\nEddie Capel: Not particularly in terms of focused on early referenceability and those kinds of things. We're seeing solid traction and deals, frankly, both from our customer base, who want to get onto a cloud strategy and a cloud platform and new customer logos. But as -- and we'll start obviously to publish this as and when we are able, but you see a nice blend of customers across both verticals and geographies.\nDennis Story: Hey, Joe. This is Dennis just to piggyback on what Eddie was saying, I would tell you, based on the demand and the pace of growth for Manhattan Active WM and our pipeline, I would say we're in the early stages of a pretty significant replacement cycle. And keep in mind that a large part of that is our installed base, but also about 45%, not all MAWM, but 45% of our cloud pipeline is net new opportunities, net new customers as well.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, great. Thanks, Dennis. Thanks, Eddie, I'll leave it there.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thank you, Joe, see you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Schappel from Benchmark.\nMark Schappel: Hi, thank you for taking my question and nice work on the quarter. Eddie starting with you, one of the benefits of your Active WMS solution and so it gives you an opportunity to really move into verticals where maybe you just weren't all that penetrated before industrial, manufacturing to the [coal mined]. I was wondering, if you could just address or just give an example or so of maybe some of the early customer interest you're seeing in Active WM from some of these non-traditional Manhattan verticals?\nEddie Capel: Yes. I mean, we're certainly beginning to see some interest there, Mark, I'm not going to obviously drop names and so forth at this particular juncture. But as you see customers of ours and industries that have typically been, kind of, heavy wholesale, heavy manufacturing and not had any, kind of, consumer contact or direct-to-consumer strategy, but frankly now are, right? So it's starting to sell direct-to-consumer and require a good bit more sophistication in the distribution strategy. There's a lot of early interest from those opportunities. The other dynamic though, is that what we've now introduced here is a cloud-based solution that always has immediate access to innovation and is extensible. And that's a new phenomenon regardless of vertical. So some of those old verticals that are running old solutions that have been highly customized over the years have been difficult to get access to whether it'd be modern innovation or modern underlying technology, they now have easy access to that with Manhattan Active Warehouse Management system, and again, starting to see a good bit of enthusiasm there.\nMark Schappel: Great, thank you. And then you mentioned you're Manhattan Active Allocation solution, which I guess is new this quarter, it sounds intriguing sounds interesting. I wonder, if you just provide a few more details on the solution itself and some of the opportunities you see there?\nEddie Capel: Yes, sure. So I'll keep it brief and because of that, a bit of an overly simplified description Mark given the time we have. But in the -- particularly in the fast fashion in apparel world, you see companies buy for a season and then push product out to the stores. And you don't see a lot of replenishment and inventory optimization activities. When you're pushing that product out to the store, there is still a healthy amount of sophistication. Where do I push that product to? Whether it'd be climate based, consumer demand based, size of store, all those kinds of things, and that's been the sort of the traditional way that one would push and allocate product type. But in the new world where we've got buy online, pickup in store, curbside pickup, buy online return from store, it requires another level of sophistication and calculating how you push that product out of the store. So Manhattan Active Allocation is a brand new rethink of how to go about soft lines in fast fashion, distribution and allocation of inventory and of course we've built it on our cloud platform, which offers speed of implementation and access to immediate innovation.\nMark Schappel: Great, thank you.\nEddie Capel: My pleasure, Mark. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Peterson from Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: Good evening, gentlemen. Hey thanks for taking the question. So Eddie, it's come up a couple of times, just the idea of a WMS refresh. I'm curious to what extent does the multi-tenant cloud portfolio you can change that, and I'm a little bit more interested, not on the existing installed base versus the opportunity for some of these legacy competitors. I'm curious how would you think about the pace of this refresh opportunity relative to what we've seen in past years?\nEddie Capel: Well, the WMS systems don't flip in a matter of days or a matter of weeks, Brian, as you know. But look, we've all seen this acceleration of customer demand, e-commerce demand, delivery, expectations and so forth. Even over the last seven, eight months or so and it's real. And it's real. We do think the companies with -- certainly with customer facing requirements, so forth are under an awful lot of pressure to be able to deliver the consumer expectations, consumer demand. And it requires modern technology, old tired Warehouse Management systems that haven't being modernized for years are not going to really be able to get the job done. So we are -- no question, we're seeing a refresh cycle happening. I don't know that it's going to be much, much, much faster than cycles that we've seen before. But it's there and the good news is as we've moved to cloud-based technology, there is a speed component in terms of being able to get these solutions rolled out to customers and prospects.\nBrian Peterson: Got it, thanks Eddie. And maybe one for Dennis, and I appreciate all the components of the guidance. But just in terms of the investments, I know they're picking up a little bit next year. Is there anything that you call out in terms of products or go-to-market that we should be paying attention to on margins next year. Thanks, guys.\nDennis Story: No, not really. Not really. As we expect to be able to benefit from scale, of course. But no major product-by-product margin impacts. We see a lot of opportunity clearly in front of us and our appetite to be able to invest in innovation is not been quenched at all. That's for sure, so we expect to continue to invest in innovation that has near-term impact on margins.\nEddie Capel: Yes, Brian, just to piggyback on that. There is also, as the cloud business continues to scale, we're investing in just tooling with our business to drive the margins up, future margins ups, so requiring investment as the business scales over the next year to two.\nBrian Peterson: Understood. Thanks guys.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Yun Kim from Loop Capital Markets.\nYun Kim: Thanks. Hey, Eddie and Dennis, congrats on a strong quarter, especially in a tough environment for you guys. Just following up on Terry's question early on. Dennis, I just want to make sure I understand it. So how does the ramp cloud deal effect RPO. Does the whole value of the contract swap in the RPO upfront? Or does it get added when the next ramp starts just like the revenue?\nEddie Capel: No, it shows up when we close the deal. The bookings show up in RPO or reported in RPO.\nYun Kim: Got it. Okay. So that could potentially be choppy as you close on larger deals, right, down the road?\nEddie Capel: I don't know, if it would be choppy, Yun I think just the reason we put that out there is on the year one ramp the revenue can be much smaller and the exiting annual subscription value can be significantly larger. So, that impact in terms of cloud revenue can squeeze your sequential decline. So it could be a little bit more lumpy on the revenue side, not as much on the booking side.\nYun Kim: Okay. Great, thanks for that. And then Dennis, it's a very basic question. Can you just give us update on your business around the brick and mortar or the big box retailers. I am assuming that particular part of the business for you guys is still being pressured, any update there on when we can start to see that business coming back? And then also how much of your professional services business is still kind of tied to that retail vertical slow down, I am assuming some of the weakness in professional services or at least a year-over-year decline is driven by the some of the projects that are more or less postponed that was ongoing prior to COVID?\nDennis Story: Yes, certainly, Yun, the -- some of the services -- most of the services decline is associated with some of the kind of retail slowdown and kind of retail hunkering down, frankly we've got a combination of some sub-verticals in retail being very, very busy and focused on meeting customer expectations. Others being impacted by the stores being closed and so forth and putting projects on hold, pausing them and so forth. We're beginning to see those light back up and so forth. So that's encouraging. In terms of the first part of your question, which was are we seeing activity around big box retail and how our big box retail customer is doing? The answer is, well, but generally in the e-commerce channel, right? You see big box e-commerce retail channels growing 200% year-over-year, putting all kinds of stress on the distribution network. So for us, we are still quite busy in that big box space.\nEddie Capel: Yes. And we haven't had from a retail perspective, it's a strategic vertical for us and a great growth opportunity. A lot of demand, when you go across sub-verticals within retail itself, Yun. In addition to that, we've had very minimal bankruptcy events, no liquidations, chapter 11 and customers are taking that opportunity to restructure their business. And really the challenge for retailers has been the mandated government shutdowns of their retail businesses. So we've seen a lot of positive activity, not just in closing deals with retail, but we are also seeing a lot of positive activity from the retail sector in the pipeline as well.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Just I'm assuming on the last one, just a high-level question for you guys. The omni-channel commerce has been a hot secular trend for the past several years and obviously it has evolved very quickly to be more strategic since COVID. Now that you guys have a cloud-based WMS solution in the market, which should reduce the overall complexity of the implementation and should be less of customization in the deployment. Are you at all kind of maybe open to adopting a larger partner ecosystem that includes large global system integrators and perhaps even giving them access to some of your professional services work to help them ramp?\nEddie Capel: Well, look, it's probably a reasonably long answer. At the end of the day, we have a large partner ecosystem around the world that ranges from big global companies like Deloitte, all the way down to the smaller supply chain focused boutique companies. And of course, you've been in that customer conference and there is no shortage of implementation partners at our customer conference. In terms of customization and so forth, there is still going to be customization required regardless of whether it's on-prem or in the cloud. One of the unique features or capabilities of our cloud solution. It is extensible, right? It is extensible. So, we'll still allow that customization to happen we'll honor all of the contracts of the customization APIs and so forth, so that as we do these updates every quarter, there is no kind of regression issues or implications have to reimplement customization and so forth. So it's a, certainly a valuable capability to be able to customize the solution and have access to immediate innovation.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Thank you so much, guys. A - Eddie Capel Our pleasure, Yun. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt.\nMark Zgutowicz: Good evening. I was just hoping to get a perspective on the -- I'm calling them downstream benefits of your accelerated POS and curbside, pickup adoption. I'm not sure how you characterize it, but I'm just trying to get a sense of where you see that sort of falling into pipeline and whether that might be, if we think about just beyond orders maybe retain business, maybe additional adoption of Active Omni solutions. And then maybe this is a stretch here, but if it's perhaps giving a slight push to accelerate adoption of your Active Warehouse Management solutions? Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Thank you, Mark. And I wouldn't say it will be a push or a nudge to go in reverse order, a nudge to the adoption of Active Warehouse Management. Those two things are reasonably different. But I think it is safe to say frankly as a consumer, we're all beginning to expect BOPUS and curbside is table stakes and price of admission frankly in the retail space. Now advanced BOPUS and curbside is starting to really come to the surface, where retailers are looking to offer cross-sell and up-sell opportunities even in BOPUS and curbside environment that requires real sophisticated customer engagement and sophisticated technology systems to be able to make that happen. So, while we have seen an acceleration of e-commerce, I think customer expectations continue to grow and that's why it's so important that we continue to innovate in that space and maintain our market leading position.\nMark Zgutowicz: Got it. Thank you, Eddie. Appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Mark. Thank you.\nOperator: That was our last question. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Eddie Capel for closing comments.\nEddie Capel: Okay, very good Mark. Well, thank you everybody for taking the time to participate in this earnings call. I would look forward to crystallizing our 2021 view, in about 90-days or so. And of course it's very premature, but they will have a very happy and safe holiday season, and we'll speak to you again in about 90-days. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. As mentioned, third quarter total revenue was $150 million, down 8% over prior year, due pretty much solely to COVID-19. Our total revenue estimate for the fourth quarter is a range of $135 million to $140 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.51 in the quarter. GAAP earnings per share was $0.39 with stock-based compensation accounting for the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS. Our adjusted earnings per share target for the fourth quarter is $0.32 within a range of $0.30 to $0.34. Starting with cloud, revenue for the quarter was $21.1 million, up 14% sequentially and up 48% year-over-year, despite a tough comp due to our Q3 2019 FEMA cloud deal. We signed two new Manhattan Active Warehouse Management deals in the third quarter, both global Tier 1 customers and continue to see strong pipeline demand for our cloud solutions with notable strength in Manhattan Active WM, Manhattan Active Omni and TMS solutions. About 50% of our deals in the quarter came from Active DM products and over 20% of our bookings were from new customers. For Q4, we estimate our cloud revenue will be about $22 million, which represents about 40% growth year-over-year. For the full-year, we estimate our cloud revenue will be $78 million to $79 million, up 68% year-over-year from the midpoint. License revenue was solid in the quarter at $13.2 million, well above our expectations, as several Q4 pipeline opportunities accelerated into Q3. Overall license is down 28% year-to-date and continues to attrite as strong demand for our solutions continues to shift to cloud. We signed three $1 million plus deals in the quarter with roughly 30% of our license deals coming from new customers. For the fourth quarter, we expect between $4 million and $5 million in license revenue. And for the full-year, we now estimate license revenue will be approximately $33 million to $34 million. Of course, as we've pointed out in our release and earlier in the call, uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic could affect our performance against our estimates. Cloud and license software mix will be approximately 70% cloud to 30% license for the full-year with total software revenue of $111 million to $113 million, up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. A record number, despite a 31% or $15 million decline in license revenue versus 2019. Turning to bookings. As we've discussed remaining performance obligation or RPO is the leading proxy for our cloud bookings performance and represents the value of contractual obligations required to be performed otherwise referred to as unearned revenue or bookings. Our RPO for the quarter totaled $257 million, up 69% over prior year and at 14% sequentially. We now expect that our year-end RPO will fall within a range of $275 million to $290 million, driven by booking strength in cloud, particularly with Manhattan Active WM. For Manhattan, this disclosed value represents our cloud bookings value of unearned revenue under non-cancelable contracts greater than one-year. Contracts with a non-cancelable term of one year or less are excluded from the reported amount. One last point on license and cloud. Our performance continues to depend on the number and relative value of large deals we closed in any quarter. Further some customers have longer implementation cycles associated with large projects requiring a multi-year annual subscription, ramp built into the contract term. As an example for a five year contract, the ramp results in year five of contracted revenue being significantly larger than year one. In the near-term as Manhattan scales large ramp deals will impact sequential and year-over-year revenue growth percentages. Now shifting to maintenance. Revenue for the quarter totaled $37.3 million, down 1% versus the prior year. Our customer retention rates remain strong at greater than 95%-plus. And for the fourth quarter, we estimate our maintenance revenue will be between $36 million and $37 million and for full-year 2020, our estimate is $145.5 million. Turning to services. Our professional services revenue for the quarter totaled $73.5 million, down 20% year-over-year as expected. Again, I would like to point out that excluding billed travel, were down about 15% year-over-year. We expect near-term services revenue trends will be tied to the pace and degree of global economic improvement. And we estimate our services revenue for Q4 will be approximately $71 million. And our full-year 2020 services revenue will be in the range of $303 million to $305 million. At the midpoint, this is really difficult math, but $304 million, services will be down about 16% versus 2019. Excluding billed travel, services revenue was down 12%. These estimates include our expected seasonal fourth quarter sequential decline over Q3, due to retail peak season. Regarding consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin. For the quarter, we generated 53% margins, driven by continued operating leverage in cloud. Our fourth quarter estimate is approximately 51.9% about 100 basis points higher than 2019. Our full-year estimate is approximately 51.4%. Turning to operating income and margin. Q3 adjusted operating income totaled $44.1 million with an adjusted operating margin of 29.4%, driven by higher license revenue performance, combined with very strong expense management. For the fourth quarter, we estimate our adjusted operating margin to be within a range of 19.2% to 20.2%. Our Q3 adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.5%, we estimate our fourth quarter rate to be 24% and full-year tax rate will be approximately 23.6%. Regarding our capital structure, our share repurchase program remains suspended and our repurchase authority limit remains at $50 million. We continue to assess the appropriate timing for a resumption of buyback activities, dictated primarily by broader macroeconomic improvement. For the fourth quarter and full-year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 64.4 million shares. Turning to cash, we closed the quarter with cash and investments of $166 million and zero debt, that's right, $166 million and zero debt. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled $113 million, down 5% sequentially on just timing of revenue recognition. Q3 cash flow from operations totaled $42 million, up 6% over prior year. Year-to-date, operating cash flow totaled $103 million, down just 8%. And finally, capital expenditures totaled $200,000 in Q3, we estimate full-year capital expenditures to be between $3 million and $5 million. Now turning to our updated annual guidance, we continue to model and review multiple scenarios in order to provide investors with our best estimate of financial performance for the remainder of the year. Of note, there are certain external factors that are out of our control and may produce results that are different from expectations. So specifically for 2020 annual guidance, our full-year total revenue range is now expected to be between $574 million to $579 million. Our target objective is $576.5 million in total revenue versus prior guidance of $562 million. Our full-year adjusted earnings per diluted share range is expected to be between a $1.62 to $1.66, our target objective midpoint is $1.64, compared to our previous guidance midpoint of $1.56. Our full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share range is expected to be $1.23 to $1.27 with a midpoint of $1.25. And we expect our full-year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. That covers the 2020 guidance. Before discussing our preliminary 2021 targets, we want to remind you that the views we have today are subject to a variety of factors that may manifest themselves over the upcoming months. And hence, are subject to change, so appropriately conservative for the environment in which we are operating. We expect to provide formal 2021 guidance on our 4Q, 2020 call next year. One final note before going further, our preliminary 2021 targets reflect year-over-year growth rates that are based on the midpoint of our updated 2020 guidance for the respective metrics. So at a high level, we view 2021 currently as a tale of two halves. Specifically we expect H2 will be stronger than H1 provided an economic recovery picks up steam in the back half of the year. Our continued business transition is masking our underlying growth and value creation, due to both license are trading to cloud and global Tier 1 customers ramping up their global footprints over multiple periods. We continue to believe RPO is the best go-forward metric in tracking the progress of our transition. Our 2021 full-year total revenue range is now expected to be between $585 million to $625 million, representing a 1% to 8% year-over-year growth range. Our target objective is to achieve $605 million, representing 5% growth, excluding our declining license impact year-over-year total revenue growth is 8%. As you know Q1, 2020 was an all-time record Q1 revenue performance pre-COVID creating a tough comp for Q1 2021. We expect Q1, 2021 total revenue to be down 7% to 9% over Q1, 2020. We expect our H1 total revenue split to be about $292 million with 1% year-over-year growth given the Q1 COVID comp and H2 split to be about $313 million, this is the revenue split with a 9% growth rate. For software revenue, we are estimating $123 million to $130 million with a midpoint growth of 13%. We are targeting a $108 million to $110 million in cloud growth with midpoint growth of about 40%. Importantly, we expect license revenue to decline, almost 50% in 2021, as customers and prospects choose our cloud solutions. License revenue will be in the $15 million to $20 million range with a midpoint of $17.5 million. Regarding 2021, RPO our preliminary estimate is between $385 million to $390 million, up about 40% over 2020. And as Eddie mentioned we are off to a very good start in Q4 on strong cloud demand. With the backdrop of COVID, government elections and retail peak season in play and a second full selling quarter of Manhattan Active WM under our belt, this will certainly help us calibrate the camshafts on our RPO entering 2021. For consulting services, we are targeting $306 million to $334 million with a $320 million midpoint, representing about 5% year-over-year growth. We expect H1 revenue to be down about 3% to 5% year-over-year with Q1 being down 15% against 2020's record services comp. The rate of year-over-year growth in services will be dictated by the pace and cadence of economic recovery for the balance of 2021. And for maintenance, we are estimating $140 million to $145 million or 4% decline to flat growth year-over-year, as we expect more existing customers to convert to cloud subscriptions. That covers the critical revenue targets. Our full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share range is $1.37 to $1.54 with a midpoint of $1.46. H1 to H2 percentage splits will be 45% H1 and 55% H2 for the annual EPS splits. Q1 will be our lowest EPS quarter totaling about 21% of full-year EPS or $0.31. The primary drivers of lower year-over-year earnings per share is related to three major components. First, the continued decline of license revenue. Second, the reversal of prior cost actions we took in April of this year. And third, continued strategic investments in innovation and tooling for cloud ops to execute on the cloud growth we see in front of us. Adjusted operating margin is expected to decline year-over-year to 20% to 21%, reflecting the operating imperatives covered in our outlook for EPS. You may recall in our Q4, 2019 call, we guided to an adjusted operating margin range of 20% to 20.5% with a trough of 20%. Unfortunately in our Q1, 2020 call the pandemic required us to downshift a few gears to protect liquidity, customers and our employees without sacrificing investments in R&D. With business conditions improving, we are refocused on the same objective with 2021 now representing our margin trough. Overall, our objective is to achieve long-term sustainable double-digit top line growth with top quartile operating margins. Manhattan's effective tax rate is expected to run at approximately 24.5% subject to any changes to federal state or foreign tax legislation. And finally, we expect that our share count will be approximately $65 million, which assumes no buyback activity and either Q4 '20 or fiscal year 2021. That covers the financial update, back to Eddie for some closing comments. Yes, that's correct, Terry. It will phase-in, it will actually phase-in into the first, second and third year of the contract as a general rule, but short-term, short-term drag on cloud revenue, but long-term values created for Manhattan on the go forward. Yes. Hey, Joe. This is Dennis just to piggyback on what Eddie was saying, I would tell you, based on the demand and the pace of growth for Manhattan Active WM and our pipeline, I would say we're in the early stages of a pretty significant replacement cycle. And keep in mind that a large part of that is our installed base, but also about 45%, not all MAWM, but 45% of our cloud pipeline is net new opportunities, net new customers as well. No, not really. Not really. As we expect to be able to benefit from scale, of course. But no major product-by-product margin impacts. We see a lot of opportunity clearly in front of us and our appetite to be able to invest in innovation is not been quenched at all. That's for sure, so we expect to continue to invest in innovation that has near-term impact on margins. Yes, certainly, Yun, the -- some of the services -- most of the services decline is associated with some of the kind of retail slowdown and kind of retail hunkering down, frankly we've got a combination of some sub-verticals in retail being very, very busy and focused on meeting customer expectations. Others being impacted by the stores being closed and so forth and putting projects on hold, pausing them and so forth. We're beginning to see those light back up and so forth. So that's encouraging. In terms of the first part of your question, which was are we seeing activity around big box retail and how our big box retail customer is doing? The answer is, well, but generally in the e-commerce channel, right? You see big box e-commerce retail channels growing 200% year-over-year, putting all kinds of stress on the distribution network. So for us, we are still quite busy in that big box space."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates Q2 2020 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, July 23, 2020. I would now like to introduce Eddie Capel, CEO; Dennis Story, CFO; and Matt Humphries, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Humphries, you may begin your call.\nMatt Humphries: Thanks, Jason and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates' second quarter 2020 earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are not guarantees of future performance, and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019 and the risk factor discussion in that report, as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note in particular that uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now, I will turn the call now over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Thanks, Matt. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter 2020 results and we discuss our outlook for the balance of the year. And before we go into detail about how the business performed in the quarter, I wanted to take a step back for a moment and just make a couple of high-level comments. Now at Manhattan Associates, we're committed each and every day to serving our customers. Frankly, our customers depend on us to execute every single day and deliver on our promises so that they can deliver on their promises. Their customers, consumers depend on them to deliver the goods and services that they need to live, and never has this been more critical than during this global pandemic. And it's more apparent than ever that there's a growing market need for modern, adaptable supply chain inventory and omnichannel solutions. And the criticality of that need is not lost on us. And we believe that we're very well positioned at the intersection of this changing world. So now back to the discussion of our results. Manhattan reported a solid quarter despite the visible effects that COVID-19 is having across the global economy. Specifically, we reported total revenue of $136 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.40, both of which exceeded our expectations. Cloud, license and services revenue, combined with disciplined expense management, drove solid earnings leverage, delivering an adjusted operating margin of 25.3%. That's about 200 basis points higher than the same period last year. And while we've seen better-than-expected demand for our supply chain and omnichannel products and services, the near-term timing and continued pace of economic recovery is somewhat unclear. But in our world, there are signs that seem to be encouraging. And as such, we're raising our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance to reflect our views for the balance of the year. Now we continue to invest in the business to drive long-term sustainable growth while focusing on profitable execution and diligent capital allocation in order to capitalize on the evolving market trends. And furthermore, our dedication to innovation remains. And we expect to invest nearly $80 million in R&D this year, even with this macro backdrop. Now looking at our current pipeline, we see a pretty healthy set of global opportunities, with our cloud pipeline trending favorably, giving us confidence in reinforcing our belief that the mission-critical products that we offer are needed now more than ever. Specifically, over 60% of our pipeline at the end of the quarter is comprised of cloud opportunities, and that's compared with 40% a year ago. And while we've seen some delays in closing pipeline opportunities, we haven\u2019t experienced any notable cancellations. And our second-half pipeline is trending somewhat favorably relative to our first half. And additionally, we're seeing a broader and more diverse set of opportunities in our pipeline as interest grows from non-retail verticals such as automotive, third-party logistics, life sciences, automotive and then all the way to manufacturing and wholesale. And finally, about 50% of our deal opportunities continue to be represented by net new logos globally. Now turning to our services business. Despite having the restriction of limited face-to-face engagements with our customers, we remain active, providing real-time support and delivering a variety of project work while executing system go-lives remotely. In the second quarter we conducted nearly 130 system go-lives, reflecting solid execution in the current environment. By the way, build travel which is margin-neutral, but does contribute to the overall services revenue, is down significantly versus last year for obvious reasons. And this represents about a 4% headwind to year-over-year services revenue growth. And while the lack of travel and face-to-face engagement is challenging, the ability of our professional services team to continue to deliver high quality complex work remotely really underscores our ability to adapt and to deliver in this dynamic and difficult time. Now on the sales and marketing front, our competitive win rates remain strong at about 70%-plus against our head-to-head competition, with about 30% of our license and cloud deals representing net new customers. Then here we are at the halfway point, really, of our 5-year cloud transition, and we're experiencing a significant shift in market demand for our cloud solutions across all of our verticals. And verticals that collectively drove more than 50% of our cloud and license revenue in the quarter were retail and consumer goods, government and food, beverage and grocery. And within these verticals, we saw robust demand for specific capabilities within our active omni suite, such as buy online, pickup-in-store, curbside pickup, and store inventory fulfillment. With so many physical stores closed during Q2, the ability of retail and consumer-facing brands to fulfill orders in creative ways was really in great demand. And we were able to standup these solutions really in a very short amount of time. And the ability for these brands have flexible distribution and selling channels is really more critical than ever. And the solutions that we offer have become a key enabler to these activities. I would like to, just for a minute, pivot a bit and give you some updates on recent advancements across our product portfolio. So let's start with maybe one of the most significant announcements in our company's history. During our online user conference in May, Momentum Connect, we unveiled Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, the next-generation of warehouse management, re-architected from the ground floor up as cloud-native, micro services-based and a versionless application. Manhattan Active WM is a step change in agility and speed of innovation within the supply chain execution landscape. With Manhattan Active WM, we were able to deliver new feature functionality every single quarter while still offering full extensibility of the core application. And while our customers continue to be extremely satisfied using our base capability inside of warehouse management, we see that customer-driven extensibility as a solution imperative with the ability for our customers to add their secret sauce and innovation on top of our platform. All while taking advantage of new capabilities that we deliver every single quarter. And we believe this is a really winning combination as well as a first-of-its-kind in the supply chain execution industry. And the underlying technology which makes this all possible is our Manhattan Active application architecture that made its debut in 2017 when we launched Manhattan Active Omni. Now relative to the live customers, we had an early adopter customer live on Manhattan Active WM prior to our release announcement of Manhattan Connect, Pet Supplies Plus. They went live in April, and actually due to unforeseen events associated with the pandemic, they've been shipping record volumes with Manhattan Active WM ever since. And they're now planning to roll out the remaining DCs in their networks. And additionally, we've also signed several other customer implementations of Manhattan Active WM. They're underway. They were large Tier 1 global brands, and we closed them inside the quarter. Now in addition to its groundbreaking technology, Manhattan Active WM delivers a number of next-generation feature function enhancements including customer grade configurable mobile applications for the associates inside the distribution center, a suite of in-line analytical user interfaces built right into Manhattan Active WM, which we call our Unified Control screens and a next-generation of algorithm focused on taking operational optimization simply to the next level. And finally, we've got a brand-new set of capabilities that we call employee engagement, a whole new way for distribution center managers and associates to interact with one another throughout the day. So in brief, that's Manhattan Active WM. And as you'd imagine, we're very excited about the release of \u2013 about this particular release. And it's really been the largest product investment in the history of Manhattan Associates. And whilst the time frame and expense of the undertaking were certainly significant, we felt that it was undoubtedly the right path to position both Manhattan and our customers to deliver best-in-class performance for the next decade. And while Manhattan Active WM was admittedly our focal point of our attention in recent times, I'm excited that we've been able to make significant strides in parallel across other applications within our portfolio. So I'll touch on just a couple of those. First, staying with our supply chain suite, we recently shipped an exciting new version of our transportation management solution that included an all-new major update to our dispatch capability and a significant update of our transportation modeling solution. For our customers who operate their own delivery fleet, dispatch management is really an integral part of the transportation management operation. And a number of our fleet-operating customers have already signed up to move to this completely redesigned and rebuilt solution. And we're excited to help them power the ever-growing last-mile delivery network of today and tomorrow. And next, a quick update on Manhattan Active Omni. As I mentioned in Q1, Manhattan Active Omni customers are really innovating at record pace to adapt their order fulfillment, delivery and pickup methods in light of the changing regulations associated with the pandemic. The volumes we're seeing so far for BOPUS orders and buy online, pickup-in-store are really off the charts, frankly, with some of our customers experiencing tenfold increases in volume. And additionally in Q2, we accelerated the release for curbside pickup into both our digital self-service and store fulfillment modules. This consumer research indicates that a curbside pickup is one of those fulfillment methods likely to persist even after the pandemic. And having an industrial strength process and technology in place is really a must have for omni channel retailers. Because of the Manhattan Active architecture, we were able to make curbside pickup support available to all of the Manhattan Active Omni customers in really record time. And last but not least on the product side, we launched a completely new application within our inventory suite, Momentum Connect this quarter. It's called Manhattan Active Allocation and its purpose built for our fashion and apparel retail customers. Because while we've had best-in-class forecasting and replenishment applications for our customers who manage relatively static product assortment. Manhattan Active Allocation is the first time we'll have a sophisticated inventory optimization offering for fast fashion customers who manage their inventory using a completely different process. And Manhattan Active Allocation launches with really two major differentiating features. Omni Channel is built right into the core of its design. And it also resides on the Manhattan Active application architecture, which we talked about before. And we think this is really a game changer for the soft lines allocation space. And we plan to make it generally available a little bit later in the year. So hopefully you'll agree. It was a pretty big quarter for the evolution of our product portfolio. And we're excited to work with that customers to light up all of these new capabilities. So that covers my broader business update. And Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance, discuss 2020 full year guidance, and I'll close with a few prepared remarks and a brief summary. So Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. So for second quarter, total revenue was up $135.6 million, down 12% over the prior year, solely related to COVID-19 impacts. Our total revenue estimate for the third quarter is a range of $136 million to $140 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.40. GAAP earnings per share was $0.30 with stock-based compensation accounting for the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS. Our adjusted earnings per share target for third quarter is $0.39 within a range of $0.38 to $0.40. License revenue was $5.7 million in the quarter above our expectations but down year-over-year as demand for our solutions continues to shift the cloud. We signed two, $1 million plus deals in the quarter with roughly 20% of all licensed deals coming from new customers. For the third quarter, we expect between $5 million to $7 million in license revenue. For the full year, we now estimate license revenue will be approximately $28 million to $31 million. Of course, as we pointed out in our release in earlier in the call, uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic could affect our performance against our estimates. Cloud revenue was a record $18.5 million, up a 105% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, driven by continued customer demand for our cloud solutions across all of the verticals we serve. Of note, we signed two new Manhattan Active Warehouse Management deals in the quarter, both global Tier one customers. No question WMS in the cloud momentum continues to build. Over 70% of our deals in the quarter came from WMS and approximately 45% of our bookings were from either net new customers or net new product sales to existing customers within our install base with a diverse set of opportunities to continue to sell into our existing customer base. For Q3, we estimate our cloud revenue will be $19.5 million to $20 million, which represents about 40% growth year-over-year against a very strong comp driven by our FEMA deal we signed last year. Ex-FEMA, the year-over-year growth rate is about 50%. And for the full year, we estimate our cloud revenue will be $76 million to $78 million, up about 65% at the midpoint. We estimate our cloud and license software mix will be approximately 70% cloud to 30% license for the full year with total software revenue in the range of $104 million to $109 million. At the midpoint of $106.5 million, total software revenue is up 11% representing a record software year, while staring down a pandemic and absorbing a 40% decline in license revenue versus 2019. Turning to bookings, as we have discussed, remaining performance obligation or RPO is the leading proxy for our cloud bookings performance and represents the value of contractual obligations required to be performed otherwise referred to as unearned revenue or bookings. Our RPO for the quarter totaled $225 million, up 87% over prior year and 11% sequentially. We continue to estimate that our year end RPO will fall within a range of $265 million to $275 million. For Manhattan, this disclosed value represents our cloud bookings value of unearned revenue under non-cancelable contracts greater than one year. Contracts with a non-cancelable term of one year or less are excluded from the reported amount. And one last point on the license and cloud, our performance does continue to depend on the number and relative value of large deals we closed in any quarter, while this is positive deal sizes may be slightly smaller as subscription revenue is recognized over time. Further, some customers have longer implementation cycles associated with large distribution footprints requiring a wrap subscription model, which can impact sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. We also retain appropriate caution around slow decision making by some clients and prospects, particularly retailers in light of COVID-19. So moving on to maintenance, revenue for the quarter totaled $35.9 million, down 4% versus the prior year. Our customer retention rates remain strong at greater than 95% plus. For the third quarter, we estimate our maintenance revenue for Q3 will be approximately $36.5 million to $37 million. And for full year 2020, our estimate is $145 million. Turning to services, consulting revenue for the quarter totaled $71.8 million, down 24% year-over-year as expected and solely driven by COVID. Again, I'd like to point out that excluding billed travel, we're down about 20% year-over-year. We expect near term services revenue trends will continue to be governed by the pace and degree of the normalization of economic activity impacted by COVID-19. We estimate our services revenue for Q3 will be approximately $72 million to $73 million. And our full year 2020 services revenue will be in a range of $292 million to $303 million. At the midpoint of $297.5 million, services will be down about 17% versus 2019, excluding billed travel services revenue is down 14% and includes our expected seasonal fourth quarter decline due to retail peak season. Our consolidated subscription maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 52.4% driven by operating leverage as our cloud revenue begins to scale. Our third quarter estimate is approximately 52.4%, approximately 270 basis points higher than 2019. Our full year estimate is approximately 51.2%. Moving to operating income and margin, Q2 adjusted operating income totaled $34.3 million with an adjusted operating margin of 25.3%. For the third quarter, we estimate our adjusted operating margin to be within a range of 24% to 24.2%, nice tight range there. Our Q2 adjusted effective income tax rate was 24%. And guess what? Our third quarter and full year tax rate will be approximately 24% as well. Regarding our capital structure, we suspended our share repurchase program effective April 1, 2020 as previously discussed. Our repurchase authority remains at $50 million. And this program continues to be an important part of our long-term capital allocation strategy. We will continue to evaluate the appropriate time for a resumption of our buyback program. For the third quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding will be approximately $64.5 million. Turning to cash. We closed the quarter with cash and investments of $124 million and zero debt. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled $119 million, up 13% sequentially on maintenance and cloud billings. Q2 cash flow from operations totaled $49 million. CapEx for the quarter totaled $0.5 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures to be in the range $5 million to $7 million. Now, I'll turn to our updated annual guidance. We continue to model and review multiple scenarios in order to provide the investment community with our best estimate of financial performance for the remainder of the year. While these estimates have been rigorously vetted, there are certain external factors that are out of our control and may produce results that are different from what we've modeled.  Specifically for annual guidance, our full year total revenue range is now expected to be between $554 million to $570 million. Our target objective is to achieve $562 million in total revenue. Our full year adjusted earnings per share \u2013 diluted per share range is expected to be between a $1.53 to a $1.59. Our target objective is a $1.56 compared to our previous guidance midpoint of a $1.54. Our full year GAAP earnings per diluted share range is expected to be a $1.17 to a $1.23 with a midpoint of a $1.20. And our full year adjusted operating margin is expected to fall within a range of 22.9% to 23.1%. So that covers my financial update. I'll turn the call back over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thank you, Dennis. Well, as we close out today's call, we recognize that the world is evolving fast from changing cultural norms to diverging consumer tastes and behaviors. There's never been a more crucial time to have a modern, adaptive and flexible supply chain and omni channel commerce set of solutions. To win today means investing in the future and we recognize this. And we continue to see customers adapt to this paradigm. And as a leader in the digital commerce space, our goal is to enable our customers to succeed and to be resilient through continued innovation and by investing in a talented global workforce. We believe that we're well positioned to capitalize on these trends and see no shortage of opportunities as we progress on that path of long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. At Manhattan, we never settle. Even in these difficult times, we remain focused on delivering on our commitments, advancing our product portfolio through market leading innovation and ensuring our customers are equipped to succeed in this challenging macro dynamic. We've experienced challenges like this before. Although this one is a bit different, admittedly, and we've consistently emerge stronger and better position, and we see no reason as to why this time is any different at people, at innovation and at culture are the heart and soul of our organization. And that's why I'm just so excited about what the future holds for all of us here at Manhattan Associates. So Jason, I'm ready now to take any questions.\nOperator: Excellent. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: Yes. Hey gentlemen. Good afternoon, Eddie. It's nice to see the early traction with the cloud WMS product and calling out Tier one wins. What I'm curious about the two part question, then I'll have a follow-up or two. But on the Tier one wins, are they going enterprise wide with the rollout of the cloud native WMS or is it more kind of isolated site and how do you see this kind of rate of adoption of the cloud WMS versus other cloud products in the past? And then I had a couple of follow-ups?\nEddie Capel: Yes. So both of the deals are definitely with Tier one global customers. They are very nice substantial deals, but there is still a lot of upside behind them for the global rollout, for sure. With regard to kind of adoption, well, it's enthusiasm, adoption and momentum. I would say it's early, of course, given that we just announced in mid May. But it feels very strong, great enthusiasm from really across the board customers, prospects, industry analysts, and so forth pretty excited about the solution. And as we've mentioned, pipeline seems pretty strong, engagement with both prospects and customers is high. So the prospects are pretty good.\nTerry Tillman: That\u2019s good to hear. Two follow-ups. The first one on the non-retail strength. What we see a lot is new business models from wholesalers and manufacturers really starting to do direct-to-consumers at their end customers. So they're building websites, they sell. I'm assuming that has big implications on the fulfillment side and supply chain side. But what are you seeing in non-retail segments going forward. Do you see a growing kind of TAM around that that heretofore you weren't really serving?\nEddie Capel: Well, so there's two pieces. You've made the point about the branded guys who are going kind of direct-to-consumer. There are also industries that are starting to go direct-to-consumer that we maybe would have not sort of expected to before and haven't maybe seen as retailers. Just one example. Automotive spare parts, for example, typically, captive to the dealer network and so forth. You're starting to see those secondary markets look like direct-to-consumer, which is a great opportunity for us, number one. As we release our new solutions, particularly WM, cloud native, innovation that we're delivering on a quarterly basis, we certainly do see the opportunity for penetrating in verticals that we may not have been the strongest in the past. CPE is one that sort of brings to mind where we're seeing some good early interest. So opening up some additional TAM, certainly.\nTerry Tillman: Yes. Just my last question. Thanks Eddie so far for the answers. Is on the services side. I thought I had in my notes that you all were looking for about 100 or maybe a little under 100 go-lives. I think Dennis said 130. So it seems like you beat expectations. You did raise services for the year. I guess what's driving that to be ahead of expectations, just given the pandemic? Are people \u2013 are you more efficient in the services, doing it virtually than you thought? Or are there just more projects moving forward than you thought? That's it for me. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Look, a few more projects than we thought, Terry. I mean, look, honestly, we were unsure coming into the quarter as to exactly how things would pan out. And frankly, they firmed up. They firmed up a little bit as the quarter went on. And I think all of us, personally and professionally, we're a little unsure. And there's still a great deal of uncertainty going \u2013 moving forward. There's no question about that, but things firmed up for us. Yes. So we're pleased about that. And very pleased with the ability of the team here to be able to execute at pretty unusual circumstances. But thanks for your questions.\nTerry Tillman: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Charles from William Blair. Your line is open.\nMatt Charles: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first start off with follow-up on the Active M product \u2013 Active WM product. And maybe you can just talk about the interest you're seeing there in the pipeline, is that more weighted towards new customers? Or is it existing WM customers that are looking to move their on-premise deployment to a cloud one?\nEddie Capel: Yes, that's an interesting question, Matt. It is just about smack down the middle, 50-50, existing customers and in new logos. I mean to give you some other sort of commentary around that. Just it is surprising maybe. It's smack down the middle, about 50-50. So we're very encouraged by that.\nMatt Charles: Got it. And when you talked about the higher volumes in Active Omni from some of your retailer customers, can you just remind us, are you able to monetize those from a revenue perspective? Or how do those contracts work when you see customers that are doing sort of 10x the either store fulfillment or other activities that they were previously doing?\nEddie Capel: Yes. There's definitely upside for us there. Most of our contracts are annual volumes. So when you see a short-term pickup in volume, there is no immediate impact for us. It really gets reconciled kind of at the end of the year. But certainly, a positive for sure.\nMatt Charles: Got it. And last one for me, and I'll pass it on.\nEddie Capel: Yes.\nMatt Charles: So you talked about some of the changes that we're seeing by COVID-19. And obviously, there's a few tough to tell everything will play out, but there's a few sort of long-term trends that seem obvious. So one is the much faster shift to e-commerce than we were previously seeing and others probably a smaller physical footprint or some of these stores that are multipurpose. When you think about your positioning and your product road map, how do you think that, that aligns with some of these long-term changes? So I guess, long term, are these changes driven by COVID-19 headwinds or tailwinds to Manhattan?\nEddie Capel: Well, so I think the simple headline answer is it's very positive for us. Now obviously, the impact of COVID on the global macro and so forth, if we put that aside, and to your point, talk about the shift in the dynamics of retail and so forth. We've been on the front end, of course, of servicing direct-to-consumer omnichannel customers, really for more than a decade. It's a strength of ours. We've always predicted continued shift from bricks-and-mortar to digital. And this acceleration is really just very, very helpful for us. I mean I think there's going to be some kind of pullback of today's numbers when we get back into a situation where bricks-and-mortar are fully open. But I do think there's \u2013 clearly, some of these initiatives, curbside particularly, buy online, pickup-in-store that they're going to remain just simply because of the convenience that people have now really realized is there. So right in the sweet spot of where we've been operating and where we are going.\nMatt Charles: Yes. Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys.\nEddie Capel: Pleasure Matt. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink from Baird. Your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Hi, great. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to go back, Eddie, to the interest Active WM has been seeing from new logos. And just thinking out loud, some of your peers in the WMS space that have had a cloud offering, the way they have talked about it is that the interest originally came from smaller customers, maybe more SMB, and more recently, they've started to see the interest from the enterprise segment. You're kind of the gold standard in the enterprise segment. And so are the new logos still similar to your traditional customers? Or is this actually broadening your audience and you're starting to get in front of maybe the type of organization that hasn't been a target of Manhattan in the past, but just given the virtues of cloud and some of the difference in economics, maybe it suddenly makes sense?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Good question, Joe. So I would say that the early interest has certainly been with what we would consider Tier one customers. I think that there's been sort of a shift, but a little bit of change. Some of the cloud solutions that have been out there for a while are really candidly on-premise solutions that are hosted in the cloud, which is great, if you're trying to not be in the data center business and so forth. You can kind of move yourself off to the cloud. And that's been attractive to kind of the lower-tier customers. But when you build a true native cloud application, have the ability to be able to deliver real first-class of world-class innovation every 90 days, that sure becomes appealing to Tier 1 customers around the world. So I think that's really the difference and why we've seen Tier 1 customers now truly embracing cloud WM versus it just being sort of a simple lift and shift, hey, I don't have a big IT organization so I'll pop it up in the cloud. So that would be sort of answer number one. In terms of our ability to be able to now have a broader geographic reach, a broader reach into all tiers, that is certainly something that is an objective of ours. It's well aligned with a true cloud strategy, but the early interest is largely being with Tier one.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, great. And then the other half of where the interest is coming from thinking about your existing installed base, do you have a way of thinking about \u2013 I think there is north of 1,200 Manhattan customers at this point, not all WMS probably, but there's a lot out there, of what's kind of the migration timeline might looks like? Typically, five years has been a normal upgrade cycle. Is maybe 20% of the installed base thinking about an upgrade every year? Just how would you kind of conceptualize within your existing base?\nEddie Capel: Yes. I mean, I think, it's a fair to look at it. There are those natural upgrade cycles that we're going to be able to kind of latch onto, to use that expression. I think that there is the opportunity for some folks that will accelerate those upgrade discussions because they can get their hands on brand-new innovation that delivers real ROI faster, and we're going to certainly help them with those business cases. We're going to see \u2013 clearly, we're going to see some customers, as we always do with technology transitions, have a pretty long tail on the migration. And \u2013 but the great news is they can do it at their own pace. They can migrate at their own pace. There's no particular acceleration required, they get to do it at their own pace and frankly, we'll be there for them when they're ready.\nJoe Vruwink: And then just one more quick one for me. It looks like you brought, I think, $7 million worth of R&D back into the 2020 forecast. Is that dedicated to any particular area? Or is it kind of broadly indicative of the different product sets you've been talking about so far on the call?\nEddie Capel: Yes, really, across the across the board, Joe. There's always \u2013 based upon product life cycle and so forth, the R&D investment moves a little bit from product to product, but there's no specific focus of bringing that back in. It's across the portfolio.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Terrific. Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks everyone. So Eddie, I'll also start with the Active WM, but just trying to gauge the results there versus your expectations, frankly I think two tier 1 wins are pretty impressive in the first quarter. That's faster than I would have expected. But I'm also seeing the license number be and kind of move higher for the year. So I'm just trying to understand maybe where you saw the upside this quarter versus your expectations on the on the WMS side?\nEddie Capel: Yes. What are we \u2013 we were six weeks in, essentially from release date. We had one early adopter that went live pre-release and so forth and two tier 1 wins in the six week period, the balance of the quarter. So we're pretty darn excited about that I got to say. And the activity continues to be pretty solid for sure. The license activity was a little stronger than we anticipated, not by orders of magnitude, but a little stronger. We're pleased about that. Frankly, it wasn't one big deal or anything just an aggregation of smaller deals that brought us a nice license quarter.\nBrian Peterson: Understood, and maybe pivoting to Active Omni or omnichannel. We've been talking about this for a while, and I think a lot of us think that omnichannel and a lot of the things that you offer are table stakes. But we \u2013 obviously with COVID we're seeing that a lot of these retailers or various providers don't have these systems in place. So I'm curious \u2013 versus where we stand now, if we use the baseball analogy, what inning are we in, in terms of this omnichannel adoption? Are we still early innings or late innings? Like how would you help us think about that?\nEddie Capel: Yes, I think there's still plenty of runway. We're past batting practice, that's for sure. I think \u2013 I would say we're probably in the second or third inning. I really do think there's a lot of runway to go here. We are going to \u2013 I think we've been seeing store dislocation and transformation going on for a couple of years now. So I think we are going to see that accelerate through this pandemic, which is going to drive yet more omnichannel strategies, the need for omnichannel strategy, the need for selling ubiquitously across those channels. And so we're excited about the opportunity given the investments we've made over the last decade plus.\nBrian Peterson: Understood. Thanks, Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Thank you, Brian. See you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yun Kim from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.\nYun Kim: All right. Thank you. Hey, Eddie, in regard to that migration of on-prem WMS to Active WM within your installed base, do you expect a faster adoption of Active WM among your active omni instilled base? Or is that really not a factor?\nEddie Capel: I don't think it's much of a factor Yun frankly. I mean, I think, we will see active omni customers adopt Active WM. It sort of makes sense for them. Frankly, they're already running the platform. It is the exact same technology underpinnings and so forth. So there's a combination of confidence, familiarity and common sense to consolidate on a common platform. So I think we'll see some of that. What is great about where we are in terms of our Manhattan Active WM release is we have a three year plus highly proven technology platform that we released on. So, whilst it is a newer solution, we've been running Manhattan Active Omni on this technology platform for three plus years now, tier 1 super high, super high volumes and so forth. So I think we're in a good spot there. And as we've talked about the enthusiasm for Manhattan Active WM across our customer base and the prospect base too, but particularly in our customer base has been very encouraging in the six or seven weeks since the announcement.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Obviously a lot of focus on Active WMS, but sometimes we forget about your main cloud business that's driving your IPO, that\u2019s Active Omni. I believe Active Omni business maybe a little bit more driven by the retail vertical than the WMS, but your RPO growth remains pretty solid. Any particular trend that you were seeing such as between new and existing or any kind of changes that you made in terms of go to market around Active Omni since the emergence of COVID? Any particular vertical that's adopting the Active Omni product who are planning to adopt the Active Omin product because of the COVID?\nEddie Capel: Yes. So I would say, no major shifts. If I were to \u2013 if I had to think about a little bit of a \u2013 sort of a phenomenon we are seeing whether it would be existing customers or new customers, frankly, look for those quick wins, right. That \u2013 those customers that \u2013 and prospects, excuse me, that simply did not have a buy online, pickup-from-store strategy or a curbside pickup strategy or picking up the red phone, right. And we need something quickly. So we are seeing \u2013 and we'll take them all day long, sort of a little bit smaller, a little bit faster, quick hit high value initiatives that the market is asking for, and that is inside of retail, inside of retail, since the onset of COVID.\nYun Kim: Okay. And then just stepping back obviously a lot has happened to your target markets, since the COVID. Can you update us on your latest thoughts on \u2013 maybe on the strategic acquisitions especially given, like I said, how fundamental \u2013 fundamentals of your target market have really evolved rather quickly here due to COVID. Do you feel that you may need to like beef up on certain capabilities like I don\u2019t know more traditional forecasting kind of side of the business to better target to manufacturers maybe more grocery oriented solutions out there or even more traditional supply chain stuff? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Yes. So, always interested in M&A and acquisitions that fit strategically within the footprint, number one. Number two, as you pointed out, could it increase our total addressable market, but as we've always said and you know this, we're not going to buy more of what we've already got. We're not going to buy aging technology. It\u2019s got to be a solid hurdle rate and those kinds of things, but maybe the most important, I think, is that, I mean, we are right in the middle of what's going on from a supply chain transformation perspective. Supply chain never been more important than it is today. I think we would all agree with that kind of personally and professionally, the need for contingencies being built into the supply chain strategically strategic resilience being built into the supply chain. And the shift, the continued shift from traditional bricks and mortar to digital commerce. And we've been right in the middle of that. We've got a lot of work still to be done. We've got a long roadmap in front of us. And I think our opportunity going forward is significant that. Now \u2013 so, what that leads us to is we have \u2013 our vision is to deliver brand new innovation to the market because the market is changing and it needs new capabilities, not old capabilities repackaged, brand new capabilities. So the opportunity for us is to continue to invest in brand new innovation and deliver it to the marketplace. And it's the great thing about this Active platform that we've got, we can develop brand new innovation and we can deliver it every 90 days, every 90 days. And so, in summary, always looking for great acquisition targets, but principally focused on investing in brand new white space innovation.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Thanks so much for that Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Yes. My pleasure, Yun. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Benchmark. Your line is open.\nMark Schappel: Hi, good afternoon, and nice job on the quarter. Most of my questions have been answered, just a couple. Eddie with respect to Active WMS, with respect to the pipeline for that solution, are you seeing any customer interest from a particular industry? I know it's early, but at this point in this \u2013 in the game, are you seeing any particular industry that's latching onto that or some\u2026\nEddie Capel: No. Actually, the great thing Mark is really it is across industry, from retail to wholesale, 3PL, life sciences, pharma, it's really widespread. So, on one hand, concentration of interest would be great, but even better, of course, is broad interest. And by the way, the interest is also global as well as across vertical. So that's created again that extra little bit of enthusiasm for us.\nMark Schappel: Great. That's good to hear and then just a follow-up here. Last quarter, you noted that some of your customers such as like grocers or distributors were delaying some projects just because they were just too swamped and they're focusing on managing their own business.\nEddie Capel: Yes.\nMark Schappel: I assume that this has subsided somewhat. Could you just comment on that a little bit?\nEddie Capel: Yes, well, it subsided a little. They're still pretty busy, but it's a comb \u2013 you're right. There is a combination of some of that \u2013 frankly panic buying and so forth has eased a little number one. And then number two, of course, the grocers, pet supply retailers and so forth have adapted to these higher volumes and managing and they're not being sort of surprised on a day by day basis anymore. So now, we're certainly starting to see those guys refocus, look at some of the strategic initiatives and think about opening up those programs again.\nMark Schappel: Great. That's good to hear. Thank you. That's all for me.\nEddie Capel: Okay, good. Thank you, Mark. I appreciate it.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to the presenters.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Very good, Jason, thank you. Well, thank you everybody for joining us on our Q2 call. As always, we appreciate your support and interest in Manhattan Associates. We\u2019ll look forward to updating you again in about 90 days or so. And in the meantime, please, everybody make sure that you stay healthy, stay safe and we'll \u2013 again, we'll look forward to speaking to you again in about 90 days. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter 2020 results and we discuss our outlook for the balance of the year. And before we go into detail about how the business performed in the quarter, I wanted to take a step back for a moment and just make a couple of high-level comments. Now at Manhattan Associates, we're committed each and every day to serving our customers. Frankly, our customers depend on us to execute every single day and deliver on our promises so that they can deliver on their promises. Their customers, consumers depend on them to deliver the goods and services that they need to live, and never has this been more critical than during this global pandemic. And it's more apparent than ever that there's a growing market need for modern, adaptable supply chain inventory and omnichannel solutions. And the criticality of that need is not lost on us. And we believe that we're very well positioned at the intersection of this changing world. So now back to the discussion of our results. Manhattan reported a solid quarter despite the visible effects that COVID-19 is having across the global economy. Specifically, we reported total revenue of $136 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.40, both of which exceeded our expectations. Cloud, license and services revenue, combined with disciplined expense management, drove solid earnings leverage, delivering an adjusted operating margin of 25.3%. That's about 200 basis points higher than the same period last year. And while we've seen better-than-expected demand for our supply chain and omnichannel products and services, the near-term timing and continued pace of economic recovery is somewhat unclear. But in our world, there are signs that seem to be encouraging. And as such, we're raising our full year total revenue and adjusted EPS guidance to reflect our views for the balance of the year. Now we continue to invest in the business to drive long-term sustainable growth while focusing on profitable execution and diligent capital allocation in order to capitalize on the evolving market trends. And furthermore, our dedication to innovation remains. And we expect to invest nearly $80 million in R&D this year, even with this macro backdrop. Now looking at our current pipeline, we see a pretty healthy set of global opportunities, with our cloud pipeline trending favorably, giving us confidence in reinforcing our belief that the mission-critical products that we offer are needed now more than ever. Specifically, over 60% of our pipeline at the end of the quarter is comprised of cloud opportunities, and that's compared with 40% a year ago. And while we've seen some delays in closing pipeline opportunities, we haven't experienced any notable cancellations. And our second-half pipeline is trending somewhat favorably relative to our first half. And additionally, we're seeing a broader and more diverse set of opportunities in our pipeline as interest grows from non-retail verticals such as automotive, third-party logistics, life sciences, automotive and then all the way to manufacturing and wholesale. And finally, about 50% of our deal opportunities continue to be represented by net new logos globally. Now turning to our services business. Despite having the restriction of limited face-to-face engagements with our customers, we remain active, providing real-time support and delivering a variety of project work while executing system go-lives remotely. In the second quarter we conducted nearly 130 system go-lives, reflecting solid execution in the current environment. By the way, build travel which is margin-neutral, but does contribute to the overall services revenue, is down significantly versus last year for obvious reasons. And this represents about a 4% headwind to year-over-year services revenue growth. And while the lack of travel and face-to-face engagement is challenging, the ability of our professional services team to continue to deliver high quality complex work remotely really underscores our ability to adapt and to deliver in this dynamic and difficult time. Now on the sales and marketing front, our competitive win rates remain strong at about 70%-plus against our head-to-head competition, with about 30% of our license and cloud deals representing net new customers. Then here we are at the halfway point, really, of our 5-year cloud transition, and we're experiencing a significant shift in market demand for our cloud solutions across all of our verticals. And verticals that collectively drove more than 50% of our cloud and license revenue in the quarter were retail and consumer goods, government and food, beverage and grocery. And within these verticals, we saw robust demand for specific capabilities within our active omni suite, such as buy online, pickup-in-store, curbside pickup, and store inventory fulfillment. With so many physical stores closed during Q2, the ability of retail and consumer-facing brands to fulfill orders in creative ways was really in great demand. And we were able to standup these solutions really in a very short amount of time. And the ability for these brands have flexible distribution and selling channels is really more critical than ever. And the solutions that we offer have become a key enabler to these activities. I would like to, just for a minute, pivot a bit and give you some updates on recent advancements across our product portfolio. So let's start with maybe one of the most significant announcements in our company's history. During our online user conference in May, Momentum Connect, we unveiled Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, the next-generation of warehouse management, re-architected from the ground floor up as cloud-native, micro services-based and a versionless application. Manhattan Active WM is a step change in agility and speed of innovation within the supply chain execution landscape. With Manhattan Active WM, we were able to deliver new feature functionality every single quarter while still offering full extensibility of the core application. And while our customers continue to be extremely satisfied using our base capability inside of warehouse management, we see that customer-driven extensibility as a solution imperative with the ability for our customers to add their secret sauce and innovation on top of our platform. All while taking advantage of new capabilities that we deliver every single quarter. And we believe this is a really winning combination as well as a first-of-its-kind in the supply chain execution industry. And the underlying technology which makes this all possible is our Manhattan Active application architecture that made its debut in 2017 when we launched Manhattan Active Omni. Now relative to the live customers, we had an early adopter customer live on Manhattan Active WM prior to our release announcement of Manhattan Connect, Pet Supplies Plus. They went live in April, and actually due to unforeseen events associated with the pandemic, they've been shipping record volumes with Manhattan Active WM ever since. And they're now planning to roll out the remaining DCs in their networks. And additionally, we've also signed several other customer implementations of Manhattan Active WM. They're underway. They were large Tier 1 global brands, and we closed them inside the quarter. Now in addition to its groundbreaking technology, Manhattan Active WM delivers a number of next-generation feature function enhancements including customer grade configurable mobile applications for the associates inside the distribution center, a suite of in-line analytical user interfaces built right into Manhattan Active WM, which we call our Unified Control screens and a next-generation of algorithm focused on taking operational optimization simply to the next level. And finally, we've got a brand-new set of capabilities that we call employee engagement, a whole new way for distribution center managers and associates to interact with one another throughout the day. So in brief, that's Manhattan Active WM. And as you'd imagine, we're very excited about the release of \u2013 about this particular release. And it's really been the largest product investment in the history of Manhattan Associates. And whilst the time frame and expense of the undertaking were certainly significant, we felt that it was undoubtedly the right path to position both Manhattan and our customers to deliver best-in-class performance for the next decade. And while Manhattan Active WM was admittedly our focal point of our attention in recent times, I'm excited that we've been able to make significant strides in parallel across other applications within our portfolio. So I'll touch on just a couple of those. First, staying with our supply chain suite, we recently shipped an exciting new version of our transportation management solution that included an all-new major update to our dispatch capability and a significant update of our transportation modeling solution. For our customers who operate their own delivery fleet, dispatch management is really an integral part of the transportation management operation. And a number of our fleet-operating customers have already signed up to move to this completely redesigned and rebuilt solution. And we're excited to help them power the ever-growing last-mile delivery network of today and tomorrow. And next, a quick update on Manhattan Active Omni. As I mentioned in Q1, Manhattan Active Omni customers are really innovating at record pace to adapt their order fulfillment, delivery and pickup methods in light of the changing regulations associated with the pandemic. The volumes we're seeing so far for BOPUS orders and buy online, pickup-in-store are really off the charts, frankly, with some of our customers experiencing tenfold increases in volume. And additionally in Q2, we accelerated the release for curbside pickup into both our digital self-service and store fulfillment modules. This consumer research indicates that a curbside pickup is one of those fulfillment methods likely to persist even after the pandemic. And having an industrial strength process and technology in place is really a must have for omni channel retailers. Because of the Manhattan Active architecture, we were able to make curbside pickup support available to all of the Manhattan Active Omni customers in really record time. And last but not least on the product side, we launched a completely new application within our inventory suite, Momentum Connect this quarter. It's called Manhattan Active Allocation and its purpose built for our fashion and apparel retail customers. Because while we've had best-in-class forecasting and replenishment applications for our customers who manage relatively static product assortment. Manhattan Active Allocation is the first time we'll have a sophisticated inventory optimization offering for fast fashion customers who manage their inventory using a completely different process. And Manhattan Active Allocation launches with really two major differentiating features. Omni Channel is built right into the core of its design. And it also resides on the Manhattan Active application architecture, which we talked about before. And we think this is really a game changer for the soft lines allocation space. And we plan to make it generally available a little bit later in the year. So hopefully you'll agree. It was a pretty big quarter for the evolution of our product portfolio. And we're excited to work with that customers to light up all of these new capabilities. So that covers my broader business update. And Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance, discuss 2020 full year guidance, and I'll close with a few prepared remarks and a brief summary. So Dennis? Okay. Thank you, Dennis. Well, as we close out today's call, we recognize that the world is evolving fast from changing cultural norms to diverging consumer tastes and behaviors. There's never been a more crucial time to have a modern, adaptive and flexible supply chain and omni channel commerce set of solutions. To win today means investing in the future and we recognize this. And we continue to see customers adapt to this paradigm. And as a leader in the digital commerce space, our goal is to enable our customers to succeed and to be resilient through continued innovation and by investing in a talented global workforce. We believe that we're well positioned to capitalize on these trends and see no shortage of opportunities as we progress on that path of long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. At Manhattan, we never settle. Even in these difficult times, we remain focused on delivering on our commitments, advancing our product portfolio through market leading innovation and ensuring our customers are equipped to succeed in this challenging macro dynamic. We've experienced challenges like this before. Although this one is a bit different, admittedly, and we've consistently emerge stronger and better position, and we see no reason as to why this time is any different at people, at innovation and at culture are the heart and soul of our organization. And that's why I'm just so excited about what the future holds for all of us here at Manhattan Associates. So Jason, I'm ready now to take any questions. Yes. So both of the deals are definitely with Tier one global customers. They are very nice substantial deals, but there is still a lot of upside behind them for the global rollout, for sure. With regard to kind of adoption, well, it's enthusiasm, adoption and momentum. I would say it's early, of course, given that we just announced in mid May. But it feels very strong, great enthusiasm from really across the board customers, prospects, industry analysts, and so forth pretty excited about the solution. And as we've mentioned, pipeline seems pretty strong, engagement with both prospects and customers is high. So the prospects are pretty good. Well, so there's two pieces. You've made the point about the branded guys who are going kind of direct-to-consumer. There are also industries that are starting to go direct-to-consumer that we maybe would have not sort of expected to before and haven't maybe seen as retailers. Just one example. Automotive spare parts, for example, typically, captive to the dealer network and so forth. You're starting to see those secondary markets look like direct-to-consumer, which is a great opportunity for us, number one. As we release our new solutions, particularly WM, cloud native, innovation that we're delivering on a quarterly basis, we certainly do see the opportunity for penetrating in verticals that we may not have been the strongest in the past. CPE is one that sort of brings to mind where we're seeing some good early interest. So opening up some additional TAM, certainly. Yes. Look, a few more projects than we thought, Terry. I mean, look, honestly, we were unsure coming into the quarter as to exactly how things would pan out. And frankly, they firmed up. They firmed up a little bit as the quarter went on. And I think all of us, personally and professionally, we're a little unsure. And there's still a great deal of uncertainty going \u2013 moving forward. There's no question about that, but things firmed up for us. Yes. So we're pleased about that. And very pleased with the ability of the team here to be able to execute at pretty unusual circumstances. But thanks for your questions. Yes, that's an interesting question, Matt. It is just about smack down the middle, 50-50, existing customers and in new logos. I mean to give you some other sort of commentary around that. Just it is surprising maybe. It's smack down the middle, about 50-50. So we're very encouraged by that. Yes. There's definitely upside for us there. Most of our contracts are annual volumes. So when you see a short-term pickup in volume, there is no immediate impact for us. It really gets reconciled kind of at the end of the year. But certainly, a positive for sure. Yes. Well, so I think the simple headline answer is it's very positive for us. Now obviously, the impact of COVID on the global macro and so forth, if we put that aside, and to your point, talk about the shift in the dynamics of retail and so forth. We've been on the front end, of course, of servicing direct-to-consumer omnichannel customers, really for more than a decade. It's a strength of ours. We've always predicted continued shift from bricks-and-mortar to digital. And this acceleration is really just very, very helpful for us. I mean I think there's going to be some kind of pullback of today's numbers when we get back into a situation where bricks-and-mortar are fully open. But I do think there's \u2013 clearly, some of these initiatives, curbside particularly, buy online, pickup-in-store that they're going to remain just simply because of the convenience that people have now really realized is there. So right in the sweet spot of where we've been operating and where we are going. Pleasure Matt. Thank you. Yes. Good question, Joe. So I would say that the early interest has certainly been with what we would consider Tier one customers. I think that there's been sort of a shift, but a little bit of change. Some of the cloud solutions that have been out there for a while are really candidly on-premise solutions that are hosted in the cloud, which is great, if you're trying to not be in the data center business and so forth. You can kind of move yourself off to the cloud. And that's been attractive to kind of the lower-tier customers. But when you build a true native cloud application, have the ability to be able to deliver real first-class of world-class innovation every 90 days, that sure becomes appealing to Tier 1 customers around the world. So I think that's really the difference and why we've seen Tier 1 customers now truly embracing cloud WM versus it just being sort of a simple lift and shift, hey, I don't have a big IT organization so I'll pop it up in the cloud. So that would be sort of answer number one. In terms of our ability to be able to now have a broader geographic reach, a broader reach into all tiers, that is certainly something that is an objective of ours. It's well aligned with a true cloud strategy, but the early interest is largely being with Tier one. Yes. I mean, I think, it's a fair to look at it. There are those natural upgrade cycles that we're going to be able to kind of latch onto, to use that expression. I think that there is the opportunity for some folks that will accelerate those upgrade discussions because they can get their hands on brand-new innovation that delivers real ROI faster, and we're going to certainly help them with those business cases. We're going to see \u2013 clearly, we're going to see some customers, as we always do with technology transitions, have a pretty long tail on the migration. And \u2013 but the great news is they can do it at their own pace. They can migrate at their own pace. There's no particular acceleration required, they get to do it at their own pace and frankly, we'll be there for them when they're ready. Yes, really, across the across the board, Joe. There's always \u2013 based upon product life cycle and so forth, the R&D investment moves a little bit from product to product, but there's no specific focus of bringing that back in. It's across the portfolio. Terrific. Thank you, Joe. Yes. What are we \u2013 we were six weeks in, essentially from release date. We had one early adopter that went live pre-release and so forth and two tier 1 wins in the six week period, the balance of the quarter. So we're pretty darn excited about that I got to say. And the activity continues to be pretty solid for sure. The license activity was a little stronger than we anticipated, not by orders of magnitude, but a little stronger. We're pleased about that. Frankly, it wasn't one big deal or anything just an aggregation of smaller deals that brought us a nice license quarter. Yes, I think there's still plenty of runway. We're past batting practice, that's for sure. I think \u2013 I would say we're probably in the second or third inning. I really do think there's a lot of runway to go here. We are going to \u2013 I think we've been seeing store dislocation and transformation going on for a couple of years now. So I think we are going to see that accelerate through this pandemic, which is going to drive yet more omnichannel strategies, the need for omnichannel strategy, the need for selling ubiquitously across those channels. And so we're excited about the opportunity given the investments we've made over the last decade plus. Yes. Thank you, Brian. See you. I don't think it's much of a factor Yun frankly. I mean, I think, we will see active omni customers adopt Active WM. It sort of makes sense for them. Frankly, they're already running the platform. It is the exact same technology underpinnings and so forth. So there's a combination of confidence, familiarity and common sense to consolidate on a common platform. So I think we'll see some of that. What is great about where we are in terms of our Manhattan Active WM release is we have a three year plus highly proven technology platform that we released on. So, whilst it is a newer solution, we've been running Manhattan Active Omni on this technology platform for three plus years now, tier 1 super high, super high volumes and so forth. So I think we're in a good spot there. And as we've talked about the enthusiasm for Manhattan Active WM across our customer base and the prospect base too, but particularly in our customer base has been very encouraging in the six or seven weeks since the announcement. Yes. So I would say, no major shifts. If I were to \u2013 if I had to think about a little bit of a \u2013 sort of a phenomenon we are seeing whether it would be existing customers or new customers, frankly, look for those quick wins, right. That \u2013 those customers that \u2013 and prospects, excuse me, that simply did not have a buy online, pickup-from-store strategy or a curbside pickup strategy or picking up the red phone, right. And we need something quickly. So we are seeing \u2013 and we'll take them all day long, sort of a little bit smaller, a little bit faster, quick hit high value initiatives that the market is asking for, and that is inside of retail, inside of retail, since the onset of COVID. Yes. So, always interested in M&A and acquisitions that fit strategically within the footprint, number one. Number two, as you pointed out, could it increase our total addressable market, but as we've always said and you know this, we're not going to buy more of what we've already got. We're not going to buy aging technology. It's got to be a solid hurdle rate and those kinds of things, but maybe the most important, I think, is that, I mean, we are right in the middle of what's going on from a supply chain transformation perspective. Supply chain never been more important than it is today. I think we would all agree with that kind of personally and professionally, the need for contingencies being built into the supply chain strategically strategic resilience being built into the supply chain. And the shift, the continued shift from traditional bricks and mortar to digital commerce. And we've been right in the middle of that. We've got a lot of work still to be done. We've got a long roadmap in front of us. And I think our opportunity going forward is significant that. Now \u2013 so, what that leads us to is we have \u2013 our vision is to deliver brand new innovation to the market because the market is changing and it needs new capabilities, not old capabilities repackaged, brand new capabilities. So the opportunity for us is to continue to invest in brand new innovation and deliver it to the marketplace. And it's the great thing about this Active platform that we've got, we can develop brand new innovation and we can deliver it every 90 days, every 90 days. And so, in summary, always looking for great acquisition targets, but principally focused on investing in brand new white space innovation. Yes. My pleasure, Yun. Thank you. No. Actually, the great thing Mark is really it is across industry, from retail to wholesale, 3PL, life sciences, pharma, it's really widespread. So, on one hand, concentration of interest would be great, but even better, of course, is broad interest. And by the way, the interest is also global as well as across vertical. So that's created again that extra little bit of enthusiasm for us. Yes. Yes, well, it subsided a little. They're still pretty busy, but it's a comb \u2013 you're right. There is a combination of some of that \u2013 frankly panic buying and so forth has eased a little number one. And then number two, of course, the grocers, pet supply retailers and so forth have adapted to these higher volumes and managing and they're not being sort of surprised on a day by day basis anymore. So now, we're certainly starting to see those guys refocus, look at some of the strategic initiatives and think about opening up those programs again. Okay, good. Thank you, Mark. I appreciate it. Okay. Very good, Jason, thank you. Well, thank you everybody for joining us on our Q2 call. As always, we appreciate your support and interest in Manhattan Associates. We'll look forward to updating you again in about 90 days or so. And in the meantime, please, everybody make sure that you stay healthy, stay safe and we'll \u2013 again, we'll look forward to speaking to you again in about 90 days. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. So for second quarter, total revenue was up $135.6 million, down 12% over the prior year, solely related to COVID-19 impacts. Our total revenue estimate for the third quarter is a range of $136 million to $140 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.40. GAAP earnings per share was $0.30 with stock-based compensation accounting for the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS. Our adjusted earnings per share target for third quarter is $0.39 within a range of $0.38 to $0.40. License revenue was $5.7 million in the quarter above our expectations but down year-over-year as demand for our solutions continues to shift the cloud. We signed two, $1 million plus deals in the quarter with roughly 20% of all licensed deals coming from new customers. For the third quarter, we expect between $5 million to $7 million in license revenue. For the full year, we now estimate license revenue will be approximately $28 million to $31 million. Of course, as we pointed out in our release in earlier in the call, uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic could affect our performance against our estimates. Cloud revenue was a record $18.5 million, up a 105% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, driven by continued customer demand for our cloud solutions across all of the verticals we serve. Of note, we signed two new Manhattan Active Warehouse Management deals in the quarter, both global Tier one customers. No question WMS in the cloud momentum continues to build. Over 70% of our deals in the quarter came from WMS and approximately 45% of our bookings were from either net new customers or net new product sales to existing customers within our install base with a diverse set of opportunities to continue to sell into our existing customer base. For Q3, we estimate our cloud revenue will be $19.5 million to $20 million, which represents about 40% growth year-over-year against a very strong comp driven by our FEMA deal we signed last year. Ex-FEMA, the year-over-year growth rate is about 50%. And for the full year, we estimate our cloud revenue will be $76 million to $78 million, up about 65% at the midpoint. We estimate our cloud and license software mix will be approximately 70% cloud to 30% license for the full year with total software revenue in the range of $104 million to $109 million. At the midpoint of $106.5 million, total software revenue is up 11% representing a record software year, while staring down a pandemic and absorbing a 40% decline in license revenue versus 2019. Turning to bookings, as we have discussed, remaining performance obligation or RPO is the leading proxy for our cloud bookings performance and represents the value of contractual obligations required to be performed otherwise referred to as unearned revenue or bookings. Our RPO for the quarter totaled $225 million, up 87% over prior year and 11% sequentially. We continue to estimate that our year end RPO will fall within a range of $265 million to $275 million. For Manhattan, this disclosed value represents our cloud bookings value of unearned revenue under non-cancelable contracts greater than one year. Contracts with a non-cancelable term of one year or less are excluded from the reported amount. And one last point on the license and cloud, our performance does continue to depend on the number and relative value of large deals we closed in any quarter, while this is positive deal sizes may be slightly smaller as subscription revenue is recognized over time. Further, some customers have longer implementation cycles associated with large distribution footprints requiring a wrap subscription model, which can impact sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. We also retain appropriate caution around slow decision making by some clients and prospects, particularly retailers in light of COVID-19. So moving on to maintenance, revenue for the quarter totaled $35.9 million, down 4% versus the prior year. Our customer retention rates remain strong at greater than 95% plus. For the third quarter, we estimate our maintenance revenue for Q3 will be approximately $36.5 million to $37 million. And for full year 2020, our estimate is $145 million. Turning to services, consulting revenue for the quarter totaled $71.8 million, down 24% year-over-year as expected and solely driven by COVID. Again, I'd like to point out that excluding billed travel, we're down about 20% year-over-year. We expect near term services revenue trends will continue to be governed by the pace and degree of the normalization of economic activity impacted by COVID-19. We estimate our services revenue for Q3 will be approximately $72 million to $73 million. And our full year 2020 services revenue will be in a range of $292 million to $303 million. At the midpoint of $297.5 million, services will be down about 17% versus 2019, excluding billed travel services revenue is down 14% and includes our expected seasonal fourth quarter decline due to retail peak season. Our consolidated subscription maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 52.4% driven by operating leverage as our cloud revenue begins to scale. Our third quarter estimate is approximately 52.4%, approximately 270 basis points higher than 2019. Our full year estimate is approximately 51.2%. Moving to operating income and margin, Q2 adjusted operating income totaled $34.3 million with an adjusted operating margin of 25.3%. For the third quarter, we estimate our adjusted operating margin to be within a range of 24% to 24.2%, nice tight range there. Our Q2 adjusted effective income tax rate was 24%. And guess what? Our third quarter and full year tax rate will be approximately 24% as well. Regarding our capital structure, we suspended our share repurchase program effective April 1, 2020 as previously discussed. Our repurchase authority remains at $50 million. And this program continues to be an important part of our long-term capital allocation strategy. We will continue to evaluate the appropriate time for a resumption of our buyback program. For the third quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding will be approximately $64.5 million. Turning to cash. We closed the quarter with cash and investments of $124 million and zero debt. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled $119 million, up 13% sequentially on maintenance and cloud billings. Q2 cash flow from operations totaled $49 million. CapEx for the quarter totaled $0.5 million. We estimate full year capital expenditures to be in the range $5 million to $7 million. Now, I'll turn to our updated annual guidance. We continue to model and review multiple scenarios in order to provide the investment community with our best estimate of financial performance for the remainder of the year. While these estimates have been rigorously vetted, there are certain external factors that are out of our control and may produce results that are different from what we've modeled.  Specifically for annual guidance, our full year total revenue range is now expected to be between $554 million to $570 million. Our target objective is to achieve $562 million in total revenue. Our full year adjusted earnings per share \u2013 diluted per share range is expected to be between a $1.53 to a $1.59. Our target objective is a $1.56 compared to our previous guidance midpoint of a $1.54. Our full year GAAP earnings per diluted share range is expected to be a $1.17 to a $1.23 with a midpoint of a $1.20. And our full year adjusted operating margin is expected to fall within a range of 22.9% to 23.1%. So that covers my financial update. I'll turn the call back over to Eddie."

As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, April 21, 2020. I'd now like to introduce Eddie Capel, CEO; Dennis Story, CFO; and Matt Humphries, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Humphries, you may begin your conference.\nMatt Humphries: Thank you, Jessie, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates\u2019 First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance, and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019 and the risk factor discussion in that report, as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Q. We note in particular that uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our Web site at manh.com. I\u2019d like to turn the call now over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: All right. Thank you, Matt. Well, good afternoon everyone. Before I begin my comments related to Manhattan Associates, I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank some of the heroes of our COVID-19 world. The healthcare workers, first responders are appropriately receiving great commendations, respect and thanks from every corner of the world, and we at Manhattan Associates join in thanking them for their amazing dedication and the personal sacrifices that they're making to keep us healthy and also care for those that are unwell. So thank you. But I can tell you from firsthand experience, both personally and professionally, there are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of supply chain heroes working every day all around the globe to maintain the flow of life sustaining products, food, beverages, pharmaceuticals and yes toilet paper, into the communities that they serve and we live in. These heroes are putting themselves at risk every single day to keep critical supply chains moving. So thank you. Thank you to the truck drivers, the warehouse operators, the retail associates and all of supply chain professionals around the world. We're humbled and proud to be working alongside you. So thanks again for everything that you do. So back to Manhattan Associates and thank you again for joining us as we review our first quarter 2020 results, and cover in some detail the actions that we've taken and the innovative approaches that we've employed to adapt to today's circumstances. Additionally, we're going to be providing updates to our financial guidance, bearing in mind the impact that COVID-19 is having on our business globally. Manhattan reported another record revenue quarter despite business activities slowing in the last few weeks of March. Specifically, we reported total revenue of $154 million that's up 4% year-over-year and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.40. Our cloud and license businesses combined with expense management drove our outperformance in the period. Now we\u2019ve typically cautioned investors about the impacts the global macro volatility and the impacts that they may have on our business. And that is certainly a fitting disclaimer in the light of events occurring as a result of COVID-19. And as such, we reflected our expectations in this most uncertain time into our full year guidance. Then Dennis will go into that in much more detail in a moment. But we're taking what we feel is an appropriate level of conservatism into our forecast for the remainder of the year. Reflecting what we know today, as well as well as the visibility we have into our business for the remainder of the year. Although it has to be said, recovery timing certainly remains the wildcard. As we outlined a few weeks ago, we've taken proactive steps to position that business in the face of today's uncertainty. These steps are precautionary in nature, enabling us to shoulder any near term disruptions, while further investing in our business as we continue to pivot to becoming a cloud first company. We view the actions we've taken as prudent and we're approaching each and every day with a long term perspective in mind. Furthermore, we've also taken swift steps to ensure the health and safety of our employees globally, while considering the needs and demands for our customers, especially those on the front lines of delivering such needed supplies to local communities. Our daily execution has evolved into a largely virtual model and we continue to find innovative ways to engage with customers and prospects, ensuring that they are fully supportive as they navigate their way through this period, but we're still ensuring to continue our focus on cash flow generation and profitable execution. And I would like to review some of these specific actions that will allow us to manage through this volatile period, while we're ensuring we're positioned to capitalize on market opportunities when we return to a more normal operating environment. Specifically, we reduced our Board of Directors\u2019 fees and the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s salaries by 25%, our Chief financial Officer\u2019s salary by 15% and the salaries of our other named executive officers, certain global leaders and all U. S. employees by 10%. We suspended our 401(k) match program here in the U. S. And for the time being, we suspended our share repurchase program. We have instituted a hiring freeze but only for non-critical roles across the organization. We've reduced planned outlays for discretionary spend across the organization. And as a natural expansion, we've reduced travel and marketing spend as appropriate. And these actions should allow us the flexibility in the near-term to remain focused on the long-term opportunities ahead. The steps we're taking enable us to preserve our global workforce in order to remain agile, while meeting customer demands as it returns. Importantly, our market leading product innovation also remains a priority. And despite global economic headwinds, we're still expecting to invest $72 million to $74 million in research and development this year. Now our global pipelines for customer opportunities remain healthy across both cloud and license, with notable trends in our cloud pipeline specifically and this is due to organic demand and a continued shift from our legacy license business and the appetite for WMS and the cloud continuing to build. Given current market volatility, though, we are seeing some shifts in pipeline opportunities from Q2 into Q3 and Q4. This I have to say though different from past challenging environments, where demand for software simply disappeared. The challenge now is one of timing. In fact, the rest of our year pipeline is over 20% higher than it was when we spoke last quarter, which of course is notably positive, specifically for our cloud business. And in terms of opportunities, we continue to see over 50% of our deal opportunities represented by net new logos. Now turning to our services business. We're active with our customers and we\u2019ve conducted about a hundred customer go lives in Q1. That's about typical of our run rate. But we've taken proactive steps to ensure large amount of services work continues virtually from project kickoffs and designs, including initial build and implementation preparation. And the go live aspect of our services work is being shifted to a remote strategy for the most part. Although, we are performing limited onsite work in certain controlled situations. And we've seen project delays due to customers who are either so consumed by the high levels of business activities, such as grocers and distributors, or those who are focused on managing their own business through this difficult time period. Now with regard specifically to our retail end markets, approximately 20% of our near-term to medium-term services revenue has been impacted, and we've updated our financial guidance to reflect this. And we haven't seen any notable project cancellations. However, we would expect to see demand push back for some of these impacted projects. And the proactive steps we've taken thus far will allow us to continue moving forward with the majority of our services engagement and we'll continue to improvise and adapt to our changing environment in order to meet customer needs and market demand. And finally on the sales and marketing front, our competitive win rates remained strong at 70 plus percent against head-to-head competition with nearly 30% of our licensing cloud deals from either net new customers or net new product into the existing customer base. Verticals driving more than 50% of our cloud and license revenue for the quarter were pretty diverse across retail, consumer goods, government, food, beverage, grocery and life sciences. Now, turning to some of our long-term opportunities, I mentioned earlier, what these recent events have brought to life, not in an environment that we would have wished to have seen. But nonetheless, it is something that we felt and worked toward for years. And that is that supply chain is a more strategic part of our customers\u2019 business than ever before. And the software that we offer is absolutely mission-critical to their success, whether in the normal course of business or in a highly volatile period, such as we see today. We've got countless examples of our customers who were able to quickly adapt their sales, service and fulfillment approaches in response to the changing landscape that we\u2019re all living in. These solutions go beyond streamlining and optimizing the supply chain, but are actively generating revenue and saving order volume through modern adaptive concepts. So let's walk through a few of those. Firstly, let's start with demand forecasting and inventory optimization. Our application in this area is deployed across a wide variety of industries, from pharmaceutical distribution, to grocery, to specialty retail. And our customers can model the types of demand shocks that they're seeing from COVID-19 quickly and easily. That way their inventory planning process responds immediately to these new forecast models and does so without damaging their underlying base forecasts. And it's been exceptionally important for many of our pharmaceutical and grocery distributors, as they are seeing surging demand for certain product categories. And this type of AI and ML driven forecasting and ordering solutions will certainly pay dividends as we move through this uncertain period and trend back towards normal forecasts and ordering patterns. And as we turn to our supply chain solution, when it comes to WMS, for example, the two areas we're hearing our customers take particular advantage of are adaptability and scalability. As you already know, as WMS is the best in the industry scaling out to support the exceptionally high fulfillment volumes that typically come along with ecommerce flash sales and peak holiday seasons. And what we've seen in the last month or so is that scalability being employed by businesses that typically never experienced these type of demand spikes, whether it\u2019d be pharmaceutical companies, grocers, medical equipment companies, the Manhattan WMS has been helping these customers ship first, two, three and four times their daily average volumes. And as you can imagine, channel shift has been very prevalent. We actually saw one customer, a well-known retailer, transform their entire DC operation from retail replenishment to direct to consumer all in a space of six days, and it saved 80% of their order volume that they otherwise would have lost. And what we typically see our customers use retail replenishment and direct to consumer capabilities in tandem, this is the first time that we've seen this type of channel flip to direct to consumer in such a short timeframe. And further on the supply chain front. We're hearing interesting stories about the adaptability and power of our transportation management solution as well. Many of our customers are rapidly reconfiguring their supply network and store hours. And our transportation optimization engine is helping many of our customers increase their shipment volumes to their stores by between 50% and 250%, while also incorporating changes to the operating environment, like hours of service and actual weight limitation changes that have been relaxed by the Department of Transportation. Now timing is a long way from perfect, but Gartner recently published its Magic Quadrant for transportation management system providers and we were thrilled, both again to be a leader and to notably improve our position within the leaders\u2019 quadrant. And we believe our ongoing investment in the solution success and expanding its adoption globally and most of all, the terrific customer satisfaction scores we received have helped us improve our position this year. And closing my product remarks, there\u2019ll be some anecdotes about how we're seeing our omnichannel solutions leveraged in innovative ways to put forth entirely new fulfillment methods and processes all in a matter of days. A particular note is the expanded use of our store fulfillment solutions. Whilst most brick and mortar stores remain closed at the moment, many of the same stores are fulfilling 10 times their normal volume of e-commerce orders. The desire to monetize the inventory that's in those stores, the need to bleed workload off the distribution center and the ambition to improve speed of delivery for customers are driving expanded use of store fulfillment solutions. We even saw one customer activate and roll out the entire solution to all of their stores in less than a week. Now with that, I did want to remind you that next month we'll be hosting our annual user conference, Momentum. And this year, it's going to be in a digital format. And certainly, while we'll miss seeing all of our customers, our partners and our analysts in person, we still plan some significant product announcements that will continue advancing our vision of unified commerce. So that covers the broader business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of our financial performance and discuss our 2020 full year guidance in further detail. And then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary.\nDennis Story: Thanks Eddie. First quarter total revenue was $153.9 million, up 4% organically over prior year, driven by our cloud and license revenue performance. Our total revenue estimate for the second quarter is a range of $122.5 million to $132.5 million. Adjusted earnings per share for Q1 was $0.40. GAAP earnings per share was $0.35 with stock-based compensation accounting for the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS. Our adjusted earnings per share estimate for the second quarter is a range of $0.33 to $0.37. License revenue for Q1 was $9.7 million, above our expectations but down year-over-year as anticipated. We signed three $1 million plus deals in the quarter, with roughly one-third of all license deals coming from new customers. For the second quarter, we are expecting approximately $4 million in license revenue as license revenue mix continues to transition to cloud subscriptions. For the full year, we estimate licensed revenue will be between $23 million to $25 million. Cloud revenue was a record $17.3 million in the quarter, up 120% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, driven by continued customer demand for our cloud solutions across all of the verticals we serve. Of note, we closed our largest Manhattan Active Omni order volume deal in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to see strong demand for WMS in the cloud solutions with over 70% of our deals in the quarter coming from WMS, and nearly 30% of our bookings coming from either net new customers or net new product sales into our existing install base. For the second quarter, we are estimating our cloud revenue to be $18 million to $18.5 million and for the full year, we estimate our cloud revenue to be in the range of $74 million to $78 million. We estimate our cloud and license software mix to be approximately 75% cloud to 25% license for the full year, with software performance totaling $97 million to $103 million, a record for total software despite 51% decline in license revenue versus 2019. Turning to bookings. As we have discussed, remaining performance obligations or RPO is the leading proxy of our cloud bookings performance and represents the value of contractual obligations required to be performed otherwise referred to as unearned revenue or bookings. Our RPO for the quarter totaled $203 million, up 102% over the prior year and 18% sequentially. We continue to estimate that our year end RPO will fall within the range of $265 million to $275 million. For Manhattan, this disclosed value represents our cloud bookings value of unearned revenue under non-cancelable contracts greater than one year. Contracts with a non-cancelable term of one year or less are excluded from this reported amount. And one last point on license and cloud. As you know, our performance continues to depend on the number in relative value of large deals we closed in any quarter. While large license deals historically have been important, our markets continue to shift towards subscription models. While this is positive, deal sizes may be slightly smaller as subscription revenue is recognized overtime. Further, some customers have longer implementation cycles associated with large distribution footprints requiring a ramp subscription model, which can impact sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. We also retain appropriate caution around slow decision making by some clients and prospects, particularly retailers in light of ongoing macro events related to COVID-19. Shifting to maintenance. Revenue for the quarter totaled $35.7 million, roughly flat versus prior year. And as you would expect in this environment, we are purposely focused on ensuring our clients have the support they need to navigate current market uncertainty. Our customer retention rates remain strong at greater than 95 plus percent. And for the second quarter, we estimate our maintenance revenue to be between $34 million and $35 million. Our full year maintenance revenue is estimated to be $143 million to $144 million, nice broad range there. Turning to services. Consulting revenue for the quarter totaled of $87.4 million, down 1% year-over-year. Services revenue trends in the near-term will be dictated by the pace and degree of the normalization of business activities impacted by COVID-19. Our estimate for second quarter services revenue is between $65 million to $72 million at the midpoint of $68 million. This represents a sequential decline of 22% over Q1 2020. We estimate our full year services revenue to be $289 million to $306 million. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 48.7%, largely driven by continued investment in cloud and consulting services, as well as slightly lower services revenue. Our second quarter estimate is for a range of 51.6% to 52.4%, approximately 80 basis points higher than 2019. Our full year estimate is approximately 51.3%, up around 40 basis points versus 2019. Turning to operating income and margin. Q1 adjusted operating income totaled $31.9 million with an adjusted operating margin of 20.7%. For the second quarter, we estimate our adjusted operating margin to fall within a range of 22.2% to 23.2%, another tight range. Our Q4 adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.1%. We estimate our second quarter and full year tax rate to be approximately 24%. Regarding our capital structure. In Q1 2020, we repurchased approximately 337,000 shares worth $25 million. While we suspended our share repurchase activity for the time being, last week our Board of Directors did approve replenishing our repurchase authority limit to $50 million. As such, we will assess ongoing market conditions and internal financial performance in determining when to reinstate our share repurchase program. This program remains a core part of our capital allocation strategy. For the second quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 64 million shares. Turning to cash. We closed the quarter with cash and investments of $75.3 million and zero debt. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled $105.5 million, 12% sequentially on maintenance and cloud billings. Q1 cash flow from operations totaled $12 million, primarily due to performance based compensation stemming from our 2019 financial performance. Finally, capital expenditures totaled $1.2 million in Q1. We estimate full year CapEx to be about $5 million. So that closes the book on Q1 2020. Turning to our updated annual guidance. We've run multiple scenarios in order to build out the appropriate framework for giving investors the best possible forward looking view of the business as we know it today. However, as a caveat, we acknowledge that the assumptions we are making are subject to future actions taken by local, state, federal and international governments, as well as the broader impacts of COVID-19 may or may not have on the global economy. We've revised our 2020 full year revenue outlook, lowering our total revenue forecast to a midpoint of $553 million, down 10.5% over 2019, driven by 17% decline in our services revenue forecast. We feel our services revenue forecast has an appropriate and prudent amount of conservatism built into our outlook. Considering all of these exogenous factors, as Eddie mentioned earlier, we've taken aggressive expense reduction measures to protect earnings without materially impairing our ability to make key investments in R&D to further extend our competitive positioning. With our strong track record of managing expenses from the midpoint of our annual guidance, we've reduced total expenses by about $45 million for the balance of 2020. In terms of quarterly progression, we view Q2 as likely being our weakest quarter of the year, which sequentially from Q1 2020 reflects $24 million or 20% reduction in total expense run rate, with Q3 and Q4 showing some incremental revenue improvement as we move into a more normal business environment. Now, specifically for annual guidance. Our full year revenue range is now expected to be within the range of $541 million to $565 million. Our full year adjusted operating margin is expected to fall within a range of 22.9% to 23.1%, up about 300 basis points from our previous guidance of 20% to 20.5%. Our full year adjusted earnings diluted -- not dilute, share range is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.58 with a midpoint of $1.54 compared to our previous guidance midpoint of $1.57. And our full year GAAP earnings per diluted share range is expected to be $1.16 to $1.24 with a midpoint of $1.20 versus a $1.16 previous guidance. Thank you. That covers the financial update. Back to Eddie for some closing comments.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thanks, Dennis. Now to close out today's call, I want to step back just for a moment and let everybody know that despite the global uncertainty that we're all experiencing, we're acutely focused on the things that we can control. We're taking innovative and proactive approaches to customer engagements, while we're continuing to invest significantly in innovation so that we can expand our total addressable market and drive long term sustainable growth. Our sales and services team remain engaged in all kinds of stages of business and project development, and as we look forward to returning to the normal course of business in the future. These actions that we've taken will set us up for continued success as we move through this choppy period. And as we exit, we would expect to see solid demand for our mission critical supply chain and omnichannel commerce products all around the globe. And we're ensuring that we're positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. While the world moves rapidly around us, I can tell you we're not sitting still. We continue to push possible as we move our vision of unified commerce forward. So thank you. Thank you to all of our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders globally. We realize that this is an extraordinarily difficult time for many and we want to continue to emphasize that we're doing our part to rise to the occasion and meet these challenges head on. Jesse, we're now ready to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Terry Tillman from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: So I'll start off with my preamble, there\u2019s a lot of insight and color. So, I appreciate all that. It's great to see how you guys are helping to drive through these critical supply chains, and I will miss seeing you all day at the conference, okay. So my first question just relates to conservativism. As we think about services projects kind of pushing out, what happened to in terms of timing of you need to get those projects going before we get into this critical window of holiday season, and we\u2019ve already seen some holiday season activity from this transaction volume. But are you assuming that actually the window is still narrow that there's a fair amount of that retail oriented kind of holiday stuff you've got to get up and running? Actually just moves into next year, because we just won't have enough time to install, that\u2019s the first question.\nEddie Capel: Yes, it's a mix of both Terry. So we're still moving a lot of projects forward. I talked about a hundred go lives in Q1, which is a random by that typical run rate. We've got about the same number of go lives planned for Q2. They\u2019ve moved to lot of remote support and so forth. So, there's a lot of go life still moving forward, again, a lot of the strategic projects still moving forward. There are some, the non-essentials is the popular term, the non-essentials and non-critical that I think are likely to push post peak. But we're still planning and our customers are still telling us that there is criticality around getting our systems live before the retail peaks.\nTerry Tillman: And it\u2019s interesting, because it seem like back in like global financial crisis in '09, you'll have like $4 million license quarter you we had a couple of them on the road and I know you don\u2019t want everyone remember that but you did. In the 2Q you\u2019re all talking about over $20 million worth of total software revenue, including subscription. So I just wanted to point that out. But what's interesting is you're talking about 20% increase in pipeline. You also talked about the business feels a lot different than in past cycles. I'm just curious on that pipeline build. What is driving that other than like the digital kind of transformation stuff, the omnichannel or just the diverse customer activity than maybe in the last crisis, which was in '08, '09? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Yes, I think it's a mixture of all of those things. Obviously, we feel like the innovation that we're driving into the field, there's a lot of interest in WMS and the cloud. Manhattan Active Omni is a large portion of that, our continued kind of expansion and vertical expansion. As I mentioned, the challenge here I think is one of timing when we see those things come to fruition. But from overall outlook and a strategic perspective, obviously we're encouraged by pipeline build such as that.\nTerry Tillman: And maybe just last question for Dennis. I think from a cash flow perspective, I don't know if you said anything for the full year. But is there any kind of guidepost to think about cash flow maybe in relationship to net income or operating profit? Or just any kind of puts and takes to think about as we look at our cash flows? Thank you.\nDennis Story: Nothing different than we've put out there before, Terry, probably a ratio of about 1.1 to 1.2 of net income.\nOperator: Matt Pfau with William Blair, your line is open.\nMatt Pfau: First, Eddie wanted to extrapolate a little bit more on those comments about the current situation that you're seeing being different than what you've seen during past slowdowns when demand dissipated. And maybe just expand on what factors you believe are driving this situation to be different than past slowdowns? And then, is it possible we're just in a situation where it's too early to tell if demand will drop off?\nEddie Capel: Well, I think there is uncertainty. There's no question about that and the depth and the size of the crystal ball is certainly in everybody's hands, yours as well as mine. I think the commentary just from the conversations we're having and the feel that we have is that we've got a shorter runway to recovery or attempt to become back to normal course of business. So, investments that are being made or plans are being made, we can we can still see the finish line for those, both us and our customers. We can see the finish line of when those things get finished, when they get -- and when they get executed versus in prior situations whether it be 2001 or '08, '09, I don't think the finish line could be seen there. The other thing that I think is a little different for us as we've done a lot of groundwork building demand for our cloud solutions and that is continuing to pay off. The other factor I've kind of mentioned is about 50% of our pipeline is coming from net new logos. So, that is, I think representative of the type of innovation that we're bringing to the marketplace and the type of innovation the new operating models are going to need. And then finally compared with certainly 2001, but even 2008 and 2009, we have both a broader product footprint and a greater global reach. So that -- those are the things -- like major things that I think are different this time around.\nMatt Pfau: And then just longer term coming out of this, I mean, it seems like your product portfolio is pretty well aligned to the direction that the market needs to go or adapt to at least. So, any changes in terms of how you guys are thinking about future investment priorities within your product portfolio or what areas you expect to be robust coming out of this?\nEddie Capel: Yes, that's a great question Matt. Look, I think I mentioned in my comments, I do think that a little bit selfishly, we've wondered for a couple of decades maybe why supply chain wasn't as a popular of the conversation in the C-suite in the boardroom, as we always thought it should have been. But I think it is front and center of all conversations today. So, the strategic nature of supply chain when we come out of this, I think will be front and center for sure. I think it is recognized that supply chain and supply chain systems are absolutely mission critical. We're right at the middle of that, I think, aside from sort of getting back to businesses, as usual, number one; driving innovation into the marketplace. I think we're going to see a good deal more focus on supply chain resilience that is needed to be put in and additional supply chain contingencies that people add customers and the market is going to want to build, whether that be geographically or locally. Now, as we think about sort of the the shift, clearly, we're seeing during this time a shift, even greater shift toward kind of direct to consumer. So we think our products are on point whether it be WMS, TMS, Manhattan Active Omni, and a demand forecasting and inventory optimization solutions. In terms of product strategy, not much change. There are some sort of adjustments that we will be making absolutely in the near term, even super near term adjustments that we're making. So the things like particularly curbside, right, curbside pickup has become very, very helpful, very popular. You lose some of the -- or a lot of the opportunity to cross sell and upsell, if you're a retailer when you're doing curbside. So we're going to introduce in a matter of days some interesting and innovative solutions that will at least give our retail customers the opportunity to execute on some cross sell, upsell even in a curbside environment. So we will bring some new creativity to bear. Obviously, we can do that because we've got a, sort of version-less cloud native solutions. But the overall product strategy remains intact.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brian Peterson with Raymond James.Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: So, Dennis, I think recurring gross margins, you had that up a bit for the full year. Given what we're seeing on the services side, I am a little surprised that margins wouldn't come down a bit as well. I know there's some other moving parts here. But any color that you can add on was helping the margins? And I'm also curious the shift towards virtual services deployments, how does that impact the overall margin structure?\nDennis Story: Yes, so I'll let Eddie answer the shift to virtual. But on the overall margin profile, the reason it's going up, Brian is, one; denominator, significant haircut on revenue and the aggressive expense management actions that we took. So we've taken about $45 million over the last three quarters of expense across the organization out of the business and obviously services is a large component of that.\nEddie Capel: Yes. From a virtual perspective, I mean, I think, I got to say the teams are executing very well. The customer organizations are adapting incredibly well. It was all kinds of creative solutions that are being employed. And honestly, there is a very little fall off. There is some, but there's very little fall off in productivity and efficiency.\nBrian Peterson : And maybe if I think I heard this right that you were able to kind of pivot with one customer in terms of their e-commerce functionality in six days. As we think about customers really adjusting in real time to the supply chain needs, are you able to really move that services capacity around and kind of help them within days and months as they kind of struggle with this dynamic?\nEddie Capel: Yes, we are. We are, yes. There's actually a couple. That six day week situation, there are two of them. One of them was with a distribution center that was moved from being a retail replenishment. So, ship to store DC to direct to consumer facility on a space of weeks. And we had one other customer that was sort of interesting names -- I'll leave the name off the charter here, but the distribution center was closed by the local government. They only have one distribution center and it was closed. They said, \"My goodness, what we do?\" We said, \"Why don't you start shipping from store? You got inventory there, the stores are closed, you can put -- they were able to put staff in the store. So, they pivoted from using WMS to distribute products through actually using app Manhattan Active Omni solution to ship product out of the store all in a space of six days. Pretty amazing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Yun Kim from Rosenblatt. Your line is open.\nYun Kim: Hi, Eddie and Dennis. Eddie I have a quick question in reference to your comment about 20% improvement in your sales pipeline. Just curious how much of that pipeline improvement did you see, let's say after the first week of March?\nEddie Capel: It was pretty consistent across the quarter Yun actually. I know it might be surprising, but I think that -- I can't fully explain why, but it was pretty balanced across the quarter. I suppose one hypothesis could be some businesses are sort of idling. They're taking the opportunity to focus on strategic projects that could be one reason. But it was spread pretty equally across the quarter.\nYun Kim: And then also, can you just talk about some of the trends that you are seeing out there in the midst of COVID-19? I know you mentioned it in your prepared remarks. But isn't there a greater motivation for customers to move to the cloud sooner than later? And I know you said that the cloud deployments tend to be more gradual. But are you seeing customers or hope maybe seeing customers perhaps thinking about heading up faster deployment cycle once the environment -- the spending environment returns to normal?\nEddie Capel: I would say that, that is true independent of anything else that's going on with COVID. In the last shall we call it 75 days or so, I wouldn't say that we've seen any types of shifts or trends of that type. There hasn't been time, frankly, and businesses have been focused on either dealing with the incredibly high volumes and velocities they've got coming at them or creative solutions to be able to keep their businesses moving forward, such as the ones that we've talked about a little bit or adapting their strategies. And we haven't really got to any particular trends around infrastructure deployment. But I would tell you, that has been the trend, again, regardless particularly for us over the last 12 to 24 months.\nYun Kim : And then for Dennis, how should we think about the margin for the services business? And then also is that -- is the services business -- could that potentially see an immediate uplift once the current travel restrictions get lifted?\nDennis Story: I don't -- one, we're not splitting out the services margin profile, Yun. So could we get an uplift if demand just stamps back? Sure, probably from a revenue perspective for sure. I would say though Yun from I mean that we're all seeing this, this is not unique to us. It appears that businesses going to open and the economy is going to open gradually. It's going to be regional, if not state specific. So, I'm not sure that we're going to see a real fast snapback and any size sort of immediacy. I think we'll see it be gradual. Now, as I said though we're being pretty effective operating in a virtual environment, which also in a way would sort of dull that snapback a lot -- a bit because we're already operating reasonably effectively.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Your line is open.\nMark Schappel : Eddie starting with you. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're seeing, I think you call a tail shift becoming more important to some of your customers. And I was wondering if you just go deeper with respect to your comments maybe as an example or two?\nEddie Capel: Yes, sure. I mean, simply put Mark it's a move away from any brick-and-mortar selling to direct-to-consumer. Now that's with the exception of course of the central businesses, the home improvement and the grocery and the pharmacy folks that are open and seeing surging volumes. But just as about everybody else, you have to through a necessity shift to direct-to-consumer. The other factor there is that some of our customers with seasonal products are moving to some pretty aggressive sales strategies, online sales strategies, because they don't want to get stuck with seasonal inventory that they can't move. And that's I think deriving some pretty high volumes of direct-to-consumer business. So, that really is type of a shift that I'm referring to.\nMark Schappel: And then one additional question here. As you're aware, supply chain solutions require very significant commitments in terms of higher amount of customers. It often takes face-to-face meeting to push a deal over the goal line. I was just wondering if you could just give us an idea, a little bit more details on how the company is managing through the current disruptions, without conducting say on-site pilots or holding face-to-face meetings?\nEddie Capel: Yes, well, I mean, look, sufficed to say there are no face-to-face sales meetings, product demonstrations and so forth. They're all being conducted virtually. I mean, one of the things that we've been very pleased with is, frankly, our tech infrastructure for our 3,500 people all around the world is not just held up, has performed flawlessly, and that's for all of our 900 people or so in research and development as well as professional services and customer support organization. We've actually put in -- not a lot of track here, but we've put in a special customer support program for those that are shipping important and essential commodities into our communities to make sure that we're giving them 24x7 support for all these very high volumes they're seeing of essential products. But then as we shift to sales and marketing, all those meetings are happening virtually. I think the world is getting more comfortable, frankly, with virtual meetings, with video meetings and Webex Teams, Zoom and everything else. And so far the market has been pretty receptive to those types of meetings. Now, there's no question that we would in more ways than one be prefer to be back and front of our customers and prospects. But in the meantime, we've got some great technology that really gets us pretty close.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question ...\nEddie Capel: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hello, everyone. I wanted to go back to this idea of Manhattan as a net beneficiary coming out of this. And the thing that came to mind, the 20% sequential increase in the pipeline, is that a result that's actually better than seasonally it might be the case for this point in the year? Are you already starting to see kind of a lead gen uplift, if you will, given the current environment?\nEddie Capel: No, not really Joe, to be perfectly honest with you. Because the first couple of months of the year, we were honestly seeing really no impact from the COVID situation, let's call it the last months, even less -- a little bit less than that of the quarter we started to see some impact. So I don't think it's seeing a surge because of that. We are seeing, as I mentioned before, a positively disproportionate level of interest in our cloud solutions and supply chain solutions move into the cloud. So that I think is part of it. again, a broader product footprint I think is driving some of thepipeline growth, and our geo expansion to a lesser extent, but our geographic expansion as well.\nDennis Story: Joe, WMS -- as demand for WMS in the cloud pipeline has been a bit of an accelerant as well. So we continue to see the pipeline strengthen on the WMS side.\nJoe Vruwink : And then I just wanted to clarify, I guess make sure I heard something correctly. Eddie, in your prepared remarks, I think you said that 20% of near-term to mid-term service revenue is impacted by, if I heard this right, the retail vertical. And I just wanted to check that because you are bringing the service full year guide down by about 20%. I don't know if it's a coincidence. Those are the same numbers. But it would actually imply that maybe outside of the retail vertical, a lot of project activity is still humming. And I would imagine be it grocery, food and beverage, life science, maybe you've actually gotten a little bit of uplift. So, just any thoughts there.\nEddie Capel: Yes. That's right analysis that you've put into that Joe. There's no question that kind of specialty retail, department stores and so forth are being -- or seem to have been impacted disproportionately. That's why we're seeing that, that shift. But we are seeing certainly the life sciences space, grocery, 3PL move up a little bit.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Very good. Thank you, Jesse, and thank you everybody for joining the call. Thank you as always for your support of Manhattan Associates. We'll look forward to speaking with you again in about 90 days, and we certainly hope that everybody out there is safe, remains safe and is -- we are all in a better spot 90 days from now. Good afternoon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference\u2026",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Matt. Well, good afternoon everyone. Before I begin my comments related to Manhattan Associates, I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank some of the heroes of our COVID-19 world. The healthcare workers, first responders are appropriately receiving great commendations, respect and thanks from every corner of the world, and we at Manhattan Associates join in thanking them for their amazing dedication and the personal sacrifices that they're making to keep us healthy and also care for those that are unwell. So thank you. But I can tell you from firsthand experience, both personally and professionally, there are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of supply chain heroes working every day all around the globe to maintain the flow of life sustaining products, food, beverages, pharmaceuticals and yes toilet paper, into the communities that they serve and we live in. These heroes are putting themselves at risk every single day to keep critical supply chains moving. So thank you. Thank you to the truck drivers, the warehouse operators, the retail associates and all of supply chain professionals around the world. We're humbled and proud to be working alongside you. So thanks again for everything that you do. So back to Manhattan Associates and thank you again for joining us as we review our first quarter 2020 results, and cover in some detail the actions that we've taken and the innovative approaches that we've employed to adapt to today's circumstances. Additionally, we're going to be providing updates to our financial guidance, bearing in mind the impact that COVID-19 is having on our business globally. Manhattan reported another record revenue quarter despite business activities slowing in the last few weeks of March. Specifically, we reported total revenue of $154 million that's up 4% year-over-year and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.40. Our cloud and license businesses combined with expense management drove our outperformance in the period. Now we've typically cautioned investors about the impacts the global macro volatility and the impacts that they may have on our business. And that is certainly a fitting disclaimer in the light of events occurring as a result of COVID-19. And as such, we reflected our expectations in this most uncertain time into our full year guidance. Then Dennis will go into that in much more detail in a moment. But we're taking what we feel is an appropriate level of conservatism into our forecast for the remainder of the year. Reflecting what we know today, as well as well as the visibility we have into our business for the remainder of the year. Although it has to be said, recovery timing certainly remains the wildcard. As we outlined a few weeks ago, we've taken proactive steps to position that business in the face of today's uncertainty. These steps are precautionary in nature, enabling us to shoulder any near term disruptions, while further investing in our business as we continue to pivot to becoming a cloud first company. We view the actions we've taken as prudent and we're approaching each and every day with a long term perspective in mind. Furthermore, we've also taken swift steps to ensure the health and safety of our employees globally, while considering the needs and demands for our customers, especially those on the front lines of delivering such needed supplies to local communities. Our daily execution has evolved into a largely virtual model and we continue to find innovative ways to engage with customers and prospects, ensuring that they are fully supportive as they navigate their way through this period, but we're still ensuring to continue our focus on cash flow generation and profitable execution. And I would like to review some of these specific actions that will allow us to manage through this volatile period, while we're ensuring we're positioned to capitalize on market opportunities when we return to a more normal operating environment. Specifically, we reduced our Board of Directors' fees and the Chief Executive Officer's salaries by 25%, our Chief financial Officer's salary by 15% and the salaries of our other named executive officers, certain global leaders and all U. S. employees by 10%. We suspended our 401(k) match program here in the U. S. And for the time being, we suspended our share repurchase program. We have instituted a hiring freeze but only for non-critical roles across the organization. We've reduced planned outlays for discretionary spend across the organization. And as a natural expansion, we've reduced travel and marketing spend as appropriate. And these actions should allow us the flexibility in the near-term to remain focused on the long-term opportunities ahead. The steps we're taking enable us to preserve our global workforce in order to remain agile, while meeting customer demands as it returns. Importantly, our market leading product innovation also remains a priority. And despite global economic headwinds, we're still expecting to invest $72 million to $74 million in research and development this year. Now our global pipelines for customer opportunities remain healthy across both cloud and license, with notable trends in our cloud pipeline specifically and this is due to organic demand and a continued shift from our legacy license business and the appetite for WMS and the cloud continuing to build. Given current market volatility, though, we are seeing some shifts in pipeline opportunities from Q2 into Q3 and Q4. This I have to say though different from past challenging environments, where demand for software simply disappeared. The challenge now is one of timing. In fact, the rest of our year pipeline is over 20% higher than it was when we spoke last quarter, which of course is notably positive, specifically for our cloud business. And in terms of opportunities, we continue to see over 50% of our deal opportunities represented by net new logos. Now turning to our services business. We're active with our customers and we've conducted about a hundred customer go lives in Q1. That's about typical of our run rate. But we've taken proactive steps to ensure large amount of services work continues virtually from project kickoffs and designs, including initial build and implementation preparation. And the go live aspect of our services work is being shifted to a remote strategy for the most part. Although, we are performing limited onsite work in certain controlled situations. And we've seen project delays due to customers who are either so consumed by the high levels of business activities, such as grocers and distributors, or those who are focused on managing their own business through this difficult time period. Now with regard specifically to our retail end markets, approximately 20% of our near-term to medium-term services revenue has been impacted, and we've updated our financial guidance to reflect this. And we haven't seen any notable project cancellations. However, we would expect to see demand push back for some of these impacted projects. And the proactive steps we've taken thus far will allow us to continue moving forward with the majority of our services engagement and we'll continue to improvise and adapt to our changing environment in order to meet customer needs and market demand. And finally on the sales and marketing front, our competitive win rates remained strong at 70 plus percent against head-to-head competition with nearly 30% of our licensing cloud deals from either net new customers or net new product into the existing customer base. Verticals driving more than 50% of our cloud and license revenue for the quarter were pretty diverse across retail, consumer goods, government, food, beverage, grocery and life sciences. Now, turning to some of our long-term opportunities, I mentioned earlier, what these recent events have brought to life, not in an environment that we would have wished to have seen. But nonetheless, it is something that we felt and worked toward for years. And that is that supply chain is a more strategic part of our customers' business than ever before. And the software that we offer is absolutely mission-critical to their success, whether in the normal course of business or in a highly volatile period, such as we see today. We've got countless examples of our customers who were able to quickly adapt their sales, service and fulfillment approaches in response to the changing landscape that we're all living in. These solutions go beyond streamlining and optimizing the supply chain, but are actively generating revenue and saving order volume through modern adaptive concepts. So let's walk through a few of those. Firstly, let's start with demand forecasting and inventory optimization. Our application in this area is deployed across a wide variety of industries, from pharmaceutical distribution, to grocery, to specialty retail. And our customers can model the types of demand shocks that they're seeing from COVID-19 quickly and easily. That way their inventory planning process responds immediately to these new forecast models and does so without damaging their underlying base forecasts. And it's been exceptionally important for many of our pharmaceutical and grocery distributors, as they are seeing surging demand for certain product categories. And this type of AI and ML driven forecasting and ordering solutions will certainly pay dividends as we move through this uncertain period and trend back towards normal forecasts and ordering patterns. And as we turn to our supply chain solution, when it comes to WMS, for example, the two areas we're hearing our customers take particular advantage of are adaptability and scalability. As you already know, as WMS is the best in the industry scaling out to support the exceptionally high fulfillment volumes that typically come along with ecommerce flash sales and peak holiday seasons. And what we've seen in the last month or so is that scalability being employed by businesses that typically never experienced these type of demand spikes, whether it'd be pharmaceutical companies, grocers, medical equipment companies, the Manhattan WMS has been helping these customers ship first, two, three and four times their daily average volumes. And as you can imagine, channel shift has been very prevalent. We actually saw one customer, a well-known retailer, transform their entire DC operation from retail replenishment to direct to consumer all in a space of six days, and it saved 80% of their order volume that they otherwise would have lost. And what we typically see our customers use retail replenishment and direct to consumer capabilities in tandem, this is the first time that we've seen this type of channel flip to direct to consumer in such a short timeframe. And further on the supply chain front. We're hearing interesting stories about the adaptability and power of our transportation management solution as well. Many of our customers are rapidly reconfiguring their supply network and store hours. And our transportation optimization engine is helping many of our customers increase their shipment volumes to their stores by between 50% and 250%, while also incorporating changes to the operating environment, like hours of service and actual weight limitation changes that have been relaxed by the Department of Transportation. Now timing is a long way from perfect, but Gartner recently published its Magic Quadrant for transportation management system providers and we were thrilled, both again to be a leader and to notably improve our position within the leaders' quadrant. And we believe our ongoing investment in the solution success and expanding its adoption globally and most of all, the terrific customer satisfaction scores we received have helped us improve our position this year. And closing my product remarks, there'll be some anecdotes about how we're seeing our omnichannel solutions leveraged in innovative ways to put forth entirely new fulfillment methods and processes all in a matter of days. A particular note is the expanded use of our store fulfillment solutions. Whilst most brick and mortar stores remain closed at the moment, many of the same stores are fulfilling 10 times their normal volume of e-commerce orders. The desire to monetize the inventory that's in those stores, the need to bleed workload off the distribution center and the ambition to improve speed of delivery for customers are driving expanded use of store fulfillment solutions. We even saw one customer activate and roll out the entire solution to all of their stores in less than a week. Now with that, I did want to remind you that next month we'll be hosting our annual user conference, Momentum. And this year, it's going to be in a digital format. And certainly, while we'll miss seeing all of our customers, our partners and our analysts in person, we still plan some significant product announcements that will continue advancing our vision of unified commerce. So that covers the broader business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of our financial performance and discuss our 2020 full year guidance in further detail. And then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary. Okay. Thanks, Dennis. Now to close out today's call, I want to step back just for a moment and let everybody know that despite the global uncertainty that we're all experiencing, we're acutely focused on the things that we can control. We're taking innovative and proactive approaches to customer engagements, while we're continuing to invest significantly in innovation so that we can expand our total addressable market and drive long term sustainable growth. Our sales and services team remain engaged in all kinds of stages of business and project development, and as we look forward to returning to the normal course of business in the future. These actions that we've taken will set us up for continued success as we move through this choppy period. And as we exit, we would expect to see solid demand for our mission critical supply chain and omnichannel commerce products all around the globe. And we're ensuring that we're positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. While the world moves rapidly around us, I can tell you we're not sitting still. We continue to push possible as we move our vision of unified commerce forward. So thank you. Thank you to all of our employees, our customers, our partners and our shareholders globally. We realize that this is an extraordinarily difficult time for many and we want to continue to emphasize that we're doing our part to rise to the occasion and meet these challenges head on. Jesse, we're now ready to take any questions. Yes, it's a mix of both Terry. So we're still moving a lot of projects forward. I talked about a hundred go lives in Q1, which is a random by that typical run rate. We've got about the same number of go lives planned for Q2. They've moved to lot of remote support and so forth. So, there's a lot of go life still moving forward, again, a lot of the strategic projects still moving forward. There are some, the non-essentials is the popular term, the non-essentials and non-critical that I think are likely to push post peak. But we're still planning and our customers are still telling us that there is criticality around getting our systems live before the retail peaks. Yes, I think it's a mixture of all of those things. Obviously, we feel like the innovation that we're driving into the field, there's a lot of interest in WMS and the cloud. Manhattan Active Omni is a large portion of that, our continued kind of expansion and vertical expansion. As I mentioned, the challenge here I think is one of timing when we see those things come to fruition. But from overall outlook and a strategic perspective, obviously we're encouraged by pipeline build such as that. Well, I think there is uncertainty. There's no question about that and the depth and the size of the crystal ball is certainly in everybody's hands, yours as well as mine. I think the commentary just from the conversations we're having and the feel that we have is that we've got a shorter runway to recovery or attempt to become back to normal course of business. So, investments that are being made or plans are being made, we can we can still see the finish line for those, both us and our customers. We can see the finish line of when those things get finished, when they get -- and when they get executed versus in prior situations whether it be 2001 or '08, '09, I don't think the finish line could be seen there. The other thing that I think is a little different for us as we've done a lot of groundwork building demand for our cloud solutions and that is continuing to pay off. The other factor I've kind of mentioned is about 50% of our pipeline is coming from net new logos. So, that is, I think representative of the type of innovation that we're bringing to the marketplace and the type of innovation the new operating models are going to need. And then finally compared with certainly 2001, but even 2008 and 2009, we have both a broader product footprint and a greater global reach. So that -- those are the things -- like major things that I think are different this time around. Yes, that's a great question Matt. Look, I think I mentioned in my comments, I do think that a little bit selfishly, we've wondered for a couple of decades maybe why supply chain wasn't as a popular of the conversation in the C-suite in the boardroom, as we always thought it should have been. But I think it is front and center of all conversations today. So, the strategic nature of supply chain when we come out of this, I think will be front and center for sure. I think it is recognized that supply chain and supply chain systems are absolutely mission critical. We're right at the middle of that, I think, aside from sort of getting back to businesses, as usual, number one; driving innovation into the marketplace. I think we're going to see a good deal more focus on supply chain resilience that is needed to be put in and additional supply chain contingencies that people add customers and the market is going to want to build, whether that be geographically or locally. Now, as we think about sort of the the shift, clearly, we're seeing during this time a shift, even greater shift toward kind of direct to consumer. So we think our products are on point whether it be WMS, TMS, Manhattan Active Omni, and a demand forecasting and inventory optimization solutions. In terms of product strategy, not much change. There are some sort of adjustments that we will be making absolutely in the near term, even super near term adjustments that we're making. So the things like particularly curbside, right, curbside pickup has become very, very helpful, very popular. You lose some of the -- or a lot of the opportunity to cross sell and upsell, if you're a retailer when you're doing curbside. So we're going to introduce in a matter of days some interesting and innovative solutions that will at least give our retail customers the opportunity to execute on some cross sell, upsell even in a curbside environment. So we will bring some new creativity to bear. Obviously, we can do that because we've got a, sort of version-less cloud native solutions. But the overall product strategy remains intact. Yes. From a virtual perspective, I mean, I think, I got to say the teams are executing very well. The customer organizations are adapting incredibly well. It was all kinds of creative solutions that are being employed. And honestly, there is a very little fall off. There is some, but there's very little fall off in productivity and efficiency. Yes, we are. We are, yes. There's actually a couple. That six day week situation, there are two of them. One of them was with a distribution center that was moved from being a retail replenishment. So, ship to store DC to direct to consumer facility on a space of weeks. And we had one other customer that was sort of interesting names -- I'll leave the name off the charter here, but the distribution center was closed by the local government. They only have one distribution center and it was closed. They said, \"My goodness, what we do?\" We said, \"Why don't you start shipping from store? You got inventory there, the stores are closed, you can put -- they were able to put staff in the store. So, they pivoted from using WMS to distribute products through actually using app Manhattan Active Omni solution to ship product out of the store all in a space of six days. Pretty amazing. It was pretty consistent across the quarter Yun actually. I know it might be surprising, but I think that -- I can't fully explain why, but it was pretty balanced across the quarter. I suppose one hypothesis could be some businesses are sort of idling. They're taking the opportunity to focus on strategic projects that could be one reason. But it was spread pretty equally across the quarter. I would say that, that is true independent of anything else that's going on with COVID. In the last shall we call it 75 days or so, I wouldn't say that we've seen any types of shifts or trends of that type. There hasn't been time, frankly, and businesses have been focused on either dealing with the incredibly high volumes and velocities they've got coming at them or creative solutions to be able to keep their businesses moving forward, such as the ones that we've talked about a little bit or adapting their strategies. And we haven't really got to any particular trends around infrastructure deployment. But I would tell you, that has been the trend, again, regardless particularly for us over the last 12 to 24 months. Yes, sure. I mean, simply put Mark it's a move away from any brick-and-mortar selling to direct-to-consumer. Now that's with the exception of course of the central businesses, the home improvement and the grocery and the pharmacy folks that are open and seeing surging volumes. But just as about everybody else, you have to through a necessity shift to direct-to-consumer. The other factor there is that some of our customers with seasonal products are moving to some pretty aggressive sales strategies, online sales strategies, because they don't want to get stuck with seasonal inventory that they can't move. And that's I think deriving some pretty high volumes of direct-to-consumer business. So, that really is type of a shift that I'm referring to. Yes, well, I mean, look, sufficed to say there are no face-to-face sales meetings, product demonstrations and so forth. They're all being conducted virtually. I mean, one of the things that we've been very pleased with is, frankly, our tech infrastructure for our 3,500 people all around the world is not just held up, has performed flawlessly, and that's for all of our 900 people or so in research and development as well as professional services and customer support organization. We've actually put in -- not a lot of track here, but we've put in a special customer support program for those that are shipping important and essential commodities into our communities to make sure that we're giving them 24x7 support for all these very high volumes they're seeing of essential products. But then as we shift to sales and marketing, all those meetings are happening virtually. I think the world is getting more comfortable, frankly, with virtual meetings, with video meetings and Webex Teams, Zoom and everything else. And so far the market has been pretty receptive to those types of meetings. Now, there's no question that we would in more ways than one be prefer to be back and front of our customers and prospects. But in the meantime, we've got some great technology that really gets us pretty close. Hi, Joe. No, not really Joe, to be perfectly honest with you. Because the first couple of months of the year, we were honestly seeing really no impact from the COVID situation, let's call it the last months, even less -- a little bit less than that of the quarter we started to see some impact. So I don't think it's seeing a surge because of that. We are seeing, as I mentioned before, a positively disproportionate level of interest in our cloud solutions and supply chain solutions move into the cloud. So that I think is part of it. again, a broader product footprint I think is driving some of thepipeline growth, and our geo expansion to a lesser extent, but our geographic expansion as well. Yes. That's right analysis that you've put into that Joe. There's no question that kind of specialty retail, department stores and so forth are being -- or seem to have been impacted disproportionately. That's why we're seeing that, that shift. But we are seeing certainly the life sciences space, grocery, 3PL move up a little bit. Okay. Very good. Thank you, Jesse, and thank you everybody for joining the call. Thank you as always for your support of Manhattan Associates. We'll look forward to speaking with you again in about 90 days, and we certainly hope that everybody out there is safe, remains safe and is -- we are all in a better spot 90 days from now. Good afternoon."

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Thanks Eddie. First quarter total revenue was $153.9 million, up 4% organically over prior year, driven by our cloud and license revenue performance. Our total revenue estimate for the second quarter is a range of $122.5 million to $132.5 million. Adjusted earnings per share for Q1 was $0.40. GAAP earnings per share was $0.35 with stock-based compensation accounting for the difference between adjusted and GAAP EPS. Our adjusted earnings per share estimate for the second quarter is a range of $0.33 to $0.37. License revenue for Q1 was $9.7 million, above our expectations but down year-over-year as anticipated. We signed three $1 million plus deals in the quarter, with roughly one-third of all license deals coming from new customers. For the second quarter, we are expecting approximately $4 million in license revenue as license revenue mix continues to transition to cloud subscriptions. For the full year, we estimate licensed revenue will be between $23 million to $25 million. Cloud revenue was a record $17.3 million in the quarter, up 120% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, driven by continued customer demand for our cloud solutions across all of the verticals we serve. Of note, we closed our largest Manhattan Active Omni order volume deal in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to see strong demand for WMS in the cloud solutions with over 70% of our deals in the quarter coming from WMS, and nearly 30% of our bookings coming from either net new customers or net new product sales into our existing install base. For the second quarter, we are estimating our cloud revenue to be $18 million to $18.5 million and for the full year, we estimate our cloud revenue to be in the range of $74 million to $78 million. We estimate our cloud and license software mix to be approximately 75% cloud to 25% license for the full year, with software performance totaling $97 million to $103 million, a record for total software despite 51% decline in license revenue versus 2019. Turning to bookings. As we have discussed, remaining performance obligations or RPO is the leading proxy of our cloud bookings performance and represents the value of contractual obligations required to be performed otherwise referred to as unearned revenue or bookings. Our RPO for the quarter totaled $203 million, up 102% over the prior year and 18% sequentially. We continue to estimate that our year end RPO will fall within the range of $265 million to $275 million. For Manhattan, this disclosed value represents our cloud bookings value of unearned revenue under non-cancelable contracts greater than one year. Contracts with a non-cancelable term of one year or less are excluded from this reported amount. And one last point on license and cloud. As you know, our performance continues to depend on the number in relative value of large deals we closed in any quarter. While large license deals historically have been important, our markets continue to shift towards subscription models. While this is positive, deal sizes may be slightly smaller as subscription revenue is recognized overtime. Further, some customers have longer implementation cycles associated with large distribution footprints requiring a ramp subscription model, which can impact sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. We also retain appropriate caution around slow decision making by some clients and prospects, particularly retailers in light of ongoing macro events related to COVID-19. Shifting to maintenance. Revenue for the quarter totaled $35.7 million, roughly flat versus prior year. And as you would expect in this environment, we are purposely focused on ensuring our clients have the support they need to navigate current market uncertainty. Our customer retention rates remain strong at greater than 95 plus percent. And for the second quarter, we estimate our maintenance revenue to be between $34 million and $35 million. Our full year maintenance revenue is estimated to be $143 million to $144 million, nice broad range there. Turning to services. Consulting revenue for the quarter totaled of $87.4 million, down 1% year-over-year. Services revenue trends in the near-term will be dictated by the pace and degree of the normalization of business activities impacted by COVID-19. Our estimate for second quarter services revenue is between $65 million to $72 million at the midpoint of $68 million. This represents a sequential decline of 22% over Q1 2020. We estimate our full year services revenue to be $289 million to $306 million. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 48.7%, largely driven by continued investment in cloud and consulting services, as well as slightly lower services revenue. Our second quarter estimate is for a range of 51.6% to 52.4%, approximately 80 basis points higher than 2019. Our full year estimate is approximately 51.3%, up around 40 basis points versus 2019. Turning to operating income and margin. Q1 adjusted operating income totaled $31.9 million with an adjusted operating margin of 20.7%. For the second quarter, we estimate our adjusted operating margin to fall within a range of 22.2% to 23.2%, another tight range. Our Q4 adjusted effective income tax rate was 23.1%. We estimate our second quarter and full year tax rate to be approximately 24%. Regarding our capital structure. In Q1 2020, we repurchased approximately 337,000 shares worth $25 million. While we suspended our share repurchase activity for the time being, last week our Board of Directors did approve replenishing our repurchase authority limit to $50 million. As such, we will assess ongoing market conditions and internal financial performance in determining when to reinstate our share repurchase program. This program remains a core part of our capital allocation strategy. For the second quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be approximately 64 million shares. Turning to cash. We closed the quarter with cash and investments of $75.3 million and zero debt. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled $105.5 million, 12% sequentially on maintenance and cloud billings. Q1 cash flow from operations totaled $12 million, primarily due to performance based compensation stemming from our 2019 financial performance. Finally, capital expenditures totaled $1.2 million in Q1. We estimate full year CapEx to be about $5 million. So that closes the book on Q1 2020. Turning to our updated annual guidance. We've run multiple scenarios in order to build out the appropriate framework for giving investors the best possible forward looking view of the business as we know it today. However, as a caveat, we acknowledge that the assumptions we are making are subject to future actions taken by local, state, federal and international governments, as well as the broader impacts of COVID-19 may or may not have on the global economy. We've revised our 2020 full year revenue outlook, lowering our total revenue forecast to a midpoint of $553 million, down 10.5% over 2019, driven by 17% decline in our services revenue forecast. We feel our services revenue forecast has an appropriate and prudent amount of conservatism built into our outlook. Considering all of these exogenous factors, as Eddie mentioned earlier, we've taken aggressive expense reduction measures to protect earnings without materially impairing our ability to make key investments in R&D to further extend our competitive positioning. With our strong track record of managing expenses from the midpoint of our annual guidance, we've reduced total expenses by about $45 million for the balance of 2020. In terms of quarterly progression, we view Q2 as likely being our weakest quarter of the year, which sequentially from Q1 2020 reflects $24 million or 20% reduction in total expense run rate, with Q3 and Q4 showing some incremental revenue improvement as we move into a more normal business environment. Now, specifically for annual guidance. Our full year revenue range is now expected to be within the range of $541 million to $565 million. Our full year adjusted operating margin is expected to fall within a range of 22.9% to 23.1%, up about 300 basis points from our previous guidance of 20% to 20.5%. Our full year adjusted earnings diluted -- not dilute, share range is expected to be between $1.50 to $1.58 with a midpoint of $1.54 compared to our previous guidance midpoint of $1.57. And our full year GAAP earnings per diluted share range is expected to be $1.16 to $1.24 with a midpoint of $1.20 versus a $1.16 previous guidance. Thank you. That covers the financial update. Back to Eddie for some closing comments. Nothing different than we've put out there before, Terry, probably a ratio of about 1.1 to 1.2 of net income. Yes, so I'll let Eddie answer the shift to virtual. But on the overall margin profile, the reason it's going up, Brian is, one; denominator, significant haircut on revenue and the aggressive expense management actions that we took. So we've taken about $45 million over the last three quarters of expense across the organization out of the business and obviously services is a large component of that. I don't -- one, we're not splitting out the services margin profile, Yun. So could we get an uplift if demand just stamps back? Sure, probably from a revenue perspective for sure. I would say though Yun from I mean that we're all seeing this, this is not unique to us. It appears that businesses going to open and the economy is going to open gradually. It's going to be regional, if not state specific. So, I'm not sure that we're going to see a real fast snapback and any size sort of immediacy. I think we'll see it be gradual. Now, as I said though we're being pretty effective operating in a virtual environment, which also in a way would sort of dull that snapback a lot -- a bit because we're already operating reasonably effectively. Joe, WMS -- as demand for WMS in the cloud pipeline has been a bit of an accelerant as well. So we continue to see the pipeline strengthen on the WMS side."

Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us as we review our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, as well as our outlook for 2022. Well, 2021 was a very successful year for Manhattan Associates, setting all-time records in total revenue, RPO, cash flow, and earnings per share. In February 2018, we announced our goal to become a Cloud first company within five years. And four years into this transition, we've exceeded our own expectations and are well ahead of our initial timing and economic projections with Cloud solutions representing 90% of our pipeline opportunities. And despite the pandemic and in the midst of this Cloud transition, we delivered record revenue in two of the four years and are guiding towards third in 2022. Proudly, our associates continue to execute extremely well, serving both customers and our end markets. Demand for our unified commerce and supply chain Cloud solutions is very strong, creating great visibility for us as we enter 2022. And to help drive growth and serve our customers, we plan to add about 500 net new employees globally, and we remain committed to significantly investing in innovation to meet the future needs of our customers, grow our market share, and extend our adjustable market. And while global ebbs and flows certainly persist, we remain very encouraged by our near-term and long-term growth opportunities. So pivoting to results. Q4 was a record quarter that, again, exceeded our expectations. Total revenue increased 17% to $171 million, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.48 was up 7% as we invested significantly in employee compensation. Regarding RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, in Q4 we added a record $126 million of RPO bookings, setting new highs in Americas, in EMEA, and in APAC. Our global sales team continued to execute well on robust demand for excited offerings across products, industry verticals, and geographic locations. Demand also remains solid from both new and existing customers with 20% of 2021 contracted bookings coming from net new customers. In the quarter, our win rates continue to be very strong at 75% as our innovation is recognized as differentiating and industry leading. And from a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And drilling into the sub verticals, they're pretty diverse, and they include apparel, department stores, grocery, consumer goods, industrial, transportation, as well as durable and non-durable goods. On the professional services front, our global team continues to set the bar for the industry. Our cloud portfolio implementations have gone very well in 2021, as our industry-leading team successfully conducted over 100 go-lives just in Q4 alone. In line with our outlook and prior commentary, we remain focused on adding and retaining our exceptional talent in 2022. And speaking of 2022, our pipelines are strong with net new potential customers representing about 35% of demand, and I mentioned earlier, we're increasing our investment in research and development to nearly $100 million this year. Now let me provide a few additional details on our product portfolio. I'll start off by providing another positive update on the progress we're making with Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, the industry's first and only true cloud-native WMS serving the tier-one market. In May 2020, we announced Manhattan Active WM as the natural successor to our industry-leading on-premise warehouse management for open systems solution. So we've been in market for about 20 months with Manhattan Active WM, and we continue to see strong market demand and a great enthusiasm. Customer deployments have been very successful and we now have nearly 60 customers who are committed to deploying Manhattan Active WM around the world. And while Manhattan WMS has been known historically for the way it excels in large scale complex direct to consumer and retail distribution centers, our initial Manhattan Active WM deployments have really been highly diverse. Today, Manhattan Active WM subscribers are located in 12 different countries and represent 21 distinct industry sub verticals, and this diversity in that customer base really reinforces our belief that supply chains of all kinds are looking to embrace cloud-native, always current, fully extensible technology for their distribution centers, regardless of their industry. And recent events have certainly shown us the critical importance of technology that allows businesses to respond quickly and effectively to supply chain disruptions. Because of the cloud-native nature of Manhattan Active WM, we empower our customers to deploy new sites, new capabilities, new users, very, very swiftly. And that close relationship with Google Cloud allows us to deploy our Manhattan Active WM, nearly anywhere, anytime with high levels of reliability and extremely low levels of latency. The robustness of the underlying Active platform is best-in-class user experience and functional capability, and the strength of our team on the ground are combining to produce exceptional customer outcomes. So now I'll provide you with just a quick update on Manhattan Active Transportation Management. As you recall, our customers can deploy Manhattan Active Transportation alongside Manhattan Active Warehouse Management to form Manhattan Active Supply Chain. The industry's first and only cloud-native fully unified supply chain execution platform. And since its launch in May 2021, Manhattan Active Transportation management has enjoyed outstanding market interest and uptake with strong international traction as well. In fact, half of our initial Manhattan Active Transportation subscribers are outside of North America, and our EMEA and Latin America teams are doing very well with Manhattan Active TM thus for actually where the products very first go-live was in Brazil. And we've communicated in the past, building a global customer base for our TMS application has been one of our strategic goals, and the hard work of our international TMS teams is really starting to play off. And we're encouraged that the results of Manhattan Active Transportation Management show that our supply chain unification message is really resonating in the market. Almost half of our Manhattan Active Transportation Management customers are also Manhattan Active WM customers. And our teams are reporting that customers are placing a really high value on our ability to offer a single user interface to manage all aspects of supply chain execution, to orchestrate end-to-end processes, both across WMS and TMS, and keep all of their supply chain applications fully integrated and current. And finally on the product front, maybe a quick update on our omnichannel commerce solution, Manhattan Active Omni, including our point-of-sale application. Our point-of-sale project teams, they remain busy with a number of new deployments in real life. And throughout the year we're slated to light up a large number of additional stores running our point-of-sale application. And many of those customers also run enterprise order management, and similar to the benefit I mentioned earlier, many of our Manhattan Active Omni customers certainly see the advantage of a unified solution across both the digital and bricks-and-mortar channels. In this quarter, we'll kick off our first Manhattan Active Allocation project with one of our strategic customers in EMEA. Manhattan Active Allocation is a next generation inventory optimization solution designed for fashion retailers. It's built on our industry-leading Manhattan Active architecture, and we believe that it brings a fresh approach to the new -- to a software category that's been mired in decades of old technology. And finally, this -- just this past quarter, we released an exciting new capability within Manhattan Active Omni, our interactive inventory capability. And it's getting a powerful boost from an all new machine learning capability that really further optimizes order promising. Many of our Manhattan Active Omni customers are shipping orders from hundreds of stores each in addition to their distribution centers. And this new solution analyzes multiple static and dynamic market factors to make a much more accurate shipping and delivery prediction in real-time as customers are shopping and checking out. In the initial results we're seeing indicate over a 50% reduction in late delivery thanks to this sophisticated machine learning algorithm. And for our Manhattan Active omni customers, it's really another great example of the advantage of an ever-evolving operational platform with new game changing capabilities like this one being delivered to them on a very regular basis. And we continue to be really very excited about our long-term growth potential. Secular tailwinds are numerous and the benefits of resilient modern and supply chains I think are pretty clear. Now, why are we confident that Manhattan Associates is well positioned to gain market share and outgrow the market in 2022 and beyond. Well, we're the industry leader and our technology is world-class. The competitive environment is favorable and our win rates are strengthening. The pipelines for our market-leading solutions continue to progress very well. At cross-sell opportunity is large and growing, in fact we've dedicated more resources to cross-selling in 2022 and see the opportunity to expand this over time as well. And then finally, we have a significant pipeline of existing on-premise customers who want to shift to our cloud-native applications that are scalable, visionless, and extensible. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and discuss our outlook for 2022 and beyond. And then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before moving to Q&A. Dennis, take it away.\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute at a high level as Eddie highlighted. In 2021, we set all-time records in RPO, total revenue, cash flow, and earnings per share, hats off to our global associates for the outstanding performance. I'll start with recapping our financial performance for the quarter and year. All growth rates are year-over-year, unless otherwise stated. Q4 total revenue was a $171 million up 17%. Full-year revenue totaled $664 million up 13%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the revenue compression by our Cloud transition, Q4 revenue growth was 24% and full year was 20%. Q4 Cloud revenue totaled $35 million, up 51%, with full-year revenue totaling $122 million, up 53%. We closed out 2021 with RPO of $699 million growing a 126% and up 22% sequentially, as demand continues to be robust. Our global services team delivered Q4 revenue of $82 million up 15%, and on the year, $335 million up 10%. Importantly, cloud sales continue to fuel services growth globally. Our Q4 operating profit totaled $39 million with adjusted operating margin of 22.8%. And our full year operating margin was 26.8% up a 160 basis points over 2020. Factoring in Q4 retail peak seasonality, we exceeded margin expectations. As discussed in our Q3 call, we also invested an additional $10 million in performance-based compensation, and employee retention investments. Our Q4 earnings per share of $0.48 exceeded our prior guidance with full-year totaling $2.23 on 27% growth. Q4 operating cash flow was $40 million and our full-year operating cash flow increased 31% to a $185 million, generating a 27% free cash flow margin, and a 28% EBITDA margin. Cash never lies. We ended the year with $264 million in cash and zero debt. For the year, we invested a 100 million in share buybacks, including $20 million in Q4, and last week, our board approved replenishing us repurchase authority to $50 million. Moving to guidance. As consistently mentioned, our overarching financial objective is to deliver sustainable double digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins bench-marked against enterprise SaaS comps. With increased visibility, we are conservatively raising the midpoint of the preliminary 2022 revenue, operating margin, and EPS guidance that we provided last quarter. We are also reiterating our 2022 RPO guidepost midpoint of $1 billion and all our guideposts for 2023 and 2024. Our cloud revenue and RPO guideposts from 2021 to 2024, can be found in today's earnings release supplemental schedules. So for full year 2022, we expect total revenue of $700 million to $715 million, with a $708 million midpoint up from our previous midpoint estimate of $705 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 16% growth and all-in, our target is 7%. First-half, second-half total revenue splits are 49% and 51% respectively. For Q1, we expect total revenue of a $168 million to $170 million. Our full-year adjusted EPS range is a $1.98 to $2.10. The $2.04 midpoint is up from our previous $2 estimate. For GAAP EPS, our guidance range is $1.31 to $1.43. For Q1, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.44 to $0.46, and GAAP EPS of $0.33 to $0.35. For Q2 through Q4, we expect GAAP EPS to be about $0.19 lower than adjusted EPS quarterly, which accounts for our investment in equity-based compensation. For full year 2022, we are increasing our cloud revenue range to $161 million to $167 million representing 34% growth, I'm sorry. And at the midpoint for Q1, we estimate Cloud revenue will be roughly $36.5 million and that it will increase to $39 million in Q2, $42 million in Q3, and $46.5 million in Q4. For services revenue, we are increasing our revenue forecast to $365 million to $373 million, representing 10% growth at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 services revenue of roughly $86 million at the midpoint, and $94.5 million in Q2, $98 million in Q3, and accounting for retail peak seasonality $90.5 million in Q4. For maintenance, we are refining our revenue range lower to $135 million to $138 million as more customers convert to cloud. For Q1, we anticipate maintenance revenue of about $35.5 million at the midpoint and $34 million in Q2. For Q3 and Q4, we expect approximately $33.5 million of maintenance revenue per quarter. With license revenue trading in favor of Cloud, we expect $13 million to $15 million for the full-year, representing approximately 2% of total 2022 revenue. I think we're a Cloud company. For Q1, we expect roughly $5 million of license revenue and $3 million in Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. For hardware, we anticipate $6 million in revenue per quarter and for consolidated subscription maintenance and services margin, we are targeting about 53.7% Q1 will be about 52.7%, Q2 and Q3 is expected to increase to between 54% and 54.5%, while accounting for seasonality, Q4 is expected to be about 53.5%. And our 2022 adjusted operating margin range will be 23% to 24% with a midpoint of 23.5%, up from our prior midpoint of 23.25%. Our full-year operating margin objectives incorporates three significant variables as we anticipate the following. First, license and maintenance attrition of 300 basis points on customer demand for cloud, 2. 250 basis points of investment for talent hiring and retention including wage increases, and 3. 200 basis points of additional investment in our business, including the return of pandemic impacted expenses. For Q1, we expect operating margin of approximately 21.7% and for sequential improvement of about a 175 basis points in both Q2 and Q3. Accounting for seasonality, we expect Q4 operating margin to be approximately 23.5%, and beginning in 2023, we continue to target 75 to 125 basis points of operating margin expansion going forward. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% and diluted share count to be approximately $64.5 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So that covers a fantastic financial update. Thank you very much, and back to Eddie for some closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well, as you can tell, we're very pleased with that strong fourth-quarter and record-setting 2021 results. Well, there certainly is some turbulence in the global macro environment, but we're entering 2022 very well-positioned. Our business momentum is strong and we continue to deliver market-leading innovation that drives our customer's digital transformation. And as a result, we anticipate long-term, sustainable, and profitable growth for Manhattan Associates. To wrap up, I want to thank all of our employees globally for a fantastic year in 2021. Your relentless dedication and commitment to our customers is one of Manhattan's key differentiators. So thank you. Thank all of you. And Angie, we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please state your question.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah. Thanks and congrats on the RPO and the fourth-quarter record. Hi, Eddie, Dennis and Mike. I guess -- and also by the way, Dennis, thanks for all that extremely fine grain guidance every quarter, makes it pretty simple to model. First question is for you Eddie in terms of being able to have this unified technology stock, how much is -- are the conversations in the pipeline activity involving customers wanting to buy both the WMS and the TMS in that conversation? And does it create a potential vendor consolidation play? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Well, certainly vendor consolidation no question about that, Terry, and that's our objective. In terms of buying both together, certainly those conversations are happening. Certainly the conversations about the road-map of, frankly, which system to implement first and so forth are happening. Honestly, the answer to the question really comes down to the capacity of the customers\u2019 organization to be able to implement both solutions simultaneously, because that is quite a plateful, so we work with them to figure out which one first, which one second, which piece is first, which piece is second, to deliver the best results for them, but it's a pretty exciting time for us and for the market for sure.\nDennis Story: And it's a nice cross-sell, up-sell opportunity, Terry.\nTerry Tillman: Sure. Thanks. So Eddie, you had a comment, I think it was great visibility. So to put you on the spot, Dennis, in terms of Eddie's comment about great visibility in the prepared remarks. As we think about RPO activity throughout the year, as part of the visibility just coming from -- you've got 60-plus customers, you got more go-lives, and you're starting to see this waterfall effect of just the installed base now, more comfortable. Hey, you've been in market for a while and that's kind of the key crops on the strengthening and visibility of the installed base saying, hey, we're ready, and then I had a follow-up on the seasonality of RPO.\nEddie Capel: Was there a question there, Terry? What I'd tell you is absolutely, visibility is fantastic, forward-looking, we're doing quite well there. And I think that's represented really in the guidepost that we've put out and reaffirmed.\nTerry Tillman: Okay. This will definitely be a question. On seasonality, how do we think about RPO, because you have been at it for a while now. And so, are you seeing any market changes in seasonality and how we should be thinking and forecasting RPO across the quarters? Thank you.\nDennis Story: I think demand blew through seasonality in Q4, so we'll update you next Q4 as well.\nEddie Capel: There tends to be -- I don't think there will be any real difference in buying patterns in the cloud world versus licensed world, Terry. There is not a ton of seasonality, but we do tend to see a little more buying at the end of Q4, and in Q1 getting ready because customers want systems implemented prior to the busy season in the following year. It's not huge, but if there is some seasonality, that tends to be what it looks like.\nDennis Story: And it tends to impact services more than it does the cloud sales.\nTerry Tillman: But -- so just to finalize here on the commentary. So Eddie, the reality is maybe there's a little bit of lumpiness in a positive way in 4Q. But also you could see some activity earlier in the year just as -- they've got budget and they're ready to commit, and then obviously they need to get it going before the season -- the holiday season.\nEddie Capel: That's right. Again, it's not a huge swing but we see a little bit of that. And then, of course you tend to see a little bit of a slowdown in the summer. That's more probably more in Europe than here. And a little bit of a slowdown going into peak while IT organizations and so forth are focused on getting ready and are a little distracted from the buying process. But I'll reiterate no major swings here, but those are the cycles.\nTerry Tillman: Nice job, guys. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please state your question.\nBrian Peterson: Hello?\nOperator: Brian, your line is open. Please state your questions.\nBrian Peterson: Hello, sorry guys the mute button got me. Well, congrats on the RPO numbers, those are fantastic. But just following up on Terry's question on the RPO. I'm curious, are your customers willing to commit to more products now that you have a broader cloud portfolio. We were talking about seasonality, but I'm curious, are people willing to buy more products at the same time now, just given that they're more integrated and I'd be curious to get your thoughts on that, Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Again, it's really the same answer, Brian. There is great opportunity for cross-sell and up-sell obviously because of the integrated and unified nature. About 15% of the 2021 bookings were kind of that cross-sell and up-sell. Now, the specific simultaneous purchase, again, comes down to, hey, how much can we knock down all at the same time verses that road-map conversation, and the follow-on sequential business that comes one behind the other.\nBrian Peterson: Makes sense. And Eddie, just maybe a follow-up. We've gotten a question a lot from investors on what the supply chain disruption does for demand. Obviously, we're seeing Active M coming -- Active WM coming in really strong. I'm curious, from your perspective, what does that do for the demand environment? And are there other parts of the portfolio where we could see improving demand in 2022 and 2023? Thanks, Eddie. Thanks, again.\nEddie Capel: I don't know that there's going to be major shifts in 2022, Brian. I think that the general Geo supply chain disruptions are going to continue, I don't think you're going to see a ton of reassuring being able to be pulled off in 2022, but it just takes time to build that strategy out. But demand is certainly high for capacity, on the digital transformation side e-commerce continues to grow. There is obviously some slowness and some shortages of product coming into the country, so as a consequence of that, as soon as it hits shore here or hits land, there's a real immediacy and an urgency to get product distributed out to end consumers, and the optimization of the deployment of inventory around the country becomes particularly important. And I just really -- I know it's a little bit of a coy expression, but supply chain flexibility and agility is just super important across the globe.\nBrian Peterson: Good color. Thanks, Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Pleasure, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please state your question\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. Maybe I'll start, Eddie in your prepared remarks, you mentioned how you saw growing addressable market opportunity. Can you maybe just expand on where some of the biggest new opportunities lie and maybe related to that, it definitely seems to be coming out more often Manhattan Active WM moving outside of that, most automated Level 4, Level 5 warehouse environment, how much is the persona of your customer starting to change? And so there's consequentially just more potential users of a cloud product and that contributes to the TAM expansion.\nEddie Capel: It's a modernization really of the supply chain versus going down market a ton, Joe, to be perfectly honest with you, that's driving a lot of the demand. As we've talked about, a number of times, distribution centers today look quite different to the way they looked even five years ago, but certainly 10 and 15 years ago with the levels of automation, robotics, and so forth. So the need to have sophisticated software to be able to drive that inside the full walls transformation is important. Obviously, the digital transformation of the way consumers are ordering and consuming goods requires a whole different strategy for distribution, whether it be the number of distribution centers, the size of the distribution centers, the hours of operation of those distribution centers, all of those things contribute to the modernization of sophisticated distribution network. In terms of growing at adjustable market certainly with continuing to expand our product portfolio, particularly out on the front end into the retail store portfolio and we feel like we're doing pretty well from a market share perspective. Again, we've talked about this before with manufacturers and wholesalers becoming much more direct-to-consumer, that drives greater demand for sophisticated fulfillment and distribution. I was talking to one of our customers the other day and just sort of mentioned it, hey, we really consider ourselves a cloud-first company now, and this was a company that had been a traditional wholesaler for 30 years. And they said funny you should say that, we now consider ourselves a direct-to-consumer company. And they have been traditionally a wholesale for 30 years, and so a great marriage there and just a lot of great market expansion opportunities for us.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's great. And then, just in regards to being focused on cross-sales and dedicating more resources that way, talk a lot about what that might mean for WMS paired with TMS. Does that also include I guess within WMS functionality, thinking of things like execution, control, yard management, labor management. When you wrap all those capabilities in the -- what Manhattan can provide, are you ultimately seeing your ACVs get bigger just within the WMS category?\nEddie Capel: It really -- certainly we've seeing a lot of synergy across those products. By the way, as you look at Manhattan Active Omni point-of-sale, Manhattan Active Omni integrated with WMS being much more sophisticated with late-stage cancellation, order consolidation, order aggregation, and those kinds of things. In terms of ACV growth or NACV growth, it still comes down to whether this is a road map purchase or a multi-product buy upfront, which again comes down to how much can our customers bite off in terms of project initiatives all at once. So it hasn't -- we haven't seen it manifest itself in a significant ACV growth at an initial contract. But we're okay with that. We're in this for the long term, we want to make sure our customers are successful over the long term, and make sure that they implemented a pace that is aggressive, but yet comfortable for them.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: Pleasure, Joe. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz with Rosenblatt Securities. Please state your question.\nMark Zgutowicz: Hey, guys, I'll play my broken record hear and again congratulate you on some great results. Eddie, I wanted to see if you might pull the curtain back a little bit on the new CMO that you brought in, and a few months ago I think it's been. And I'm just curious if there are any tangible you might be able to share in terms of what your marketing or branding looks like this year relative to last and specifically across other product or geo, or perhaps using different types of ad mediums that would be helpful. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: So Addie is doing a fantastic job. We're thrilled to have her on the team, and not only did she do fantastic where she's integrating into the team wonderfully and really spreading her wings across product and across their geographies. I'm not going to put her on the spot with very specific marketing initiatives in her first 90 days here or so, or even in an interim. But I will tell you that she's got us and our company very focused on digital marketing. Number 1, number 2, we've said for a long time that we think we have some of the best kept secrets on the planet. Well, here comes Ann with 90 days or so into the business, and she certainly concurs, now she's got under the hood a little bit and is focused on making sure that we don't have a lot of secrets, that we are loud and proud with our marketing strategies going into 2022. So you certainly should expect to see us again be a little more, for both frankly, in communicating some of the very innovative solutions that we have in our portfolio.\nMark Zgutowicz: Got it. I suppose we're not expecting a Super Bowl ad this year though.\nEddie Capel: Well, you never know, don't get up and go the restroom, Mark. You might\nMark Zgutowicz: Alright. That's good. I like that anticipation. Last question, and I might have missed it just a housekeeping on POS go-live. I know you've chatted about them in the past, but just curious how that has trended.\nEddie Capel: Yeah, it's gone pretty well, and what I said was that we've got a number that are underway and we expect by the end of the year to light up a bunch more stores both here in the U.S. and some internationally as well. So the pipeline continues to grow, there clearly is demand out there for a really integrated, strategic suite of selling product across bricks-and-mortar and in digital. And as we get more established in this world and in this market, you're going to see us start talk about some really nice brands that are starting to adopt a solution.\nMark Zgutowicz: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Mark. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel with Loop Capital.\nMark Schappel: Hi, nice job on the quarter and thanks for taking my question.\nEddie Capel: Sure thing Mark, thank you.\nMark Schappel: Hey, Eddie, just starting with you. A question on your point-of-sale business, just building off the former question here. In over the past year or so the focus was basically just building up reference accounts with respect to that product. Now that you have many of those reference accounts in place, I'm wondering if you would expect point-of-sale to become a greater percentage of your business going forward.\nEddie Capel: Look, it's a slow burn, Mark. We don't wake up one morning and say, hey, I'm going to -- it's the heart and soul of the retail operation. They don't -- certainly retailers do not replace their point-of-sale systems on a whim, and they're very, very strategic decisions. But I got to tell you, we can feel the momentum building throughout our organization, everything from initial pipeline, acceleration, to deployments and go-live. I guess you'll be the judge of whether it's a significant part of the business as we march through the next eight or 10 quarters, but certainly momentum is building nicely.\nMark Schappel: Nice. Thanks. And then regarding just supply chain in general, given the increasing attention that companies are placing on supply chain these days, how much are you seeing higher level executives involved in your sales processes and say, six, three or four years ago?\nEddie Capel: Yeah, much more so. I think we've always been mission critical solutions to our customers since day one of the company's existence, but never more than in the last year or two have we been participating in forward-level and C-suite level conversations. I don't think there's barely a company on the planet that isn't very focused on supply chain issues, whether manufacture, wholesale, or retailer, and we really are becoming one of the most important IT systems in our customers\u2019 landscape for sure.\nMark Schappel: Okay, that's helpful. And then just finally here, I was wondering if you just comment a little bit on what you're seeing or whether you're seeing any changes with respect to your customers budgeting cycles for the upcoming year?\nEddie Capel: No. It's a pretty simple answer to that, Mark. No real change in budget cycles that we've seen.\nMark Schappel: We like simple answers, appreciate it. Thanks, that's all I have.\nEddie Capel: Sure thing, Mark. Thank you.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please state your question.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, guys. I wanted to ask on the labor side of things and obviously you ramped up some compensation to retain and presumably attract employees. On the services side, have you been able to hire a plan, and has labor been a bottleneck there at all? And then within your customers, has their ability to engage with you been any limiter to getting deals implemented?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. We've had to plan, so that's been good. We -- I think so far this year we've got a new -- we've got about somewhere in the 75 - 100 new associates with the company, so that's exciting to see for sure. In terms of the reticence of our customers to move forward because of lack of resource on their side, I haven't seen a ton of that. Now, we have seen them ask us to take on maybe a little more work and, of course, we're seeing a very, very vibrant system integrator participation. And certainly, we're being asked to introduce our system integration partners into the mix to augment our customer teams, but I wouldn't say we've seen any buying trepidation or buying slowness due to lack of resource on the customer side.\nMatt Pfau: Great. And then in terms of existing WM customers moving from an on-prem deployment to the Cloud, maybe just some update there and what the interest level is. And I think if I recall when you released Active WM back in 2020, the original plan was to support the on-prem version for five years so presumably we're a bit over three years out now from when that would end, how are customer -- discussions with customers progressing around moving over to the Cloud from existing deployments?\nEddie Capel: If you have a lot of enthusiasm, we just said we got about 60 different customers under contract now. I may not be exactly correct percentage-wise, but it's about 50-50. 50% of those 60 brand new customers that we've never done business with before, and 50% are existing customers that are transitioning from on-prem into the cloud. So it's a pretty exciting time, we're very pleased about where we are. Obviously we were very pleased with the financial results, but at the end of the day, we've only transitioned 30 of our existing customers that we built up over the last 30 years so far. We're encouraged by the enthusiasm there and their desire to move to scalable, extensible, visionless software in the cloud.\nMatt Pfau: Okay, great. I appreciate it guys.\nEddie Capel: Sure thing, Matt.\nOperator: At this time there are no further questions, I will now turn the floor back to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Yeah, good. Thank you, Angie. No real closing remarks. Just would like to thank everybody for all of their support during 2021. We're thrilled to be started with 2022 and look forward to giving you our first 2022 update in about 90 days or so. In the meantime, have a great evening. Thank you. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Angie. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties, are not guarantees of future performance, and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly on our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we've provide in our subsequent Form 10 - Qs. We note in particular that uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Eddie. Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute at a high level as Eddie highlighted. In 2021, we set all-time records in RPO, total revenue, cash flow, and earnings per share, hats off to our global associates for the outstanding performance. I'll start with recapping our financial performance for the quarter and year. All growth rates are year-over-year, unless otherwise stated. Q4 total revenue was a $171 million up 17%. Full-year revenue totaled $664 million up 13%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the revenue compression by our Cloud transition, Q4 revenue growth was 24% and full year was 20%. Q4 Cloud revenue totaled $35 million, up 51%, with full-year revenue totaling $122 million, up 53%. We closed out 2021 with RPO of $699 million growing a 126% and up 22% sequentially, as demand continues to be robust. Our global services team delivered Q4 revenue of $82 million up 15%, and on the year, $335 million up 10%. Importantly, cloud sales continue to fuel services growth globally. Our Q4 operating profit totaled $39 million with adjusted operating margin of 22.8%. And our full year operating margin was 26.8% up a 160 basis points over 2020. Factoring in Q4 retail peak seasonality, we exceeded margin expectations. As discussed in our Q3 call, we also invested an additional $10 million in performance-based compensation, and employee retention investments. Our Q4 earnings per share of $0.48 exceeded our prior guidance with full-year totaling $2.23 on 27% growth. Q4 operating cash flow was $40 million and our full-year operating cash flow increased 31% to a $185 million, generating a 27% free cash flow margin, and a 28% EBITDA margin. Cash never lies. We ended the year with $264 million in cash and zero debt. For the year, we invested a 100 million in share buybacks, including $20 million in Q4, and last week, our board approved replenishing us repurchase authority to $50 million. Moving to guidance. As consistently mentioned, our overarching financial objective is to deliver sustainable double digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins bench-marked against enterprise SaaS comps. With increased visibility, we are conservatively raising the midpoint of the preliminary 2022 revenue, operating margin, and EPS guidance that we provided last quarter. We are also reiterating our 2022 RPO guidepost midpoint of $1 billion and all our guideposts for 2023 and 2024. Our cloud revenue and RPO guideposts from 2021 to 2024, can be found in today's earnings release supplemental schedules. So for full year 2022, we expect total revenue of $700 million to $715 million, with a $708 million midpoint up from our previous midpoint estimate of $705 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 16% growth and all-in, our target is 7%. First-half, second-half total revenue splits are 49% and 51% respectively. For Q1, we expect total revenue of a $168 million to $170 million. Our full-year adjusted EPS range is a $1.98 to $2.10. The $2.04 midpoint is up from our previous $2 estimate. For GAAP EPS, our guidance range is $1.31 to $1.43. For Q1, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.44 to $0.46, and GAAP EPS of $0.33 to $0.35. For Q2 through Q4, we expect GAAP EPS to be about $0.19 lower than adjusted EPS quarterly, which accounts for our investment in equity-based compensation. For full year 2022, we are increasing our cloud revenue range to $161 million to $167 million representing 34% growth, I'm sorry. And at the midpoint for Q1, we estimate Cloud revenue will be roughly $36.5 million and that it will increase to $39 million in Q2, $42 million in Q3, and $46.5 million in Q4. For services revenue, we are increasing our revenue forecast to $365 million to $373 million, representing 10% growth at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 services revenue of roughly $86 million at the midpoint, and $94.5 million in Q2, $98 million in Q3, and accounting for retail peak seasonality $90.5 million in Q4. For maintenance, we are refining our revenue range lower to $135 million to $138 million as more customers convert to cloud. For Q1, we anticipate maintenance revenue of about $35.5 million at the midpoint and $34 million in Q2. For Q3 and Q4, we expect approximately $33.5 million of maintenance revenue per quarter. With license revenue trading in favor of Cloud, we expect $13 million to $15 million for the full-year, representing approximately 2% of total 2022 revenue. I think we're a Cloud company. For Q1, we expect roughly $5 million of license revenue and $3 million in Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. For hardware, we anticipate $6 million in revenue per quarter and for consolidated subscription maintenance and services margin, we are targeting about 53.7% Q1 will be about 52.7%, Q2 and Q3 is expected to increase to between 54% and 54.5%, while accounting for seasonality, Q4 is expected to be about 53.5%. And our 2022 adjusted operating margin range will be 23% to 24% with a midpoint of 23.5%, up from our prior midpoint of 23.25%. Our full-year operating margin objectives incorporates three significant variables as we anticipate the following. First, license and maintenance attrition of 300 basis points on customer demand for cloud, 2. 250 basis points of investment for talent hiring and retention including wage increases, and 3. 200 basis points of additional investment in our business, including the return of pandemic impacted expenses. For Q1, we expect operating margin of approximately 21.7% and for sequential improvement of about a 175 basis points in both Q2 and Q3. Accounting for seasonality, we expect Q4 operating margin to be approximately 23.5%, and beginning in 2023, we continue to target 75 to 125 basis points of operating margin expansion going forward. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% and diluted share count to be approximately $64.5 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So that covers a fantastic financial update. Thank you very much, and back to Eddie for some closing remarks. And it's a nice cross-sell, up-sell opportunity, Terry. I think demand blew through seasonality in Q4, so we'll update you next Q4 as well. And it tends to impact services more than it does the cloud sales."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, October 27. I would now like to introduce Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Thank you, Liah, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates 2021 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates.

Well, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter results, discuss our updated full-year 2021 outlook and provide some very preliminary color on 2022 and beyond. Q3 and year-to-date results were an all-time record for Manhattan Associates. Total revenue increased 13% to $169 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.71 increased 39%. Both of these metrics exceeded our expectations. Strong cloud and services demand continues to drive revenue outperformance, fueling double-digit top line growth and strong earnings leverage. Above all, our investments in innovation are paying off. Product differentiation between Manhattan and other supply chain software vendors continues to increase. And moreover, our global teams are performing exceptionally well with a laser focus on customer success. We delivered record third quarter bookings with RPO increasing 123% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $574 million, providing us with excellent future revenue visibility. Additionally, 40% of our Q3 contracted bookings were generated from net new customers. And our pipeline continues to be robust with solid demand across our product suites. Over 90% of the pipeline consists of cloud opportunities with net new potential customers representing about 35% of that demand. And with strong business momentum and our increased visibility, we're providing refreshed guideposts for RPO and cloud revenue through 2024. Dennis will provide more color later in the call, but this includes moving up our milestone of reaching $1 billion in RPO to 2022 from our original target of 2023. On the sales front, competitive win rates remained strong at about 75% as our innovation is recognized as industry-leading. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings for the quarter, but drilling into the sub verticals, they're pretty diverse, including apparel, department stores, grocery, food and beverage, industrial, health services as well as durable and nondurable goods. Our global services team continues to execute amazingly well, conducting over 100 go-lives in Q3. And for the quarter, services revenue was up 20% compared with the prior-year period. As we mentioned in our Q2 call, the market is extremely competitive for services and technical talent. And while we're well positioned for significant growth, we do expect demand for talent to continue to be strong, with new and existing customers wanting to accomplish more with our solutions and at a faster pace. We're very mindful of the workload that we put on our teams, and we're focused on attracting and retaining talent, which we continue to factor into our operational planning and guidance. On the innovation front, with our R&D spend approaching $90 million annually, we're focused on providing modern cloud native applications that are architected to unify commerce and supply chain experiences. Manhattan is on the leading edge of removing numerous unnatural silos or artificial boundaries that really don't align with business workflows. Our technology is differentiating and industry-leading and a Manhattan active SaaS solutions are scalable, versionless and extensible. And this enables our customers to quickly adapt to market changes. It can improve efficiency and leverage their data in more robust ways, including solving challenges that legacy and silo systems simply cannot. And we believe that we're still very early in our cloud journey, but we couldn't be more pleased with the market's enthusiastic response to our Manhattan Active solutions. So let's spend just a few minutes on specific updates on products and customers. We're actually off to a great start with Manhattan Active Transportation Management, the industry's fastest and smartest multimodal transportation optimization engine. Manhattan Active TM is the industry's first self-configuring and self-tuning system built on our industry-leading Manhattan application architecture. Manhattan Active TM is joined with Manhattan Active Warehouse Management to form Manhattan Active supply chain, the industry's first unified cloud native supply chain execution platform. And since launch, we've been heartened by the accolades we've received for Manhattan Active Transportation Management from analysts, partners and customers. perhaps most encouragingly, several of the Manhattan Active Transportation Management customers are also deploying Manhattan Active WM. In other words, our supply chain unification message and strategy is really resonating with these joint solution customers realizing the clear benefits of unifying distribution, transportation, labor and automation within a single application. Manhattan Active WM, the other half of Manhattan Active Supply Chain, continues to experience pretty explosive growth. Consistent with prior quarters, we're seeing a very nice balance between net new customers and existing Manhattan WMS customers choosing to migrate to our next-generation of WM platform. In just, what is it, 16 short months, Manhattan Active WM is live or are in the process of being implemented in 11 countries across 16 different industries, a pretty good testament to its cross-vertical and international applicability. The small sampling of either live or currently implementing Manhattan Active WM customers include a luxury retail department store and national beverage distributor, Tier 0 national grocer outside of the US and several industrial distributors across the globe. Our competitive win rate with WMS has always been pretty high, and Manhattan Active WM has helped us raise that already high bar. Now turning now to our omni-channel applications. We continue to make strides with our Manhattan Active point-of-sale application. This past quarter saw a global apparel and footwall brand, activate a Manhattan Active point-of-sale application in two new flagship stores in New York and Las Vegas. This particular customer also runs Manhattan Active order management, and they saw a clear advantage of deploying a unified omnichannel operating platform across their digital and bricks-and-mortar operations. And from a geographical point of view, the plans call for deploying Manhattan Active point-of-sale and order management across the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. And we believe that Manhattan Active omni is unique in its ability to provide full featured order management, contact center and store systems as part of a unified platform across the globe. And to close out our product and customer updates this quarter, I'm happy to report that a couple of weeks ago, we were able to host several small customer events in person for the first time in quite some time. And we were pleased to host customers in the UK, in the Netherlands and finally in France for some pretty intimate events to discuss their commerce and supply chain strategies and how Manhattan Active solutions can help them progress their digital transformations. And I got to tell you, it was such a pleasure to connect in person with a group of strategic customers after such a long break. Well, that concludes my brief business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and outlook, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. Nothing but accolades for our Manhattan global teams. Top to bottom, we continue to raise the bar in a choppy macro delivering strong growth, profitability, cash flow and balance sheet metrics. I'll start with a quick recap of the quarter with growth rates on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. Total revenue was a record $169 million, up 13%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 27%. Notably, 70% of our total revenue is now driven by cloud and services. Our Q3 operating profit was a record totaling $53 million, up 20% with adjusted operating margin of 31.3% and GAAP operating margin of 25.1%. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue combined with lower expenses driven by the COVID pandemic. Compared to 2019, we estimate COVID lowered our year-to-date 2021 expenses by about 425 basis points and year-to-date 2020 by about 325 basis points, respectively. Adjusting for COVID or put another way, assuming these expenses remain unchanged from 2019 levels, adjusted operating margin would be approximately 24% year-to-date, up over 200 basis points compared to year-to-date 2020. Earnings per share was a record $0.71, up 39%. Our earnings per share did include $0.06 of nonrecurring tax benefit associated with expiring tax statutes. So, normalized EPS was $0.65, up 27%, either way a record. Our Q3 and year-to-date operating cash flow performance was a record with Q3 totaling $60 million and year-to-date $145 million, both up 41% on record global cash collections. How about our free cash flow margin? It continues to be strong at 35% for the quarter and 29% year-to-date. EBITDA margin was 32% in the quarter and 29% year-to-date. Our balance sheet continues to be rock solid with $246 million in cash and 0 debt, providing us excellent flexibility to invest for growth. We invested $20 million in share buybacks in the quarter, resulting in $80 million in buybacks year-to-date. And for the fourth quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be about 64.3 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. Also, our board has approved our customary $50 million share repurchase authority. That covers the macros. Now let's drill down a little bit into revenue. Cloud revenue in the quarter totaled $32 million, up 53% as our new annual contract value continues to accelerate on strong market demand. For Q4, we expect cloud revenue of roughly $33.5 million. As Eddie mentioned, Q3 was a record third quarter with RPO, remaining performance obligation. Our RPO bookings totaled $574 million, up 123% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. With RPO continuing to compound positively, our visibility into future subscription revenue continues to strengthen, giving us confidence in our forward visibility and guidepost projections. Services revenue was $88 million, up 20% as our cloud momentum continues to fuel our services revenue growth. Americas and Europe are running at double-digit growth, with APAC demand improving. For Q4 retail peak season, it's starting earlier than normal given supply chain constraints. We are forecasting services revenue to be about $82 million with year-over-year growth of 16%. As a reminder to most of you, the sequential revenue decline from Q3 represents our traditional retail peak seasonality as customers slow implementations to meet their customers' demand. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 56.8%, up over 380 basis points compared to the year ago period and was predominantly driven by revenue performance and cloud operating leverage. Accounting for retail peak season and growth investments, we expect Q4 margin to be about 50.2%, resulting in full year 2021 margin of 53.5%, up 190 basis points over the prior year. License revenue was $8 million, down 36% and maintenance revenue was $34 million, down 8%, primarily on cash collection timing. And one final revenue call out, our hardware team is in the double-digit growth gain, up 25% year-to-date. Good job, guys. Transitioning to guidance. Barring any major global macro setbacks, our full year 2021 guidance and preliminary 2022 outlook puts us on track to deliver consecutive record revenue years. Our overarching objective obviously is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins, benchmarked annually against enterprise SaaS comps. For 2021, we are raising our total revenue guidance to $653 million to $655 million, up from our prior range of $643 million to $650 million. Our underlying total 2021 revenue growth ex license and maintenance, which removes the revenue compression from our cloud transition is targeted to be 19% at the midpoint. For Q4, we expect total revenue of $161 million to $163 million. Full year operating margin is expected to be 25.8% to 26%, factoring in retail peak season revenue impact and including $10 million in special performance-based compensation and retention investments. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be $2.12 to $2.14, up from our prior range of $2.00 to $2.06. For GAAP EPS, our guidance range is $1.61 to $1.63 with a midpoint of $1.62, up 6% from our previous midpoint of $1.53. And for Q4, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39. For full year 2021, our cloud revenue estimate is increasing to $121 million, representing 51% growth. Given our strong performance in Q3 and year-to-date, we are also increasing our RPO outlook to a range of $675 million to $700 million, up from our prior outlook range of $550 million to $600 million. The $688 million midpoint is up over 75% from our initial RPO target provided on our Q3 2020 earnings call. For full year 2021, license and maintenance revenue continues to positively attrite on increasing demand for our cloud solutions. We expect license to be about $33 million and maintenance roughly $143 million. For Q4, we expect license to be about $7.5 million and maintenance roughly $35 million. Our CapEx estimate for 2021 is $3 million to $4 million. And for full year 2021, we expect an adjusted tax rate of about 19.5% and a GAAP tax rate of approximately 17.5%. So that covers the quarter and our 2021 outlook. Let's cover some 2022 preliminary targets and guideposts. We are in our budget cycle currently, so we will firm up our parameters on our Q4 call. Please note, though, to facilitate a review for you all, we have added a supplemental schedule, Item Number 9 last page in today's earnings release, providing a comparison of our original geometrics and our current updated guideposts. As the schedule shows, we are moving all our guideposts for cloud revenue and RPO materially higher. In addition, our adjusted operating margins are improved from our initial color provided in February. Please note year-over-year growth rates are based on the midpoint of our 2021 guidance. Our preliminary estimate of 2022 total revenue is $695 million to $715 million, excluding license and maintenance attrition at 16% growth. All in, our initial growth target is 8%. Our full year 2022 adjusted EPS range is $1.90 to $2.10. For 2022 cloud revenue, we are targeting $160 million to $165 million in revenue, representing 35% growth at the midpoint. Exiting 2021, including ramp transactions, we expect to achieve a three-year 2022 to 2024 compounded annual growth rate of 40% at the midpoint of our cloud revenue targets. For RPO, we are targeting a three-year CAGR of 35% at the midpoint of our targets of $1 billion in 2022, growing to $1.7 billion in 2024. Those are big numbers. In 2022, we are also targeting services revenue of $362 million to $370 million, which represents 9% growth. License revenue of $13 million to $15 million and maintenance revenue of $137 million to $140 million as we continue to expect a longer attrition tell for maintenance. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin is expected to be about 54%, and we are pegging 2022 operating margins at 22.5% to 24% and are targeting an annual 75 to 125 basis point expansion annually starting in 2023. The factors impacting the inherent leverage in our model and driving the 2022 year over decline in operating margin include license attrition of 57% and to $14 million with maintenance revenue attrition at 4% as customers shift to cloud, totaling about 200 basis points of margin impact. Wage inflation and labor market trends accounting for about 200 basis points in margin investment. As we've previously discussed, demand for technical talent is high, and we expect the labor market to continue to be very competitive through 2022. Continued investment across our company fueled by customer demand, we are investing in R&D, services and sales and marketing and the continued return of COVID impact expenses such as travel, our annual momentum customer conference, employee appreciation events, contractors, et cetera, total about 100 basis points. We also expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22%, and our diluted share count will be approximately 64.3 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So, lastly, I'll summarize our 2023 and 2024 guideposts that should better assist investors' assessment of our future cloud growth and earnings trajectory. Remember comparison of our guidepost versus historicals are located in our earnings release. For 2023, we are targeting RPO of $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion, representing 33% growth at the midpoint. Cloud revenue of $220 million to $240 million, representing 42% growth at the midpoint. And introducing 2024, for RPO, we are targeting $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, representing 28% growth at the midpoint. Cloud revenue, we're targeting $310 million to $345 million, representing 42% growth at the midpoint. So that covers the financial update. Thank you very much, and back to Eddie for some closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Good report. Dennis, thank you. We're very pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date results. And while we continue to operate in a pretty turbulent global macro environment, business momentum is very positive. And of course, we're very encouraged by our accelerating RPO and associated revenue growth. As we look forward, we're confident in our ability to deliver success for our customers and help them drive their digital transformation. As a result, we anticipate long-term, sustainable and profitable growth for Manhattan Associates. And with that, Liah, we'd be happy to take any questions.\nOperator: All right. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats. Exceptional results. I guess maybe - and hi, Eddie, Dennis and Mike, I should have said that to begin with. Maybe, Eddie, I'll ask you a question. Congrats on the hiring of the CMO. I'm curious, I know it's probably still early days, but what kind of impact do you see her in terms of having on the branding, marketing and just continuing to evolve go-to-market activities?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. Yeah. It's early, Terry, but without putting too much pressure on and we're obviously very pleased to have her on board. And at the end of the day, we think, frankly, as well as we've done, we've still got some of the industry's best kept secrets, and we're anxious to be able to get that message out. So, I think we have the opportunity to share our stories with a broader community, drive awareness, particularly for our newer products. And just overall, frankly, get the message out that we're here to do business and help our customers in the industry with digital transformation.\nTerry Tillman: Understood. Well, maybe some healthy pressure is good, though, for Ann. So, maybe there's somewhere in the middle there, but okay, that's great. It was great to see the 40% contracted bookings from new logos. So this kind of like closes the loop because you have been building the pipeline in terms of new lower activity has been picking up. So now you see the conversion going on. What I'm curious about is, is it something with certain of the active cloud products that is getting you into parts of the retail or the e-commerce-oriented markets that you haven't been before, whether it's DTC or just other types of kind of micro segments? I'm just kind of curious because it is a striking number. Any more color you can provide there?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. I don't think there's any specific micro verticals or sub verticals, Terry, but I do think that there has been some - a little bit of pent-up demand with the industry waiting for the real next generation of cloud native or next generation of solutions to emerge, those, in this case, being cloud-native, very innovative access to new innovation on a regular basis. So we're definitely seeing some uptick out there from customers that we haven't done business with before. We're fortunately seeing some nice takeaways from some of the older competitors that are out there. But it is - but it's quite broad and not focused on any given industry.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. And just my final question, and I appreciate Dennis and Mike, the figures are at the end that helps us a lot in terms of the guidepost. But I had a question actually on cash flow, Dennis. The cash flow was strong in the quarter, a lot stronger than expected. As you think about 2020, I know you don't usually guide on cash flow, but could we see a similar pattern whereby free cash flow margins are higher than operating margins? Just anything else you can call out on any onetime things or CapEx things into 2022 and just thinking about free cash flow.\nDennis Story: Yeah. No onetime items, great quality of one quality of earnings and quality of cash flow. So I'd expect we're going to post up another record free cash flow year next year, this upcoming year. And yes, definitely the potential to surpass EBITDA margin and as well as potentially operating margin.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. Thanks. Congrats.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry.\nMichael Bauer: Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nEddie Capel: Anybody there?\nMichael Bauer: Operator? Operator, we'll take the next question. Liah, are you there? Liah, can you hear us, Liah. Everybody on the call, the operator just told us that she's having some technical issues. So, standby.\nOperator: Once again, we have a question in queue from Joe with Baird. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Can you hear me, okay?\nEddie Capel: We can, Joe. Apologies to everybody for the short break there that appeared to be a little technical challenge with the call service. But please fire away, Joe.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Great. I'm wondering when customers are making a commitment to WMS, are you seeing any changes in interest going along with the WMS and integrating other of your solutions within the same engagement. So are WMS deals carrying over into order management or TMS in a bigger way. And I'm curious if that's the case, are the deal sizes getting bigger. So I'd imagine RPO, there's a good quantity of activity, but is the size of what you're winning also going up?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. Great question. Just overall, clearly, our strategy is to partner with our customers to develop a digital transformation road map. And frankly, whether it starts with transportation, inventory, warehouse management, omni solutions and so forth, we really don't care where we get started. We certainly are seeing some multiproduct implementations. We launched Manhattan Active transportation management just a few months ago. We've got several customers and half of them is are implementing Manhattan Active WM as well. So it's great to see Manhattan Active TM and Madden Active WM coming together to provide that unified solution for our customers. But I think across the board, when you look at our order management system customers, our WM customers and our transportation customers, they are all great prospects for the other solutions for upsell and cross-sell. As we've said historically, across the approximate 20 products that we have in our portfolio, the average number of products that any one customer owns is about 304. So we've got a lot of cross-sell and upsell potential. As far as your question around larger RPO opportunities for multiproduct, yes, is the answer to that. Do just bear in mind, though, that when you implement either a WM program, a TM program, an order management program and inventory program, they're pretty big. And customers can only bite off so much at once. So they tend to be a bit more serial than in parallel. But we certainly are seeing some joint unified programs.\nJoe Vruwink: That's good color. And then, Eddie, I think the win rate disclosure you typically made this quarter, it went up relative to what the win rates have been trending at. I'm just wondering if you can kind of carve out where you're seeing the improvement? And maybe one of the things that was noticeable during the quarter is the geographic breadth of where the announcements are coming from it's not so much Americas or Europe, it's global, and you mentioned your global teams a number of times on the call. So I'm wondering if there's maybe anything new happening in the sales activity that can help explain kind of the improvement and what you're seeing.\nEddie Capel: I think it's the continued investment in innovation that's really driving the win ratio when it comes right down to it. We will see that bounce around a little bit. But I think when we look at - when we talk to our prospects that have turned into customers about why they chose us and so forth. I mean it tends to be because of the innovation that we brought to the market. And certainly, the great experience we've got across our teams and all the other things, the attributes that we bring play a role, but the innovation in our product delivery, I think, is number one. In terms of seeing an improvement in both EMEA and APAC this quarter. There's no question we've seen in EMEA and APAC lag just a little bit in terms of, I guess, we'll call it, the COVID recovery. And we're seeing a good bit more movement and momentum in Europe, number one, and then follow closely behind in APAC. So feel good about bringing a bit of balance back to the performance.\nDennis Story: Yeah. Joe, we are having some nice cross-sell upsell deal closures as well, about $60 million of bookings impact in the quarter.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Thanks, Dennis. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Very good. Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson from Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a really strong quarter. So two for me. Obviously, we're seeing the guidepost gets raised. I'm curious if we had to think about, I guess, 9 to 12 months ago, obviously, you're outperforming your expectations. If we had to kind of stack order rank what drove that from like a product or market perspective, what would you say are the top one or two key drivers?\nEddie Capel: I think we have been pleasantly surprised by the uptick of Manhattan Active WM, number one. I think certainly it's early days, but the momentum we're seeing around Manhattan Active Transportation Management. And then thirdly, the bounce back of Manhattan Active omni. We saw some subdued shall we say, activity in Manhattan Active omni, and that's back to picking back up. So that would be the top three, I think, on my roster, Brian.\nBrian Peterson: Okay. And I'll follow up on the WMS side, Eddie. So we're 16 months into Active WM. And obviously, I think we're hearing the win rates are good, the performance, everything sounds really encouraging. But I'm curious that the cloud or referenceability, is that a friction point for some customers? And to the extent that you have customers up and running, does that actually make the next 16 months like a lot brighter than the first 6 months. I'm just curious to get your thoughts there. Thanks, guys.\nEddie Capel: We hope so. But we've certainly got great implementation activity going on, good referenceability and so forth. I'll tell you that the friction or the resistance to being early or an early adopter or no, whatever you want to call it, hasn't really been there. As you know, we had a beta customer when we launched. We already had a customer live, very successful, already been through a bunch of kind of versionless updates and so forth. So we had a great reference point to get it started and didn't see a lot of friction. But no question, success breed success. And as we continue to drive across verticals, across geographies and get more referenceability across all those dimensions, I think we certainly have the opportunity to continue to see success.\nBrian Peterson: Great. Thanks, Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Loop Capital [ph]. Your line is open.\nMark Schappel: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, and good job on the quarter. Congrats on that. Eddie, starting with you, I just want to revisit your prepared remarks around the hiring environment for your professional services team. And I just wonder if you could just give us a sense of where you're at with respect to your hiring plan for this year. Are you on plan for the most part, a little bit behind plan? Maybe just give us a little color there.\nEddie Capel: Yeah, we're a little bit behind, Mark, where we'd like to be, frankly. It's a tough sledding out there from a talent acquisition perspective. But we've obviously got a great success story here. We've got a fantastic culture in the company. No question that people like to be associated with a successful company that is doing meaningful work for Tier 1 companies around the globe. So we're doing pretty good on that front. But if I could wave a magic one, there's no question we'd be a little further ahead with a higher in trajectory than where we are. And obviously, that's driven by demand.\nMark Schappel: And with that said, given that demand is tight and as you said earlier, you expect it to continue to be tight for talent. Is that changing the way that maybe you're approaching R&D as far as prioritizing certain projects? In other words, maybe putting in some features and capabilities in your products that just make them a little bit easier to install and it doesn't require as much professional services time.\nEddie Capel: Yeah. We're always focused on that, Mark, frankly, trying to make it. We're trying to drive down always the total cost of ownership for our products. We want to be feature-rich. We want to be able to provide the greatest innovation to our customers. But by the same token, we've got to continue to focus on total cost of ownership, speed of implementation, cost of support and so forth. So we've always been focused on that. I'll be honest, I wouldn't say that we've taken any particularly specific steps to focus on that in the last six months or so, but we remain focused on driving total cost of ownership bank. And obviously, you bring up a corollary point there with such a tight labor market for distribution centers, truck drivers and so forth, certainly, the capabilities that we bring to market, focus on blending, automation, robotics and people in the warehouse and so forth certainly is very helpful for our customers.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Great. And then just going back to your earlier comments around the bounce back that you're seeing in your active omni business and product. Maybe just talk a little bit about what you think is driving that so-called bounce back.\nEddie Capel: I mean stores were closed, right, for a couple of quarters, number one, the acceleration of the digital transformation that we're all seeing personally and professionally. So we're seeing a combination of the stores reopening and the need for store systems and very strategic omnichannel initiatives that are driving growth for retail and wholesale customers alike.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. That's all from me. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Mark. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is open.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to first start out on the supply chain challenges that I'm sure many of your customers are having. How is that impacting your business, if at all? Because I imagine it could drive demand as well as perhaps create some distractions with customers or prospects.\nEddie Capel: Yeah, yeah. Honestly, I would say it's got a slight positive to it, Matt. We're obviously involved largely in the finished goods side. So on the import side of things and all those boats sitting off the port of Long Beach and everywhere else, we're not necessarily managing that sequencing and so forth. But when the finished goods hit sure, there is a great need to accelerate the movement of that inventory, have the inventory in the right place at the right time and then get that inventory in the hands of the consumers in a timely fashion. And of course, again, our solutions creating that speed and that dexterity and that agility for our customers to be able to manage through these or help manage through these very, very tough times and the need to be able to manage inventory at very, very high levels.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. Great. And any update on the point-of-sale solution?\nEddie Capel: I'll put a few comments in my prepared remarks about point of sale. But yes, we've seen a couple of terrific go-lives in recent weeks and recent months. And in terms of closures, a couple of other nice real important wins for us in the quarter. So continuing to see that forward momentum, frankly. And looking forward to getting more and more and more referenceable customers there. And as Brian from Ray J mentioned, the more referenceable customers that you've got, the less friction than might be in the sales cycle. So these couple of go lights we had in the quarter are important to us and as are the new sales and new bookings that we've seen in the quarter too.\nMatt Pfau: Great. And last one for me, just in terms of the dynamic of RPO growth and cloud revenue growth, maybe you can just remind us again about the timing differences between the two. And now that you've given us this helpful multiyear outlook, we can kind of see how cloud revenue growth accelerates and then RPO growth comes down a little bit off it's high. But how do we sort of think about the timing differences and how long those discrepancies take to resolve?\nEddie Capel: Well, I mean, I don't know, one of the reasons for providing those supplemental schedules and the guideposts and so forth was so that you can see how that dynamic shapes up. If you were to kind of pin me down on how long it takes for those things to normalize, it'd probably be the 18- to 24-month time frame. And of course, by the same token, we're going to continue to drive new RPO. - it'll have the same dynamic built into it. So - but I think 18 to 24 months before you see that kind of really normalize.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. I guess, maybe another way to look at it is with the Active WM implementations, which I think are the main things driving that discrepancy with the implementation rollout. What would the typical rollout for your Active WM deployments be? Because if I understand correctly, that's the primary driver of sort of the timing differences between those two items?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. Well, so the thing to really be aware of there is a lot of this ramp, as we call it, is driven by multisite rollouts. So the average duration, typical duration to get an Active WM site up and running, let's call it, the six-month kind of timeframe. But when you're dealing with a global 10, 20, 30 distribution centers or more distribution centers around the globe, that's what takes time to move through that deal moving through the snake.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Certainly, Matt.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt Securities. I'm sorry, but the question was withdrawn. Please go ahead, presenters.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Very good. If that's all of the questions for today, we'll say thank you very much for everybody's time, your support, and we'll look forward to seeing you - or talking to you on our Q4 call in about 90 days or so. Thanks, again. Bye-bye.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter results, discuss our updated full-year 2021 outlook and provide some very preliminary color on 2022 and beyond. Q3 and year-to-date results were an all-time record for Manhattan Associates. Total revenue increased 13% to $169 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.71 increased 39%. Both of these metrics exceeded our expectations. Strong cloud and services demand continues to drive revenue outperformance, fueling double-digit top line growth and strong earnings leverage. Above all, our investments in innovation are paying off. Product differentiation between Manhattan and other supply chain software vendors continues to increase. And moreover, our global teams are performing exceptionally well with a laser focus on customer success. We delivered record third quarter bookings with RPO increasing 123% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $574 million, providing us with excellent future revenue visibility. Additionally, 40% of our Q3 contracted bookings were generated from net new customers. And our pipeline continues to be robust with solid demand across our product suites. Over 90% of the pipeline consists of cloud opportunities with net new potential customers representing about 35% of that demand. And with strong business momentum and our increased visibility, we're providing refreshed guideposts for RPO and cloud revenue through 2024. Dennis will provide more color later in the call, but this includes moving up our milestone of reaching $1 billion in RPO to 2022 from our original target of 2023. On the sales front, competitive win rates remained strong at about 75% as our innovation is recognized as industry-leading. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings for the quarter, but drilling into the sub verticals, they're pretty diverse, including apparel, department stores, grocery, food and beverage, industrial, health services as well as durable and nondurable goods. Our global services team continues to execute amazingly well, conducting over 100 go-lives in Q3. And for the quarter, services revenue was up 20% compared with the prior-year period. As we mentioned in our Q2 call, the market is extremely competitive for services and technical talent. And while we're well positioned for significant growth, we do expect demand for talent to continue to be strong, with new and existing customers wanting to accomplish more with our solutions and at a faster pace. We're very mindful of the workload that we put on our teams, and we're focused on attracting and retaining talent, which we continue to factor into our operational planning and guidance. On the innovation front, with our R&D spend approaching $90 million annually, we're focused on providing modern cloud native applications that are architected to unify commerce and supply chain experiences. Manhattan is on the leading edge of removing numerous unnatural silos or artificial boundaries that really don't align with business workflows. Our technology is differentiating and industry-leading and a Manhattan active SaaS solutions are scalable, versionless and extensible. And this enables our customers to quickly adapt to market changes. It can improve efficiency and leverage their data in more robust ways, including solving challenges that legacy and silo systems simply cannot. And we believe that we're still very early in our cloud journey, but we couldn't be more pleased with the market's enthusiastic response to our Manhattan Active solutions. So let's spend just a few minutes on specific updates on products and customers. We're actually off to a great start with Manhattan Active Transportation Management, the industry's fastest and smartest multimodal transportation optimization engine. Manhattan Active TM is the industry's first self-configuring and self-tuning system built on our industry-leading Manhattan application architecture. Manhattan Active TM is joined with Manhattan Active Warehouse Management to form Manhattan Active supply chain, the industry's first unified cloud native supply chain execution platform. And since launch, we've been heartened by the accolades we've received for Manhattan Active Transportation Management from analysts, partners and customers. perhaps most encouragingly, several of the Manhattan Active Transportation Management customers are also deploying Manhattan Active WM. In other words, our supply chain unification message and strategy is really resonating with these joint solution customers realizing the clear benefits of unifying distribution, transportation, labor and automation within a single application. Manhattan Active WM, the other half of Manhattan Active Supply Chain, continues to experience pretty explosive growth. Consistent with prior quarters, we're seeing a very nice balance between net new customers and existing Manhattan WMS customers choosing to migrate to our next-generation of WM platform. In just, what is it, 16 short months, Manhattan Active WM is live or are in the process of being implemented in 11 countries across 16 different industries, a pretty good testament to its cross-vertical and international applicability. The small sampling of either live or currently implementing Manhattan Active WM customers include a luxury retail department store and national beverage distributor, Tier 0 national grocer outside of the US and several industrial distributors across the globe. Our competitive win rate with WMS has always been pretty high, and Manhattan Active WM has helped us raise that already high bar. Now turning now to our omni-channel applications. We continue to make strides with our Manhattan Active point-of-sale application. This past quarter saw a global apparel and footwall brand, activate a Manhattan Active point-of-sale application in two new flagship stores in New York and Las Vegas. This particular customer also runs Manhattan Active order management, and they saw a clear advantage of deploying a unified omnichannel operating platform across their digital and bricks-and-mortar operations. And from a geographical point of view, the plans call for deploying Manhattan Active point-of-sale and order management across the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. And we believe that Manhattan Active omni is unique in its ability to provide full featured order management, contact center and store systems as part of a unified platform across the globe. And to close out our product and customer updates this quarter, I'm happy to report that a couple of weeks ago, we were able to host several small customer events in person for the first time in quite some time. And we were pleased to host customers in the UK, in the Netherlands and finally in France for some pretty intimate events to discuss their commerce and supply chain strategies and how Manhattan Active solutions can help them progress their digital transformations. And I got to tell you, it was such a pleasure to connect in person with a group of strategic customers after such a long break. Well, that concludes my brief business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and outlook, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis? Good report. Dennis, thank you. We're very pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date results. And while we continue to operate in a pretty turbulent global macro environment, business momentum is very positive. And of course, we're very encouraged by our accelerating RPO and associated revenue growth. As we look forward, we're confident in our ability to deliver success for our customers and help them drive their digital transformation. As a result, we anticipate long-term, sustainable and profitable growth for Manhattan Associates. And with that, Liah, we'd be happy to take any questions. Yeah. Yeah. It's early, Terry, but without putting too much pressure on and we're obviously very pleased to have her on board. And at the end of the day, we think, frankly, as well as we've done, we've still got some of the industry's best kept secrets, and we're anxious to be able to get that message out. So, I think we have the opportunity to share our stories with a broader community, drive awareness, particularly for our newer products. And just overall, frankly, get the message out that we're here to do business and help our customers in the industry with digital transformation. Yeah. I don't think there's any specific micro verticals or sub verticals, Terry, but I do think that there has been some - a little bit of pent-up demand with the industry waiting for the real next generation of cloud native or next generation of solutions to emerge, those, in this case, being cloud-native, very innovative access to new innovation on a regular basis. So we're definitely seeing some uptick out there from customers that we haven't done business with before. We're fortunately seeing some nice takeaways from some of the older competitors that are out there. But it is - but it's quite broad and not focused on any given industry. Thank you, Terry. Anybody there? We can, Joe. Apologies to everybody for the short break there that appeared to be a little technical challenge with the call service. But please fire away, Joe. Yeah. Great question. Just overall, clearly, our strategy is to partner with our customers to develop a digital transformation road map.

Very good. Thank you, Joe. I think we have been pleasantly surprised by the uptick of Manhattan Active WM, number one. I think certainly it's early days, but the momentum we're seeing around Manhattan Active Transportation Management. And then thirdly, the bounce back of Manhattan Active omni.

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. Nothing but accolades for our Manhattan global teams. Top to bottom, we continue to raise the bar in a choppy macro delivering strong growth, profitability, cash flow and balance sheet metrics. I'll start with a quick recap of the quarter with growth rates on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. Total revenue was a record $169 million, up 13%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 27%. Notably, 70% of our total revenue is now driven by cloud and services. Our Q3 operating profit was a record totaling $53 million, up 20% with adjusted operating margin of 31.3% and GAAP operating margin of 25.1%. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue combined with lower expenses driven by the COVID pandemic. Compared to 2019, we estimate COVID lowered our year-to-date 2021 expenses by about 425 basis points and year-to-date 2020 by about 325 basis points, respectively. Adjusting for COVID or put another way, assuming these expenses remain unchanged from 2019 levels, adjusted operating margin would be approximately 24% year-to-date, up over 200 basis points compared to year-to-date 2020. Earnings per share was a record $0.71, up 39%. Our earnings per share did include $0.06 of nonrecurring tax benefit associated with expiring tax statutes. So, normalized EPS was $0.65, up 27%, either way a record. Our Q3 and year-to-date operating cash flow performance was a record with Q3 totaling $60 million and year-to-date $145 million, both up 41% on record global cash collections. How about our free cash flow margin? It continues to be strong at 35% for the quarter and 29% year-to-date. EBITDA margin was 32% in the quarter and 29% year-to-date. Our balance sheet continues to be rock solid with $246 million in cash and 0 debt, providing us excellent flexibility to invest for growth. We invested $20 million in share buybacks in the quarter, resulting in $80 million in buybacks year-to-date. And for the fourth quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be about 64.3 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. Also, our board has approved our customary $50 million share repurchase authority. That covers the macros. Now let's drill down a little bit into revenue. Cloud revenue in the quarter totaled $32 million, up 53% as our new annual contract value continues to accelerate on strong market demand. For Q4, we expect cloud revenue of roughly $33.5 million. As Eddie mentioned, Q3 was a record third quarter with RPO, remaining performance obligation. Our RPO bookings totaled $574 million, up 123% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. With RPO continuing to compound positively, our visibility into future subscription revenue continues to strengthen, giving us confidence in our forward visibility and guidepost projections. Services revenue was $88 million, up 20% as our cloud momentum continues to fuel our services revenue growth. Americas and Europe are running at double-digit growth, with APAC demand improving. For Q4 retail peak season, it's starting earlier than normal given supply chain constraints. We are forecasting services revenue to be about $82 million with year-over-year growth of 16%. As a reminder to most of you, the sequential revenue decline from Q3 represents our traditional retail peak seasonality as customers slow implementations to meet their customers' demand. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 56.8%, up over 380 basis points compared to the year ago period and was predominantly driven by revenue performance and cloud operating leverage. Accounting for retail peak season and growth investments, we expect Q4 margin to be about 50.2%, resulting in full year 2021 margin of 53.5%, up 190 basis points over the prior year. License revenue was $8 million, down 36% and maintenance revenue was $34 million, down 8%, primarily on cash collection timing. And one final revenue call out, our hardware team is in the double-digit growth gain, up 25% year-to-date. Good job, guys. Transitioning to guidance. Barring any major global macro setbacks, our full year 2021 guidance and preliminary 2022 outlook puts us on track to deliver consecutive record revenue years. Our overarching objective obviously is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins, benchmarked annually against enterprise SaaS comps. For 2021, we are raising our total revenue guidance to $653 million to $655 million, up from our prior range of $643 million to $650 million. Our underlying total 2021 revenue growth ex license and maintenance, which removes the revenue compression from our cloud transition is targeted to be 19% at the midpoint. For Q4, we expect total revenue of $161 million to $163 million. Full year operating margin is expected to be 25.8% to 26%, factoring in retail peak season revenue impact and including $10 million in special performance-based compensation and retention investments. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be $2.12 to $2.14, up from our prior range of $2.00 to $2.06. For GAAP EPS, our guidance range is $1.61 to $1.63 with a midpoint of $1.62, up 6% from our previous midpoint of $1.53. And for Q4, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39. For full year 2021, our cloud revenue estimate is increasing to $121 million, representing 51% growth. Given our strong performance in Q3 and year-to-date, we are also increasing our RPO outlook to a range of $675 million to $700 million, up from our prior outlook range of $550 million to $600 million. The $688 million midpoint is up over 75% from our initial RPO target provided on our Q3 2020 earnings call. For full year 2021, license and maintenance revenue continues to positively attrite on increasing demand for our cloud solutions. We expect license to be about $33 million and maintenance roughly $143 million. For Q4, we expect license to be about $7.5 million and maintenance roughly $35 million. Our CapEx estimate for 2021 is $3 million to $4 million. And for full year 2021, we expect an adjusted tax rate of about 19.5% and a GAAP tax rate of approximately 17.5%. So that covers the quarter and our 2021 outlook. Let's cover some 2022 preliminary targets and guideposts. We are in our budget cycle currently, so we will firm up our parameters on our Q4 call. Please note, though, to facilitate a review for you all, we have added a supplemental schedule, Item Number 9 last page in today's earnings release, providing a comparison of our original geometrics and our current updated guideposts. As the schedule shows, we are moving all our guideposts for cloud revenue and RPO materially higher. In addition, our adjusted operating margins are improved from our initial color provided in February. Please note year-over-year growth rates are based on the midpoint of our 2021 guidance. Our preliminary estimate of 2022 total revenue is $695 million to $715 million, excluding license and maintenance attrition at 16% growth. All in, our initial growth target is 8%. Our full year 2022 adjusted EPS range is $1.90 to $2.10. For 2022 cloud revenue, we are targeting $160 million to $165 million in revenue, representing 35% growth at the midpoint. Exiting 2021, including ramp transactions, we expect to achieve a three-year 2022 to 2024 compounded annual growth rate of 40% at the midpoint of our cloud revenue targets. For RPO, we are targeting a three-year CAGR of 35% at the midpoint of our targets of $1 billion in 2022, growing to $1.7 billion in 2024. Those are big numbers. In 2022, we are also targeting services revenue of $362 million to $370 million, which represents 9% growth. License revenue of $13 million to $15 million and maintenance revenue of $137 million to $140 million as we continue to expect a longer attrition tell for maintenance. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin is expected to be about 54%, and we are pegging 2022 operating margins at 22.5% to 24% and are targeting an annual 75 to 125 basis point expansion annually starting in 2023. The factors impacting the inherent leverage in our model and driving the 2022 year over decline in operating margin include license attrition of 57% and to $14 million with maintenance revenue attrition at 4% as customers shift to cloud, totaling about 200 basis points of margin impact. Wage inflation and labor market trends accounting for about 200 basis points in margin investment. As we've previously discussed, demand for technical talent is high, and we expect the labor market to continue to be very competitive through 2022. Continued investment across our company fueled by customer demand, we are investing in R&D, services and sales and marketing and the continued return of COVID impact expenses such as travel, our annual momentum customer conference, employee appreciation events, contractors, et cetera, total about 100 basis points. We also expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22%, and our diluted share count will be approximately 64.3 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So, lastly, I'll summarize our 2023 and 2024 guideposts that should better assist investors' assessment of our future cloud growth and earnings trajectory. Remember comparison of our guidepost versus historicals are located in our earnings release. For 2023, we are targeting RPO of $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion, representing 33% growth at the midpoint. Cloud revenue of $220 million to $240 million, representing 42% growth at the midpoint. And introducing 2024, for RPO, we are targeting $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, representing 28% growth at the midpoint. Cloud revenue, we're targeting $310 million to $345 million, representing 42% growth at the midpoint. So that covers the financial update. Thank you very much, and back to Eddie for some closing remarks. Yeah. No onetime items, great quality of one quality of earnings and quality of cash flow. So I'd expect we're going to post up another record free cash flow year next year, this upcoming year. And yes, definitely the potential to surpass EBITDA margin and as well as potentially operating margin. Yeah. Joe, we are having some nice cross-sell upsell deal closures as well, about $60 million of bookings impact in the quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Ren, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates Q2 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, July 27. I would now like to introduce Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Sir, you may begin.\nMichael Bauer: Thank you, Ren, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates' 2021 second quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You were cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties are not guarantees of future performance, and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note, in particular, that uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everybody and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results and discuss our updated full year outlook. So Q2 and first half 2021 results were an all-time record for Manhattan Associates. With Q2, total revenue increasing 22% to $166 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share increasing 53% to $0.61, and both of these metrics exceeded our expectations. Our global teams are very busy and continue to execute extremely well as broad revenue and performance translated into strong top line growth and also earnings leverage. Furthermore, demand continues to strengthen for our growing set of cloud solutions, resulting in record second quarter bookings with RPO increasing 117% year-over-year and 16% sequentially to $489 million. So with momentum accelerating and forward revenue visibility improving, once again, we're increasing our 2021 guidance, including RPO. Now, as many of you are aware, our solutions are mission critical and that we're focused on providing modern cloud native solutions that are architected to unify commerce and supply chain experiences. Our technology is differentiating and industry leading, and by providing solutions that are scalable, versionless and extensible. Our customers are able to adapt more quickly to changing market conditions and are better positioned to profitably scale their businesses. On the sales front, competitive win rates remains strong at about 70%. It\u2019s that commitment to innovation keeps Manhattan Associates at top of our industry rankings. From a vertical perspective, retail manufacturing and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And if we drill in a little to the sub verticals, they're pretty diverse, including apparel, department stores, food and beverage, industrial, as well as durable and non-durable goods. Now our Manhattan Active Solution pipeline continues to grow nicely to benefiting from our market leadership position, our unparalleled technology and global infrastructure and favorable market tailwinds, which are all driving strong demand for a modern, adaptable, scalable and resilient supply chain, inventory and omnichannel solutions. We're experiencing solid demand across all of our product suites. About 90% of our pipeline consists of cloud opportunities with existing customers conversion accelerating somewhat. And in addition, net new potential customers represent about 40% of the pipeline demand. Americas pipeline is particularly strong, but we're starting to see Europe and APAC strengthen heading into the second half as well. Now our global services team executed amazingly well in Q2. They conducted over a 100 go-lives. And as expected, our services segment returned to growth in this quarter, increasing 18% compared with the prior year period. And with strong demand for our services, we're aggressively recruiting talent globally, but like everyone, we expect the market to be extremely competitive for services and technical talent in the second half, which we have factored into our operational planning and guidance. Now on the innovation front, it's still quite early in our journey to unify mission critical commerce and supply chain systems. But that said, given our solution breadth, industry expertise and commitment to innovation, we're uniquely positioned to successfully do so. With our R&D spend approaching $19 million annually, growing opportunities to innovate within white space and a large opportunity to drive penetration of our Manhattan Active Solution with new and existing customers, we're very well positioned for long-term sustainable growth. Now as most of you know, in late May and for the second straight year, we held our annual user conference, Momentum Connect virtually. Like last year, we saw a strong registration attendance at the conference, which offered a mix of live sessions and a plethora of on demand sessions as well. And also for the second year running, we made a major product announcement this time regarding our transportation management solution. Now, before we get into the details of Manhattan Active Transportation Management, a quick short recap of our multi-year product strategies probably in order. Now back in 2014, we started on our mission to modernize our product lines, to ensure both Manhattan and our customers, who are strategically positioned for future needs. Our strategy really had two key elements, relaunching our industry-leading solutions like WMS, OMS, and TMS as true cloud native solutions, and leveraging our leading-edge cloud native platform to create solution capability and unification to a degree that really was previously impossible. Now in 2017, we launched Manhattan Active Omni, the first of these unified cloud native suite of solutions. Manhattan Active Omni unifies contact center or the management, customer engagement, point-of-sale and store inventory and fulfillment into a single offering, it allows our customers to deliver unparalleled omnichannel customer experiences without ever needing to an install additional applications or ever performing upgrade. Now in 2020, we shipped Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, the industry's first Tier 1 cloud-native WMS. And this year at Momentum Connect, we announced Manhattan Active Transportation Management with the industry's fastest and smartest multimodal transportation optimization engine. And together with Manhattan Active WM, Manhattan Active TM forms the Manhattan Active Supply Chain, the industry's first unified supply chain execution platform. We believe Manhattan Active Supply Chain is really a game changer for our customers. For the last couple of decades, we've had a front row seat to see the challenges and opportunities that come with integrating WMS and TMS in high volume, high complexity digital supply chains. And along the way, we came to realize that the way to solve this problem was not just better integration, but rather through a truly unified distribution and transportation solution. Unfortunately, the advent of microservices and the cloud-native architecture presented us with the unique opportunity to build such a unified offering. And we launched it in May of this year. Solution unification delivers some obvious benefits like single user experiences for all things, supply chain execution, a dramatically simplified integration picture, and a common technology platform for our customers to extend the solution and innovate alongside us. But we believe that the opportunities that unified supply chain platform brings are actually much larger than that. Unification of a WMS and TMS allows us to solve entirely new set of problems, a holistic approach to solving problems that benefits our customers in a base application. And it also allows them to solve problems creatively using our entire catalog of microservices. And perhaps most importantly of all, it allows our customers to break down their organizational silos between distribution and transportation, and to think about optimizing inventory flow and customer deliveries, because now more than ever, supply chain professionals are effectively customer service associates because their actions directly impact customer outcomes and brand loyalty. So Manhattan Active Supply Chain comprises the newly Manhattan Active Transportation Management combined with Manhattan Active Warehouse Management. And frankly, it's been a great first year for Manhattan Active WM. Market response for Manhattan Active WM has really exceeded our expectations and that product and delivery teams are fully engaged with a busy summer of go-lives. In hindsight, it does appear that there was a significant market demand for a Tier 1 cloud-native WMS and this quarter's new Manhattan Active WM subscriptions continue to show a nice diversification of geographies and industries and a nice mix of net new WM logos, and conversions from our existing on-premise WMS. In early reports, the customers are seeing significant benefit from innovations like customer grade mobile experience for warehouse associates, order streaming and it's first of a kind employee engagement capability built directly into WMS. Now I close out my product remarks today with just a few updates on the major Manhattan Active platform, Manhattan Active Omni. Last quarter, I updated you on some pretty nice signings and growing pipeline for our point-of-sale application. In this quarter, I'll just tell you a little bit about what we're seeing in order management. We kicked off projects this year at a number of large well-known global retailers to implement that core order management applications. And not only will they activate core OMS, they'll also take advantage of the Manhattan exclusive innovations like interactive inventory for dynamic order promising. And they're also using the digital self-service capabilities to allow their customers to change or to pick up windows to create their own returns, to create their own exchanges, all directly on their own mobile devices. And we continue to push the boundaries of the problems we solve with Manhattan Active Omni and with an increasing frequency of our omnichannel microservices that are the center of our customer's headless commerce architectures or for the future good of the industry. Now that concludes my brief business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and outlook. And then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. And as Eddie mentioned, record Q2 and first half results and nearly every major metric category, we put up record numbers, growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet results were all solid for the quarter. Our quality of earnings performance was outstanding top to bottom. There are no one-time adjustments in these results, just great execution. And here's a summary of Q2 financial highlights, which includes our guidance for total revenue, operating profit and earnings per share. You also can refer to today's earnings release for our adjusted and GAAP guidance. Also unless otherwise stated, growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. So total revenue was up $166 million or was $166 million up 22%. Our outperformance was broadened across all revenue line items. Like Q1, we again experienced notable strength in cloud. Based on our strong first half and second half outlook, we are raising our total revenue guidance from our previous range of $625 million to $640 million to $643 million to $650 million. So our new range is $643 million to $650 million on total revenue, targeting 10% growth at the midpoint of $646 million. Our underlying total revenue growth, excluding license and maintenance, which removes the revenue compression from our cloud transition is targeted to be 18% at the midpoint. And for Q3, we expect total revenue of $162 million to $165 million or 9% growth at the midpoint. For adjusted EPS, EPS was up $0.61 or was $0.61 up 53% and GAAP EPS was $0.48. For adjusted EPS, we are raising full year guidance range to $2 to $2.06 with a midpoint of $2.03, up 23% from our previous midpoint of $1.65. For GAAP earnings per share, our guidance range is $1.50 to $1.56 with a midpoint of $1.53 and that's up 33% from our previous midpoint of a $1.15. For Q3, we expect adjusted EPS to be $0.53 to $0.55. Moving to revenue lines. Cloud revenue was $29 million up 55%. For Q3, we expect cloud revenue of roughly $30.5 million and are raising our previous full year 2021 cloud revenue estimate of $111 million to $113 million, we're raising that up to $117 million to $119 million equating to 48% growth at the midpoint. Q2 was a record second quarter with RPO with bookings totaling $489 million up 117% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. With RPO continuing to compound positively, our visibility into future subscription revenue continues to strengthen. As mentioned in Q1, we will update our forward-looking guidepost on our Q4 call and we intend to guide RPO on an annual basis as bookings can be lumpy, primarily based on sales cycle timing, the number and relative value of large deals and product mix from quarter-to-quarter. That said, with our strong year-to-date RPO performance, we are raising our 2021 estimate at $450 million to $550 million to $550 million to $600 million. Licensed revenue for the quarter was $8.8 million as our base of existing customers added users in the quarter, and maintenance revenue was up or \u2013 I'm sorry was $38 million up 5% on license revenue and solid gas collections. As previously discussed, we expect second half license and maintenance revenue to decline on customer conversions to cloud, which is positive for our company, our customers, RPO and future subscription revenue growth. We expect license to decline to about $6 million in Q3 and $4.5 million in Q4. For maintenance revenue we are targeting roughly $36 million in Q3 and $35.5 million in Q4. For perspective, on cloud demand full year 2020, license revenue is down 22% and maintenance down 1%. Our 2021 forecast has licensed down about 54% in the second half and down 29% for the full year. No question, cloud demand is outstripping license. Maintenance will be down about 1% for full year 2021, also maintenance will have a longer attrition tail as customers typically maintain customer support through the cloud conversion cycle. Moving to services revenue. Services revenue was $85 million up 18% with our cloud momentum fueling our services and revenue growth. Our Q3 services revenue estimate is $86 million and for Q4, our estimate is $83 million. The sequential decline is driven by Q4 retail peak season impact as customers typically idol implementations. And our final revenue line, hardware, delivered $6 million in revenue up 66%. So that covers growth. How about profitability. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 55.9% up over 350 basis points compared to the year ago, period and it was predominantly driven by revenue performance and cloud operating leverage. We expect Q3 consolidated cloud, subscription, maintenance and services margin to be about 55.2% and Q4 margin to be 52.7%, again driven by retail peak season resulting in a second half margin of approximately 54% ahead of our prior outlook of 51.1%. And how about the bottom line. Q2 operating income totaled $50 million, up 46%. Operating margin was 30.2% up over 490 basis points. GAAP operating margin was 23.7%. We are increasing our full year adjusted operating margin range to 25.5% to 26%, up about 400 basis points over prior guidance of 21% to 22%. For Q3, we expect a range of 27$ to 27.5% and for Q4 a range estimate of 22.5% to 23%. Just a reminder, our second half license and maintenance expectations combined with Q4 retail peak seasonality is factored into our Q4 estimates. That said, we are very pleased with our earnings leverage and we are continuing to invest significantly in our business to drive long-term sustainable, double-digit top line growth balanced with top quartile operating margins. Now turning to cash, cash flow, taxes and cap structure, another solid performance. We closed with Q2 cash on hand totaling $209 million was zero debt. Our operating cash flow was $46 million resulting in year-to-date operating cash flow of $85 million up 41%. Our Q2 free cash flow margin was 27% and note our CapEx estimate for 2021 continues to be $6 million to $8 million. Also, we invested $33 million in share buybacks in Q2, resulting in $60 million in buybacks year-to-date. For the third quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be about $64.4 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity and also our board raised our buyback authority to $50 million. Regarding taxes, our adjusted effective income tax rate for Q2 was 21.7% and our GAAP tax rate was 23%. For full year 2021, we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of about 21.5% and a GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%. So that covers the financial update. Thank you, and back to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Very good. Thanks Dennis. Well, we're very pleased with our strong second quarter and year-to-date results. And while the global macro environment remains somewhat turbulent, Manhattan Associates is entering into second half of 2021 with some tailwinds. We've accelerated the pace of our innovation and delivering the right solutions at the right time. And the result is a strong business momentum and a great opportunity for us to deliver success to our customers and help shape their digital transformation. And before opening it up for questions, I do want to take this opportunity to thank all of my Manhattan Associates teammates across the globe. Many of you have started to return to our offices and I continue to be inspired by your flexibility, resilience, and ongoing commitment to ensure our customers are successful. So thanks again. Ren, we're now open to take questions\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: Hey gentlemen, good afternoon, and definitely congratulations on the results and the outlook update. I have two questions. The first Eddie for you, in terms of now delivering on the innovation around Active WM and TM, and combined. Are you actually seeing sales cycles where they actually want to buy both of the products at the same time, or is it more of a differentiator and it's just helping spur the conversations and improve close rates on just either or? That's the first question?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Good question, Terry. Well, it's early. Of course, we're six weeks past release of Manhattan Active TM, but the answer is yes, we have sold at least one that comes to mind new customer \u2013 brand new customer, so new logo, not done business with us before. And they contracted for both Manhattan Active WM and Manhattan Active TM. So feel pretty good about that and off to a good start six week in.\nTerry Tillman: That's great. And then just the follow-up question, Dennis, for you and thanks for all the financial color is. What I'm curious about is, I think I forgot if it was the fourth quarter or the first quarter, but I think it was fourth quarter call. You gave us kind of a long-term roadmap and how like the cloud subscription revenue, how it's going to layer on from this growing RPO. But what I'm curious about is yes, you guys are well ahead of expectations on RPO, but also your cloud subscription revenues been coming along faster than I would've expected. Does that change kind of how the glide path or the acceleration curve is going to be that you talked about in a couple of years on cloud subscription revenue, or could it be maybe more evened out because of what you're seeing? Thank you.\nDennis Story: It is the former versus the latter Terry, it will change and we'll address that \u2013 we'll address those updates in the Q4 call for sure. Great forward visibility.\nTerry Tillman: Sounds great, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink from Baird. Your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi everyone. I wanted to go to the comment just on existing customers, maybe choosing to migrate a little more quickly or I think you said accelerating somewhat. Is that just a function of maybe time and comfort, the fact that we're over a year now with Active WM in market. So there is been a chance to see it, there's maybe some reference examples or there is something else going on there, where given what's happening from a industry backdrop, just the elevated importance of supply chain, maybe comfort with cloud ultimately feeds in as well that more customers are arriving at the conclusion that now is the right time to maybe embrace the new product?\nEddie Capel: Yes, I think you've answered the question well there, Joe. We're a year in or a year so, and certainly it takes a little time, not so much from a reference-ability perspective, but the budgeting cycles and even though we're existing customers those, if you want to call them sales cycles take awhile. And we're starting to see more of them come to fruition, but also the accelerating need for digital transformation in that core supply chain execution space. We've talked about this before that distribution centers don't look the same today as they did five or certainly 10 years ago, and the need for that modern software engine and technology to be able to power those distribution centers is certainly something that's fueling the growth to.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's great. And then just on the development of cloud and other gross margins and the upside you're starting to see. I guess, bigger picture because there is a couple of quarters in a row now of sequential gross margin improvement. Do you think you're at the point within the context of the broader transition and really the investment in cloud infrastructure and personnel that you\u2019ve been making over a number of years now, you're at a point where there just should be greater leverage behind that past investments. And so, understandably, there is seasonal changes in gross margin, but maybe as we look to the out years, there is an opportunity to build on 2021\u2019s levels?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, Dennis will take some of the details here as well. But certainly, there is opportunity to build on scale and leverage and so forth. I do think we had a virtual momentum conference this year, so we had some \u2013 we ended some underspend there frankly. We still have the opportunity that we believe to invest more in marketing and awareness. We're doing okay clearly, but we've got to get the message out and make sure we're not one of the world's best kept secrets from a technology and a supply chain perspective. So there is still some underspend there from our perspective and we'll continue to make those investments as well as material investments in research and development.\nDennis Story: Yes, Joe. I'll piggyback on Eddie too. So we're in year four or five, so I'd say we're probably \u2013 when we look at where we're at, we're probably a year ahead of what we expected, we're pretty excited about that. But bottom line is, we're going to continue to invest in T&T and that's talent and technology, we think we \u2013 our overall objective is, as I said in this call and continue to say is, as the objective is really to create long-term sustainable double-digit top line growth, and be a top quartile margin performer against any tech comps out there. And I think we're doing pretty good there.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks, gentlemen. Congrats in a really strong RPO number. So Dennis, maybe a follow-up on that last question, I've seen \u2013 I think we've seen the initial outlook of the last few years imply a decline in operating margins, but now we're seeing the expansion in 2020, we'll see margins up again this year. And there's still a lot of moving parts, but are we at the point where we can kind of call a trough in operating margins or is there any dynamic related to hiring or investments that we need to keep in mind there?\nDennis Story: We're not going to call a trough at this stage. So we'll evaluate that and discuss that in the Q4 earnings call, Brian. We are going to continue to invest in the business, but suffice to say, we're pretty confident in our ability to generate operating leverage.\nBrian Peterson: Got it. And maybe just one follow-up for me on the RPO, that was pretty strong again this quarter. I'm curious if you had to look back in the first half of the year and clearly RPO exceeded our expectations. Do you think the upside was more related to volume or just like the sales cycles or maybe related to deal value in any way that you can kind of slice and dice it that way? Just be curious to get your thoughts there. Thanks again.\nEddie Capel: That's pretty balanced, Brian, actually. So we've seen nice deal volume. We've seen some bigger deals, not much, but a little bit on the longer contract side. So a really nice balance is driving that RPO number, frankly.\nDennis Story: Yes. We're seeing a nice balance of not just our install base, but net new customers in our portfolio as well. Pretty exciting.\nBrian Peterson: Good to hear. Thanks guys.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Benchmark. Your line is open.\nMark Schappel: Hi, good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. Let me start off by saying, congratulations. Nice job on the quarter, another good quarter. Just want to drive down into some of the drivers of growth in the quarter. Were there particular product areas that you saw certain outperformance more so than others? I mean, it appears just based on some of your commentary in your prepared remarks that WMS kind of led the way, is that a good read?\nEddie Capel: Certainly WMS was the preponderance, a heritage there and so forth, and it tends to be sort of the lead product. But much like Q1, there was very nice balance across the product portfolio. WMS was strong for sure. And it was the lead dog but MAO really stepped up in Q2 and delivered some nice numbers and TMS, point-of-sale and inventory participated as well. So pretty nice balance, frankly.\nDennis Story: Yes. And the pipeline is continues to strengthen as well. So we're\u2026\nEddie Capel: Yes, similar balance in pipeline.\nMark Schappel: Okay, great. And then just diving down a little bit on the point-of-sale product that you have, on the Q1 call, you were seeing a pickup in some large point-of-sale projects and the sense was that retailers were just kind of restarting some of those strategic initiatives that they had. I just want to get that momentum carried over into the second quarter here. It appears that it did.\nDennis Story: Yes. Continues to have nice momentum, the good news is that some of these implementation timelines are getting shorter and shorter. So we've actually had three point-of-sale customers go-live just in the last \u2013 the back half of this quarter. And the nice thing about the point-of-sale pipeline for us is about 50% of the pipeline again, brand new customers that we've never done business with before. So as we've said many, many times not going to be an overnight success, but we really do feel like the flywheel given the wins, some go-lives, we're getting under our belt now in the pipeline, that we're starting to see the flywheel pick up some momentum.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Very good. And then finally here, just stepping back, taking like a 30,000 foot view, based on the overperformance, it appears that you're seeing a sense of heightened urgency from your customers regarding modernizing their supply chains? And just one, if you could just address how customers are maybe thinking differently about supply chain modernization today than they were a year or two ago?\nDennis Story: Yes. Well, I think a combination of needing or recognizing that they need resilience in the supply chain, they need contingency in the supply chain. And frankly, it's a very competitive world out there. I said a little bit of a different way than I said, in the script, supply chain these days is a customer service attributes, right. So each one of the customer \u2013 supply chain associates and our customers feel like their customer service advocates. And so I think that the need continues to grow. The need continues to heighten to bring supply chain to the forefront and be a competitive differentiator for our customers.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. Nice job.\nEddie Capel: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yun Kim from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nYun Kim: Thank you. So congrats on another strong quarter, Eddie and Dennis.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Yun.\nYun Kim: Eddie, maybe that you rolled out at the TM, I believe that's the last of the high-profile products to be activated into the active product family, if I can say that. So can you just give us an update on what your overall thoughts on what's next? Maybe this is a good time to update us on your acquisition strategy. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Yes, there was still plenty of work to do, Yun, in the supply chain space. We have frankly, a much longer list of innovations in the hopper than we can get through in the next quarter or two. So we're continuing to bear down on the investment strategy, build out the innovation into the white space that we see. I do think that, there's a couple of areas. In addition to the constant build out, the constant changing markets that drive new needs in the omni suite of solutions into WMS, into TMS, there's two categories, I think that are popping out, as a continuum. One is greater, greater levels of customer engagement. And so all of this work in digital self-service, what we've called consumer grade CRM still I think is a very vibrant market in a white space for us to drive into. And then the second piece is inventory optimization. I'm not suggesting that any of our customers or the market is not focused on inventory optimization but there is a still a real race to drive customer satisfaction and meet all of those SLAs. And we have yet to see a real acute focus on inventory optimization in the omnichannel world. And we believe that's coming and we're investing out ahead of that trend.\nYun Kim: Okay. That's great. Thanks. And Dennis, we used to get a metric in a number of deals above $1 million in the good old like license revenue days. So how should we think about what is that similar metric for large subscription deals? Should we look at it from the total RPO perspective? Like should we be asking you how much of your RPO growth is driven by these large deals or something like that? Just wanted to get your sense on how we should assess your overall kind of exposure to big deal activity, because you have mentioned that RPO growth could be lumpy depending on the sizable bookings and whatnot. Thanks.\nDennis Story: Yes. So from a RPO point of view, it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but bottom line is it's compounding from a growth point of view, and that's a very linear line in essence. So that's from what I would judge our performance by is really the RPO, overall RPO growth from quarter-to-quarter and the guidance we're giving.\nYun Kim: Got you. And then a question that I always ask, any meaningful change in the overall contract length that may had a meaningful impact on the RPO?\nDennis Story: No.\nEddie Capel: No, not at all.\nYun Kim: All right. Sounds good. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Yun.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is open.\nMatt Pfau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Eddie, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you are seeing existing customers accelerate their conversion to the cloud. Maybe just care to expand on those comments a little bit on in terms of what's driving that?\nEddie Capel: I just think timing Matt for the most part. We're about a year from release, upgrade cycles, budgeting for upgrade cycles and so forth. Take some time. So I think that's one factor. And then the continuing need to modernize the distribution center and get access to \u2013 get almost immediate access to the innovation that we're developing.\nDennis Story: Hey, Matt.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. And\u2026\nDennis Story: Matt, the other \u2013 just jumping in here is, is broader suite of solutions. We've been delivering new innovation over the last four years. And what we're seeing is really from a pipeline build and just in the sales process, pretty nice diversity across the solutions.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. And then from a geographic perspective, I think you called out that Americas is being particularly strong in the pipeline, but also seen some improvement in EMEA and APAC. Is that just driven by America reopening quicker, being more open than some of those other geographies? Or what sort of behind the pipeline strength there?\nEddie Capel: Yes, I think that's it, Matt, because even within APAC and EMEA returning, you can see sort of the micro trends. There are certain countries and so forth that are still lagging from a perspective of opening, and open up the doors and so forth. So, yes, I just think it's a little bit of a lag and a little bit of timing there before we see the same kind of modernization, trends really start to blossom in those, Matt. But we can certainly see it, I think it's on the doorstep, frankly.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. Great, guys. That's all I have. Thanks a lot.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Matt. See you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thank you. Good evening, guys.\nEddie Capel: Hi, Mark.\nDennis Story: Hi, Mark.\nMark Zgutowicz: Just a quick follow-up to the earlier question on the RPO strength, obviously blew through it from just the first couple of quarters. And I was wondering how much of your original guidance had or how much macro conservatism might have been built in? And sort of how that may or may not still be extended into the second half of the year now relative to the obvious incremental strength that you've been seeing?\nEddie Capel: Yes. I mean, there's some question coming into the year. We were a little cautious about how things were going to shape up here and around the world, but now obviously we're seeing, we're seeing the demand, we're seeing the bookings, we're seeing the pipeline grow. So feeling stronger about it, hence all the raises, the raises across the board. So we are \u2013 we certainly try to be under promise over a deliver organization. So we'd like to keep that trend going, but I think as you can see from the raises that we've provided, that we've delivered and guidance that we've given and so forth, we're not exactly holding back. Now we're feeling more confident.\nMark Zgutowicz: Got it. And just a last one on Europe. Your comment on strength there, just to fall into the last question. Is there some quantification to that strength or is it too early to tell just how strong Europe will come back? Just maybe some color as you're looking at Europe over the next six to 12 months.\nEddie Capel: Yes. It's just been a little flatter \u2013 little flatter relative to the U.S. over the last two or three quarters. And we see it coming back to normality, if you want to \u2013 if you would like to put it that way. Typically, we've seen Europe represent somewhere between 12% and 15% in software, software revenues and it's been a little lower, not materially, but a little bit lower than that for the last couple of three quarters. And we see it coming back to normal ranges here in the near future.\nMark Zgutowicz: Got it. Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nEddie Capel: Pleasure, Mark. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Manhattan Associates\u2019 Q2 2021 earnings call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everybody and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results and discuss our updated full year outlook. So Q2 and first half 2021 results were an all-time record for Manhattan Associates. With Q2, total revenue increasing 22% to $166 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share increasing 53% to $0.61, and both of these metrics exceeded our expectations. Our global teams are very busy and continue to execute extremely well as broad revenue and performance translated into strong top line growth and also earnings leverage. Furthermore, demand continues to strengthen for our growing set of cloud solutions, resulting in record second quarter bookings with RPO increasing 117% year-over-year and 16% sequentially to $489 million. So with momentum accelerating and forward revenue visibility improving, once again, we're increasing our 2021 guidance, including RPO. Now, as many of you are aware, our solutions are mission critical and that we're focused on providing modern cloud native solutions that are architected to unify commerce and supply chain experiences. Our technology is differentiating and industry leading, and by providing solutions that are scalable, versionless and extensible. Our customers are able to adapt more quickly to changing market conditions and are better positioned to profitably scale their businesses. On the sales front, competitive win rates remains strong at about 70%. It's that commitment to innovation keeps Manhattan Associates at top of our industry rankings. From a vertical perspective, retail manufacturing and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And if we drill in a little to the sub verticals, they're pretty diverse, including apparel, department stores, food and beverage, industrial, as well as durable and non-durable goods. Now our Manhattan Active Solution pipeline continues to grow nicely to benefiting from our market leadership position, our unparalleled technology and global infrastructure and favorable market tailwinds, which are all driving strong demand for a modern, adaptable, scalable and resilient supply chain, inventory and omnichannel solutions. We're experiencing solid demand across all of our product suites. About 90% of our pipeline consists of cloud opportunities with existing customers conversion accelerating somewhat. And in addition, net new potential customers represent about 40% of the pipeline demand. Americas pipeline is particularly strong, but we're starting to see Europe and APAC strengthen heading into the second half as well. Now our global services team executed amazingly well in Q2. They conducted over a 100 go-lives. And as expected, our services segment returned to growth in this quarter, increasing 18% compared with the prior year period. And with strong demand for our services, we're aggressively recruiting talent globally, but like everyone, we expect the market to be extremely competitive for services and technical talent in the second half, which we have factored into our operational planning and guidance. Now on the innovation front, it's still quite early in our journey to unify mission critical commerce and supply chain systems. But that said, given our solution breadth, industry expertise and commitment to innovation, we're uniquely positioned to successfully do so. With our R&D spend approaching $19 million annually, growing opportunities to innovate within white space and a large opportunity to drive penetration of our Manhattan Active Solution with new and existing customers, we're very well positioned for long-term sustainable growth. Now as most of you know, in late May and for the second straight year, we held our annual user conference, Momentum Connect virtually. Like last year, we saw a strong registration attendance at the conference, which offered a mix of live sessions and a plethora of on demand sessions as well. And also for the second year running, we made a major product announcement this time regarding our transportation management solution. Now, before we get into the details of Manhattan Active Transportation Management, a quick short recap of our multi-year product strategies probably in order. Now back in 2014, we started on our mission to modernize our product lines, to ensure both Manhattan and our customers, who are strategically positioned for future needs. Our strategy really had two key elements, relaunching our industry-leading solutions like WMS, OMS, and TMS as true cloud native solutions, and leveraging our leading-edge cloud native platform to create solution capability and unification to a degree that really was previously impossible. Now in 2017, we launched Manhattan Active Omni, the first of these unified cloud native suite of solutions. Manhattan Active Omni unifies contact center or the management, customer engagement, point-of-sale and store inventory and fulfillment into a single offering, it allows our customers to deliver unparalleled omnichannel customer experiences without ever needing to an install additional applications or ever performing upgrade. Now in 2020, we shipped Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, the industry's first Tier 1 cloud-native WMS. And this year at Momentum Connect, we announced Manhattan Active Transportation Management with the industry's fastest and smartest multimodal transportation optimization engine. And together with Manhattan Active WM, Manhattan Active TM forms the Manhattan Active Supply Chain, the industry's first unified supply chain execution platform. We believe Manhattan Active Supply Chain is really a game changer for our customers. For the last couple of decades, we've had a front row seat to see the challenges and opportunities that come with integrating WMS and TMS in high volume, high complexity digital supply chains. And along the way, we came to realize that the way to solve this problem was not just better integration, but rather through a truly unified distribution and transportation solution. Unfortunately, the advent of microservices and the cloud-native architecture presented us with the unique opportunity to build such a unified offering. And we launched it in May of this year. Solution unification delivers some obvious benefits like single user experiences for all things, supply chain execution, a dramatically simplified integration picture, and a common technology platform for our customers to extend the solution and innovate alongside us. But we believe that the opportunities that unified supply chain platform brings are actually much larger than that. Unification of a WMS and TMS allows us to solve entirely new set of problems, a holistic approach to solving problems that benefits our customers in a base application. And it also allows them to solve problems creatively using our entire catalog of microservices. And perhaps most importantly of all, it allows our customers to break down their organizational silos between distribution and transportation, and to think about optimizing inventory flow and customer deliveries, because now more than ever, supply chain professionals are effectively customer service associates because their actions directly impact customer outcomes and brand loyalty. So Manhattan Active Supply Chain comprises the newly Manhattan Active Transportation Management combined with Manhattan Active Warehouse Management. And frankly, it's been a great first year for Manhattan Active WM. Market response for Manhattan Active WM has really exceeded our expectations and that product and delivery teams are fully engaged with a busy summer of go-lives. In hindsight, it does appear that there was a significant market demand for a Tier 1 cloud-native WMS and this quarter's new Manhattan Active WM subscriptions continue to show a nice diversification of geographies and industries and a nice mix of net new WM logos, and conversions from our existing on-premise WMS. In early reports, the customers are seeing significant benefit from innovations like customer grade mobile experience for warehouse associates, order streaming and it's first of a kind employee engagement capability built directly into WMS. Now I close out my product remarks today with just a few updates on the major Manhattan Active platform, Manhattan Active Omni. Last quarter, I updated you on some pretty nice signings and growing pipeline for our point-of-sale application. In this quarter, I'll just tell you a little bit about what we're seeing in order management. We kicked off projects this year at a number of large well-known global retailers to implement that core order management applications. And not only will they activate core OMS, they'll also take advantage of the Manhattan exclusive innovations like interactive inventory for dynamic order promising. And they're also using the digital self-service capabilities to allow their customers to change or to pick up windows to create their own returns, to create their own exchanges, all directly on their own mobile devices. And we continue to push the boundaries of the problems we solve with Manhattan Active Omni and with an increasing frequency of our omnichannel microservices that are the center of our customer's headless commerce architectures or for the future good of the industry. Now that concludes my brief business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and outlook. And then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So Dennis? Very good. Thanks Dennis. Well, we're very pleased with our strong second quarter and year-to-date results. And while the global macro environment remains somewhat turbulent, Manhattan Associates is entering into second half of 2021 with some tailwinds. We've accelerated the pace of our innovation and delivering the right solutions at the right time. And the result is a strong business momentum and a great opportunity for us to deliver success to our customers and help shape their digital transformation. And before opening it up for questions, I do want to take this opportunity to thank all of my Manhattan Associates teammates across the globe. Many of you have started to return to our offices and I continue to be inspired by your flexibility, resilience, and ongoing commitment to ensure our customers are successful. So thanks again. Ren, we're now open to take questions Yes. Good question, Terry. Well, it's early. Of course, we're six weeks past release of Manhattan Active TM, but the answer is yes, we have sold at least one that comes to mind new customer \u2013 brand new customer, so new logo, not done business with us before. And they contracted for both Manhattan Active WM and Manhattan Active TM. So feel pretty good about that and off to a good start six week in. Yes, I think you've answered the question well there, Joe. We're a year in or a year so, and certainly it takes a little time, not so much from a reference-ability perspective, but the budgeting cycles and even though we're existing customers those, if you want to call them sales cycles take awhile. And we're starting to see more of them come to fruition, but also the accelerating need for digital transformation in that core supply chain execution space. We've talked about this before that distribution centers don't look the same today as they did five or certainly 10 years ago, and the need for that modern software engine and technology to be able to power those distribution centers is certainly something that's fueling the growth to. Yes. Well, Dennis will take some of the details here as well. But certainly, there is opportunity to build on scale and leverage and so forth. I do think we had a virtual momentum conference this year, so we had some \u2013 we ended some underspend there frankly. We still have the opportunity that we believe to invest more in marketing and awareness. We're doing okay clearly, but we've got to get the message out and make sure we're not one of the world's best kept secrets from a technology and a supply chain perspective. So there is still some underspend there from our perspective and we'll continue to make those investments as well as material investments in research and development. Thank you, Joe. That's pretty balanced, Brian, actually. So we've seen nice deal volume. We've seen some bigger deals, not much, but a little bit on the longer contract side. So a really nice balance is driving that RPO number, frankly. Thank you, Brian. Certainly WMS was the preponderance, a heritage there and so forth, and it tends to be sort of the lead product. But much like Q1, there was very nice balance across the product portfolio. WMS was strong for sure. And it was the lead dog but MAO really stepped up in Q2 and delivered some nice numbers and TMS, point-of-sale and inventory participated as well. So pretty nice balance, frankly. Yes, similar balance in pipeline. Thanks Mark. Thank you, Yun. Yes, there was still plenty of work to do, Yun, in the supply chain space. We have frankly, a much longer list of innovations in the hopper than we can get through in the next quarter or two. So we're continuing to bear down on the investment strategy, build out the innovation into the white space that we see. I do think that, there's a couple of areas.

            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. And as Eddie mentioned, record Q2 and first half results and nearly every major metric category, we put up record numbers, growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet results were all solid for the quarter. Our quality of earnings performance was outstanding top to bottom. There are no one-time adjustments in these results, just great execution. And here's a summary of Q2 financial highlights, which includes our guidance for total revenue, operating profit and earnings per share. You also can refer to today's earnings release for our adjusted and GAAP guidance. Also unless otherwise stated, growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. So total revenue was up $166 million or was $166 million up 22%. Our outperformance was broadened across all revenue line items. Like Q1, we again experienced notable strength in cloud. Based on our strong first half and second half outlook, we are raising our total revenue guidance from our previous range of $625 million to $640 million to $643 million to $650 million. So our new range is $643 million to $650 million on total revenue, targeting 10% growth at the midpoint of $646 million. Our underlying total revenue growth, excluding license and maintenance, which removes the revenue compression from our cloud transition is targeted to be 18% at the midpoint. And for Q3, we expect total revenue of $162 million to $165 million or 9% growth at the midpoint. For adjusted EPS, EPS was up $0.61 or was $0.61 up 53% and GAAP EPS was $0.48. For adjusted EPS, we are raising full year guidance range to $2 to $2.06 with a midpoint of $2.03, up 23% from our previous midpoint of $1.65. For GAAP earnings per share, our guidance range is $1.50 to $1.56 with a midpoint of $1.53 and that's up 33% from our previous midpoint of a $1.15. For Q3, we expect adjusted EPS to be $0.53 to $0.55. Moving to revenue lines. Cloud revenue was $29 million up 55%. For Q3, we expect cloud revenue of roughly $30.5 million and are raising our previous full year 2021 cloud revenue estimate of $111 million to $113 million, we're raising that up to $117 million to $119 million equating to 48% growth at the midpoint. Q2 was a record second quarter with RPO with bookings totaling $489 million up 117% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. With RPO continuing to compound positively, our visibility into future subscription revenue continues to strengthen. As mentioned in Q1, we will update our forward-looking guidepost on our Q4 call and we intend to guide RPO on an annual basis as bookings can be lumpy, primarily based on sales cycle timing, the number and relative value of large deals and product mix from quarter-to-quarter. That said, with our strong year-to-date RPO performance, we are raising our 2021 estimate at $450 million to $550 million to $550 million to $600 million. Licensed revenue for the quarter was $8.8 million as our base of existing customers added users in the quarter, and maintenance revenue was up or \u2013 I'm sorry was $38 million up 5% on license revenue and solid gas collections. As previously discussed, we expect second half license and maintenance revenue to decline on customer conversions to cloud, which is positive for our company, our customers, RPO and future subscription revenue growth. We expect license to decline to about $6 million in Q3 and $4.5 million in Q4. For maintenance revenue we are targeting roughly $36 million in Q3 and $35.5 million in Q4. For perspective, on cloud demand full year 2020, license revenue is down 22% and maintenance down 1%. Our 2021 forecast has licensed down about 54% in the second half and down 29% for the full year. No question, cloud demand is outstripping license. Maintenance will be down about 1% for full year 2021, also maintenance will have a longer attrition tail as customers typically maintain customer support through the cloud conversion cycle. Moving to services revenue. Services revenue was $85 million up 18% with our cloud momentum fueling our services and revenue growth. Our Q3 services revenue estimate is $86 million and for Q4, our estimate is $83 million. The sequential decline is driven by Q4 retail peak season impact as customers typically idol implementations. And our final revenue line, hardware, delivered $6 million in revenue up 66%. So that covers growth. How about profitability. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 55.9% up over 350 basis points compared to the year ago, period and it was predominantly driven by revenue performance and cloud operating leverage. We expect Q3 consolidated cloud, subscription, maintenance and services margin to be about 55.2% and Q4 margin to be 52.7%, again driven by retail peak season resulting in a second half margin of approximately 54% ahead of our prior outlook of 51.1%. And how about the bottom line. Q2 operating income totaled $50 million, up 46%. Operating margin was 30.2% up over 490 basis points. GAAP operating margin was 23.7%. We are increasing our full year adjusted operating margin range to 25.5% to 26%, up about 400 basis points over prior guidance of 21% to 22%. For Q3, we expect a range of 27$ to 27.5% and for Q4 a range estimate of 22.5% to 23%. Just a reminder, our second half license and maintenance expectations combined with Q4 retail peak seasonality is factored into our Q4 estimates. That said, we are very pleased with our earnings leverage and we are continuing to invest significantly in our business to drive long-term sustainable, double-digit top line growth balanced with top quartile operating margins. Now turning to cash, cash flow, taxes and cap structure, another solid performance. We closed with Q2 cash on hand totaling $209 million was zero debt. Our operating cash flow was $46 million resulting in year-to-date operating cash flow of $85 million up 41%. Our Q2 free cash flow margin was 27% and note our CapEx estimate for 2021 continues to be $6 million to $8 million. Also, we invested $33 million in share buybacks in Q2, resulting in $60 million in buybacks year-to-date. For the third quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be about $64.4 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity and also our board raised our buyback authority to $50 million. Regarding taxes, our adjusted effective income tax rate for Q2 was 21.7% and our GAAP tax rate was 23%. For full year 2021, we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of about 21.5% and a GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%. So that covers the financial update. Thank you, and back to Eddie. It is the former versus the latter Terry, it will change and we'll address that \u2013 we'll address those updates in the Q4 call for sure. Great forward visibility. Yes, Joe. I'll piggyback on Eddie too. So we're in year four or five, so I'd say we're probably \u2013 when we look at where we're at, we're probably a year ahead of what we expected, we're pretty excited about that. But bottom line is, we're going to continue to invest in T&T and that's talent and technology, we think we \u2013 our overall objective is, as I said in this call and continue to say is, as the objective is really to create long-term sustainable double-digit top line growth, and be a top quartile margin performer against any tech comps out there. And I think we're doing pretty good there. We're not going to call a trough at this stage. So we'll evaluate that and discuss that in the Q4 earnings call, Brian. We are going to continue to invest in the business, but suffice to say, we're pretty confident in our ability to generate operating leverage. Yes. We're seeing a nice balance of not just our install base, but net new customers in our portfolio as well. Pretty exciting. Yes. And the pipeline is continues to strengthen as well. So we're... Yes. Continues to have nice momentum, the good news is that some of these implementation timelines are getting shorter and shorter. So we've actually had three point-of-sale customers go-live just in the last \u2013 the back half of this quarter. And the nice thing about the point-of-sale pipeline for us is about 50% of the pipeline again, brand new customers that we've never done business with before. So as we've said many, many times not going to be an overnight success, but we really do feel like the flywheel given the wins, some go-lives, we're getting under our belt now in the pipeline, that we're starting to see the flywheel pick up some momentum. Yes. Well, I think a combination of needing or recognizing that they need resilience in the supply chain, they need contingency in the supply chain. And frankly, it's a very competitive world out there. I said a little bit of a different way than I said, in the script, supply chain these days is a customer service attributes, right. So each one of the customer \u2013 supply chain associates and our customers feel like their customer service advocates. And so I think that the need continues to grow. The need continues to heighten to bring supply chain to the forefront and be a competitive differentiator for our customers. Yes. So from a RPO point of view, it can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but bottom line is it's compounding from a growth point of view, and that's a very linear line in essence. So that's from what I would judge our performance by is really the RPO, overall RPO growth from quarter-to-quarter and the guidance we're giving. No. Hey, Matt. Matt, the other \u2013 just jumping in here is, is broader suite of solutions. We've been delivering new innovation over the last four years. And what we're seeing is really from a pipeline build and just in the sales process, pretty nice diversity across the solutions. Hi, Mark."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter results and discuss our updated full year 2021 outlook. Manhattan Associates is off to a strong start for the year, reporting record Q1 total revenue of $157 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.43 both exceeding expectations. Our business pace continues to be solid with broad revenue outperformance across our solutions, driving top line revenue growth and earnings leverage in the quarter, while simultaneously driving our increasing investment in the business. Our team continues to execute well and that business momentum is accelerating, underscoring this strength and the growing demand for cloud solutions. We achieved record bookings in Q1 with our RPO increasing 108% over the prior year and 36% sequentially to $421 million. With our forward revenue visibility improving and the inherent leverage in our model, we\u2019ll be increasing our 2021 guidance across the board. Equally important, our pipeline continues to grow nicely with about 90% of the pipe consisting of cloud opportunities and net new potential customers representing about 40% of that demand. And much of our success is bolstered by delivering the most innovative technological advancements in our industry. As solutions are mission critical to our customers and our end markets. And now with the need for modern, adaptable, scalable and resilient supply chain, inventory and omni-channel solution is never more apparent, we're in the early stages of extending our mind and wallet share. Additionally, the secular tailwinds in numerous, digital transformation of businesses, brick-and-mortar stores shifting to an innovative multi-function facility concept, the insatiable desire to get as close as possible to the end customer, creative inventory management strategies and shorter fulfillment timelines, just some of the significant drivers that are aligning customer demand with our product strategy. And our unified platform is industry-leading and provides our customers with solutions that are scalable, versionless and extensible. And this enables our clients to be adaptable and provide unmatched customer experiences. Now with Manhattan Active omni, just entering its fourth year in the market and Manhattan Active Warehouse Management about to reach its first anniversary and on pace for innovation to set \u2013 our innovation set to accelerate on the heels of nearly $19 million invested in R&D just this year alone. We are strategically positioned for long-term sustainable growth. On the sales front, competitive win rates remain strong at about 70% is that commitment to innovation keeps Manhattan Associates at top of the industry. In Q1, about 25% of our client in-licensed deals were from new customers. From a vertical perspective, retail manufacturing, and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And drilling in a little bit, the sub verticals, a pretty diverse as well, including apparel, department stores, food and beverage, industrial, as well as durable and non-durable goods. As services group executed extremely well in Q1, conducting over 100 go-lives and with demand for expertise remaining high, we anticipate as services revenue will return to growth in Q2. And we continue to aggressively hire talent to meet the forecasted demand. Now let me provide if I can just some quick updates on our product portfolio. Starting with our point-of-sale solution, Q1 was a pretty positive quarter for POS both with respect to go-lives and new customer signings. While early, pipeline opportunities are growing following a pretty quiet year in 2020. Now on the go-live front, we've got a number of implementations currently in flight, including a well-known specialty retailer that during the quarter went live with that point-of-sale application in a pilot store and feedback from the store associates has been extremely positive. We've commentary on an ease of use, speed and responsiveness. And the retailer has started rolling out the system across their store fleet and will be complete in a few months. Then they'll turn their attention to activating the rest of our Manhattan Active omni suite, including enterprise order management and store fulfillment. And when it comes to new point-of-sale customer signings, we're happy to announce that three additional projects that been signed and kicked off in the last quarter. These include a well-known global apparel brand that will first pilot up point-of-sale application here in the U.S. this summer and then plot plan to roll out the solution to the fleet of stores worldwide. This customer is already live on enterprise order management and saw the true sales and service advantage from having a unified order management and point-of-sale application. And that same advantage proved attractive for a long time Manhattan Active OMS customer in Canada, who will roll out our point-of-sales solution across their fleet of apparel retail stores by early fall. And finally, we've also kicked off a project at a well-known sports apparel and footwear customer. And this global brand will start by using our point-of-sale to enable endless aisle capabilities in their stores, enabling their store associates to use mobile devices, to capture orders for customers when a size or a color isn't available at that particular location. And once again, this point-of-sale usage will be an extension of an existing Manhattan Active omni functionality that is already deployed of that particular customer. And while the pandemic seemed to cause many of the store systems or much of the store systems activities to be put on hold, third-party integrators and industry research firms are now beginning to indicate the planned investments in point-of-sale are again showing signs of picking up. And because we were able to continue to invest heavily in that point-of-sale application throughout the pandemic, we believe that we're very well positioned for the inevitable need for a replacement cycle in point-of-sale and store systems in general. Now turning to supply chain, Q1 was another good quarter for our transportation management application. Just in recent weeks, we received word from Gartner that for the third year in a row, our application was one of the very few to be included in the Leader\u2019s quadrant that in the recently published Gartner Magic Quadrant for transportation management systems. And we've been able to maintain this important industry designation because of our continued investment in innovation, within TMS, and also the high levels of customer satisfaction that we garner with our customers. The TMS market continues to be an active one for us as customers either move older on-premise deployments of TMS to the cloud, or adopt a new TMS for the very first time. And generally speaking, tied TMS customers or cloud TMS allows smaller customers to benefit from the power of a leading TMS solution. Now speaking of supply chain applications in the cloud, we continue to see very favorable response from our Manhattan Active WM application, launched almost a year ago now at last year's momentum conference, the number of Manhattan Active WM projects has surpassed two dozen at professional services team across North and South America and Europe remain quite busy preparing for a summer full of Manhattan Active WM go-lives. And additionally, our sales pipeline remains strong across both existing Manhattan WMS on-premise customers looking to go cloud native and with opportunities with net new customers. Q1 was also a nice quarter for a demand forecasting inventory optimization solutions. As we continue to see both existing and new customers choose a cloud based solutions to help them optimize their inventory levels across the enterprise. And finally, our product teams are hard at work preparing for upcoming Momentum Connect 2021 conference in May. Like last year will be virtual, unfortunately, but we're planning again to make some really important product announcements. For a number of years now, our product strategy has been centered around two key ideas. Migrating our best-in-class functional capabilities to a truly cloud native architecture and secondly, delivering unified applications within that three main areas of focus, omni-channel, supply chain and inventory. And at this year's conference, we'll announce yet another large step forward in making that vision a reality for our customers. So that concludes my business update. With that, I'll pass it over to Dennis, who will provide you with an update on our financial performance and discuss our outlook for 2021. And I'll close our prepared remarks for the brief summary before moving to Q&A. So Dennis, take it away.\nDennis Story: Thanks Eddie. I would characterize our first quarter execution as an all-rounder. We delivered strong financial performance from top line to bottom line with across the board, solid growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet results. Here's the key summary of financial highlights with growth rates on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. As Eddie mentioned Q1 total revenue was $157 million, up 2%; adjusted earnings per share was $0.43, up 8%; GAAP EPS was $0.35 and overall performance was driven by cloud revenue in the quarter. Q1 operating income totaled $36 million, up 12% year-over-year; adjusted operating margin was 22.7%, up 200 basis points and our GAAP operating margin was 16.2%. Q1 cloud revenue was $27 million, up 54%. License revenue was $7.8 million, down 19% as our end markets are predominantly choosing our cloud solutions. And Q1 RPO was a record performance at $421 million, up 108% in case you forgot from Eddie's comments year-over-year and up 36% sequentially. At our current full year outlook $450 million to $550 million we are on track to exceed our $500 million midpoint. Further cloud momentum is fueling our services pipeline and revenue growth opportunity. Q1 services revenue exceeded expectations totaling $80 million against an $87 million comp in Q1 2020. More importantly, services revenue was up 13% sequentially over Q4 2020 with our growth outlook accelerating for the balance of 2021. Our Q2 services revenue forecast is $83 million to $85 million, up 17% year-over-year. And for Q3 and Q4, our forecast calls for 20% year-over-year growth. Maintenance was up 1% on cash collections. Important point here, like license revenue, we do expect second half attrition on customer conversions to cloud, which will positively impact our RPO performance. And also our hardware team delivered a solid $6 million in sales up 56% year-over-year. So let me turn to cash and cash flow, another strong performance, Q1 closed with cash on hand totaling $197 million with zero debt operating. Cash flow was $40 million up 3.5 times year-over-year and our Q1 free cash flow margin was 25%. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled to $123 million up 8% over Q4 2020 and 17% year-over-year on cloud billings. And also we invested $27 million in share buybacks in Q1 and our board raised our buyback authority to $50 million. That's the results summary, I'll cover some additional financial updates and guidance and then turn the call back to Eddie. Our cloud revenue outperformance was mostly driven by positive deal timing, overages renewals. Overages and renewals can be lumpy on a quarterly basis, for Q2 we expect cloud revenue to be roughly up 46% compared to Q2 2020. For the full year, we are raising our previous cloud revenue estimate of $108 million to $110 million to a range of $111 million to $113 million equating to 40% growth at the midpoint. As frequently mentioned, remaining performance obligation or RPO is the leading proxy for our cloud revenue. While we updated our RPO outlet to exceed $500 million midpoint for 2021 going forward, our intention remains to guide RPO on an annual basis as bookings can be lumpy primarily based on sales cycle timing and the number and relative value of large deals and product mix from quarter-to-quarter. Furthermore, on flow-through from RPO to cloud revenue, some customers have longer implementation cycles, associated with large projects requiring a multi-year annual subscription ramp built into the contract. These revenue ramps are commonly or common for larger cloud deals and with larger opportunities becoming more prevalent in our pipeline, we expect RPO growth to accelerate first, followed by a gradual steepening ramp in cloud revenue growth, providing us with very good visibility into future subscription revenue. So all said, we are confident in our ability to achieve the high end of our prior $450 million to $550 million RPO outlook for 2021. As discussed in our previous Q4 earnings call, we expect license and maintenance revenue attrition to accelerate in 2021, estimating license revenue to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million for the full year, which represents a 41% year-over-year decline. For Q2, we anticipate license revenue to be approximately $6 million, and Q3 and Q4 to be about $4 million each quarter. For maintenance revenue, we continue to target approximately $35 million per quarter throughout 2021, and we expect the attrition impact will manifest itself for the most part in the second half of 2021. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 50.9% driven by revenue performance and cloud operating leverage. We expect Q2 consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin to be about 52.6% improving 40 bps over prior expectations. Given the strong demand we anticipate costs to tick up slightly in the second half on hiring and performance-based comp with second half margin to be about 51.1% compared to our prior expectations of 51.5%. And for operating income and margin, we are increasing our full year 2021 guidance 50 bps, resulting in a midpoint of 21.5% and we remain confident in our ability to make strong progress on achieving the rule authority over time. On a quarterly basis, we anticipate adjusted operating margin to be 22.5% for Q2, 21.2% in Q3 and 19.4% in Q4. Regarding taxes, our adjusted effective income tax rate was 21.5%, we expect our Q2 and full year 2021 adjusted tax rate to be 21.5%, down from our prior expectations of 23%. The lower tax rate will benefit pro forma adjusted EPS by roughly $0.03 for the full year, our GAAP effective income tax rate was 9.9% for the quarter driven by excess tax benefits on restricted stock vesting. We expect our full year 2021 GAAP tax rate to be about 20%. Regarding our capital structure, in Q1 2021, we repurchased approximately 214,000 shares worth roughly $27 million, for the second quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be 64.8 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. Also for CapEx, we estimate for 2001 [ph] to invest about $6 million to $8 million at this time. So that completes the core financial update, turning to increased 2021 guidance. For total revenue we are raising guidance from our previous range of $595 million to $625 million, which represented 4% growth at the midpoint to a new guidance range of $625 million to $640 million targeting 8% growth at the midpoint of $632 million. As a reminder, this includes $22.5 million of revenue compression equating to 4 percentage points of growth driven by license and maintenance attrition. For Q2, we expect total revenue of $154 million to $159 million or 15% growth at the $157 million midpoint. As we account for continued license attrition, we expect Q3 and Q4 midpoint total revenue growth to be approximately 7% to 8%. For adjusted earnings per share, we're increasing our previous guidance range of $1.44 to $1.59 to $1.60 to $1.70 with a midpoint of $1.65, up from our previous midpoint of $1.52. For GAAP earnings per share, our guidance range is $1.10 to $1.20 with a midpoint of $1.15 up from our previous midpoint of $1.04. For Q2, we expect adjusted EPS $0.42 to $0.44. And as previously discussed for operating margin, we are raising our target range to 21% to 22% and for Q2 we expect an operating margin range of 22.3% to 22.7%. So in summary, our underlying growth fundamentals are strong, excluding license and maintenance, which are line items negatively impacted by our cloud transition, because they are a trading at the midpoint of our Q2 and full year guidance, our pro forma total 2021 total revenue growth is 23% for Q2 and full year 17%. So thank you, that covers my financial update and I'll turn the call back to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Terrific. Thanks Dennis. So we're very pleased with a strong start to 2021 and record results. While we continue to operate in a pretty turbulent global macroenvironment, we're confident in our ability to help deliver success for our customers and drive long-term sustainable growth from Manhattan Associates. Many of our customers and prospects are in the early stages of their digital transformation and even their move to the cloud. With our industry leading innovation, technical and domain expertise and the world's most talented and seasoned supply chain commerce employees, we believe that we are best positioned to help the industry modernize, which in turn creates a really exciting opportunity for Manhattan Associates. So with that, Jeff, we'd be happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: Hey, good afternoon, everyone and congrats on the all-rounder here in 1Q. Eddie, maybe my first question is for you, and then Dennis I had a question for you. But \u2013 when hearing about point of sale that seems like forever ago when we were hearing about the early kind of success and the pipeline building, what I'm curious about is, it's good to hear about some new deals starting to flow again and then projects moving forward. But could you maybe educate us on kind of what the point of sale kind of opportunities look like when you land one of those from a size and scale perspective, how does that compare to the OMS and WMS business? And is the pipeline activity continuing to build as we move into the second half of the year?\nEddie Capel: Yes, it does. It certainly seems that interest is picking up in the market Terry, we're seeing that interest pick up and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, industry analysts and the third-party integrators and so forth seem to be indicating that after the gap year of 2020, where we sort of spent a large part of the time closed as they reopened. And an emerge really is multi-function facilities by online curbside boutiques, galleries, return centers for product support online and so forth. Now, the systems that they have in place today don't support those capabilities very well, as well as all of the cross-selling and upselling that certainly retailers want to do and manage \u2013 maximize the inventory they have across the network. So there certainly seems to be some forward momentum there. The position that we're in with point of sale being sort of an extension of our Omni or order management suite of solutions seems to be being pretty well received in the market, you again heard from my comments that most of our customers are seeing one or the other go first on that roadmap, because there is a real strategic advantage for them. With regard to the size of the opportunity, the market is large as we know, we know the game as it were has moved from being a hardware game to a software game and that's where the critical mass is beginning to build. I don't know that I'm going to be able to give you a \u2013 and I don't want to give you a specific ASP of point of sale as it relates to order management and warehouse management. But suffice to say is a huge opportunity out there particularly, when the customers and retailers have a large store network. And I mean, I guess I would just say that it certainly would not be unusual for a point of sale opportunity to be in the same ballpark as material WMS program or a material OMS program.\nTerry Tillman: Okay. That's great to hear. I guess, maybe Dennis, for you in terms of we were looking for $50 million of additional RPO in the quarter, you did over $100 million additional RPO. So like, what I'm curious about is it's a two-part question; one, what are you seeing in terms of commitments, are these still these kind of long-term kind of multi-year commitments, did anything changed in duration? And then secondly, there was a big deal, I'm curious, is it \u2013 was it a volume and velocity of deal activity, or was it \u2013 did it benefit from some especially large deals? Looking for a little bit more color on the beat there? Thank you.\nDennis Story: In terms of duration, no change, we\u2019re still hitting right at the five year mark, given the mission critical and strategic nature of these solutions, Terry, and what I would tell you is, pretty diverse spread of bookings across the customer, there wasn't any material concentration of one customer in the pool of deals that we closed in the quarter, good volume and good velocity and good diversity as well.\nTerry Tillman: That's great. Congrats.\nEddie Capel: Thanks, Terry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink from Baird. Your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi everyone. Yes, just stick with the RPO bookings. Obviously it doesn't happen without a good product, but Eddie and Dennis, I'm wondering a lot of thematic topics around the WMS category right now, be it new WMS pairing with robotics and automation, new WMS to manage pretty tight labor constraints in the industry, skew complexity with e-commerce. Are any of these factors you think driving maybe increased awareness or ultimately it would be kind of pipeline growth for you more than the others? Or is it really just a combination of new product embracing the cloud, these thematic things all kind of happening at once?\nEddie Capel: Well, it's I think the \u2013 there\u2019s been great review of some of the drivers there, Joe. But the top of the list is a more immediate access to innovation. Just we've talked about it before, but honestly, I feel like it's head and shoulders above the other drivers with so many things changing in, supply chain, obviously digital transformation continuing to accelerate. The oldest other things that you talked about are factors, but the need to be flexible, agile and meet ever changing business needs, drives the need to get your hands on new innovation quickly. And that I think is the number one reason. There's no question that the challenge finding IT talent and so forth puts pressure on our customer's organization so that having us manage the solutions and so forth is helpful to them. As a corollary to it, but access to innovation would be number one.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Eddie, a lot of your prepared remarks were discussing just expansions that existing accounts across the full suite of omni-channel capabilities, and I would imagine eventually that will lead across \u2013 in the supply chain across the entire kind of unified platform. Is it possible to give any maybe quantification, I don\u2019t know if it's not revenue retention, maybe some sort of cohort analysis, just a general sense, what you're seeing with existing customers maybe a few years ago and kind of how their spend with Manhattan is evolving.\nEddie Capel: Yes. I wouldn't say there is any major change in terms of the \u2013 our ability to cross-sell and up-sell across the suite of solutions to be honest with you, Joe, we've had great customer retention over the world \u2013 over the years, we generally refer to it as maintenance retention, still it's true that a large percentage of our new software sales and every given quarter comes from existing customers. But the good news is with all of that said still a healthy number of new logos coming into the family. So I think a great balance there as we continue to drive innovation into the marketplace, we certainly expect to be able to continue that cross-sell and up-sell. And especially as we do introduce new products to the marketplace and we throw a little bit of that in the last quarter with point of sale in one of my more recent product introductions.\nDennis Story: Yes, Joe, I would say also 25% of our software was net new customers in the quarter, and if you look at our pipeline 40% of the pipeline is made up of net new customers as well. I think that goes to Eddie\u2019s story about the importance of innovation and from a retention point of view, it's early days from our renewal point of view, but we're basically at 99% to 100% on cloud renewal retention.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, interesting. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yun Kim from Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nYun Kim: Great, thank you. So another super congrats on another strong quarter Eddie; Dennis and Mike. So Eddie, it's good to hear that point of sales is coming back which I take it that some parts of the retail vertical is coming back. So can you update us on where we are in terms of the retail vertical coming back from the depth of COVID early last year, and then also can you update us on the competitive landscape in that retail vertical? Because I believe certain vendors did take a step back when the retail vertical did slow down last year.\nEddie Capel: Yes, well certainly in terms of the journey of retail coming back for us over the last shall we call it 15 months, during 2020 in the real depths of the pandemic, there was still a fair amount of activity, we saw that first Q2 was pretty turbulent. But is there a fair amount of activity on the WMS side, direct-to-consumer shipments were increasing obviously the need for speed was there and so forth so we felt fairly healthy amount of activity in WMS. The larger strategic Manhattan Active Omni projects, went low quiet last year maybe for obvious reasons, there were smaller point projects with curbside and BOPUS projects and ship-from-store projects and so forth. But the big omnichannel project seem to wane a little bit with seeing that pick back up. And then again for obvious reasons with many stores closed store systems projects where, it was a bit of a gap year in 2020, and again, we're starting to see point of sale and store systems projects begin to pick back up, kind of across the board. So I'd say that's sort of been the journey across the solution suite over the last 15, 12 \u2013 12 or 15 months. In terms of the competitive landscape, it hasn't changed a great deal frankly. Really competitors remained the same, they remain as active, there is some terrific competitors out there and keeps us sharp and on that toes and keeping innovating.\nYun Kim: Okay. Thanks for that. And then Europe showed another strong sequential growth. Can you just talk about what kind of trends you were seeing there and whether or not we can continue to expect this positive trend out of Europe for the remaining of the year?\nEddie Capel: The services business was particularly strong in European in Q1, we're starting to see just like here in the U.S. frankly things begin to open up direct consumer growing has been growing over the last 12 months. So I don't think there is anything really very different in Europe that's happening here, it's pretty positive across the board. There are a couple of spots in APAC that are a little slower than we might like. Australia is pretty strong, but Japan is a little flat frankly China is a little flat, but there are smaller parts of the business and we certainly expect those to cycle back up in the next couple three quarters.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. I have one for Dennis, very strong cash flow for Q1 especially, so it kind of looks like a cash collection was especially strong in the quarter. Was there like a onetime thing that drove cash collection or is there some sort of a trend that is emerging as you start to have higher mix of description billings and moving away from license deals?\nDennis Story: No onetime trend, what we have is a company that's super focused on \u2013 as part of our DNA on cash, it was a record cash collections quarter for us, and really underpinning that is really the growing subscription business.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Thank you.\nDennis Story: Yes, 25% free cash flow margin.\nYun Kim: Yes.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Yun.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Benchmark. Your line is open.\nMark Schappel: All right. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter guys.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Mark.\nMark Schappel: Hey, Eddie a question for you on active WM, I know it's still early, but could you address whether you're seeing a different set of competitors with that solution than you did with your traditional on-premise products? And also to \u2013 if you could just address your active WM win rates and whether they're above the 70% average for all your products.\nEddie Capel: Yes. So pretty short answer is, Mark, no, competitors are pretty much the same today as they have been over the last \u2013 well, even longer than this, but let\u2019s call it, a couple of three or four or five years. So same competitive landscape in terms of the win rates, I don't have that right off the top of my head, but certainly that strong, that probably might be a tick above the 70%. And we feel pretty good about where we are. We've talked about this before generally, when we don't come in first, often it's a pricing challenge and so forth, but still feel pretty good about the win rates.\nMark Schappel: Okay, great. And then in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the company was benefiting from a couple of secular tailwinds, many of what you've mentioned in the past, but this time you brought up something called creative inventory strategies. I was wondering if you could just clarify that a little bit more for us.\nEddie Capel: Yes, sure. I mean, really with an acceleration of buy online, pickup in-store, curbside pickup and ship from store, it throws off traditional inventory strategies. So because you don't know, it's much harder to predict and forecast what those \u2013 the impact of those strategies are going to be on a stores\u2019 inventory strategy, not relying on walk-ins anymore. So it requires frankly creative and sophisticated, a forecasting strategies and over the long-term, integration with an auto management system. So that you get a much better handle on what those \u2013 more creative fulfillment strategies are going to look like across the store network and how they feed back in to inventory optimization.\nMark Schappel: Thank you. Helpful, nice job in the quarter. Thanks guys.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Peterson: Good evening, gentlemen, and thanks for taking the question. So congrats on a really, really strong RPO this quarter so maybe a follow-up to Terry's question, but just \u2013 you talked about the duration, Dennis. I know you hit on that, but is there any commonality into what you're displacing or how you're thinking about sales cycles? It was just such a big step up. I'm just curious, maybe what changed and kind of, how did that trend versus your expectations?\nEddie Capel: I don't think there's any trend, if we look back my answer to that, Brian, would be if you think about particularly Manhattan Active WM, which drove a healthy amount of the bookings, and of course, the result in RPO. It's about three quarters since we released, or it certainly was at the end of the quarter. The first quarter, most folks were figuring out what it was, what it looked like and so forth. And then we began to enter into sales cycles and we really started picking up some sales cycle momentum from Manhattan Active, Manhattan Active WM in kind of Q4, and again, in Q1. So now no big change, there have been a couple of questions where competitive landscape and secular trends and so forth, no big changes there. But I do think it has taken just a little while to build momentum for an awareness and everything else in the solution.\nDennis Story: Yes. Brian, we're almost equally split on conversions and net new customers on MAWM. And as Eddie mentioned, we're already over two dozen, we've closed over two dozen deals there, so.\nBrian Peterson: All right. So off to a pretty good start with that three-quarters in but and maybe a higher level one, Eddie, just I don't want to take away your thunder from momentum next month, but just thinking about the innovation over the last several years, point-of-sale is obviously a new product, but we've seen a lot of innovation on the WM side. I'm just curious, as we sit here today, how much of your product efforts are really focused on enhancing your existing product offerings versus potentially building out things that are adjacent to the portfolio?\nEddie Capel: Yes. So there's really sort of three prongs of \u2013 we have plenty of ideas for new innovation inside of our existing solutions. We really do. So we'll continue to innovate into our existing solutions, no question. We are certainly continuing to build out our product footprint with new products, and the ability to be able to cross-sell, upsell and obviously help our customers. And then the third bucket is the real creative and innovative unification of the solutions. Okay. Because there's a level of unification and flat out capability that we can deliver to the marketplace through a component base, set of microservices based solutions that could not done before. So unification new innovation into our existing solutions and footprint growth.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt. Your line is open.\nMark Zgutowicz: Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. Two quick ones in terms of outside North America pipeline, curious where your sales capacity is relative to perhaps levels you'd like it to be, perhaps in Europe. And then speaking to APACs or what sort of the status there and what are the limitations in terms of moving the needle in APAC? And then Eddie, perhaps maybe looking through your POS telescope, just curious if you have any incremental sense of yet on a pace of retail store reopenings, sort of relative to the last quarter or so are we still seeing sort of a slow and steady pickup or is it perhaps speeding up a bit, just anything incremental in the margin there? Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, so first of all, just in terms of kind of overall dynamics and so forth, Europe's about 20% to 25% of our pipeline, number one. In terms of sales capacity, we are not capacity constrained. We do have a couple of open spots in Europe. Frankly, we say this a lot, but we've always got a few open spots for domain experts in our field, both Europe, APAC and in \u2013 but with U.S., but we're not capacity constrained. In terms of APAC, of course, APAC represents about 6% or 7% of our revenue. And it's very important to us. It's certainly very important to our global customers and so forth. But it also represents a pretty diverse set of countries, right. Japan, China, Singapore, and Southeast Asia, Australia spread across that 6% or 7%. And honestly, we like many others talk about APAC as a region, but boy, it is pretty diverse in and of itself. So there's no \u2013 again, no particular sales capacity issue there and country-by-country almost there are kind of different dynamics going on. I think we all know that Australia and New Zealand are in a pretty good shape. Things are pretty open. And businesses flourishing reasonably well there, whereas some of the other countries are struggling a little bit more. And then with regard to your second question around looking through the point-of-sale telescope, I think you called it. And what we're seeing in terms of store openings, obviously Europe is opening up, a good bit more from a trajectory perspective now, particularly in the UK. Here, obviously we're pretty much fully open across the board in the spots that are not, I think retailers are definitely feeling like it's pretty close by and beginning to feel the need for adaption and modernization in those stores.\nMark Zgutowicz: Super. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Certainly, Mark. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Robinson from William Blair. Your line is open.\nDavid Robinson: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess just a quick one around kind of the secular tailwinds that you've been experiencing. I guess, given the increasing demand across the product portfolio and the amount of pilots that you guys have been able to put into play and potential customers further understanding the importance of omni-channel and cloud-based supply chain solutions due to COVID. Have you experienced any shortening of the sales cycle or any acceleration there or has it stayed about the same?\nEddie Capel: Yes, that's a good question. So broadly speaking, no, the sales cycles have remained about the same. However in the last 12 months, we have seen some what I would call smaller point projects go faster, right. So when we were in a situation where stores were closed and retailers wanted to use those stores as ship from locations, we source them, ship from store projects accelerate. We saw some buy online, pickup in-store, some curbside pickup projects where our customers came to us and said, listen, we got to be live in days. And that we've referred to it in a couple of previous earnings calls. I think some examples where frankly, we turned on a dime and had buy online, pickup in-store solutions up and running with an existing customer, of course, in literally six or seven days. And even in situations where it was a new customer needed curbside pickup program, zero to live in six weeks. So we did see some of those small programs have very short sales cycles. But overall David, nothing honestly has really changed at a higher level and more strategic level.\nDavid Robinson: Got it. And I guess, just to kind of build upon that, has there been any kind of discussion or change in sales strategy as you've seen kind of the success is being able to sell those small products that obviously can lead to larger ones in the future, or is that kind of similar as well?\nEddie Capel: Not really David, we've got a reasonably broad portfolio in the supply chain space. And there are certainly some of our solutions that are considered tip of arrow. If you think about the distribution management side, sometimes slotting optimization projects or labor management projects on the transportation side. Look at transportation procurement or transportation modeling engagements, which would be considered tip of arrow for TMS and same is true of omni-channel and some of the ones that we've talked about. But that really isn't a big change for us. I have to say that, since we are focused largely on Tier 1 and Tier 2, usually those companies who have put a lot of thought into these transformational programs and tend to take the time with a sales cycle, but engage in larger initiatives with us.\nDavid Robinson: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nEddie Capel: My pleasure, David, thank you.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A and now back to Mr. Eddie Capel for final remarks.\nEddie Capel: All right. Very good, Jeff, thank you very much. Appreciate it. And thank you everybody for taking the time to join the call today and get an update on our Q1 2021. As I said, we're excited about the quarter but even more excited about our go-forward opportunity. And we'll look forward to speaking to you about three months from now with our Q2 update. Thanks again. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter results and discuss our updated full year 2021 outlook. Manhattan Associates is off to a strong start for the year, reporting record Q1 total revenue of $157 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.43 both exceeding expectations. Our business pace continues to be solid with broad revenue outperformance across our solutions, driving top line revenue growth and earnings leverage in the quarter, while simultaneously driving our increasing investment in the business. Our team continues to execute well and that business momentum is accelerating, underscoring this strength and the growing demand for cloud solutions. We achieved record bookings in Q1 with our RPO increasing 108% over the prior year and 36% sequentially to $421 million. With our forward revenue visibility improving and the inherent leverage in our model, we'll be increasing our 2021 guidance across the board. Equally important, our pipeline continues to grow nicely with about 90% of the pipe consisting of cloud opportunities and net new potential customers representing about 40% of that demand. And much of our success is bolstered by delivering the most innovative technological advancements in our industry. As solutions are mission critical to our customers and our end markets. And now with the need for modern, adaptable, scalable and resilient supply chain, inventory and omni-channel solution is never more apparent, we're in the early stages of extending our mind and wallet share. Additionally, the secular tailwinds in numerous, digital transformation of businesses, brick-and-mortar stores shifting to an innovative multi-function facility concept, the insatiable desire to get as close as possible to the end customer, creative inventory management strategies and shorter fulfillment timelines, just some of the significant drivers that are aligning customer demand with our product strategy. And our unified platform is industry-leading and provides our customers with solutions that are scalable, versionless and extensible. And this enables our clients to be adaptable and provide unmatched customer experiences. Now with Manhattan Active omni, just entering its fourth year in the market and Manhattan Active Warehouse Management about to reach its first anniversary and on pace for innovation to set \u2013 our innovation set to accelerate on the heels of nearly $19 million invested in R&D just this year alone. We are strategically positioned for long-term sustainable growth. On the sales front, competitive win rates remain strong at about 70% is that commitment to innovation keeps Manhattan Associates at top of the industry. In Q1, about 25% of our client in-licensed deals were from new customers. From a vertical perspective, retail manufacturing, and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And drilling in a little bit, the sub verticals, a pretty diverse as well, including apparel, department stores, food and beverage, industrial, as well as durable and non-durable goods. As services group executed extremely well in Q1, conducting over 100 go-lives and with demand for expertise remaining high, we anticipate as services revenue will return to growth in Q2. And we continue to aggressively hire talent to meet the forecasted demand. Now let me provide if I can just some quick updates on our product portfolio. Starting with our point-of-sale solution, Q1 was a pretty positive quarter for POS both with respect to go-lives and new customer signings. While early, pipeline opportunities are growing following a pretty quiet year in 2020. Now on the go-live front, we've got a number of implementations currently in flight, including a well-known specialty retailer that during the quarter went live with that point-of-sale application in a pilot store and feedback from the store associates has been extremely positive. We've commentary on an ease of use, speed and responsiveness. And the retailer has started rolling out the system across their store fleet and will be complete in a few months. Then they'll turn their attention to activating the rest of our Manhattan Active omni suite, including enterprise order management and store fulfillment. And when it comes to new point-of-sale customer signings, we're happy to announce that three additional projects that been signed and kicked off in the last quarter. These include a well-known global apparel brand that will first pilot up point-of-sale application here in the U.S. this summer and then plot plan to roll out the solution to the fleet of stores worldwide. This customer is already live on enterprise order management and saw the true sales and service advantage from having a unified order management and point-of-sale application. And that same advantage proved attractive for a long time Manhattan Active OMS customer in Canada, who will roll out our point-of-sales solution across their fleet of apparel retail stores by early fall. And finally, we've also kicked off a project at a well-known sports apparel and footwear customer. And this global brand will start by using our point-of-sale to enable endless aisle capabilities in their stores, enabling their store associates to use mobile devices, to capture orders for customers when a size or a color isn't available at that particular location. And once again, this point-of-sale usage will be an extension of an existing Manhattan Active omni functionality that is already deployed of that particular customer. And while the pandemic seemed to cause many of the store systems or much of the store systems activities to be put on hold, third-party integrators and industry research firms are now beginning to indicate the planned investments in point-of-sale are again showing signs of picking up. And because we were able to continue to invest heavily in that point-of-sale application throughout the pandemic, we believe that we're very well positioned for the inevitable need for a replacement cycle in point-of-sale and store systems in general. Now turning to supply chain, Q1 was another good quarter for our transportation management application. Just in recent weeks, we received word from Gartner that for the third year in a row, our application was one of the very few to be included in the Leader's quadrant that in the recently published Gartner Magic Quadrant for transportation management systems. And we've been able to maintain this important industry designation because of our continued investment in innovation, within TMS, and also the high levels of customer satisfaction that we garner with our customers. The TMS market continues to be an active one for us as customers either move older on-premise deployments of TMS to the cloud, or adopt a new TMS for the very first time. And generally speaking, tied TMS customers or cloud TMS allows smaller customers to benefit from the power of a leading TMS solution. Now speaking of supply chain applications in the cloud, we continue to see very favorable response from our Manhattan Active WM application, launched almost a year ago now at last year's momentum conference, the number of Manhattan Active WM projects has surpassed two dozen at professional services team across North and South America and Europe remain quite busy preparing for a summer full of Manhattan Active WM go-lives. And additionally, our sales pipeline remains strong across both existing Manhattan WMS on-premise customers looking to go cloud native and with opportunities with net new customers. Q1 was also a nice quarter for a demand forecasting inventory optimization solutions. As we continue to see both existing and new customers choose a cloud based solutions to help them optimize their inventory levels across the enterprise. And finally, our product teams are hard at work preparing for upcoming Momentum Connect 2021 conference in May. Like last year will be virtual, unfortunately, but we're planning again to make some really important product announcements. For a number of years now, our product strategy has been centered around two key ideas. Migrating our best-in-class functional capabilities to a truly cloud native architecture and secondly, delivering unified applications within that three main areas of focus, omni-channel, supply chain and inventory. And at this year's conference, we'll announce yet another large step forward in making that vision a reality for our customers. So that concludes my business update. With that, I'll pass it over to Dennis, who will provide you with an update on our financial performance and discuss our outlook for 2021. And I'll close our prepared remarks for the brief summary before moving to Q&A. So Dennis, take it away. Terrific. Thanks Dennis. So we're very pleased with a strong start to 2021 and record results. While we continue to operate in a pretty turbulent global macroenvironment, we're confident in our ability to help deliver success for our customers and drive long-term sustainable growth from Manhattan Associates. Many of our customers and prospects are in the early stages of their digital transformation and even their move to the cloud. With our industry leading innovation, technical and domain expertise and the world's most talented and seasoned supply chain commerce employees, we believe that we are best positioned to help the industry modernize, which in turn creates a really exciting opportunity for Manhattan Associates. So with that, Jeff, we'd be happy to take any questions. Yes, it does. It certainly seems that interest is picking up in the market Terry, we're seeing that interest pick up and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, industry analysts and the third-party integrators and so forth seem to be indicating that after the gap year of 2020, where we sort of spent a large part of the time closed as they reopened. And an emerge really is multi-function facilities by online curbside boutiques, galleries, return centers for product support online and so forth. Now, the systems that they have in place today don't support those capabilities very well, as well as all of the cross-selling and upselling that certainly retailers want to do and manage \u2013 maximize the inventory they have across the network. So there certainly seems to be some forward momentum there. The position that we're in with point of sale being sort of an extension of our Omni or order management suite of solutions seems to be being pretty well received in the market, you again heard from my comments that most of our customers are seeing one or the other go first on that roadmap, because there is a real strategic advantage for them. With regard to the size of the opportunity, the market is large as we know, we know the game as it were has moved from being a hardware game to a software game and that's where the critical mass is beginning to build. I don't know that I'm going to be able to give you a \u2013 and I don't want to give you a specific ASP of point of sale as it relates to order management and warehouse management. But suffice to say is a huge opportunity out there particularly, when the customers and retailers have a large store network. And I mean, I guess I would just say that it certainly would not be unusual for a point of sale opportunity to be in the same ballpark as material WMS program or a material OMS program. Thanks, Terry. Well, it's I think the \u2013 there's been great review of some of the drivers there, Joe. But the top of the list is a more immediate access to innovation. Just we've talked about it before, but honestly, I feel like it's head and shoulders above the other drivers with so many things changing in, supply chain, obviously digital transformation continuing to accelerate. The oldest other things that you talked about are factors, but the need to be flexible, agile and meet ever changing business needs, drives the need to get your hands on new innovation quickly. And that I think is the number one reason. There's no question that the challenge finding IT talent and so forth puts pressure on our customer's organization so that having us manage the solutions and so forth is helpful to them. As a corollary to it, but access to innovation would be number one. Yes. I wouldn't say there is any major change in terms of the \u2013 our ability to cross-sell and up-sell across the suite of solutions to be honest with you, Joe, we've had great customer retention over the world \u2013 over the years, we generally refer to it as maintenance retention, still it's true that a large percentage of our new software sales and every given quarter comes from existing customers. But the good news is with all of that said still a healthy number of new logos coming into the family. So I think a great balance there as we continue to drive innovation into the marketplace, we certainly expect to be able to continue that cross-sell and up-sell. And especially as we do introduce new products to the marketplace and we throw a little bit of that in the last quarter with point of sale in one of my more recent product introductions. Thank you, Joe. Yes, well certainly in terms of the journey of retail coming back for us over the last shall we call it 15 months, during 2020 in the real depths of the pandemic, there was still a fair amount of activity, we saw that first Q2 was pretty turbulent. But is there a fair amount of activity on the WMS side, direct-to-consumer shipments were increasing obviously the need for speed was there and so forth so we felt fairly healthy amount of activity in WMS. The larger strategic Manhattan Active Omni projects, went low quiet last year maybe for obvious reasons, there were smaller point projects with curbside and BOPUS projects and ship-from-store projects and so forth. But the big omnichannel project seem to wane a little bit with seeing that pick back up. And then again for obvious reasons with many stores closed store systems projects where, it was a bit of a gap year in 2020, and again, we're starting to see point of sale and store systems projects begin to pick back up, kind of across the board. So I'd say that's sort of been the journey across the solution suite over the last 15, 12 \u2013 12 or 15 months. In terms of the competitive landscape, it hasn't changed a great deal frankly. Really competitors remained the same, they remain as active, there is some terrific competitors out there and keeps us sharp and on that toes and keeping innovating. The services business was particularly strong in European in Q1, we're starting to see just like here in the U.S. frankly things begin to open up direct consumer growing has been growing over the last 12 months. So I don't think there is anything really very different in Europe that's happening here, it's pretty positive across the board. There are a couple of spots in APAC that are a little slower than we might like. Australia is pretty strong, but Japan is a little flat frankly China is a little flat, but there are smaller parts of the business and we certainly expect those to cycle back up in the next couple three quarters. Thank you, Yun. Thank you, Mark. Yes. So pretty short answer is, Mark, no, competitors are pretty much the same today as they have been over the last \u2013 well, even longer than this, but let's call it, a couple of three or four or five years. So same competitive landscape in terms of the win rates, I don't have that right off the top of my head, but certainly that strong, that probably might be a tick above the 70%. And we feel pretty good about where we are. We've talked about this before generally, when we don't come in first, often it's a pricing challenge and so forth, but still feel pretty good about the win rates. Yes, sure. I mean, really with an acceleration of buy online, pickup in-store, curbside pickup and ship from store, it throws off traditional inventory strategies. So because you don't know, it's much harder to predict and forecast what those \u2013 the impact of those strategies are going to be on a stores' inventory strategy, not relying on walk-ins anymore. So it requires frankly creative and sophisticated, a forecasting strategies and over the long-term, integration with an auto management system. So that you get a much better handle on what those \u2013 more creative fulfillment strategies are going to look like across the store network and how they feed back in to inventory optimization. Thank you, Mark. I don't think there's any trend, if we look back my answer to that, Brian, would be if you think about particularly Manhattan Active WM, which drove a healthy amount of the bookings, and of course, the result in RPO. It's about three quarters since we released, or it certainly was at the end of the quarter. The first quarter, most folks were figuring out what it was, what it looked like and so forth. And then we began to enter into sales cycles and we really started picking up some sales cycle momentum from Manhattan Active, Manhattan Active WM in kind of Q4, and again, in Q1. So now no big change, there have been a couple of questions where competitive landscape and secular trends and so forth, no big changes there. But I do think it has taken just a little while to build momentum for an awareness and everything else in the solution. Yes. So there's really sort of three prongs of \u2013 we have plenty of ideas for new innovation inside of our existing solutions. We really do. So we'll continue to innovate into our existing solutions, no question. We are certainly continuing to build out our product footprint with new products, and the ability to be able to cross-sell, upsell and obviously help our customers. And then the third bucket is the real creative and innovative unification of the solutions. Okay. Because there's a level of unification and flat out capability that we can deliver to the marketplace through a component base, set of microservices based solutions that could not done before. So unification new innovation into our existing solutions and footprint growth. Thank you, Brian. Yes. Well, so first of all, just in terms of kind of overall dynamics and so forth, Europe's about 20% to 25% of our pipeline, number one. In terms of sales capacity, we are not capacity constrained. We do have a couple of open spots in Europe. Frankly, we say this a lot, but we've always got a few open spots for domain experts in our field, both Europe, APAC and in \u2013 but with U.S., but we're not capacity constrained. In terms of APAC, of course, APAC represents about 6% or 7% of our revenue. And it's very important to us. It's certainly very important to our global customers and so forth.

And honestly, we like many others talk about APAC as a region, but boy, it is pretty diverse in and of itself. So there's no \u2013 again, no particular sales capacity issue there and country-by-country almost there are kind of different dynamics going on. I think we all know that Australia and New Zealand are in a pretty good shape. Things are pretty open. And businesses flourishing reasonably well there, whereas some of the other countries are struggling a little bit more. And then with regard to your second question around looking through the point-of-sale telescope, I think you called it. And what we're seeing in terms of store openings, obviously Europe is opening up, a good bit more from a trajectory perspective now, particularly in the UK. Here, obviously we're pretty much fully open across the board in the spots that are not, I think retailers are definitely feeling like it's pretty close by and beginning to feel the need for adaption and modernization in those stores. Certainly, Mark. Thank you. Yes, that's a good question. So broadly speaking, no, the sales cycles have remained about the same. However in the last 12 months, we have seen some what I would call smaller point projects go faster, right. So when we were in a situation where stores were closed and retailers wanted to use those stores as ship from locations, we source them, ship from store projects accelerate. We saw some buy online, pickup in-store, some curbside pickup projects where our customers came to us and said, listen, we got to be live in days. And that we've referred to it in a couple of previous earnings calls. I think some examples where frankly, we turned on a dime and had buy online, pickup in-store solutions up and running with an existing customer, of course, in literally six or seven days. And even in situations where it was a new customer needed curbside pickup program, zero to live in six weeks. So we did see some of those small programs have very short sales cycles. But overall David, nothing honestly has really changed at a higher level and more strategic level. Not really David, we've got a reasonably broad portfolio in the supply chain space. And there are certainly some of our solutions that are considered tip of arrow. If you think about the distribution management side, sometimes slotting optimization projects or labor management projects on the transportation side. Look at transportation procurement or transportation modeling engagements, which would be considered tip of arrow for TMS and same is true of omni-channel and some of the ones that we've talked about.

I have to say that, since we are focused largely on Tier 1 and Tier 2, usually those companies who have put a lot of thought into these transformational programs and tend to take the time with a sales cycle, but engage in larger initiatives with us. My pleasure, David, thank you. All right. Very good, Jeff, thank you very much. Appreciate it. And thank you everybody for taking the time to join the call today and get an update on our Q1 2021. As I said, we're excited about the quarter but even more excited about our go-forward opportunity. And we'll look forward to speaking to you about three months from now with our Q2 update. Thanks again. Appreciate it."

            "content": "Thanks Eddie. I would characterize our first quarter execution as an all-rounder. We delivered strong financial performance from top line to bottom line with across the board, solid growth, profitability, cash flow, and balance sheet results. Here's the key summary of financial highlights with growth rates on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. As Eddie mentioned Q1 total revenue was $157 million, up 2%; adjusted earnings per share was $0.43, up 8%; GAAP EPS was $0.35 and overall performance was driven by cloud revenue in the quarter. Q1 operating income totaled $36 million, up 12% year-over-year; adjusted operating margin was 22.7%, up 200 basis points and our GAAP operating margin was 16.2%. Q1 cloud revenue was $27 million, up 54%. License revenue was $7.8 million, down 19% as our end markets are predominantly choosing our cloud solutions. And Q1 RPO was a record performance at $421 million, up 108% in case you forgot from Eddie's comments year-over-year and up 36% sequentially. At our current full year outlook $450 million to $550 million we are on track to exceed our $500 million midpoint. Further cloud momentum is fueling our services pipeline and revenue growth opportunity. Q1 services revenue exceeded expectations totaling $80 million against an $87 million comp in Q1 2020. More importantly, services revenue was up 13% sequentially over Q4 2020 with our growth outlook accelerating for the balance of 2021. Our Q2 services revenue forecast is $83 million to $85 million, up 17% year-over-year. And for Q3 and Q4, our forecast calls for 20% year-over-year growth. Maintenance was up 1% on cash collections. Important point here, like license revenue, we do expect second half attrition on customer conversions to cloud, which will positively impact our RPO performance. And also our hardware team delivered a solid $6 million in sales up 56% year-over-year. So let me turn to cash and cash flow, another strong performance, Q1 closed with cash on hand totaling $197 million with zero debt operating. Cash flow was $40 million up 3.5 times year-over-year and our Q1 free cash flow margin was 25%. Our current deferred revenue balance totaled to $123 million up 8% over Q4 2020 and 17% year-over-year on cloud billings. And also we invested $27 million in share buybacks in Q1 and our board raised our buyback authority to $50 million. That's the results summary, I'll cover some additional financial updates and guidance and then turn the call back to Eddie. Our cloud revenue outperformance was mostly driven by positive deal timing, overages renewals. Overages and renewals can be lumpy on a quarterly basis, for Q2 we expect cloud revenue to be roughly up 46% compared to Q2 2020. For the full year, we are raising our previous cloud revenue estimate of $108 million to $110 million to a range of $111 million to $113 million equating to 40% growth at the midpoint. As frequently mentioned, remaining performance obligation or RPO is the leading proxy for our cloud revenue. While we updated our RPO outlet to exceed $500 million midpoint for 2021 going forward, our intention remains to guide RPO on an annual basis as bookings can be lumpy primarily based on sales cycle timing and the number and relative value of large deals and product mix from quarter-to-quarter. Furthermore, on flow-through from RPO to cloud revenue, some customers have longer implementation cycles, associated with large projects requiring a multi-year annual subscription ramp built into the contract. These revenue ramps are commonly or common for larger cloud deals and with larger opportunities becoming more prevalent in our pipeline, we expect RPO growth to accelerate first, followed by a gradual steepening ramp in cloud revenue growth, providing us with very good visibility into future subscription revenue. So all said, we are confident in our ability to achieve the high end of our prior $450 million to $550 million RPO outlook for 2021. As discussed in our previous Q4 earnings call, we expect license and maintenance revenue attrition to accelerate in 2021, estimating license revenue to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million for the full year, which represents a 41% year-over-year decline. For Q2, we anticipate license revenue to be approximately $6 million, and Q3 and Q4 to be about $4 million each quarter. For maintenance revenue, we continue to target approximately $35 million per quarter throughout 2021, and we expect the attrition impact will manifest itself for the most part in the second half of 2021. Our consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin for the quarter was 50.9% driven by revenue performance and cloud operating leverage. We expect Q2 consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin to be about 52.6% improving 40 bps over prior expectations. Given the strong demand we anticipate costs to tick up slightly in the second half on hiring and performance-based comp with second half margin to be about 51.1% compared to our prior expectations of 51.5%. And for operating income and margin, we are increasing our full year 2021 guidance 50 bps, resulting in a midpoint of 21.5% and we remain confident in our ability to make strong progress on achieving the rule authority over time. On a quarterly basis, we anticipate adjusted operating margin to be 22.5% for Q2, 21.2% in Q3 and 19.4% in Q4. Regarding taxes, our adjusted effective income tax rate was 21.5%, we expect our Q2 and full year 2021 adjusted tax rate to be 21.5%, down from our prior expectations of 23%. The lower tax rate will benefit pro forma adjusted EPS by roughly $0.03 for the full year, our GAAP effective income tax rate was 9.9% for the quarter driven by excess tax benefits on restricted stock vesting. We expect our full year 2021 GAAP tax rate to be about 20%. Regarding our capital structure, in Q1 2021, we repurchased approximately 214,000 shares worth roughly $27 million, for the second quarter and full year, we estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be 64.8 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. Also for CapEx, we estimate for 2001 [ph] to invest about $6 million to $8 million at this time. So that completes the core financial update, turning to increased 2021 guidance. For total revenue we are raising guidance from our previous range of $595 million to $625 million, which represented 4% growth at the midpoint to a new guidance range of $625 million to $640 million targeting 8% growth at the midpoint of $632 million. As a reminder, this includes $22.5 million of revenue compression equating to 4 percentage points of growth driven by license and maintenance attrition. For Q2, we expect total revenue of $154 million to $159 million or 15% growth at the $157 million midpoint. As we account for continued license attrition, we expect Q3 and Q4 midpoint total revenue growth to be approximately 7% to 8%. For adjusted earnings per share, we're increasing our previous guidance range of $1.44 to $1.59 to $1.60 to $1.70 with a midpoint of $1.65, up from our previous midpoint of $1.52. For GAAP earnings per share, our guidance range is $1.10 to $1.20 with a midpoint of $1.15 up from our previous midpoint of $1.04. For Q2, we expect adjusted EPS $0.42 to $0.44. And as previously discussed for operating margin, we are raising our target range to 21% to 22% and for Q2 we expect an operating margin range of 22.3% to 22.7%. So in summary, our underlying growth fundamentals are strong, excluding license and maintenance, which are line items negatively impacted by our cloud transition, because they are a trading at the midpoint of our Q2 and full year guidance, our pro forma total 2021 total revenue growth is 23% for Q2 and full year 17%. So thank you, that covers my financial update and I'll turn the call back to Eddie. In terms of duration, no change, we're still hitting right at the five year mark, given the mission critical and strategic nature of these solutions, Terry, and what I would tell you is, pretty diverse spread of bookings across the customer, there wasn't any material concentration of one customer in the pool of deals that we closed in the quarter, good volume and good velocity and good diversity as well. Yes, Joe, I would say also 25% of our software was net new customers in the quarter, and if you look at our pipeline 40% of the pipeline is made up of net new customers as well. I think that goes to Eddie's story about the importance of innovation and from a retention point of view, it's early days from our renewal point of view, but we're basically at 99% to 100% on cloud renewal retention. No onetime trend, what we have is a company that's super focused on \u2013 as part of our DNA on cash, it was a record cash collections quarter for us, and really underpinning that is really the growing subscription business. Yes, 25% free cash flow margin. Yes. Brian, we're almost equally split on conversions and net new customers on MAWM. And as Eddie mentioned, we're already over two dozen, we've closed over two dozen deals there, so."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Manhattan Associates Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, February 2. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note, in particular, the turbulent global macro environment could impact our performance and cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results, as well as our outlook for 2023. So 2022 is a remarkable year for Manhattan, setting all-time records in total revenue, RPO, operating profit, cash collections and earnings per share. And to drive future growth and innovation, we also invested record amounts in our people and in R&D. In 2022, we spent over $110 million on research and development, which is up 15% from the previous year. We also increased our total headcount by 16% in response to the high demand for our solutions and services. We are confident that these investments will contribute to our already high levels of customer satisfaction and extend our position as the leading innovator in core supply chain execution, omnichannel solutions and retail point-of-sale commerce. And given the size of our opportunity and the long-term favorable business momentum, we plan to continue the investments, including hiring between 400 and 600 new associates in 2023, which we are guiding to be our fourth record revenue year since introducing our goal to become a cloud-first company five years ago. Now while we remain appropriately cautious regarding the global economy, demand for our solutions remains robust, and we are optimistic about our long-term market opportunity. Now recall our solutions are mission-critical and they are key components to our customers' success. And additionally, we are entering 2023 with pretty good visibility in several growth drivers, including, the acquisition of new customers; the conversion of our on-premise customers to the cloud; and cross-selling our unified product portfolio into our customer base. Now specifically pivoting to our quarterly results, Q4 was a record quarter that exceeded our expectations. Revenue increased 16% as a reported $198 million and highlighted by 49% growth in cloud, 22% growth in services and double-digit revenue growth across all of our geographies. And these strong results drove our topline outperformance and solid earnings leverage in the quarter with adjusted earnings per diluted share increasing 69% to $0.81. Now RPO, the leading indicator of that growth, increased 50% to $1.1 billion at the end of 2022. And importantly, customer satisfaction levels are high. Win rates remain at 75% plus, and demand for our cloud solutions continues to be pretty solid across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example in the quarter, cloud deals won include a global cosmetics manufacturer, a grocery retailer, a diversified automotive company, a manufacturer of home goods, a food wholesaler and an e-commerce retailer as well as numerous others. And this contributed to a healthy mix of bookings across sub-verticals for the full-year. And additionally, aided by the clear benefit of resilient modern supply chains, over 40% of our bookings were generated from new logos and over 30% from cross-sell opportunities in 2022. Importantly, that pipeline continues to be strong with solid demand across our product suites. Net new potential customers represent about 35% of that demand. And as of year-end, we had converted less than 10% of our on-premise customers to the cloud. Now turning to the product front. We are coming off of a very exciting National Retail Federation Conference in New York. Customers and prospects were back in force this year, and we have some exciting product innovations to share with them. Those include the work we are doing around fully enabling RFID with our Manhattan Active store solution. We've added native support for RFID directly into checkouts and returns, inventory management and store fulfillment functions so that retailers can make more accurate promises, increased conversion rates and maximize inventory exposure for selling. The value of RFID in stores has proven to be quite significant as the digital experience becomes an integral part of bricks-and-mortar shopping. It's vital that our customers know how much of a particular product that they have and where each specific unit is located inside of their store. And what's more, RFID allows our customers to deliver these improved experiences and to do it with significantly less labor. Now speaking of our store technology, we just finished a very successful retail peak season, and specifically with our point-of-sale application. A number of our customers are showing very positive results from the rollout of our Omnicart capabilities. That's the ability to sell items from alternate locations in a single transaction. And only a unified commerce solution with a built-in point-of-sale and order management capabilities can deliver a seamless Omnicart process. Now regarding implementations, we are seeing some really very positive operational results tied to the first wave of deployments of Manhattan Active Warehouse Management. And I thought I'd share a couple of anecdotes on the positive operational impact from the deployments of our cloud-native WMS. Now I've spoken before about employee engagement, one of the WMS features, which is unique to our application. And one of our early adopter Manhattan Active WM customers who now activated all the features of employee engagement, including enabling their associates to complete in gamified challenges and accumulate points. And these points are redeemable for a variety of tangible items in a digital incentive store. And the result for this customer is an incremental 5% productivity improvement in the DC on top of their traditional engineered labor standards and incentive program. And staying on productivity enhancements for a moment, one of our high-volume apparel customers in Brazil is showing a double-digit throughput increase in their distribution center after implementing Manhattan Active WM. Even though the facility was already outfitted with pretty extensive automation, the workflow optimization inside of Manhattan Active WM is helping them extract record levels of productivity from their material handling automation. Now even in a less automated DC, Manhattan Active WM really shines there, too. One of our large wholesale drug customers is reporting a picking productivity improvement in excess of 30%, and this improvement is attributable to the latest pick path optimization algorithms native to Manhattan Active WM. Now before I hand off to Dennis, I want to take this opportunity to briefly recognize and thank each and every member of the Manhattan global team. And Manhattan is committed to creating an inclusive culture where our team members can advance their careers, contribute to our company-wide goals, feel valued and engaged with the communities in which they live and work. And in 2022, they clearly went above and beyond to deliver a remarkable year with remarkable results for our valued customers. And I'm confident in the future success of this company largely because of this team. So that includes \u2013 or concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of our financial performance and outlook. And then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. As Eddie highlighted in 2022, we set all-time records in RPO, total revenue, operating profit, cash collections and earnings per share. Congratulations to our team members around the globe for great execution. Overall, for the quarter and the year, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance on topline growth and operating margin, with both results comparing favorably to the Rule of 40 and if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, excluding license and maintenance attrition, both results exceed the Rule of 50. We continue to deliver strong metrics across revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll start with recapping our financial performance for the quarter and year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Additionally, we are also providing constant currency growth to demonstrate apples-to-apples comparisons. Unless otherwise stated, constant currency will compare results as if rates were unchanged from the year ago period. Q4 total revenue was $198 million, up 16% as reported and 19% excluding FX. Full-year revenue totaled $767 million, also up 16% and 18% removing FX. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the revenue compression by our cloud transition, Q4 revenue growth was 29% and full-year 25%. Q4 cloud revenue totaled $52 million, up 49%, with full-year revenue totaling $176 million, up 44%. We closed out 2022 with RPO of $1.1 billion on the round, growing 50%. This was at the high end of our guidance. If FX rates remain unchanged from the year ago period, RPO growth would be 54%. And if rates remained unchanged from September 30 levels, sequential RPO growth would be 6%. As of December 31, over 97% of our RPO represents true cloud-native subscriptions. Q4 services revenue increased 22% to $100 million, and full-year services revenue increased 18% to $394 million. Both were records as cloud sales continue to fuel services growth globally. Shifting to earnings leverage. Our Q4 adjusted operating income totaled $60 million with an operating margin of 30.2%. The 740 basis point increase was driven by revenue growth. Full-year adjusted operating margin was 27.6%, up 80 basis points on revenue growth. Our Q4 GAAP operating income was $45 million with a 22.6% operating margin, with full-year GAAP operating income totaling $153 million with a 20% operating margin. Our Q4 earnings per share increased 69% to $0.81. Note, our EPS includes $0.05 of tax benefit associated with expiring tax statutes, lowering our effective tax rate in the quarter to 16%. This resulted in full-year EPS of $2.76, which was up 24%, exceeding guidance. Q4 operating cash flow increased 38% to $55 million as Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin was 31% and free cash flow margin was 26.6%. Our full-year operating cash flow was $180 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.5% and free cash flow margin was 22.6%. Remember, these figures include $58 million in cash taxes paid, which is roughly doubling the amount of cash taxes paid over last year. For more information on the $26 million incremental cash taxes paid associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, please refer to Item 8 in our earnings supplemental information schedules. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue increased 36% year-over-year and 23% sequentially to $209 million. We closed 2022 with $225 million in cash and zero debt. For the year, we invested $175 million in share buybacks, including $25 million in Q4. Also, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. Now moving to guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit topline growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. As Eddie mentioned, we will continue to invest with a balanced approach to growth and profitability. We are raising the midpoint of the preliminary 2023 revenue, operating margin and EPS guidance that we provided last quarter. We are also reiterating our 2023 RPO guidepost midpoint of $1.35 billion. Consistent with our recent earnings releases, our guidepost can be found in today's earnings release, supplemental schedules. As noted on prior earnings calls, we will be updating our RPO outlook on an annual basis. Additionally, as previously discussed, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or nonlinear bookings throughout the year. For full-year 2023, we expect total revenue of $820 million to $833 million with an $826.5 million midpoint, up from our prior midpoint of $810 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 16% growth. All in, our target is 8%. First half and second half total revenue splits are expected to be about 50-50. For Q1, we expect total revenue of $198 million to $202 million, which at the midpoint represents 21% growth, ex license and maintenance attrition and 12% growth all in. We continue to track ahead of our original margin expectations. And reflective of our higher revenue outlook, we are increasing our 2023 adjusted operating margin range to 25.5% to 26.5%, with a midpoint of 26%, up from our prior guidance of 25.5%. Included in this range is a 260 basis point headwind from the $35 million reduction in maintenance and license revenue from our transition to cloud. At the midpoint, operating margin on a quarterly basis is expected to be roughly: For Q1, 26%; Q2, 26.8%; Q3, 27%; and accounting for retail peak seasonality, 24.3% in Q4. Those are pretty exact targets. This results in a full-year adjusted EPS range of $2.61 to $2.75. The $2.68 midpoint, up from our prior $2.55 midpoint outlook for GAAP EPS, our guidance range is $1.81 to $1.95. Note, if the 2022 below-the-line income taxes and other income were normalized at 2022 levels, 2023 adjusted EPS would be $0.13 higher and GAAP EPS would be $0.14 higher. For Q1, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.64 to $0.66 and GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.48. For Q2 through Q4, we expect GAAP EPS to be about $0.20 lower than adjusted EPS per quarter, which accounts for our investment in equity-based compensation. Here are some additional details on our 2023 outlook. For full-year 2023, we are increasing our cloud revenue range to $232 million to $236 million, representing 33% growth at the midpoint and assumes $53.8 million in Q1 with about a $3 million sequential increase per quarter throughout the year. For services revenue, we are increasing our forecast of $428 million to $437 million, representing 10% growth at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 services revenue of roughly $103 million; Q2, $111 million; Q3, $114 million; and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $106 million in Q4. On attrition to cloud, we expect maintenance and license to represent about an 8-point headwind in total revenue growth in 2023. For maintenance, we expect a range of $122 million to $124 million, or a 14% decline at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 to be $33 million; Q2, $32 million; Q3, $30 million; and Q4, $28 million. We expect license revenue to be roughly $9 million or 1% of 2023 total revenue. For Q1, we expect $3.5 million of license revenue; $2.5 million in Q2; and $1.5 million in both Q3 and Q4. And for hardware, we anticipate approximately $7 million in revenue per quarter. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin, we are targeting about 54% for the full-year. On a quarterly basis, Q1 will be about 53%, Q2 and Q3 is expected to be 54.5%. And accounting for seasonality, Q4 is expected to be about 53.5%. We expect our effective tax rate to be 21.7% and our diluted share count to be 63 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, 2022 was a great year, and we expect 2023 to be another year of balanced growth across revenue, profitability and cash flow. Thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well look, 2022 was a very good year for Manhattan. And while we remain appropriately cautious, as I mentioned on the volatile macro conditions out there, we are entering 2023 with solid business momentum, and we are very excited about the many opportunities that lie ahead. So just to recap, our strategic demand for our solutions is solid and seems to be resilient. Our global teams are executing very well, and we are continuing to invest in our business to deliver leading innovation to help our customers with their digital and supply chain transformation journeys. In closing, again, thank you to all of our employees across the globe for a fantastic 2022 as your dedication and commitment to our growing customer base that continues to be one of Manhattan's key differentiators. And Robert, with that, we are now ready to take any questions that might be out there.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTerrell Tillman: Yes. Hey, Eddie, Dennis and Mike. Congratulations on the results. I'm going to do my standard annoying preamble, and then I'll kind of get to my questions. First, Eddie, I love kind of the different examples of the customers. That helps a lot in terms of understanding how the business has evolved. So I hope you keep doing that. Dennis, modeling, basically, we don't really have anything to do. You basically told us every line item across all four quarters. So thanks for making that easy. Now finally, to my questions. Maybe the first question for you, Eddie, is just given what you've done with the platform, the cloud products, and just nowadays the business models are a lot different and you have omnichannel, when you bring on a new logo and you've been bringing on more than you had in the past, what does the new logo look like versus three or five years ago in terms of the size and scope of that initial deal or project? And then I had a follow-up for you Dennis.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Great question, Terry. So it tends to be a little bit different. In the old world of license revenue, it was more typical for customers to buy multiple products at the same time. In a subscription-based world, it seems to be more popular, not exclusively this way, but more popular, frankly, to buy one product at a time with follow-on upsell later. And you can kind of see that in the results with 30% of our revenue coming from upsell. And that, I think, is also indicative of the unified platform that we have and the bridge from one solution to the other is frankly not very long.\nTerrell Tillman: Okay. And maybe my follow-up for you, Eddie, and then I had a quick for Dennis. You actually did mention in your prepared remarks visibility for solid or strong visibility, I forgot exactly the description there. But what I'm curious about is you do have the installed base, and we're going to see this maintenance start to kind of decline maybe more meaningfully, so that's one driver. And then the cross-selling. How is the visibility changing or improving? Is one much more notable than the other in terms of driving this visibility?\nEddie Capel: You mean customer base versus new logos?\nTerrell Tillman: No installed base now starting their journey versus then cross-selling. And like you had just said, they get going and then there's repetition to buy more.\nEddie Capel: Yes, I don't think there's a huge difference in visibility or frankly, confidence of visibility, only because we're pretty close to our customers, Terry. And whether it be an on-premise to cloud conversion, or whether it be an expansion of capability inside the customer base, we're pretty close. We've got long-term relationships with these guys. And generally, they share their road map with us. So no big difference in visibility across the two.\nTerrell Tillman: Okay. And then finally for you, Dennis, in terms of the free cash flow margin, maybe you could either answer or give a perspective on how to think about free cash flow margin for the year, or just incremental headwinds on that $56 million plus in cash taxes in 2022 and how that looks in 2023? Thank you.\nDennis Story: Yes. So on the free cash flow, it's going to follow a point or two relative to our operating margin. So I would probably handicap it as two to three points difference between operating margin. And then \u2013 I'm sorry, Terry, what was your other?\nTerrell Tillman: Well, I'm hogging up this call. I should just stop. But it was related to that and the impact from the cash taxes, like does it take another step up? Or are we starting to kind of \u2013 we're going to get past the worst of that?\nDennis Story: We're past the worst of that. So essentially, we're in a mode of about the same amount of taxes on an annual basis now.\nTerrell Tillman: Okay. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJoseph Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone.\nEddie Capel: Hi, Joe.\nJoseph Vruwink: I wanted to go back to NRF this year. And one thing that really stood at to me was just all the attention on the floor and speaking to folks about order management and also store-related solutions. I would imagine WMS is still going to be the primary driver of bookings for you this year. But do you anticipate a bit of an uptick in interest as it relates to the omni and inventory suites?\nEddie Capel: Well, we certainly hope so, Joe. I don't know that there's going to be a massive step up, frankly. As you know, order management is sort of number 2 on the pecking order of solutions for us. There certainly is a lot of interest. We've clearly continued to make significant investments in that solution, and particularly the integration with the bricks-and-mortar store solutions. So there's no question. There is significant interest there. And we're hoping for continued growth in that and momentum in that particular area.\nJoseph Vruwink: Okay. Great. Eddie I think at one point in time, as you were looking at and kind of thinking about migrating the installed base, I know there's not any sort of timetable customers can move as they're ready. But I want to say maybe six, seven years was contemplated. Do you have any views on \u2013 if it's less than 10% of the base today, maybe how long until most of your installed base has a cloud solution from Manhattan?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Still feel the same way. Well, okay, there's two suddenly different questions there, Joe. I definitely \u2013 when I look at my crystal ball, I think most of our existing customers will migrate from on-premise to the cloud over the next six to seven years. There's always a few laggards and so forth, but the bulk of our customers will transition from on-premise to the cloud over the next six or seven years. The slight \u2013 the second part of the question is when will our customer base own something in the cloud from us? Remember, we are now a cloud-first company. So as we cross-sell and upsell into our customer base, it is quite likely that an on-prem \u2013 just hypothetically, an on-premise customer for WMS might well buy a cloud TMS solution, a cloud point-of-sale solution or a cloud OMS solution. So that would mean that, that time horizon would be shorter than six or seven years.\nJoseph Vruwink: Okay. That makes sense. And then I have one quick one if I can squeeze it in. Just any thoughts on just RPO quarter-by-quarter, if you'd expect seasonality or, I guess, if the macros have been tougher, customers might view budgets more on a quarterly basis? Just any way to think about kind of the cadence of RPO bookings throughout 2023?\nEddie Capel: Look, we suspect \u2013 we've always said RPO bookings likely will suffer from a little bit of lumpiness just like license revenue did back in the day. We haven't seen a ton of seasonality when it comes to RPO bookings. I said it before, but frankly, these are big strategic purchases and so forth. And frankly, our customers need to \u2013 they want to get going whenever they want to get going. And so there isn't generally a particular slowdown in any particular quarter, again, very strategic decisions.\nJoseph Vruwink: Great. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is John on for Brian. I wanted to first touch on cross-sell. Eddie, you referenced really good cross-sell numbers here in 2022. I think you said 30%. But I'm curious if you're seeing a change in cadence with customers coming back for additional products? Maybe any geographies you'd call out where you're seeing faster cross-sell? Any color there would be great.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Not particularly, John, to be perfectly honest. The cross-sell across geography is: A, pretty consistent or has been pretty consistent kind of year-over-year and is pretty consistent across that 30% in 2022, number one. And more recently, we've seen a little bit of an uptick in cross-sell, meaning 2022 over the prior years. I think, again, part of that is as we move and have moved into a cloud-first environment, we've seen customers bite off smaller pieces of the product portfolio upfront and then \u2013 but move more quickly into a larger portfolio.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's great color there. Thank you very much. And then also, I want to touch on the TMS product. I see you recall in the past, you called out strength outside of the U.S. I'm curious how the pipes' progressing though within the U.S. And maybe you can give us insight into how the customer conversations are going there? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Yes, pretty good. I mean, look, honestly, the only reason \u2013 the reason that we called out TMS growth outside of the Americas, is historically, that has not been the strongest market for us by design. We tended not to offer TMS outside of the Americas in a very strong way. That's picked up over the last few years. So we were certainly highlighting some of the successes particularly in Europe, particularly in Latin America, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. But the product is doing very well. frankly, and we've talked a little bit about this before, the unification of Manhattan Active WM with Manhattan Active TM is really jump-starting some pretty interesting conversations about, I guess, about half of our more recent Manhattan Active transportation customers or Manhattan Active WM customers. So really starting to benefit from that unification. And we see that as something that will continue on into the future.\nUnidentified Analyst: Well, thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, John. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys and great quarter. I wanted to ask in terms of the new customers you're signing, it seemed like this year was a particularly strong year for net new customers that you brought on to Manhattan. Is there any particular product that you're landing the majority of those with? And where are those customers coming from, typically? Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, the great news there, Matt, is not particularly. It's across the product portfolio. So that's encouraging, number one. And number two, it is across the sub-verticals. So I listed at some of the principal sub-vertical and the product portfolio, and it's a pretty nice spread there across new customers versus existing. Now as you \u2013 if you drill in a little bit further on the distribution side of the house, you certainly see verticals that we've maybe not been quite as strong in over the years, kind of bubbling to the surface, particularly CPG, industrial manufacturing and so forth, as they need to reenergize and modernize their supply chains and particularly with a focus on, kind of, direct-to-consumer or direct to consumer ready. Similar things are happening in the OMS space as well. As you see companies that traditionally were not selling direct-to-consumer now either selling direct to consumer or at least being direct-to-consumer ready as they ship into retail channels. So those would be a couple of spots where we've seen some nice growth, which really speaks to not just total addressable market growth, but certainly, verticals that we've not typically been as strong in, which is very nice.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. And then just to follow up on the margin \u2013 operating margin guidance and commentary. Dennis, so it seems like ex the impact of the cloud transition, which is accelerating in 2023, you would actually show year-over-year margin improvement in 2023. Is that correct? And then, what else should we think about, from an expense perspective in terms of wage inflation and then other investment areas that you're making, particularly with the hundreds of people that you plan to add next year or this year? Thanks.\nDennis Story: Yes, definitely. Look, we guided across all key metrics above this year's \u2013 the 2022 performance. From that perspective, we would expect operating margin to increase through the year, et cetera. And \u2013 having a little brain cramp here.\nEddie Capel: In terms of where the people generally \u2013 where the investments in people will be, for the most part, Matt, those will be customer-facing folks, so largely in our professional services organization and in our customer organization. Now we do plan to and are actively investing more in research and development this year. So you'll see some heads move into there. Sales and marketing is also another area that will continue to add heads as we've talked about before. It's important for us to keep driving awareness the solutions for which we are not quite as well known. That's important to us because we think we've got a great opportunity there. And as always, we'll be selective about adding team members to our sales organization. We've got a very effective and a very efficient sales organization. But as our customer base grows, [indiscernible] coverage and overall coverage is important to us. So again, back to summarize on those people, principally customer-facing, but sales and marketing and R&D as well.\nMatthew Pfau: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thank you, Matt. See you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Schappel: Hi, thank you for taking my questions and nice job on the quarter.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Mark.\nMark Schappel: You are welcome. Eddie, with respect to the macro environment, there was a little \u2013 very little way in commentary in your prepared remarks on that front. Obviously, based on the strong results and guide, it appears you're encountering very few headwinds. But I was wondering if you could just provide some additional commentary on what you're seeing from a macro perspective?\nEddie Capel: Look, there's definitely chop out there. There's no question about that, Mark. Each of us wake up every morning can see, feel and see the chop. But I mean, when we look at the demand for our solutions, when we look at our pipeline, we believe driven by the investments in innovation that we're making, the critical nature of our solutions to both the resilience and the growth of our target markets, we obviously feel pretty good about where we are. We've got pretty good visibility. And so that is how it feels to us, that forward motion feels pretty good. But it is not without its headwinds, for sure. Not without its headwinds.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Great. And then just shifting gears to your point-of-sale solution. I think it was last year's user conference, you expressed that achieving like 10 to 12 go-lives would be a pretty significant milestone \u2013 you felt it would be a pretty significant milestone for the company just because it would make it very easy for the next sale. Just wondering if you can give us a little bit of an update on where you stand on that front?\nEddie Capel: Yes, yes. So we're making good progress. Honestly, you caught me a little colder, I should know all those numbers specifically. We're not quite at that number. But we're less than a handful of way from our initial target. I mean we're not \u2013 listen, obviously, the finish line is not 10 or 12 installations, but we've got \u2013 the first lap for us is sort of getting there. We're making good progress. We've got a couple of go-lives, I think, coming up here in Q1, early 2Q. And by \u2013 certainly by the fall of this year, we will have round it out and met that first milestone. From an overall momentum of point-of-sale and store solutions, again, feels pretty good. We came off of a very enthusiastic National Retail Federation Conference where all the retailers are. We had a pretty big presence from a point-of-sale perspective. Actually, we were fortunate enough to have two components. We had our own booth. We were also the only third-party vendor in the Google Cloud booth as well demonstrating point-of-sale, and we saw a lot of interest coming out of that.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Great. And then on the point-of-sale, again, I think fiscalization was an important new capability that you are building into the product mainly to go after the international customers. Maybe just provide us a little bit of an update there?\nEddie Capel: Yes, sure. Well, actually, so you're spot on. In addition to international customers, oftentimes when you sell point-of-sale even to kind of what is a domestically headquartered company, they have operations overseas. They want a single solution. So fiscalization is important for them as well. And we're knocking them down, frankly. We're knocking down the countries. There is a process there. There's a technical integration. There's a design process, a technical integration process. And then there's a certification process with each and every government agency in those individual countries. And to be honest with you, you can only go at a certain pace because you're dealing with those legislative bodies. But we're making good progress. The principal focus of wave 1 has been on Europe for us. But we're moving to both APAC and to Latin America, just as fast as we can and knocking them off, fortunately as fast as our customers need them.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all for me.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Our final question is from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks for taking the question. Nice quarter, guys. Just following on the point-of-sale product lines, I guess I'm just curious if maybe you give us a little more color on the competitive landscape as you're bidding for these new projects. And what are you typically displacing \u2013 or what are you seeing in place that you're able to push aside with your solution?\nEddie Capel: Well, not pushed aside. But yes I mean \u2013 look, there's a lot of legacy, if you want to call it that, competition out there because this is obviously a point-of-sale in general, is not a new space. There have been solutions available for literally 100 years out there. But our real competitive differentiation is with an omnichannel solution, right. We're not just providing a cash and carry, cash-register-centric solution. Obviously, we've seen over the years, the point-of-sale industry kind of move from being a hardware-centric industry to now a software-based solution with pretty commoditized hardware, whether it be tablet or desktop PCs. So the disposition or the transition is around both hardware and software. And again, in any solution where there is a level of personalization and consumer touch involved, that's where we are really able to shine.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay. Great. And in terms of the macro environment, just \u2013 is the retail \u2013 I'm just wondering of your key verticals, is there anyone you would call out to say, hey, this is a little bit squishier than some of the others?\nEddie Capel: No, I don't think so, Blair. Again, we're all reading, frankly, the same articles and watching the same news feeds. There's a little bit of squishiness everywhere. But as a function of that, in order to compete, then you've got to be close to the customer, you got to be able to provide \u2013 or our customers have to provide excellent service, maximum utilization of the biggest piece of working capital they have, which is the inventory on hand. And bringing those two things together, customer demand and available inventory. So it's \u2013 we're as you know, providing mission-critical systems to our customers. And yes, the \u2013 frankly, there's winners and losers across the customer base. But the fortunate thing is we're much more diverse today, frankly, than we were maybe 10 or 12 years ago, and that's helpful to us.\nBlair Abernethy: Yes. That's great. Thanks for the extra color.\nEddie Capel: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Eddie Capel for closing comments.\nEddie Capel: Very good. Thank you, Robert. Well, again, as always, we appreciate you taking the time to join us this afternoon, particularly since it's our year-end earnings call. We're very pleased with the 2022 results. We appreciate your support throughout the year, and we're excited about as the path ahead. So we look forward to talking to everybody in about 90 days or so. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results, as well as our outlook for 2023. So 2022 is a remarkable year for Manhattan, setting all-time records in total revenue, RPO, operating profit, cash collections and earnings per share. And to drive future growth and innovation, we also invested record amounts in our people and in R&D. In 2022, we spent over $110 million on research and development, which is up 15% from the previous year. We also increased our total headcount by 16% in response to the high demand for our solutions and services. We are confident that these investments will contribute to our already high levels of customer satisfaction and extend our position as the leading innovator in core supply chain execution, omnichannel solutions and retail point-of-sale commerce. And given the size of our opportunity and the long-term favorable business momentum, we plan to continue the investments, including hiring between 400 and 600 new associates in 2023, which we are guiding to be our fourth record revenue year since introducing our goal to become a cloud-first company five years ago. Now while we remain appropriately cautious regarding the global economy, demand for our solutions remains robust, and we are optimistic about our long-term market opportunity. Now recall our solutions are mission-critical and they are key components to our customers' success. And additionally, we are entering 2023 with pretty good visibility in several growth drivers, including, the acquisition of new customers; the conversion of our on-premise customers to the cloud; and cross-selling our unified product portfolio into our customer base. Now specifically pivoting to our quarterly results, Q4 was a record quarter that exceeded our expectations. Revenue increased 16% as a reported $198 million and highlighted by 49% growth in cloud, 22% growth in services and double-digit revenue growth across all of our geographies. And these strong results drove our topline outperformance and solid earnings leverage in the quarter with adjusted earnings per diluted share increasing 69% to $0.81. Now RPO, the leading indicator of that growth, increased 50% to $1.1 billion at the end of 2022. And importantly, customer satisfaction levels are high. Win rates remain at 75% plus, and demand for our cloud solutions continues to be pretty solid across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example in the quarter, cloud deals won include a global cosmetics manufacturer, a grocery retailer, a diversified automotive company, a manufacturer of home goods, a food wholesaler and an e-commerce retailer as well as numerous others. And this contributed to a healthy mix of bookings across sub-verticals for the full-year. And additionally, aided by the clear benefit of resilient modern supply chains, over 40% of our bookings were generated from new logos and over 30% from cross-sell opportunities in 2022. Importantly, that pipeline continues to be strong with solid demand across our product suites. Net new potential customers represent about 35% of that demand. And as of year-end, we had converted less than 10% of our on-premise customers to the cloud. Now turning to the product front. We are coming off of a very exciting National Retail Federation Conference in New York. Customers and prospects were back in force this year, and we have some exciting product innovations to share with them. Those include the work we are doing around fully enabling RFID with our Manhattan Active store solution. We've added native support for RFID directly into checkouts and returns, inventory management and store fulfillment functions so that retailers can make more accurate promises, increased conversion rates and maximize inventory exposure for selling. The value of RFID in stores has proven to be quite significant as the digital experience becomes an integral part of bricks-and-mortar shopping. It's vital that our customers know how much of a particular product that they have and where each specific unit is located inside of their store. And what's more, RFID allows our customers to deliver these improved experiences and to do it with significantly less labor. Now speaking of our store technology, we just finished a very successful retail peak season, and specifically with our point-of-sale application. A number of our customers are showing very positive results from the rollout of our Omnicart capabilities. That's the ability to sell items from alternate locations in a single transaction. And only a unified commerce solution with a built-in point-of-sale and order management capabilities can deliver a seamless Omnicart process. Now regarding implementations, we are seeing some really very positive operational results tied to the first wave of deployments of Manhattan Active Warehouse Management. And I thought I'd share a couple of anecdotes on the positive operational impact from the deployments of our cloud-native WMS. Now I've spoken before about employee engagement, one of the WMS features, which is unique to our application. And one of our early adopter Manhattan Active WM customers who now activated all the features of employee engagement, including enabling their associates to complete in gamified challenges and accumulate points. And these points are redeemable for a variety of tangible items in a digital incentive store. And the result for this customer is an incremental 5% productivity improvement in the DC on top of their traditional engineered labor standards and incentive program. And staying on productivity enhancements for a moment, one of our high-volume apparel customers in Brazil is showing a double-digit throughput increase in their distribution center after implementing Manhattan Active WM. Even though the facility was already outfitted with pretty extensive automation, the workflow optimization inside of Manhattan Active WM is helping them extract record levels of productivity from their material handling automation. Now even in a less automated DC, Manhattan Active WM really shines there, too. One of our large wholesale drug customers is reporting a picking productivity improvement in excess of 30%, and this improvement is attributable to the latest pick path optimization algorithms native to Manhattan Active WM. Now before I hand off to Dennis, I want to take this opportunity to briefly recognize and thank each and every member of the Manhattan global team. And Manhattan is committed to creating an inclusive culture where our team members can advance their careers, contribute to our company-wide goals, feel valued and engaged with the communities in which they live and work. And in 2022, they clearly went above and beyond to deliver a remarkable year with remarkable results for our valued customers. And I'm confident in the future success of this company largely because of this team. So that includes \u2013 or concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of our financial performance and outlook. And then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So Dennis? Terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well look, 2022 was a very good year for Manhattan. And while we remain appropriately cautious, as I mentioned on the volatile macro conditions out there, we are entering 2023 with solid business momentum, and we are very excited about the many opportunities that lie ahead. So just to recap, our strategic demand for our solutions is solid and seems to be resilient. Our global teams are executing very well, and we are continuing to invest in our business to deliver leading innovation to help our customers with their digital and supply chain transformation journeys. In closing, again, thank you to all of our employees across the globe for a fantastic 2022 as your dedication and commitment to our growing customer base that continues to be one of Manhattan's key differentiators. And Robert, with that, we are now ready to take any questions that might be out there. Yes. Great question, Terry. So it tends to be a little bit different. In the old world of license revenue, it was more typical for customers to buy multiple products at the same time. In a subscription-based world, it seems to be more popular, not exclusively this way, but more popular, frankly, to buy one product at a time with follow-on upsell later. And you can kind of see that in the results with 30% of our revenue coming from upsell. And that, I think, is also indicative of the unified platform that we have and the bridge from one solution to the other is frankly not very long. You mean customer base versus new logos? Yes, I don't think there's a huge difference in visibility or frankly, confidence of visibility, only because we're pretty close to our customers, Terry. And whether it be an on-premise to cloud conversion, or whether it be an expansion of capability inside the customer base, we're pretty close. We've got long-term relationships with these guys. And generally, they share their road map with us. So no big difference in visibility across the two. Thank you, Terry. Hi, Joe. Well, we certainly hope so, Joe. I don't know that there's going to be a massive step up, frankly. As you know, order management is sort of number 2 on the pecking order of solutions for us. There certainly is a lot of interest. We've clearly continued to make significant investments in that solution, and particularly the integration with the bricks-and-mortar store solutions. So there's no question. There is significant interest there. And we're hoping for continued growth in that and momentum in that particular area. Yes. Still feel the same way. Well, okay, there's two suddenly different questions there, Joe. I definitely \u2013 when I look at my crystal ball, I think most of our existing customers will migrate from on-premise to the cloud over the next six to seven years. There's always a few laggards and so forth, but the bulk of our customers will transition from on-premise to the cloud over the next six or seven years. The slight \u2013 the second part of the question is when will our customer base own something in the cloud from us? Remember, we are now a cloud-first company. So as we cross-sell and upsell into our customer base, it is quite likely that an on-prem \u2013 just hypothetically, an on-premise customer for WMS might well buy a cloud TMS solution, a cloud point-of-sale solution or a cloud OMS solution. So that would mean that, that time horizon would be shorter than six or seven years. Look, we suspect \u2013 we've always said RPO bookings likely will suffer from a little bit of lumpiness just like license revenue did back in the day. We haven't seen a ton of seasonality when it comes to RPO bookings. I said it before, but frankly, these are big strategic purchases and so forth. And frankly, our customers need to \u2013 they want to get going whenever they want to get going. And so there isn't generally a particular slowdown in any particular quarter, again, very strategic decisions. Thank you, Joe. Yes. Not particularly, John, to be perfectly honest. The cross-sell across geography is: A, pretty consistent or has been pretty consistent kind of year-over-year and is pretty consistent across that 30% in 2022, number one.

We tended not to offer TMS outside of the Americas in a very strong way. That's picked up over the last few years. So we were certainly highlighting some of the successes particularly in Europe, particularly in Latin America, particularly in Australia and New Zealand.

And again, in any solution where there is a level of personalization and consumer touch involved, that's where we are really able to shine. No, I don't think so, Blair. Again, we're all reading, frankly, the same articles and watching the same news feeds. There's a little bit of squishiness everywhere. But as a function of that, in order to compete, then you've got to be close to the customer, you got to be able to provide \u2013 or our customers have to provide excellent service, maximum utilization of the biggest piece of working capital they have, which is the inventory on hand. And bringing those two things together, customer demand and available inventory. So it's \u2013 we're as you know, providing mission-critical systems to our customers. And yes, the \u2013 frankly, there's winners and losers across the customer base. But the fortunate thing is we're much more diverse today, frankly, than we were maybe 10 or 12 years ago, and that's helpful to us. Thank you. Very good. Thank you, Robert. Well, again, as always, we appreciate you taking the time to join us this afternoon, particularly since it's our year-end earnings call. We're very pleased with the 2022 results. We appreciate your support throughout the year, and we're excited about as the path ahead. So we look forward to talking to everybody in about 90 days or so. Thanks a lot."

            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. As Eddie highlighted in 2022, we set all-time records in RPO, total revenue, operating profit, cash collections and earnings per share. Congratulations to our team members around the globe for great execution. Overall, for the quarter and the year, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance on topline growth and operating margin, with both results comparing favorably to the Rule of 40 and if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, excluding license and maintenance attrition, both results exceed the Rule of 50. We continue to deliver strong metrics across revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll start with recapping our financial performance for the quarter and year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Additionally, we are also providing constant currency growth to demonstrate apples-to-apples comparisons. Unless otherwise stated, constant currency will compare results as if rates were unchanged from the year ago period. Q4 total revenue was $198 million, up 16% as reported and 19% excluding FX. Full-year revenue totaled $767 million, also up 16% and 18% removing FX. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the revenue compression by our cloud transition, Q4 revenue growth was 29% and full-year 25%. Q4 cloud revenue totaled $52 million, up 49%, with full-year revenue totaling $176 million, up 44%. We closed out 2022 with RPO of $1.1 billion on the round, growing 50%. This was at the high end of our guidance. If FX rates remain unchanged from the year ago period, RPO growth would be 54%. And if rates remained unchanged from September 30 levels, sequential RPO growth would be 6%. As of December 31, over 97% of our RPO represents true cloud-native subscriptions. Q4 services revenue increased 22% to $100 million, and full-year services revenue increased 18% to $394 million. Both were records as cloud sales continue to fuel services growth globally. Shifting to earnings leverage. Our Q4 adjusted operating income totaled $60 million with an operating margin of 30.2%. The 740 basis point increase was driven by revenue growth. Full-year adjusted operating margin was 27.6%, up 80 basis points on revenue growth. Our Q4 GAAP operating income was $45 million with a 22.6% operating margin, with full-year GAAP operating income totaling $153 million with a 20% operating margin. Our Q4 earnings per share increased 69% to $0.81. Note, our EPS includes $0.05 of tax benefit associated with expiring tax statutes, lowering our effective tax rate in the quarter to 16%. This resulted in full-year EPS of $2.76, which was up 24%, exceeding guidance. Q4 operating cash flow increased 38% to $55 million as Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin was 31% and free cash flow margin was 26.6%. Our full-year operating cash flow was $180 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.5% and free cash flow margin was 22.6%. Remember, these figures include $58 million in cash taxes paid, which is roughly doubling the amount of cash taxes paid over last year. For more information on the $26 million incremental cash taxes paid associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, please refer to Item 8 in our earnings supplemental information schedules. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue increased 36% year-over-year and 23% sequentially to $209 million. We closed 2022 with $225 million in cash and zero debt. For the year, we invested $175 million in share buybacks, including $25 million in Q4. Also, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. Now moving to guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit topline growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. As Eddie mentioned, we will continue to invest with a balanced approach to growth and profitability. We are raising the midpoint of the preliminary 2023 revenue, operating margin and EPS guidance that we provided last quarter. We are also reiterating our 2023 RPO guidepost midpoint of $1.35 billion. Consistent with our recent earnings releases, our guidepost can be found in today's earnings release, supplemental schedules. As noted on prior earnings calls, we will be updating our RPO outlook on an annual basis. Additionally, as previously discussed, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or nonlinear bookings throughout the year. For full-year 2023, we expect total revenue of $820 million to $833 million with an $826.5 million midpoint, up from our prior midpoint of $810 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 16% growth. All in, our target is 8%. First half and second half total revenue splits are expected to be about 50-50. For Q1, we expect total revenue of $198 million to $202 million, which at the midpoint represents 21% growth, ex license and maintenance attrition and 12% growth all in. We continue to track ahead of our original margin expectations. And reflective of our higher revenue outlook, we are increasing our 2023 adjusted operating margin range to 25.5% to 26.5%, with a midpoint of 26%, up from our prior guidance of 25.5%. Included in this range is a 260 basis point headwind from the $35 million reduction in maintenance and license revenue from our transition to cloud. At the midpoint, operating margin on a quarterly basis is expected to be roughly: For Q1, 26%; Q2, 26.8%; Q3, 27%; and accounting for retail peak seasonality, 24.3% in Q4. Those are pretty exact targets. This results in a full-year adjusted EPS range of $2.61 to $2.75. The $2.68 midpoint, up from our prior $2.55 midpoint outlook for GAAP EPS, our guidance range is $1.81 to $1.95. Note, if the 2022 below-the-line income taxes and other income were normalized at 2022 levels, 2023 adjusted EPS would be $0.13 higher and GAAP EPS would be $0.14 higher. For Q1, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.64 to $0.66 and GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.48. For Q2 through Q4, we expect GAAP EPS to be about $0.20 lower than adjusted EPS per quarter, which accounts for our investment in equity-based compensation. Here are some additional details on our 2023 outlook. For full-year 2023, we are increasing our cloud revenue range to $232 million to $236 million, representing 33% growth at the midpoint and assumes $53.8 million in Q1 with about a $3 million sequential increase per quarter throughout the year. For services revenue, we are increasing our forecast of $428 million to $437 million, representing 10% growth at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 services revenue of roughly $103 million; Q2, $111 million; Q3, $114 million; and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $106 million in Q4. On attrition to cloud, we expect maintenance and license to represent about an 8-point headwind in total revenue growth in 2023. For maintenance, we expect a range of $122 million to $124 million, or a 14% decline at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 to be $33 million; Q2, $32 million; Q3, $30 million; and Q4, $28 million. We expect license revenue to be roughly $9 million or 1% of 2023 total revenue. For Q1, we expect $3.5 million of license revenue; $2.5 million in Q2; and $1.5 million in both Q3 and Q4. And for hardware, we anticipate approximately $7 million in revenue per quarter. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin, we are targeting about 54% for the full-year. On a quarterly basis, Q1 will be about 53%, Q2 and Q3 is expected to be 54.5%. And accounting for seasonality, Q4 is expected to be about 53.5%. We expect our effective tax rate to be 21.7% and our diluted share count to be 63 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, 2022 was a great year, and we expect 2023 to be another year of balanced growth across revenue, profitability and cash flow. Thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks. Yes. So on the free cash flow, it's going to follow a point or two relative to our operating margin. So I would probably handicap it as two to three points difference between operating margin. And then \u2013 I'm sorry, Terry, what was your other? We're past the worst of that. So essentially, we're in a mode of about the same amount of taxes on an annual basis now. Yes, definitely. Look, we guided across all key metrics above this year's \u2013 the 2022 performance. From that perspective, we would expect operating margin to increase through the year, et cetera. And \u2013 having a little brain cramp here."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Robert, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, October 25. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer, you may begin.\nMichael Bauer: Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates 2022 third quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note, in particular, the turbulent global macro environment could impact our performance and cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We have no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed.\nEddie Capel: Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter results, discuss our updated full year 2022 outlook and provide some preliminary color on our thinking around 2023. Both Q3 and year-to-date results were record-setting for Manhattan Associates with Q3 total revenue of $198 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. Both exceeded our expectations. Demand is strong. Customer satisfaction is solid, and we continue to be the leading innovator in core supply chain execution, omnichannel solutions and retail point-of-sale commerce. And while we remain cautious regarding the global economy, we continue to set aggressive growth and investment goals. This includes strategically allocating capital towards industry-leading innovation, enabling customer success and expanding our addressable market. We expect these efforts to further deliver on our long-term growth and earnings objectives. We remain optimistic on our outlook for the remainder of the year and into 2023. And as such, we're raising our 2020 guidance for both revenue and earnings. Q3 was our sixth consecutive record revenue quarter, highlighted by 41% growth in cloud revenue and 17% growth in services revenue. This encompasses double-digit revenue growth across all of our geographies. These strong results drove our top line at performance and solid earnings leverage in the quarter. Our global teams are exceedingly busy in the field and are executing well for our customers. Following by new product sales and system upgrades, we're experiencing strong services demand and continue to actively recruit into our services team around the world to meet demand and further drive customer satisfaction. And this includes hiring over 500 new team members across our company in the first 9 months of 2022, slightly exceeding our original plans. While we're prudently cautious, we still remain focused on adding additional exceptional talent. Foundational to our growth is Manhattan's ability to deliver industry-leading innovation and services to our customers, a mission-critical Manhattan platform and solutions are differentiated and the key components in our customers' success, providing them with the ability to best serve their end markets, adapt quickly and efficiently to changing market conditions and profitably scale their businesses. These powerful benefits contributed to our strong customer satisfaction levels and 75% plus win rates within the quarter. And despite noticeable FX headwinds, RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 69% to $970 million at the end of Q3. On a constant currency basis, which uses the one year ago FX rates, RPO crossed the $1 billion milestone. Now it's up 76%. Importantly though, demand for our cloud solutions continues to be strong and resilient across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example, the quarter cloud deals included a manufacturer and distributor engineered components, a sporting goods and outdoor recreational retailer, an aerospace and defense company, a grocery retailer, an appliance and electronics manufacturer and a food and beverage company, among many others. Our pipeline continues to be robust with solid demand across our product suites. Net new potential customers represented about 35% of that demand. And year-to-date, new logos have generated a full half of our total bookings. And as I mentioned earlier, our global professional services businesses are all performing very well, posting record revenue results with Q3 revenue up 17%, and we continue to receive high marks for customer satisfaction, conducting well over 100 go-lives in the quarter. While our R&D spend plays to eclipse $100 million this year, let's move to a quick update on our industry-leading solutions, starting with Manhattan Active Transportation Management. Across industries and geographies, we continue to experience strong demand and win rates from Manhattan Active TM. And like Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, Manhattan Active Transportation Management serves the needs of retailers, grocers, the food and beverage industry, pharmaceutical distributors, industrial distributors and many others. And that same principle holds true across geographies with Manhattan Active TM already live on three continents with a fourth in process. Now according to Gartner, the total addressable market for WMS and TMS are approximately the same size and present a significant growth opportunity for Manhattan. Both WMS and TMS markets are large, global and span nearly all industries. In Manhattan active Supply Chain, which comprises of Manhattan Active Warehouse Management and Manhattan Active Transportation Management has launched us the ability to provide leading-edge supply chain technologies to customers across industries and across the globe. And as supply chain practitioners hunger for continuous innovation, a truly cloud-native always current unified solution is uniquely positioned to provide the customers a platform for core development. And as a result, we're seeing a growing number of our Manhattan Active WM customers also subscribe to Manhattan Active Transportation Management. In just five quarters after launching Manhattan Active Transportation Management, we believe this growing attach rate for the solution is further indication that our target markets understand and appreciate the many benefits of supply chain unification. Unlike application integration, which several software vendors can offer, true solution unification can only be achieved by replatforming applications to our truly cloud-native and shared collection of micro services. This state-of-the-art common platform makes this unification possible and gives Manhattan Active Supply Chain applications a clear advantage over the competition. And the great thing about the concept of solution unification is that it works up and down the application stack. Macro unification delivers powerful benefits from the suite level, such as with the Manhattan Active Omni and Manhattan Active Supply Chain, but unification also delivers benefits all the way down to the feature level. Many of our early activating customers are already benefiting from the Manhattan Active WM's combination of warehouse management, labor management, automation, orchestration, yard management, slotting optimization and a number of historically separate applications well built into a unified solution. Now moving to our retail specific capabilities. We continue to progress at a rapid pace, implementing Manhattan Active store solutions across a number of leading retailers. To-date, we have Manhattan Active Solutions running in more than 20,000 stores, enabling over 140,000 daily store users across 70 countries. The point-of-sale continues to be a strategic focus for us, and our message around the importance of running an omnichannel native point of sale continues to resonate. We believe strongly that to achieve omni-channel operational excellence, store systems must be an extension of the retailer's digital platform. Manhattan is the only technology provider who can provide best-in-class capabilities, serving both the digital and the physical store channels, and we continue to add new prospects to our point-of-sale pipeline and anticipate an active Q4 with respect to point-of-sale. So in summary, Manhattan Active Supply Chain continues to be a real force in the market with new customers subscribing and existing customers going live on a weekly basis. But before I hand off to Dennis, I'm also excited to share that Manhattan Associates recently won a TrustRadius 2020 firm Tech Cares Award for our corporate social responsibility and ESG initiatives. Our company was specifically recognized for both our commitment to building environmental sustainability into the supply chain and also our employee wellness program. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of our financial performance and outlook, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute extremely well in a challenging macro environment. Now in the quarter, we delivered strong financial results as both our Q3 and year-to-date results compare favorably to the rule of 40 plus Manhattan has solid visibility, and we continue to deliver strong metrics across growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll start with a recap of the quarter with growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Additionally, due to the volatile FX environment, we are also providing constant currency growth to demonstrate apples-to-apples comps. Unless otherwise stated, constant currency will compare results as if rates were unchanged from the year ago period. Total revenue was a record $198 million up 17% as reported and up 21% in constant currency. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, as-reported total revenue was up 23% and 27% in constant currency. Q3 cloud revenue totaled $45 million up 41%. And as Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $970 million, up 69%. Excluding FX, RPO totaled $1.01 billion, up 76% and assumes year ago FX rates. Sequential growth was 10% and assumes FX rates remain unchanged from the June 30 levels. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect RPO to be at the high end of our prior guidepost range of $950 million to $1.05 billion on an as-reported basis and exceed the range, excluding FX. As of September 30, over 97% of our RPO represents true cloud native subscriptions. As Eddie mentioned, Q3 global services revenue was a record $103 million, up 17% and as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Our Q3 operating profit totaled $51 million with adjusted operating margin of roughly 20% and which includes $13 million of incremental performance-based compensation accruals. On a normalized basis, operating margin would be approximately 32%. I'd call that tapping on the door of rule of 50. The quarter's better-than-expected margin performance was driven by revenue growth and operating leverage. Importantly, we continue to invest for future growth. For the quarter, Q3 adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, and GAAP earnings per share totaled $0.47. Turning to cash. Q3 operating cash flow was a solid $40 million, and year-to-date operating cash flow was $124 million. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%. Free cash flow margin was 19% and was impacted by timing of cash taxes paid and accounts receivable billings. As previously discussed, the year-to-date decline in operating cash is solely tied to the incremental cash taxes paid associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that did not impact the year ago period. Year-to-date, we have paid $42 million in cash taxes compared to $18 million over the first 9 months of 2021, with the vast majority of the increase due to the new law. We continue to expect between $25 million and $30 million of additional tax payments in 2022. For more information, I'd refer you to Item 8 in our earnings release supplemental information schedules. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue increased 24% year-over-year to $169 million with subscriptions totaling over 50% of the line item. Similarly, to free cash flow, deferred revenue was impacted by the quarterly fluctuation of cash receipts. Specifically, some customers paid us in Q2 of this year versus Q3 of 2021. And - we ended the quarter with $197 million in cash and zero debt. In the quarter, we invested $50 million in share repurchases and resulting in $150 million in buybacks year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishing of our $70 million share repurchase authority. Now turning to updated 2022 guidance. With our strong year-to-date performance and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2022 outlook on both the top and bottom lines and are on pace to deliver our third consecutive record revenue year. As such, the midpoint of our total revenue range is increasing to $751.5 million representing 13% growth as reported and 16% constant currency. This is up from our prior guidance midpoint of $737 million and 11% growth. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, 2022 growth would be 23% as reported and 26% in constant currency. That's pretty solid. Inclusive of our increased investment in hiring, we continue to anticipate full year adjusted operating margin to be about 25.5% and which is in line with our prior guidance range and ahead of our original margin target of 23.25%. For full year adjusted earnings per share, the midpoint of our range is increasing to $2.44, up from our prior midpoint of $2.37. For GAAP EPS, yes, that's GAAP EPS, the midpoint is moving to $1.72, up from the prior midpoint of $1.65. Note the difference between non-GAAP and GAAP is solely our investment in equity-based compensation. This implies Q4 revenue of $182.5 million, targeting cloud revenue of $47.5 million, services revenue of $93.5 million and maintenance revenue of $32.5 million. Operating margin is targeted at 21.8%, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.49. As previously mentioned on prior calls, our Q4 margin accounts for retail peak seasonality, which traditionally, on a sequential basis, is down from Q3 as customers idle implementations to focus on their busy season. So that covers the 2022 guidance update, and we're going to move to preliminary 2023 parameters. Our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. Please refer to Item 9 on our earnings release for our updated 2022 and 2023 guidepost. We are also reiterating our 2024 guidepost estimates that we published in February, which, on an FX-adjusted basis, should be used as a baseline for our future performance. Note, our published 2024 guidepost have not been adjusted for currency movements. As Eddie highlighted, we are taking a cautious approach to the volatile macro environment, balancing our optimism regarding our large and growing opportunity, strong, resilient demand across our solutions with the uncertain economic outlook. Additionally, we are currently in our budget cycle and will firm up our 2023 parameters on our Q4 call in early February. Accounting for the current FX environment, our preliminary estimate for 2023 total revenue is $800 million to $820 million, representing 16% growth excluding license and maintenance attrition and 8% reported growth at the midpoint. If rates would mean at June 30 levels, our 2023 total revenue range would be $10 million higher or approximately $820 million at the midpoint. For 2023, cloud revenue, we are targeting $230 million to $233 million, representing 35% growth at the midpoint. This compares favorably to our prior guide post midpoint of $230 million that used year-end 2021 FX rates. If rates remained at 2021 levels, the midpoint of our cloud revenue range would increase to $239 million. For RPO, we are targeting a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, representing about 30% growth at the midpoint, which compares favorably to our prior guidepost midpoint of $1.325 billion. Yes, that's $1.325 billion. That used year-end 2021 FX rates. If rates remained at 2021 levels, our RPO range will be about $50 million higher. Additionally, as previously discussed, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or nonlinear bookings throughout the year. Our services demand continues to be fueled by cloud, resulting in solid visibility. In 2023, we are targeting services revenue of $417 million to $425 million, which represents 9% growth at the midpoint, 10% excluding the impact of FX. On attrition to cloud, we expect maintenance revenue to be $115 million to $122 million or a 15% decline at the midpoint and license revenue to be about 1% of total revenue. We expect our adjusted operating margin to be roughly unchanged from our current 2022 projections. While we continue to track ahead of our original margin expectations, the combination of opportunistic investment in our business and hiring supply chain talent as well as attrition to cloud is masking some of the inherent leverage in our model. We expect our effective tax rate to be 21.7% and our diluted share count to be approximately 63.4 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, for 2023 parameters and on an as-reported basis, we expect total revenue x license and maintenance attrition to increase 16%, cloud revenue to increase 35%, services revenue to increase 9%, RPO to increase 30% and for us to achieve 25.5% operating margin. So that comes a very stout financial performance update and outlook. Thank you, and back to Eddie for some closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Great. Thanks, Dennis. Well, look, despite the volatile macro conditions, our global teams are executing extremely well. And we're really encouraged by the resiliency of our business. We're pleased with our results and the strong demand for our solutions really across the world. But most importantly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver success for our customers and help them with their digital transformation. So with that, thanks to everybody for joining the call and to our employees for their great work and dedication. With that, Robert, we'd be happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Pleaser proceed with your question.\nTerrell Tillman: Hi, good afternoon, gentlemen. First, I guess, congrats on GAAP earnings and tapping on the rule of 50.\nEddie Capel: Thank you.\nTerrell Tillman: So a couple of questions. Maybe first, Eddie, for you, we get asked the question a lot about the retail complex in general and e-commerce and just potentially impact on your business. The way I'd like to frame this question is if in retail-related industries in e-commerce, if we're shifting from just trying to sell as much as you can when demand is strong to managing maybe even excess inventory or trying to enhance service level, do the conversations, are they changing in terms of maybe what products you need to lead with and/or just the directional dynamics around their budgets?\nEddie Capel: There's just modest adjustments, Terry, when it comes down to it. I mean I think, obviously, you framed the general dynamic in the market well. But at the end of the day, you still don't get away from retailers really wanting to drive that loyalty and customer satisfaction. So being able to keep the promise is still very, very important to again drive that loyalty and reputation. And of course, we're right in the middle of helping them do that.\nTerrell Tillman: Got it. And I guess maybe a follow-up for you, Eddie, is any more color you could share on the important product cycle around cloud WMS? I think you've given some commentary over the quarters in terms of - given us some crumbs, so to speak, in terms of where you are in either go-lives or just total customer count. Just any more you can share about where you ended at the end of 3Q or how you think about it by the end of the year. And then I had a follow-up for Dennis.\nEddie Capel: Yes. So let's see. We're at about 80 customers under contract, just a couple more than that. I think NAV will us use 80 for a ran number. Still strong demand around the globe, still strong from Tier 1 and strong across industries. We've mentioned before, we've for Eclipse a, frankly, the 100,000 users of WMS under native the Manhattan Active WM subscription. So we just - we continue to be very pleased with that particular product.\nTerrell Tillman: That's great to hear. And I guess, maybe, Dennis, for you in terms of - it was notable to call out across FX, but then also the accrual, I'd like to double-click into that a little bit. So this $13 million was incremental. This was a new accrual in the third quarter, if I'm not mistaken. So otherwise, the margin would have been even stronger than it was. How do we allocate the $13 million? Was some of it up in the cost of revenue or the three OpEx items? Any more you could share on the $13 million? Thank you.\nDennis Story: So we've basically spread that up and down the P&L, Terry, in terms of department structure. And you'll see that in the 10-Q as well, which we probably will be publishing tomorrow.\nTerrell Tillman: Okay, great. Congrats again.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I guess on the 2023 outlook, one of the interesting things is that the maintenance revenue is expected to see an accelerated pace of decline. I guess we've kind of been talking a lot this year about how good new logo interest has been in Active WM. Are you starting to get the indication from the big installed base that those customers are now ready to move at a more aggressive pace? And if that's true, is the potential revenue benefit from that - and understand there's a lot that's uncertain, but is that something that is maybe 2024, 2025 kind of that time frame for getting an inflection in growth?\nEddie Capel: No real change in dynamic there, Joe. But some of the maintenance starts to fall off in 2023. And part of that is for deals, frankly, that we've signed in prior years that we're coming to a point of go-live and that maintenance is start to tail off in 2023. So I appreciate the question. It's a clever one, but there really is no major change in trajectory or dynamic there.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. And then just on the broader approach you took to kind of recalibrating the 2023 numbers. It seems like we have, on one hand, your performance and execution, which has been really good, and it sounds like really no changes in that. And then there's also a macro overlay where you don't want to get ahead of yourself, you want to bake in the uncertainty that's out there. I guess how would you kind of characterize one versus the other as we, investors, approach Manhattan into next year? Is there any sort of historical precedent where you would go back in time and say, In a tougher macro, this is what has been relevant to our business? Or kind of what's kind of the puts and takes on your ability to execute versus the macro?\nEddie Capel: Well, in the - Joe, in the three or four of these twists and turns that I've been through in my 20 years, we've followed a similar pattern. We've managed through the uncertainty. We've always done that pretty well, and we've invested into it. And in general, that will be our strategy regardless of what happens in 2023 and beyond. And the balance here is that we feel very positive and optimistic about our future performance. And frankly, we've looked as deep into the crystal ball as we possibly can, but we still see the glass is a little foggy when we look deep into it. So that's why we're taking sort of a cautious approach. Obviously, we feel great about our balance sheet position going into any turbulent times with cash on the balance sheet, zero debt and so forth. It gives us the flexibility that we need to be able to continue on with that strategy that I alluded to, which is focus on our customers, focus on our people, manage through uncertainty but invest into it.\nJoe Vruwink: And then one quick one, if I may, Eddie, just your comment on kind of investing into uncertainty with the margin outlook kind of being flattish as opposed to getting a bit of improvement. Next year, I'd imagine this is part of it. Any particular areas you think are opportunities for investment?\nEddie Capel: Not particularly. I mean across the portfolio, frankly. We've got some great opportunities across the portfolio and the areas that we've talked about before in terms of expanding our total addressable market.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Joe. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen. Just maybe following up on the margin outlook for next year. Dennis, typically or at least over the last few years, you guys have guided down in terms of the margins. And obviously, you've outperformed and you've executed really well against that. I'm just curious, are we seeing just more leverage now given that the product investments that you've made are maybe more leverageable or updated stance on hiring? I'd just be curious, maybe some qualitative inputs on what went into that.\nDennis Story: Yes. I think we definitely have some leverage opportunity. The other side of the equation is we've got such strong demand. We've got to continue to aggressively hire. So good problems to have there, Brian.\nBrian Peterson: No. Understood. And Eddie, maybe one quick follow-up for you. Just with your 80-or-so active WM customers that you have, how are those - how does this look from a land versus expand perspective? I guess I'm trying to understand are you getting in at a near 100% penetration in terms of the DC footprint? Or is it kind of starting small and you have an expand motion over time?\nEddie Capel: It's a combination, Brian. We're still at about - which is very positive. We're still at about 50-50 in terms of - meaning 50% brand new customers that we've never done business before, 50% existing customers converting. And then when you look at the opportunity to continue to expand our WMS footprint with both those categorizations of customers, it's - there's still plenty of opportunity there for sure.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks Eddie.\nEddie Capel: My pleasure, Brian. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks for taking my question guys. Wanted to ask on the visibility into '23 revenue guidance. So on the cloud side, I would assume that the RPO you have should give you pretty good visibility into that number, but correct me if I'm wrong there. But then on the services side, how much visibility do you have in that? What's the potential variability there, particularly in a weaker macro?\nEddie Capel: You're certainly right about the first. We've got pretty good visibility into cloud revenue based upon deals signed in prior years and so forth. Obviously, we've still got to sign new deals in '23, both for '23 revenue and the years. In terms of services visibility, it's not all contracted work for sure. But we've got visibility into the rollout plans across our product portfolio, across geographies and across industry verticals. And is there an opportunity for some of those things - some of those projects to slow down? I suppose there is. But when you think about the fact that most of them are backed up by irrevocable subscription fees, it does seem like the likelihood that those things will slow down is lesser, number one, in no particular sequence. Number two, we are always considered mission-critical and central to business operations. So when you put those two things together, yes, can never say there isn't any risk, but we feel pretty good about the visibility, Matt.\nMatt Pfau: Great. And just wanted to follow up on your comments around point of sale. I know that in your conference in May, it was a point of emphasis to make sure your customers are aware that you're in that market and have a new product, newer product there. Are you starting to see that materialize? Is that starting to build the pipeline?\nEddie Capel: It seems not just that event but all of the efforts that our team, particularly world-class marketing organization have put in to drive awareness through every avenue that we can gain. It certainly seems to be doing the trick, and our pipeline is building. And I think I mentioned in my prepared comments we're looking forward to a pretty active Q4 from a point-of-sale perspective.\nMatt Pfau: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Matt. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Schappel: Hi, thank you for taking my question. And nice job in the quarter. Eddie, starting with you, based on the strong results, the guidance on the commentary, it appears that you're not seeing much of - any way of a slowdown in your business? Is this the correct way to read this?\nEddie Capel: I think that would be an accurate way to read it, Mark. But look, all of us, both personally and professionally. As I've mentioned before, we use that expression. We've looked as deep into the crystal ball as we can look. And as we look deeper and deeper, the glass is a little cloudy. So we're just applying a little caution to the outlook, too.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Understood. And I appreciate your earlier comments on the active TM product. And is the early success you're seeing coming from any particular industry or geography? I think you spoke earlier about maybe a 50-50 breakdown between new and existing customers. But what about industry or geographies? Are you seeing any particular strength?\nEddie Capel: No, it's - no, it's pretty balanced, Mark. Actually, as I mentioned, we're live on three continents. We've got the fourth in progress. So it gives you a little sense of the geographic dispersion. Europe happens to be pretty strong. I'm not saying it's an outlier but had some strong performance going on in Europe. And across the industry, we've got some good penetration in there, too. So a good start. We're only about five quarters in from the release of the new product, but we feel pretty good about where we are for sure.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. I'll hand it off to someone else.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Terrific Mark. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks, and nice performance, guys. I just wanted to maybe get a little bit more color on the active WMS, the 80 customers. As some of the earliest customers become more seasoned, what's the - kind of what's sort of the dynamic you're seeing in terms of pull-through of other products?\nEddie Capel: Yes. I mean we're certainly seeing nice attach rate for transportation management. That's for sure. We continue to see expanded usage of WMS inside of that footprint. Labor management is a great and sort of obvious add-on into that portfolio as well. And then geographic expansion, where one of our customers or customers might well be starting in one geography and expanding that across the world. So pretty nice footprint expansion across the board there, frankly.\nDennis Story: Yes. Blair, year-to-date, we have 30% of our year-to-date bookings is cross-sell, upsell. That's up from 20% last year, same period.\nEddie Capel: That's across all products but is certainly a big part of it.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay. Excellent. Excellent. And then just, Dennis, a quick one for you. As you kind of look at your 2023 margins and this declining maintenance revenue as the business transitions, I mean, is that - how much of a headwind is that from a margin perspective? And as you kind of look out to more of a three to five-year time frame, does that margin start to climb again?\nDennis Story: Well, if you normalize the margins for license in CSSC, it's about 180 bps of upside from a normalized perspective. So margin model is pretty stout.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay. Okay. Great.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eddie Capel for closing comments.\nEddie Capel: Good. Thank you, Robert, and thanks, everybody, for joining our call today. As you can tell, we're excited about where we are and even more excited about our future, and look forward to updating you on that again in about 90-days or so. Obviously, we won't speak to you between now and then. So I know it's a little early, but happy holidays to you all. Thanks. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter results, discuss our updated full year 2022 outlook and provide some preliminary color on our thinking around 2023. Both Q3 and year-to-date results were record-setting for Manhattan Associates with Q3 total revenue of $198 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.66. Both exceeded our expectations. Demand is strong. Customer satisfaction is solid, and we continue to be the leading innovator in core supply chain execution, omnichannel solutions and retail point-of-sale commerce. And while we remain cautious regarding the global economy, we continue to set aggressive growth and investment goals. This includes strategically allocating capital towards industry-leading innovation, enabling customer success and expanding our addressable market. We expect these efforts to further deliver on our long-term growth and earnings objectives. We remain optimistic on our outlook for the remainder of the year and into 2023. And as such, we're raising our 2020 guidance for both revenue and earnings. Q3 was our sixth consecutive record revenue quarter, highlighted by 41% growth in cloud revenue and 17% growth in services revenue. This encompasses double-digit revenue growth across all of our geographies. These strong results drove our top line at performance and solid earnings leverage in the quarter. Our global teams are exceedingly busy in the field and are executing well for our customers. Following by new product sales and system upgrades, we're experiencing strong services demand and continue to actively recruit into our services team around the world to meet demand and further drive customer satisfaction. And this includes hiring over 500 new team members across our company in the first 9 months of 2022, slightly exceeding our original plans. While we're prudently cautious, we still remain focused on adding additional exceptional talent. Foundational to our growth is Manhattan's ability to deliver industry-leading innovation and services to our customers, a mission-critical Manhattan platform and solutions are differentiated and the key components in our customers' success, providing them with the ability to best serve their end markets, adapt quickly and efficiently to changing market conditions and profitably scale their businesses. These powerful benefits contributed to our strong customer satisfaction levels and 75% plus win rates within the quarter. And despite noticeable FX headwinds, RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 69% to $970 million at the end of Q3. On a constant currency basis, which uses the one year ago FX rates, RPO crossed the $1 billion milestone. Now it's up 76%. Importantly though, demand for our cloud solutions continues to be strong and resilient across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example, the quarter cloud deals included a manufacturer and distributor engineered components, a sporting goods and outdoor recreational retailer, an aerospace and defense company, a grocery retailer, an appliance and electronics manufacturer and a food and beverage company, among many others. Our pipeline continues to be robust with solid demand across our product suites. Net new potential customers represented about 35% of that demand. And year-to-date, new logos have generated a full half of our total bookings. And as I mentioned earlier, our global professional services businesses are all performing very well, posting record revenue results with Q3 revenue up 17%, and we continue to receive high marks for customer satisfaction, conducting well over 100 go-lives in the quarter. While our R&D spend plays to eclipse $100 million this year, let's move to a quick update on our industry-leading solutions, starting with Manhattan Active Transportation Management. Across industries and geographies, we continue to experience strong demand and win rates from Manhattan Active TM. And like Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, Manhattan Active Transportation Management serves the needs of retailers, grocers, the food and beverage industry, pharmaceutical distributors, industrial distributors and many others. And that same principle holds true across geographies with Manhattan Active TM already live on three continents with a fourth in process. Now according to Gartner, the total addressable market for WMS and TMS are approximately the same size and present a significant growth opportunity for Manhattan. Both WMS and TMS markets are large, global and span nearly all industries. In Manhattan active Supply Chain, which comprises of Manhattan Active Warehouse Management and Manhattan Active Transportation Management has launched us the ability to provide leading-edge supply chain technologies to customers across industries and across the globe. And as supply chain practitioners hunger for continuous innovation, a truly cloud-native always current unified solution is uniquely positioned to provide the customers a platform for core development. And as a result, we're seeing a growing number of our Manhattan Active WM customers also subscribe to Manhattan Active Transportation Management. In just five quarters after launching Manhattan Active Transportation Management, we believe this growing attach rate for the solution is further indication that our target markets understand and appreciate the many benefits of supply chain unification. Unlike application integration, which several software vendors can offer, true solution unification can only be achieved by replatforming applications to our truly cloud-native and shared collection of micro services. This state-of-the-art common platform makes this unification possible and gives Manhattan Active Supply Chain applications a clear advantage over the competition. And the great thing about the concept of solution unification is that it works up and down the application stack. Macro unification delivers powerful benefits from the suite level, such as with the Manhattan Active Omni and Manhattan Active Supply Chain, but unification also delivers benefits all the way down to the feature level. Many of our early activating customers are already benefiting from the Manhattan Active WM's combination of warehouse management, labor management, automation, orchestration, yard management, slotting optimization and a number of historically separate applications well built into a unified solution. Now moving to our retail specific capabilities. We continue to progress at a rapid pace, implementing Manhattan Active store solutions across a number of leading retailers. To-date, we have Manhattan Active Solutions running in more than 20,000 stores, enabling over 140,000 daily store users across 70 countries. The point-of-sale continues to be a strategic focus for us, and our message around the importance of running an omnichannel native point of sale continues to resonate. We believe strongly that to achieve omni-channel operational excellence, store systems must be an extension of the retailer's digital platform. Manhattan is the only technology provider who can provide best-in-class capabilities, serving both the digital and the physical store channels, and we continue to add new prospects to our point-of-sale pipeline and anticipate an active Q4 with respect to point-of-sale. So in summary, Manhattan Active Supply Chain continues to be a real force in the market with new customers subscribing and existing customers going live on a weekly basis. But before I hand off to Dennis, I'm also excited to share that Manhattan Associates recently won a TrustRadius 2020 firm Tech Cares Award for our corporate social responsibility and ESG initiatives. Our company was specifically recognized for both our commitment to building environmental sustainability into the supply chain and also our employee wellness program. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of our financial performance and outlook, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So Dennis? Great. Thanks, Dennis. Well, look, despite the volatile macro conditions, our global teams are executing extremely well. And we're really encouraged by the resiliency of our business. We're pleased with our results and the strong demand for our solutions really across the world. But most importantly, we remain confident in our ability to deliver success for our customers and help them with their digital transformation. So with that, thanks to everybody for joining the call and to our employees for their great work and dedication. With that, Robert, we'd be happy to take any questions. Thank you. There's just modest adjustments, Terry, when it comes down to it. I mean I think, obviously, you framed the general dynamic in the market well. But at the end of the day, you still don't get away from retailers really wanting to drive that loyalty and customer satisfaction. So being able to keep the promise is still very, very important to again drive that loyalty and reputation. And of course, we're right in the middle of helping them do that. Yes. So let's see. We're at about 80 customers under contract, just a couple more than that. I think NAV will us use 80 for a ran number. Still strong demand around the globe, still strong from Tier 1 and strong across industries. We've mentioned before, we've for Eclipse a, frankly, the 100,000 users of WMS under native the Manhattan Active WM subscription. So we just - we continue to be very pleased with that particular product. Thank you, Terry. No real change in dynamic there, Joe. But some of the maintenance starts to fall off in 2023. And part of that is for deals, frankly, that we've signed in prior years that we're coming to a point of go-live and that maintenance is start to tail off in 2023. So I appreciate the question. It's a clever one, but there really is no major change in trajectory or dynamic there. Well, in the - Joe, in the three or four of these twists and turns that I've been through in my 20 years, we've followed a similar pattern. We've managed through the uncertainty. We've always done that pretty well, and we've invested into it. And in general, that will be our strategy regardless of what happens in 2023 and beyond. And the balance here is that we feel very positive and optimistic about our future performance. And frankly, we've looked as deep into the crystal ball as we possibly can, but we still see the glass is a little foggy when we look deep into it. So that's why we're taking sort of a cautious approach. Obviously, we feel great about our balance sheet position going into any turbulent times with cash on the balance sheet, zero debt and so forth. It gives us the flexibility that we need to be able to continue on with that strategy that I alluded to, which is focus on our customers, focus on our people, manage through uncertainty but invest into it. Not particularly. I mean across the portfolio, frankly. We've got some great opportunities across the portfolio and the areas that we've talked about before in terms of expanding our total addressable market. Our pleasure, Joe. Thank you. It's a combination, Brian. We're still at about - which is very positive. We're still at about 50-50 in terms of - meaning 50% brand new customers that we've never done business before, 50% existing customers converting. And then when you look at the opportunity to continue to expand our WMS footprint with both those categorizations of customers, it's - there's still plenty of opportunity there for sure. My pleasure, Brian. Thank you. You're certainly right about the first. We've got pretty good visibility into cloud revenue based upon deals signed in prior years and so forth.

Obviously, we won't speak to you between now and then. So I know it's a little early, but happy holidays to you all. Thanks. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute extremely well in a challenging macro environment. Now in the quarter, we delivered strong financial results as both our Q3 and year-to-date results compare favorably to the rule of 40 plus Manhattan has solid visibility, and we continue to deliver strong metrics across growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll start with a recap of the quarter with growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Additionally, due to the volatile FX environment, we are also providing constant currency growth to demonstrate apples-to-apples comps. Unless otherwise stated, constant currency will compare results as if rates were unchanged from the year ago period. Total revenue was a record $198 million up 17% as reported and up 21% in constant currency. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, as-reported total revenue was up 23% and 27% in constant currency. Q3 cloud revenue totaled $45 million up 41%. And as Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $970 million, up 69%. Excluding FX, RPO totaled $1.01 billion, up 76% and assumes year ago FX rates. Sequential growth was 10% and assumes FX rates remain unchanged from the June 30 levels. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect RPO to be at the high end of our prior guidepost range of $950 million to $1.05 billion on an as-reported basis and exceed the range, excluding FX. As of September 30, over 97% of our RPO represents true cloud native subscriptions. As Eddie mentioned, Q3 global services revenue was a record $103 million, up 17% and as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Our Q3 operating profit totaled $51 million with adjusted operating margin of roughly 20% and which includes $13 million of incremental performance-based compensation accruals. On a normalized basis, operating margin would be approximately 32%. I'd call that tapping on the door of rule of 50. The quarter's better-than-expected margin performance was driven by revenue growth and operating leverage. Importantly, we continue to invest for future growth. For the quarter, Q3 adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, and GAAP earnings per share totaled $0.47. Turning to cash. Q3 operating cash flow was a solid $40 million, and year-to-date operating cash flow was $124 million. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%. Free cash flow margin was 19% and was impacted by timing of cash taxes paid and accounts receivable billings. As previously discussed, the year-to-date decline in operating cash is solely tied to the incremental cash taxes paid associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that did not impact the year ago period. Year-to-date, we have paid $42 million in cash taxes compared to $18 million over the first 9 months of 2021, with the vast majority of the increase due to the new law. We continue to expect between $25 million and $30 million of additional tax payments in 2022. For more information, I'd refer you to Item 8 in our earnings release supplemental information schedules. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue increased 24% year-over-year to $169 million with subscriptions totaling over 50% of the line item. Similarly, to free cash flow, deferred revenue was impacted by the quarterly fluctuation of cash receipts. Specifically, some customers paid us in Q2 of this year versus Q3 of 2021. And - we ended the quarter with $197 million in cash and zero debt. In the quarter, we invested $50 million in share repurchases and resulting in $150 million in buybacks year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishing of our $70 million share repurchase authority. Now turning to updated 2022 guidance. With our strong year-to-date performance and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2022 outlook on both the top and bottom lines and are on pace to deliver our third consecutive record revenue year. As such, the midpoint of our total revenue range is increasing to $751.5 million representing 13% growth as reported and 16% constant currency. This is up from our prior guidance midpoint of $737 million and 11% growth. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, 2022 growth would be 23% as reported and 26% in constant currency. That's pretty solid. Inclusive of our increased investment in hiring, we continue to anticipate full year adjusted operating margin to be about 25.5% and which is in line with our prior guidance range and ahead of our original margin target of 23.25%. For full year adjusted earnings per share, the midpoint of our range is increasing to $2.44, up from our prior midpoint of $2.37. For GAAP EPS, yes, that's GAAP EPS, the midpoint is moving to $1.72, up from the prior midpoint of $1.65. Note the difference between non-GAAP and GAAP is solely our investment in equity-based compensation. This implies Q4 revenue of $182.5 million, targeting cloud revenue of $47.5 million, services revenue of $93.5 million and maintenance revenue of $32.5 million. Operating margin is targeted at 21.8%, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.49. As previously mentioned on prior calls, our Q4 margin accounts for retail peak seasonality, which traditionally, on a sequential basis, is down from Q3 as customers idle implementations to focus on their busy season. So that covers the 2022 guidance update, and we're going to move to preliminary 2023 parameters. Our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. Please refer to Item 9 on our earnings release for our updated 2022 and 2023 guidepost. We are also reiterating our 2024 guidepost estimates that we published in February, which, on an FX-adjusted basis, should be used as a baseline for our future performance. Note, our published 2024 guidepost have not been adjusted for currency movements. As Eddie highlighted, we are taking a cautious approach to the volatile macro environment, balancing our optimism regarding our large and growing opportunity, strong, resilient demand across our solutions with the uncertain economic outlook. Additionally, we are currently in our budget cycle and will firm up our 2023 parameters on our Q4 call in early February. Accounting for the current FX environment, our preliminary estimate for 2023 total revenue is $800 million to $820 million, representing 16% growth excluding license and maintenance attrition and 8% reported growth at the midpoint. If rates would mean at June 30 levels, our 2023 total revenue range would be $10 million higher or approximately $820 million at the midpoint. For 2023, cloud revenue, we are targeting $230 million to $233 million, representing 35% growth at the midpoint. This compares favorably to our prior guide post midpoint of $230 million that used year-end 2021 FX rates. If rates remained at 2021 levels, the midpoint of our cloud revenue range would increase to $239 million. For RPO, we are targeting a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, representing about 30% growth at the midpoint, which compares favorably to our prior guidepost midpoint of $1.325 billion. Yes, that's $1.325 billion. That used year-end 2021 FX rates. If rates remained at 2021 levels, our RPO range will be about $50 million higher. Additionally, as previously discussed, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or nonlinear bookings throughout the year. Our services demand continues to be fueled by cloud, resulting in solid visibility. In 2023, we are targeting services revenue of $417 million to $425 million, which represents 9% growth at the midpoint, 10% excluding the impact of FX. On attrition to cloud, we expect maintenance revenue to be $115 million to $122 million or a 15% decline at the midpoint and license revenue to be about 1% of total revenue. We expect our adjusted operating margin to be roughly unchanged from our current 2022 projections. While we continue to track ahead of our original margin expectations, the combination of opportunistic investment in our business and hiring supply chain talent as well as attrition to cloud is masking some of the inherent leverage in our model. We expect our effective tax rate to be 21.7% and our diluted share count to be approximately 63.4 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, for 2023 parameters and on an as-reported basis, we expect total revenue x license and maintenance attrition to increase 16%, cloud revenue to increase 35%, services revenue to increase 9%, RPO to increase 30% and for us to achieve 25.5% operating margin. So that comes a very stout financial performance update and outlook. Thank you, and back to Eddie for some closing remarks. So we've basically spread that up and down the P&L, Terry, in terms of department structure. And you'll see that in the 10-Q as well, which we probably will be publishing tomorrow. Yes. I think we definitely have some leverage opportunity. The other side of the equation is we've got such strong demand. We've got to continue to aggressively hire. So good problems to have there, Brian. Yes. Blair, year-to-date, we have 30% of our year-to-date bookings is cross-sell, upsell. That's up from 20% last year, same period. Well, if you normalize the margins for license in CSSC, it's about 180 bps of upside from a normalized perspective. So margin model is pretty stout."

I'd like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates Q2 Earnings Conference Call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder ladies and gentlemen this call is being recorded today July 26, 2022. I would now like to introduce Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Thank you, Dilem and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates' 2022 second quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2021 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note in particular that turbulent global macro environment could impact our performance and cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Thanks Mike. Well, good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results and discuss the increased outlook that we have for full year 2022. Manhattan delivered a record Q2 and record first half results generating Q2 total revenue of $192 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.69, both exceeding our expectations. Specifically, 48% growth in cloud revenue and 19% growth in services revenue drove a topline outperformance and strong earnings leverage in the quarter. Our global teams are executing very well for our customers and we continue to invest in our people and in R&D. Our consistent investment and unmatched industry expertise are key factors in our continued strong customer satisfaction levels and innovation that differentiates our mission-critical Manhattan Active platform and solutions. The industry-leading innovation that we're delivering to the market is a key component to our customers' success providing them with the ability to adapt quickly and efficiently to changing market conditions and profitably scale their businesses. Frankly, factors that contributed to a 75% win rates in the quarter. Now, despite FX headwinds in Q2, RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 84% to $898 million. Excluding the FX impact due to the strong dollar, RPO totaled $928 million, up 90%. And regardless of any FX movements, we're on pace to exceed our prior outlook of $1 billion in RPO for the second half of this year. Demand for our cloud solutions is strong and broad-based across products, industry verticals, and geographic locations. It also remains robust from both new and existing customers. Similar to Q1, demand from net new customers was particularly strong and contributed 50% of our total bookings in the quarter. And while the mix of bookings will certainly vary on a quarterly basis, we believe that net new customers generating about 55% of our cloud bookings in the first half of the year exemplifies the unique value that we're delivering to the market and a large and growing opportunity. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing, and wholesale, continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. Across our cloud solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter cloud deals one include a manufacturer of recreational vehicles food distribution wholesaler, a Japanese multinational conglomerate that specializes in electronics and industrial products, a specialty retailer of automotive parts, an industrial manufacturer and a large fashion brand as well as a number of others. So, as you can see pretty diverse. And our cloud pipeline continues to be robust with solid demand across our product suites. And net new customers represent about 35% of that demand. On the services front, our global team continues to execute very well conducting well over... [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Please remain on the line. Your conference will resume shortly. [Technical Difficulty]\nDennis Story: I heard the verticals.\nEddie Capel: Okay.\nMichael Bauer: Hi, Dilem?\nOperator: Yes, you're back on.\nMichael Bauer: We're back on. Are we in the public's call, right now?\nOperator: Yes, we are live at the moment.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Very good. All right. Well, everybody, I'm very sorry about the technical difficulties. But I'll pick back up and talk a little bit about our cloud pipeline. I think I had mentioned that the vertical diversity that we experienced in Q2. But our cloud pipeline, I think I mentioned this continues to be robust with solid demand across our product suite. And our net new customers represent about 35% of the demand in our pipeline. And on the services front, our global team continues to execute incredibly well, and they conducted well over 100 go-lives in the quarter. And company-wide, we continue to make really great progress against our hiring. We added over 300 new team members during the first half of the year and expect to be at least 4,000 employees by the conclusion of 2022. These hires will contribute to our ability to meet our future customer needs, grow our market share and extend our addressable market. Now speaking of our team, we are very proud that we were recently voted by them a Top Place to Work in Atlanta for the 10th consecutive year. And we won similar awards this year in India, Australia and Singapore.  I'm also very happy to report that in mid-May we hosted in person our annual customer conference and it really was a great success. Attendance for the event was strong and terrific to see and talk and collaborate with our customers and partners face-to-face about our innovation and product strategy. At the conference, we brought together the industry's top agents of change and we laid out our vision for agile and sustainable supply chain commerce.  So let me spend a moment or two on a couple of the newer product concepts that we rolled out at the event, solution assembly and our Manhattan Active platform developer portal. So, regarding solution assembly. We see this concept as the logical next step for the solution unification strategy that we introduced in 2017.  Now as a reminder solution unification refers to the unique way that we deliver best-in-class order management point-of-sale and customer relationship management into a single unified experience called, Manhattan Active Omni. And this same concept holds true for the unification of active supply chain with warehouse management, transportation management, yard management, automation orchestration and so on. In our Momentum this year, we introduced our customers to the concept of solution assemblies. And assemblies refer to the Manhattan design to develop end-to-end flows which span our major Manhattan Active cloud offerings: Omni, supply chain and inventory.  So let me give you a quick example to illustrate the power of assemblies and the strong cross-selling opportunities within our solutions. Given the challenge that inventory continues to pose, let's review a solution assembly in this area that we specifically demonstrated at Momentum.  By assembling Manhattan Active Allocation and Manhattan Active Omni, we help our fashion and apparel customers maximize margin and sell-through of their own inventory from the time the inventory arrives in the market to the end of the selling season.  The key to this particular assembly is the way that allocation continuously informs order management about the health of every inventory position throughout the supply chain network. And armed with this real-time inventory health data OMS uses the global view of direct-to-consumer demand to proactively reduce inventory positions where they're running heavy and avoid those locations where they're running light.  Assembling, allocation and order management it's really made possible via the unique way that we connect APIs across our cloud deployments. And this out-of-the-box assembly reduces both IT complexity and delivers material revenue margin uplift, in this case for our specialty and apparel customers. Now turning now to one of the other key highlights from momentum, technology. Since we introduced the Manhattan Active platform in 2017 its cloud-native, evergreen and auto-scaling capabilities have delivered game-changing innovation for our customers. And as we've talked about, these technical capabilities have been really important differentiators for our solution across a number of application categories.  Like the functional capabilities of the Manhattan Active applications, our technology in particular the extensibility of our underlying tech platform is vital to our technology-focused customers. So, at Momentum we introduced the Manhattan Active platform developer portal, a self-guided reference tool for the technologists and developers within our customer base.  Now paired with Pro-Active our platform's tool for extending the base behavior of Manhattan Active applications, the developer portal provides technologists with the ability to incorporate our extensive library of APIs into their broader technical landscape. And we believe that the strong demand that we're seeing from Manhattan Active applications reflects the mission-critical and strategic innovation that we continue to develop. Enhancing customer experiences and customer service remains top of mind for leading enterprises. And when combined with the capabilities that we offer around maximizing revenue and profitability of owned inventory, we expect demand for our solutions to remain strong. And that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update, on our financial performance and our enhanced outlook. And then I'll close our prepared remarks, with a brief summary, before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute exceptionally well, as we delivered strong financial results across the board, while significantly investing in the business. We are tracking well compared to the Rule of 40, as top to bottom line we continue to raise the bar in a choppy macro environment, delivering strong quality of earnings that includes growth, profitability, cash flow and great balance sheet metrics. I'll start with a quick recap of the quarter, with growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. So total revenue was a record $192 million, up 16% as reported and up 18% in constant currency. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, as reported total revenue was up 26%. Q2 cloud revenue totaled $42 million, up 48%. We ended the quarter, with RPO of $898 million growing 84% and 11% sequentially. As Eddie mentioned, excluding approximately $30 million in first half FX headwinds, RPO totaled $928 million up 90%. We are well positioned to exceed the high end of our $1 billion RPO outlook, during the second half of this year, of which we estimate $15 million to $20 million in potential FX headwinds. Regarding RPO, we expect to update guideposts on our Q3 earnings call. Q2 services revenue knocked it out of the park passing the century mark, recording $101 million up 19%, as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Our Q2 operating profit totaled $53 million, with adjusted operating margin of 27.5%. And importantly, we continue to invest for future growth. In Q2, revenue growth combined with operating leverage drove the outperformance versus our prior 24% operating margin target for the quarter. This resulted in record Q2 earnings per share of $0.69, up 13% and GAAP EPS was $0.49. Turning to cash is king. Q2 operating cash flow was a solid $53 million up 16%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%, and free cash flow margin was 27%. As we discussed last quarter, our Q2 cash flow absorbed $13 million of incremental cash tax associated with the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that did not impact us a year ago -- in the year-ago period. I refer you to Item eight on our earnings release, for more information on the timing of cash tax payments under this new law. Regarding our balance sheet, let's start with solid. Deferred revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $179 million. We ended the quarter with $214 million in cash and zero debt. In the quarter, we invested $50 million in share repurchases resulting in $100 million in buybacks invested year-to-date. Also our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. Now turning to our updated 2022 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit, top line growth and top quartile operating margins, benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps, of which we are doing. With our strong first half performance, and increasing visibility we are again raising our 2022 outlook. We are raising our total revenue range to $733 million to $741 million, with a $737 million midpoint, representing 11% growth as reported and 14% growth removing FX impacts. This is up from our prior guidance midpoint of $723.5 million and 9% growth. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, growth would be 21% as reported and 24% removing FX. For Q3, we expect total revenue of $183 million to $187 million with $185 million midpoint, delivering 9% growth year-over-year. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, Q3's expected growth at the midpoint is 18% and removing FX growth would be 22%. We are increasing our operating margin range to 25.5% to 25.7%, up from our prior midpoint of 24.5% and our original midpoint of 23.25%. And we have previously highlighted our 2022 operating margin guidance factors in continued investments for growth including hiring talent. Yes, I said we are hiring. Talent retention and performance-based compensation as well as the return of pandemic-impacted expenses such as our in-person Momentum conference as well. Also just a reminder, our margin is also impacted by license and maintenance attrition and customer demand for our cloud solutions. Regarding full year adjusted earnings per share, we are raising the range to $2.35 to $2.39, with a $2.37 midpoint, which is up 9% from our prior midpoint of $2.18. And for GAAP EPS, our guidance range is moving up to $1.63 to $1.67. For Q3, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.56 to $0.58 and GAAP EPS of $0.36 to $0.38, with the difference between adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS, solely representing investment and equity-based compensation. Further drilling down on revenue for the full year 2022, we are increasing our cloud revenue range to $170 million to $172 million, representing 40% growth at the midpoint. We estimate cloud revenue will be approximately $44 million in Q3 and $47 million in Q4 at the midpoint. And for our services revenue, we are increasing our forecast to $382 million to $387 million. At the midpoint, this represents 15% growth and on a quarterly basis represents Q3 services revenue of $101 million and for Q4, $93 million accounting for traditional retail peak seasonality. For maintenance revenue, we are slightly refining our revenue range [Technical Difficulty]\nEddie Capel: Can you hear us, operator?\nOperator: Yes we can. Your line is open sir. You can go ahead.\nEddie Capel: Yes, yes we can.\nDennis Story: Yes. Okay. So I'll just backing it up here a little bit. For maintenance revenue we are slightly refining our revenue range to $135.5 million to $136.5 million at the midpoint for Q3. We anticipate maintenance revenue of $33 million and $32 million in Q4. We expect license revenue to be about 2.5% of total revenue, averaging about $3 million in license revenue per quarter for the remainder of the year. For hardware, we expect about $4 million in Q3 and $5.5 million in Q4. Now moving or shifting to what we do well which is profitability. For consolidated subscription maintenance and services, we expect margin to be about 54% in Q3 and 53% in Q4. For operating margin at the midpoint, we expect about 25% for Q3 and 23% in Q4. Remember, the Q4 sequential decline in margin accounts for retail peak seasonality. All set at the midpoint of our guide, we expect to achieve full year operating margin of 25.6%. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.7% and diluted share count to be approximately 63.5 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. And finally in all caps that covers our resilient financial performance update for Q2 and first half of the year. Thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Yes, perfect. Thanks, Dennis. Well, listen, I apologize again for the technical blips that we may have had during the call. I hope it didn't impede your ability to understand the breadth of our Q2. Because despite the FX drag that we saw in the quarter, we're very pleased with our second quarter results and frankly our year-to-date results. And while we continue to operate in turbulent global -- a turbulent global macro environment, our teams are executing incredibly well and our business momentum remains very positive. Demand for our solutions is strong and our pipelines continue to progress very well as new and existing customers both want to shift to our industry-leading cloud-native applications. So thanks everybody again for joining our call. And also, thank you to our employees for all the fabulous work that you're doing around the globe. With that, Dilem will be happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist. Please go ahead.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah. First, congratulations, and you can't be silent despite a bad conference call operation, so it's good to see the results in there. I guess if it wasn't for currency, you got pretty darn close to even getting the low end of the ending of your RPO. So that was good to see. And thanks for the FX impact color. All right enough of my preamble. One question I was going to ask you Dennis just relates to, there was a pretty meaningful subscription or cloud subscription revenue acceleration in 2Q. It was up to 48%. I know you're not giving any update on guidepost, but like the idea is the way subscription revenue would build, it would actually really accelerate into 2024, if I'm not mistaken. I know you're not giving any updates, but we're already seeing an acceleration in 2Q. How are you thinking about cloud sub revenue and the visibility over the next couple of quarters and into next year?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to hold. Your conference call will resume momentarily. Okay. Mr. Bauer, are you back on?\nMichael Bauer: Terrific. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: All right, Dilem. Well, I think we've concluded the call. We'd be happy to take any questions that might be in the line.\nOperator: Sure. Mr. Tillman, your line is open. Could you please repeat your question?\nTerry Tillman: Yes. And this gives me an opportunity to clean the question up. It was a sloppy question so now I'm going to make it real tight. So Dennis the question is that cloud subscription revenue accelerated actually notably up to 48%. I know you're not changing any of the guideposts across the KPIs. But is there any potential change from what you all were thinking originally about how the cloud sub revenue builds over the next couple of years including the acceleration in 2024?\nDennis Story: I would say we're optimistic about that Terry. But given the guideposts that we provided we're multi-year. We did make it clear that we'll only revise those longer-term estimates on an annual basis. So we're definitely encouraged, but I think we'll defer frankly that question and the answer to the question until the end of the year.\nTerry Tillman: Okay. Got it. Maybe Dennis I'll follow-up for you though on the cash flow. Anything to think about, I mean, I know the seasonality [Technical Difficulty] on expenses and then PS revenue but you had the cash impact the tax cash impact, but you saw a strong cash flow. Any sense on how we think about 3Q and 4Q cash flow? And then I had a final question for Eddie.\nDennis Story: Our cash flow margin will probably be similar to our operating margin right in that range.\nTerry Tillman: For both quarters?\nDennis Story: Yes.\nTerry Tillman: Okay. Cool. And then maybe Eddie just it feels like old days of me wanting to ask about a WMS refresh cycle. And in your case it's -- you've got the cloud innovation that's going to draw people into wanting to do that. Can you give us an update on where you are in terms of customers that are now embarking on the cloud WM strategy? I know you gave us an update over the last couple of quarters. Just where is it building now in terms of how many folks are in process? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Yes, that's a great question. I think it changes on every few days. So I might be off plus or minus one or two. But we're at about 73 customers under contract Terry across, I think, we're either 11 or 12 countries now one of the two. And we're over 40 sites are live across the customer base. We frankly are pretty busy summer season here of go-lives and so forth. So it's definitely very encouraging.\nTerry Tillman: That's great. Nice job. Good luck for the second half. Thanks. \nEddie Capel: Thank you. Thank you, Terry. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian Peterson: Hey, gentlemen, congrats on the strong quarter. So I wanted to unpack the services strength a bit. It was up 19% on an 18% comp. And obviously, the guidance is up for the year. How do you think about the trajectory of that business? I mean, we're all seeing the news in terms of the macro, but obviously the RPO growth is really strong. There just seems to be a lot of crosscurrents out there. So, yes, as we think about maybe the kind of two to three-year outlook for services like how do we think about that in the current macro?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, again from a -- when we think about the two to three-year outlook, Brian, we'll update that at the end of the year. I think updating two or three-year outlooks every couple of quarters might be -- have a bit too much volatility built into it. But having said that as you know we have good visibility into our services demand frankly because of the software sales and\u2026\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to hold. Your call will resume momentarily.  [Technical Difficulty]\nMichael Bauer: Can you guys hear us now?\nOperator: Yes, we can.\nBrian Peterson: Yes. I'm live. Eddie, I can hear you.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Very good. Thank you, Brian. Sorry, sorry about that. So, obviously, services kind of lags a little bit. The software sales we've seen very strong software sales. We see strong demand for our services. You can see that frankly in the hiring profile that we have. We've added 300 people so far this year. We're going to add another couple of hundred at least in the balance of the year to top 4,000 associates. We've got good visibility at the next several quarters from a services demand perspective. And we feel -- obviously we feel terrific about it. There is -- I know there's been, some questions about will the services attach rate be the same for our cloud solutions as they were on-prem. And we've been saying yes to that. And I think now you can actually see that coming to the fore in that services revenue growth.\nBrian Peterson: No. That's great. And Eddie maybe just following up and sorry for double dipping on the macro questions here, but you mentioned the kind of diversification into the verticals. I'd love to get your sense of the health of the diversification of the customer base today maybe versus prior economic challenge periods of that 2009. And I'd love to just hear kind of how the product portfolio has changed? And maybe where in terms of customer exposure or health is different today versus maybe five years ago?\nEddie Capel: Yes. I mean clearly more diversity across verticals for us helps with less exposure and so forth. But in general, even where particular segments of the market might be challenged, there is still a desire to make sure they maximize market share, maximize customer satisfaction and maximize customer retention. And that's what we can help with. So even in a market that tightens up a little bit, there is still obviously competition to ensure that customers are being serviced with inventory, serviced at the levels that they expect and so forth. And those are the areas that we can help. Hence the reason I believe, we continue to see kind of strong demand for both our solutions and our services.\nDennis Story: 50% net new logos, year-to-date.\nEddie Capel: Yeah.\nBrian Peterson: Understood. Thanks guys. Congrats.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMatt Pfau: Hey guys thanks for taking my question and great results. I wanted to ask on the new customers that you added and the strength that you're seeing there. So maybe just what do you think is driving that? And I appreciate that it can change from quarter-to-quarter. And then, when we look at that 50% coming from net new customers and the cloud pipeline is at 35%, does that indicate that your close rates are better with new customers? Or what accounts for that discrepancy? Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Yeah, I think the second piece is just a little bit of variability quarter-by-quarter Matt. So it's not -- there's nothing frankly too analytical to build into that. But in terms of what we think is driving the new logo acquisition overall is really a couple of things. One is we're seeing our penetration into verticals that we've not been as strong in before manufacturing particularly. And that tends to be driven by those manufacturing companies beginning to go direct to consumer, okay and needing the types of sophisticated supply chain capabilities that we offer. Secondly, we are having some pretty good success replacing some older systems of whether it be competitors from the bygone years or takeaway from current competitors again, because of the underlying technology strategy that we have and the advanced capabilities that we're delivering to the market that are frankly needed today.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. And then, just in terms of -- again to switch over to the macro the demand that you're seeing. Obviously some of your retail, customers or prospects could be feeling pressure in their business partly that's driven by inflation and higher cost which your solutions can help solve. Is that playing a role in terms of what products are interested in? Or how they're thinking about adopting your solutions at all?\nEddie Capel: Matt, I would tell you I think that's likely going forward. To-date it's been more focused on how do we -- how do our customers attract and retain and service their customers. And I think their -- I believe their focus certainly is turbulent times approach on making sure that they have great customer loyalty and they have great inventory management. Again, both of those things we can help with.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Thanks. Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Loop Capital. Please, go ahead.\nMark Schappel: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. And nice job on the quarter. Eddie, I was wondering if you could just comment on your point-of-sale solutions or your point-of-sale business during the quarter. If I recall correctly, you started seeing larger projects return to that business a few quarters ago. And I was wondering if that's still the case.\nEddie Capel: Yes, it is. It is. In fact, we had a couple of very nice wins in the quarter, more to come a little bit later, but some very strategic wins across multi-brand -- across our multi-brand conglomerate. Our go-lives are going well. We've seen two or three smaller, granted, 100 150, 250 store chains complete rollout of our point of sale across their entire network. And that in turn, as we've talked about many times, is building some nice momentum for us. So very excited about the opportunity, very excited about the reception. And again, multi-year strategy clearly, but definitely encouraged about where we are.\nMark Schappel: Okay, great. Thank you. And then as a follow-up just to build on an earlier question. I was wondering if you could just comment on what you're seeing, specifically in the retail sector. It just appears from your results and guide that you're not seeing any sign of a slowdown in the year in respect of -- \nEddie Capel: Yes. I mean, the pipelines are strong, demand is strong, win rate is strong and that is, obviously, true on the software side, but the pull-through on the services side is also strong too. And, obviously, what that indicates is that, once software is purchased, our customers are anxious to get that software live and delivering value for them. So we feel pretty good about the demand profile for sure, again, based on the pipeline and the visibility we have for the services business over the next several quarters.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all for me. \nEddie Capel: Thanks. Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of where Blair Abernethy from Rosenblatt Securities. Please, go ahead.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks. Nice quarter guys.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Blair.\nBlair Abernethy: Just first question, just around -- following up on the point-of-sale side of things. I'm just wondering if you can refresh us on your go-to-market here in pursuing new customers in the point-of-sale side. And how much -- or are you relying upon channel partners here? Or what's sort of your strategy with that?\nEddie Capel: No. Our strategy is one of going direct, Blair. So we're direct in the market. Of course, we've got partners who help with implementations and those kinds of things. But our go-to-market strategy is definitely through our direct sales force and that's where we're seeing the success.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay, great. And then, just shifting over to the cloud question -- customers here. So the net new cloud customers are you -- can you give us a sense of what their -- is there an average or sort of range at which they're landing at these new customers? And then after a year, sort of, how those businesses are growing for you?\nEddie Capel: Well, we don't disclose the deal size, Blair, I\u2019m sorry. So I can't comment on that. But in terms of the implementations post sale, they're going well. A, they're going well; and B, as I mentioned I think a little earlier, we've got a very busy summer and fall in front of us. Some really terrific brands, both here in the US and around the world and getting great feedback frankly.\nBlair Abernethy: Great. Thanks very much for your help.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Blair, and thanks for taking the time.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I wanted to go back to macro a little bit. One thing that's been kind of fascinating, we had big supply chain trade shows throughout the spring, summer. Your customer conference was thrown in there. And really every indication we heard throughout that timeframe was supply chain project inquiries going up, year has started stronger than 2021 left off. And that's obviously a big point in contrast to the incremental updates we've been getting from kind of the retail macro where it seems like everything is kind of moderating and a lot of your customers are maybe resetting expectations. How would you maybe characterize the divergence between the two things? And is it maybe the case where a lot of your customers, obviously, realize criticality around supply chain new investments? So, last year was maybe a year of getting budgets ready, vendor assessments in place and now, we're simply moving into the period of allocating these dollars and making the commitments?\nOperator: Sorry. Please continue to standby. Your host will join momentarily. [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Mr. Bauer, I show you're back on? Please remain on the line. Your conference will resume shortly.\nMichael Bauer: Dilem, can you hear?\nOperator: Yes, I hear you now sir. Mr. Bauer, can you hear me?\nMichael Bauer: Dilem, can you hear us?\nOperator: Yes, I can now.\nEddie Capel: You can hear us?\nOperator: Yes, I can hear you. I have Mr. Vruwink still on the line. You may proceed with your question.\nEddie Capel: Well, again, everyone, we certainly very much appreciate your patience this afternoon given the technical difficulties we had. We are very appreciative of your support. We'll be sure not to have any technical difficulties 90 days from now when we look forward to reviewing our Q3 results with you. In the meantime, please enjoy the rest of the summer. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Well, good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results and discuss the increased outlook that we have for full year 2022. Manhattan delivered a record Q2 and record first half results generating Q2 total revenue of $192 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.69, both exceeding our expectations. Specifically, 48% growth in cloud revenue and 19% growth in services revenue drove a topline outperformance and strong earnings leverage in the quarter. Our global teams are executing very well for our customers and we continue to invest in our people and in R&D. Our consistent investment and unmatched industry expertise are key factors in our continued strong customer satisfaction levels and innovation that differentiates our mission-critical Manhattan Active platform and solutions. The industry-leading innovation that we're delivering to the market is a key component to our customers' success providing them with the ability to adapt quickly and efficiently to changing market conditions and profitably scale their businesses. Frankly, factors that contributed to a 75% win rates in the quarter. Now, despite FX headwinds in Q2, RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 84% to $898 million. Excluding the FX impact due to the strong dollar, RPO totaled $928 million, up 90%. And regardless of any FX movements, we're on pace to exceed our prior outlook of $1 billion in RPO for the second half of this year. Demand for our cloud solutions is strong and broad-based across products, industry verticals, and geographic locations. It also remains robust from both new and existing customers. Similar to Q1, demand from net new customers was particularly strong and contributed 50% of our total bookings in the quarter. And while the mix of bookings will certainly vary on a quarterly basis, we believe that net new customers generating about 55% of our cloud bookings in the first half of the year exemplifies the unique value that we're delivering to the market and a large and growing opportunity. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing, and wholesale, continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. Across our cloud solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter cloud deals one include a manufacturer of recreational vehicles food distribution wholesaler, a Japanese multinational conglomerate that specializes in electronics and industrial products, a specialty retailer of automotive parts, an industrial manufacturer and a large fashion brand as well as a number of others. So, as you can see pretty diverse. And our cloud pipeline continues to be robust with solid demand across our product suites. And net new customers represent about 35% of that demand. On the services front, our global team continues to execute very well conducting well over... [Technical Difficulty] Okay. Okay. Very good. All right. Well, everybody, I'm very sorry about the technical difficulties. But I'll pick back up and talk a little bit about our cloud pipeline. I think I had mentioned that the vertical diversity that we experienced in Q2. But our cloud pipeline, I think I mentioned this continues to be robust with solid demand across our product suite. And our net new customers represent about 35% of the demand in our pipeline. And on the services front, our global team continues to execute incredibly well, and they conducted well over 100 go-lives in the quarter. And company-wide, we continue to make really great progress against our hiring. We added over 300 new team members during the first half of the year and expect to be at least 4,000 employees by the conclusion of 2022. These hires will contribute to our ability to meet our future customer needs, grow our market share and extend our addressable market. Now speaking of our team, we are very proud that we were recently voted by them a Top Place to Work in Atlanta for the 10th consecutive year. And we won similar awards this year in India, Australia and Singapore.  I'm also very happy to report that in mid-May we hosted in person our annual customer conference and it really was a great success. Attendance for the event was strong and terrific to see and talk and collaborate with our customers and partners face-to-face about our innovation and product strategy. At the conference, we brought together the industry's top agents of change and we laid out our vision for agile and sustainable supply chain commerce.  So let me spend a moment or two on a couple of the newer product concepts that we rolled out at the event, solution assembly and our Manhattan Active platform developer portal. So, regarding solution assembly. We see this concept as the logical next step for the solution unification strategy that we introduced in 2017.  Now as a reminder solution unification refers to the unique way that we deliver best-in-class order management point-of-sale and customer relationship management into a single unified experience called, Manhattan Active Omni. And this same concept holds true for the unification of active supply chain with warehouse management, transportation management, yard management, automation orchestration and so on. In our Momentum this year, we introduced our customers to the concept of solution assemblies. And assemblies refer to the Manhattan design to develop end-to-end flows which span our major Manhattan Active cloud offerings: Omni, supply chain and inventory.  So let me give you a quick example to illustrate the power of assemblies and the strong cross-selling opportunities within our solutions. Given the challenge that inventory continues to pose, let's review a solution assembly in this area that we specifically demonstrated at Momentum.  By assembling Manhattan Active Allocation and Manhattan Active Omni, we help our fashion and apparel customers maximize margin and sell-through of their own inventory from the time the inventory arrives in the market to the end of the selling season.  The key to this particular assembly is the way that allocation continuously informs order management about the health of every inventory position throughout the supply chain network. And armed with this real-time inventory health data OMS uses the global view of direct-to-consumer demand to proactively reduce inventory positions where they're running heavy and avoid those locations where they're running light.  Assembling, allocation and order management it's really made possible via the unique way that we connect APIs across our cloud deployments. And this out-of-the-box assembly reduces both IT complexity and delivers material revenue margin uplift, in this case for our specialty and apparel customers. Now turning now to one of the other key highlights from momentum, technology. Since we introduced the Manhattan Active platform in 2017 its cloud-native, evergreen and auto-scaling capabilities have delivered game-changing innovation for our customers. And as we've talked about, these technical capabilities have been really important differentiators for our solution across a number of application categories.  Like the functional capabilities of the Manhattan Active applications, our technology in particular the extensibility of our underlying tech platform is vital to our technology-focused customers. So, at Momentum we introduced the Manhattan Active platform developer portal, a self-guided reference tool for the technologists and developers within our customer base.  Now paired with Pro-Active our platform's tool for extending the base behavior of Manhattan Active applications, the developer portal provides technologists with the ability to incorporate our extensive library of APIs into their broader technical landscape. And we believe that the strong demand that we're seeing from Manhattan Active applications reflects the mission-critical and strategic innovation that we continue to develop. Enhancing customer experiences and customer service remains top of mind for leading enterprises. And when combined with the capabilities that we offer around maximizing revenue and profitability of owned inventory, we expect demand for our solutions to remain strong. And that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update, on our financial performance and our enhanced outlook. And then I'll close our prepared remarks, with a brief summary, before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis? Can you hear us, operator? Yes, yes we can. Yes, perfect. Thanks, Dennis. Well, listen, I apologize again for the technical blips that we may have had during the call. I hope it didn't impede your ability to understand the breadth of our Q2. Because despite the FX drag that we saw in the quarter, we're very pleased with our second quarter results and frankly our year-to-date results. And while we continue to operate in turbulent global -- a turbulent global macro environment, our teams are executing incredibly well and our business momentum remains very positive. Demand for our solutions is strong and our pipelines continue to progress very well as new and existing customers both want to shift to our industry-leading cloud-native applications. So thanks everybody again for joining our call. And also, thank you to our employees for all the fabulous work that you're doing around the globe. With that, Dilem will be happy to take any questions. All right, Dilem. Well, I think we've concluded the call. We'd be happy to take any questions that might be in the line. Yes, that's a great question. I think it changes on every few days. So I might be off plus or minus one or two. But we're at about 73 customers under contract Terry across, I think, we're either 11 or 12 countries now one of the two. And we're over 40 sites are live across the customer base. We frankly are pretty busy summer season here of go-lives and so forth. So it's definitely very encouraging. Thank you. Thank you, Terry. Appreciate it. Yes. Well, again from a -- when we think about the two to three-year outlook, Brian, we'll update that at the end of the year. I think updating two or three-year outlooks every couple of quarters might be -- have a bit too much volatility built into it. But having said that as you know we have good visibility into our services demand frankly because of the software sales and... Okay. Very good. Thank you, Brian. Sorry, sorry about that. So, obviously, services kind of lags a little bit. The software sales we've seen very strong software sales. We see strong demand for our services. You can see that frankly in the hiring profile that we have. We've added 300 people so far this year. We're going to add another couple of hundred at least in the balance of the year to top 4,000 associates. We've got good visibility at the next several quarters from a services demand perspective. And we feel -- obviously we feel terrific about it. There is -- I know there's been, some questions about will the services attach rate be the same for our cloud solutions as they were on-prem. And we've been saying yes to that. And I think now you can actually see that coming to the fore in that services revenue growth. Yes. I mean clearly more diversity across verticals for us helps with less exposure and so forth. But in general, even where particular segments of the market might be challenged, there is still a desire to make sure they maximize market share, maximize customer satisfaction and maximize customer retention. And that's what we can help with. So even in a market that tightens up a little bit, there is still obviously competition to ensure that customers are being serviced with inventory, serviced at the levels that they expect and so forth. And those are the areas that we can help. Hence the reason I believe, we continue to see kind of strong demand for both our solutions and our services. Yeah. Thank you, Brian. Yes. Yeah, I think the second piece is just a little bit of variability quarter-by-quarter Matt. So it's not -- there's nothing frankly too analytical to build into that. But in terms of what we think is driving the new logo acquisition overall is really a couple of things. One is we're seeing our penetration into verticals that we've not been as strong in before manufacturing particularly. And that tends to be driven by those manufacturing companies beginning to go direct to consumer, okay and needing the types of sophisticated supply chain capabilities that we offer. Secondly, we are having some pretty good success replacing some older systems of whether it be competitors from the bygone years or takeaway from current competitors again, because of the underlying technology strategy that we have and the advanced capabilities that we're delivering to the market that are frankly needed today. Matt, I would tell you I think that's likely going forward. To-date it's been more focused on how do we -- how do our customers attract and retain and service their customers. And I think their -- I believe their focus certainly is turbulent times approach on making sure that they have great customer loyalty and they have great inventory management. Again, both of those things we can help with. Thanks. Thank you, Matt. Yes, it is. It is. In fact, we had a couple of very nice wins in the quarter, more to come a little bit later, but some very strategic wins across multi-brand -- across our multi-brand conglomerate. Our go-lives are going well. We've seen two or three smaller, granted, 100 150, 250 store chains complete rollout of our point of sale across their entire network. And that in turn, as we've talked about many times, is building some nice momentum for us. So very excited about the opportunity, very excited about the reception. And again, multi-year strategy clearly, but definitely encouraged about where we are. Yes. I mean, the pipelines are strong, demand is strong, win rate is strong and that is, obviously, true on the software side, but the pull-through on the services side is also strong too. And, obviously, what that indicates is that, once software is purchased, our customers are anxious to get that software live and delivering value for them. So we feel pretty good about the demand profile for sure, again, based on the pipeline and the visibility we have for the services business over the next several quarters. Thanks. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Blair. No. Our strategy is one of going direct, Blair. So we're direct in the market. Of course, we've got partners who help with implementations and those kinds of things. But our go-to-market strategy is definitely through our direct sales force and that's where we're seeing the success. Well, we don't disclose the deal size, Blair, I'm sorry. So I can't comment on that. But in terms of the implementations post sale, they're going well. A, they're going well; and B, as I mentioned I think a little earlier, we've got a very busy summer and fall in front of us. Some really terrific brands, both here in the US and around the world and getting great feedback frankly. Our pleasure, Blair, and thanks for taking the time. You can hear us? Well, again, everyone, we certainly very much appreciate your patience this afternoon given the technical difficulties we had. We are very appreciative of your support. We'll be sure not to have any technical difficulties 90 days from now when we look forward to reviewing our Q3 results with you. In the meantime, please enjoy the rest of the summer. Thank you."

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "I heard the verticals. Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute exceptionally well, as we delivered strong financial results across the board, while significantly investing in the business. We are tracking well compared to the Rule of 40, as top to bottom line we continue to raise the bar in a choppy macro environment, delivering strong quality of earnings that includes growth, profitability, cash flow and great balance sheet metrics. I'll start with a quick recap of the quarter, with growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. So total revenue was a record $192 million, up 16% as reported and up 18% in constant currency. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, as reported total revenue was up 26%. Q2 cloud revenue totaled $42 million, up 48%. We ended the quarter, with RPO of $898 million growing 84% and 11% sequentially. As Eddie mentioned, excluding approximately $30 million in first half FX headwinds, RPO totaled $928 million up 90%. We are well positioned to exceed the high end of our $1 billion RPO outlook, during the second half of this year, of which we estimate $15 million to $20 million in potential FX headwinds. Regarding RPO, we expect to update guideposts on our Q3 earnings call. Q2 services revenue knocked it out of the park passing the century mark, recording $101 million up 19%, as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Our Q2 operating profit totaled $53 million, with adjusted operating margin of 27.5%. And importantly, we continue to invest for future growth. In Q2, revenue growth combined with operating leverage drove the outperformance versus our prior 24% operating margin target for the quarter. This resulted in record Q2 earnings per share of $0.69, up 13% and GAAP EPS was $0.49. Turning to cash is king. Q2 operating cash flow was a solid $53 million up 16%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%, and free cash flow margin was 27%. As we discussed last quarter, our Q2 cash flow absorbed $13 million of incremental cash tax associated with the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that did not impact us a year ago -- in the year-ago period. I refer you to Item eight on our earnings release, for more information on the timing of cash tax payments under this new law. Regarding our balance sheet, let's start with solid. Deferred revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $179 million. We ended the quarter with $214 million in cash and zero debt. In the quarter, we invested $50 million in share repurchases resulting in $100 million in buybacks invested year-to-date. Also our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. Now turning to our updated 2022 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit, top line growth and top quartile operating margins, benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps, of which we are doing. With our strong first half performance, and increasing visibility we are again raising our 2022 outlook. We are raising our total revenue range to $733 million to $741 million, with a $737 million midpoint, representing 11% growth as reported and 14% growth removing FX impacts. This is up from our prior guidance midpoint of $723.5 million and 9% growth. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, growth would be 21% as reported and 24% removing FX. For Q3, we expect total revenue of $183 million to $187 million with $185 million midpoint, delivering 9% growth year-over-year. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, Q3's expected growth at the midpoint is 18% and removing FX growth would be 22%. We are increasing our operating margin range to 25.5% to 25.7%, up from our prior midpoint of 24.5% and our original midpoint of 23.25%. And we have previously highlighted our 2022 operating margin guidance factors in continued investments for growth including hiring talent. Yes, I said we are hiring. Talent retention and performance-based compensation as well as the return of pandemic-impacted expenses such as our in-person Momentum conference as well. Also just a reminder, our margin is also impacted by license and maintenance attrition and customer demand for our cloud solutions. Regarding full year adjusted earnings per share, we are raising the range to $2.35 to $2.39, with a $2.37 midpoint, which is up 9% from our prior midpoint of $2.18. And for GAAP EPS, our guidance range is moving up to $1.63 to $1.67. For Q3, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.56 to $0.58 and GAAP EPS of $0.36 to $0.38, with the difference between adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS, solely representing investment and equity-based compensation. Further drilling down on revenue for the full year 2022, we are increasing our cloud revenue range to $170 million to $172 million, representing 40% growth at the midpoint. We estimate cloud revenue will be approximately $44 million in Q3 and $47 million in Q4 at the midpoint. And for our services revenue, we are increasing our forecast to $382 million to $387 million. At the midpoint, this represents 15% growth and on a quarterly basis represents Q3 services revenue of $101 million and for Q4, $93 million accounting for traditional retail peak seasonality. For maintenance revenue, we are slightly refining our revenue range [Technical Difficulty] Yes. Okay. So I'll just backing it up here a little bit. For maintenance revenue we are slightly refining our revenue range to $135.5 million to $136.5 million at the midpoint for Q3. We anticipate maintenance revenue of $33 million and $32 million in Q4. We expect license revenue to be about 2.5% of total revenue, averaging about $3 million in license revenue per quarter for the remainder of the year. For hardware, we expect about $4 million in Q3 and $5.5 million in Q4. Now moving or shifting to what we do well which is profitability. For consolidated subscription maintenance and services, we expect margin to be about 54% in Q3 and 53% in Q4. For operating margin at the midpoint, we expect about 25% for Q3 and 23% in Q4. Remember, the Q4 sequential decline in margin accounts for retail peak seasonality. All set at the midpoint of our guide, we expect to achieve full year operating margin of 25.6%. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.7% and diluted share count to be approximately 63.5 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. And finally in all caps that covers our resilient financial performance update for Q2 and first half of the year. Thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks. I would say we're optimistic about that Terry. But given the guideposts that we provided we're multi-year. We did make it clear that we'll only revise those longer-term estimates on an annual basis. So we're definitely encouraged, but I think we'll defer frankly that question and the answer to the question until the end of the year. Our cash flow margin will probably be similar to our operating margin right in that range. Yes. 50% net new logos, year-to-date."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates Quarter One Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, April 26. I would now like to introduce Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Thank you, Leah and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates 2022 first quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2021 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note in particular that uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You will find a reconciliation schedule in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now, I will turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Good. Thanks Mike. Well, good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter results and discuss our increased full year 2022 outlook. Manhattan Associates is off to a strong start in 2022. We are reporting record results. Our Q1 total revenue increased 14% to $179 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 40% to $0.60 and both of these metrics exceeded our expectations. Our global teams are busy and are executing very well for our customers, resulting in very strong customer satisfaction, broad revenue outperformance and earnings leverage. And furthermore, our investment in innovation and our people continues to payoff as product differentiation between Manhattan and other supply chain software vendors is widening. And this differentiation contributed to our 75% win rates in the quarter and the growing demand for our industry leading mission-critical cloud solutions. In Q1, RPO, which tends to be the leading indicator for growth, increased 92% to $810 million and we are tracking well towards achieving the $1 billion RPO milestone later this year. Demand for our cloud offerings remains strong across products, industry verticals and geographic locations. Demand also remains robust from both new and existing customers. And while the mix of bookings will certainly vary on a quarterly basis, in Q1, over half of our contracted bookings came from net new customers, showcasing the unique value that we bring to the market and the runway that\u2019s in front of us. And from a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter, but drilling in the sub-verticals are pretty diverse and include apparel, department stores, home furnishings, grocery, consumer goods, manufacturing as well as durable and non-durable goods. Our pipeline also remains robust with solid demand across all of our product suites. Over 90% of our pipeline consists of cloud opportunities, probably you would expect with net new potential customers representing about 35% of that demand. And with strong business momentum and our forward revenue visibility improving, we are going to be increasing our 2022 revenue and earnings guidance and Dennis will cover those details in a moment. On the services front, our team continues to execute very well, conducting about 100 go-lives in the quarter. And our global teams are also making really good progress against our goal of adding about 500 net new employees this year. In Q1, we added about 120 talented individuals from Manhattan family and have a large new plant scheduled to begin in Q2 as well. Across our organization, these hires will contribute to our ability to meet the future needs of our customers, grow our market share and extend our addressable market. So now, let\u2019s move on to a short update on some of our products. And I\u2019d like to start with an update on our store fulfillment application part of our Manhattan Active Omni suite. A wide range of retail brands use store fulfillment to power their ship from store, pick up in store, curbside and same-day delivery customer experiences. The solution is flexible enough to scale down to support individual order picking in the boutiques of some of the world\u2019s best-known luxury retailers. But it also can scale up to power team picking, allowing dozens of associates to pick orders in department stores and other large footprint retail formats. And beyond its industry leading functionality, the platform independent nature of the application allows it to be used across a variety of form factors and operating systems with our customers mixing and matching windows in either iOS or Android. And that solution stands apart in the market for its functional depth, its platform flexibility, and of course, the fact that it can be deployed in conjunction with our point-of-sale application, delivering a mobile-first cloud-native and omnichannel-enabled experience for all store associates. And we are happy to report that each and everyday, more than 18,000 stores across the globe use our store fulfillment application to deliver best-in-class delivery experiences for consumers worldwide. And speaking of stores and our point-of-sale application specifically, we continue to activate more stores across more retailers in 2022. Point-of-sale remains a key strategic initiative for us and we are making solid progress on our journey to being the world\u2019s leading retail point-of-sale provider. Now, I provided a more exhaustive update on Manhattan Active Warehouse Management in the last quarter\u2019s update. So I will keep my remarks on this flagship application, a little more concise this quarter. Suffice to say though we continue to see very strong interest and adoption for Manhattan Active WM, the cloud-native WMS that we launched in May of 2020. This quarter saw a number of additional go-lives, including several high-volume, highly complex distribution centers, and the applications feature-richness, intuitive mobile application and ability to automatically scale in periods of peak workload set it apart in the market. And these factors have combined to deliver a competitive win rate with Manhattan Active WM, unlike anything we have seen in our 32-year history. And turning now to the other foundational element of Manhattan Active supply chain, that\u2019s Manhattan Active Transportation Management. In Q1, we were once again named to the Leaders quadrant in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for TMS. And this results \u2013 this result marks the fourth consecutive year to be named a leader in the transportation industry\u2019s most respective landscape report. And in addition to recognition from the industry analysts, Q1 was another strong quarter from an execution perspective for Manhattan Active TM. We continue to add new cloud customers across a diverse industry base and some of our early subscribing customers are now coming live with the solution. And as a testament to our geographic diversity of our TMS customer base, our first go-live for Manhattan Active TM was actually the largest drugstore retail chain in Latin America. And the power of our unified supply chain offering is resonating around the globe, helping drive TMS pipeline and customer acquisition both in the Americas and in Europe. Speaking in the Americas, kind of interesting, we have recently signed a strategic SaaS agreement with a large home improvement retailer. And as part of the project, this customer will migrate their existing on-premise deployments of WMS, TMS, OMS and our demand forecasting inventory optimization solutions to the cloud. And one of the unique benefits of our completely rewritten truly cloud-native applications is how easy it is for our customers to use adjacent solutions, because the solutions are now evergreen and it\u2019s relatively easy for us to design and maintain flows connecting the Manhattan Active applications. And I will close out my product remarks by mentioning Momentum, our annual customer conference. And thankfully, for the first time since 2019, we plan to be back together in-person. This year we will be in Hollywood, Florida, one of our favorite venues and the theme for this year\u2019s conference is Assemble, Agents of Change. And we will bring that theme to life in several ways, aside from the obvious advantage of being able to assemble in-person again this year, we\u2019ll also be demonstrating the unique advantages that we deliver when we assemble multiple applications at Manhattan Active applications together, a flexible and powerful Manhattan Active architecture empowers our customers and partners to easily unify solutions to take our market leading applications and extend them to do even more and drive positive change for their business and their customers. And before I hand it off to Dennis, I am also excited to share that we have recently launched our ESG website and published metrics for years 2020 and 2021. Manhattan is committed to providing clear communication to all of our stakeholders and we encourage you to view these materials to better understand our commitment to the environment, how we support a diverse and inclusive workplace, and our efforts to strengthen the communities in which we live and work. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of our financial performance and outlook, and then I\u2019ll close our prepared remarks with a very brief summary before we move on to Q&A. So, Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie and hats off to our Manhattan strong global teams who continue to execute exceptionally well. We delivered strong financial results across the board, while significantly investing in the business. All 3 major geos were in the money, Americas, EMEA and APAC delivered double-digit top line growth and double-digit operating profit growth. Our growth, profitability and cash flow metrics continue to be solid. I will start with a quick recap of the quarter with growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Total revenue was a record $179 million, up 14%. This included 2 points of FX headwind excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 20%. Q1 cloud revenue totaled $37 million, up 40%. We ended the quarter with RPO of $810 million, growing 92% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. As an FYI, as of March 31, 2022, over 97% of our RPO is cloud-native subscriptions. As Eddie highlighted, demand continues to be broad and robust, well positioning us to achieve the $1 billion RPO milestone this year. Services set a new Q1 revenue record of $90 million, up 12%. How about them apples? As cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Cloud and services revenue combined represented 71% of our total revenue in the quarter. Our Q1 operating profit totaled $48 million, with adjusted operating margin of 26.9%, up 420 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth, combined with operating leverage as our cloud business scales. This resulted in record Q1 earnings per share of $0.60, up 40% and GAAP EPS was $0.48, up 37%. Turning to cash, Q1 operating cash flow was a solid $32 million. We absorbed $25 million related to 2021 bonus compensation payout and 2022 merit compensation increases. Overall, this resulted in a 28% adjusted EBITDA margin and 17% free cash flow margin. Our balance sheet is rock solid with $216 million in cash and zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position, investing our full $50 million share repurchase authority in the quarter. Given the strength of our balance sheet, solid cash collections and increasing visibility, our Board has increased our share repurchase authority to $75 million. So on to 2022 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. With our strong start to the year and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2022 outlook. As a reminder, it is our intention to only update our multiyear guidepost on an annual basis. In today\u2019s earnings release showcases the guidepost we originally published in conjunction with our Q4 call. For 2022 total revenue, we now expect a range of $720 million to $727 million, with a $723.5 million midpoint representing 9% year-over-year growth, up from our prior midpoint guidance of $708 million. For Q2, we expect total revenue of $178 million to $182 million. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, we estimate 19% growth for full year and Q2 representing sound underlying growth fundamentals. For operating margin, we are increasing our range to 24.2% to 24.8% up from our prior range of 23% to 24%, and we continue to target 75 to 125 basis points of operating margin expansion per year beginning in 2023. As highlighted on our Q4 call, 2022 operating margin guidance incorporates the following: an impact of 300 basis points from license and maintenance attrition on customer demand for our cloud solutions; 250 basis points of investment for talent hiring and retention; and 200 basis points of additional investment in our business, including the return of pandemic-impacted expenses. Yes, we are investing in the business. Regarding full year adjusted EPS, we are raising the range to $2.14 to $2.22, with a $2.18 midpoint, which is up from our prior $2.04 estimate. For GAAP EPS, our guidance range is moving up to $1.45 to $1.53. For Q2, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 and GAAP EPS of $0.33 to $0.35 with the difference between adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS solely representing investment in equity-based compensation. I\u2019ll now provide some additional color for full year 2022. This is good stuff. We are increasing our cloud revenue range to $167 million to $170 million, representing 38% growth at the $168.5 million midpoint. We estimate cloud revenue will be approximately $40.5 million in Q2 and that it will increase to $43.5 million in Q3 and $47 million in Q4. That\u2019s precision target volume there. For services revenue, we are increasing our forecast of $375 million to $379 million, representing 13% growth at the $377 million midpoint. We estimate Q2 services revenue of $96 million, $98.5 million in Q3 and to account for retail peak seasonality, $92 million in Q4. For maintenance revenue, we are slightly refining our revenue range lower to $134 million to $135 million as customers convert to cloud. For Q2, we estimate maintenance revenue of $34 million for Q3 $33 million and about $32 million in Q4. Overall, by end of year 2022, we expect license revenue to be about 2% of total revenue averaging about $3 million in license revenue per quarter for the remainder of the year. And for hardware, we expect about $6 million in revenue per quarter. Yes, I said $3 million in license per quarter versus $6 million from our hardware team. Clearly, demand has shifted to cloud. Moving to profitability. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services, we expect margin to be about 54% for the remaining quarters of 2022. For operating margin, we are estimating about 24% for Q2 and Q3 and 23% in Q4, as timing of investments in hiring, marketing and pandemic-related expenses will push to the second half of the year. All said, though, we expect to achieve full year operating margin of 24.5%. Turning to operating cash flow. Starting January 1, 2022, as most of you are aware, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires the capitalization of R&D for tax purposes. I refer you to item nine in our supplemental schedules. We anticipate the newly enacted tax legislation to increase this year\u2019s cash income taxes paid by approximately $30 million to $35 million compared to 2021 of which about $15 million will be paid in Q2 with the remainder paid evenly over Q3 and Q4. While there is still a possibility that legislation will be enacted that defers or eliminates the requirement to capitalize these costs, our current outlook factors in higher cash taxes as we will be required to make these payments unless the existing law is amended. To be clear, this legislation does not impact earnings per share and it does not create any incremental expense obligation and, importantly, does not impact our ability to operationally grow cash flow. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.7% and diluted share count to be approximately 64 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So that covers a super fantastic Q1 performance. Thanks to all Manhattan Associates, and thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well, we are very pleased with our strong start to 2022, and our record Q1 results. A more turbulent global macro environment persists, we continue to perform very well and feel like we\u2019re very well positioned for future growth. So in summary, Manhattan is the industry leader offering world-class technology. Demand is strong, the competitive environment is favorable and that pipeline has continued to progress very well as new and existing customers want to shift to our industry-leading cloud-native applications that are scalable, versionless and extensible. So, thank you to everyone joining the call and thank you to our employees for all the great work that you are doing around the planet. Leah, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist. Sir, your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: Good afternoon, Eddie, Dennison, Mike. Basically 2.5 questions, Eddie, it\u2019s great to hear about the WMS win rate. I think best in 32 years, that\u2019s not bad statement. Dennis, the precision modeling, you\u2019ve effectively done our models for us for each quarter, so thank you for that. Yes, first question is after that preamble is in terms of the RPO mix and the strength in RPO in the quarter, I guess, Eddie, it reminds me of coming out of the global financial crisis, we saw a WMS replacement cycle. Maybe an update on \u2013 is that what we\u2019re seeing again a WS replacement cycle or is this just more kind of company-specific around the cloud innovation theme you have?\nEddie Capel: I think it\u2019s a bit of both, Terry. I mean look, we have a product that\u2019s been anchored for, if you will, by the industry for a long, long time, specifically being able to get access to new innovation much faster. You combine that with the continued transition to digital supply chains, the need for speed agility, faster delivery times, a great deal of flexibility inside of the four walls of the distribution center blending man and machine, meaning automation and robotics. And it calls to be \u2013 those facilities calls to be operated by today\u2019s modern flexible warehouse management systems. And so there is a combination of both of those things going on, I think.\nTerry Tillman: Okay. Got it. And I guess maybe, Dennis, a follow-up questions is just it is notable to hear about the new logo activity, 50% of, I guess, contracted bookings. Do those have a different profile in terms of deal sizes as they come in, new customers for the first time? Do they tend to be smaller and then it\u2019s expanding over time or do those deal sizes compare to existing customers just doing more? And then I wanted to follow-up on free cash flow for the year given the cash taxes.\nEddie Capel: Well, I\u2019ll take the new customer logo and Dennis, you\u2019ll take the free cash flow. No, the deal sizes for the new logo customers, there is no discernible difference between new customers and deals with existing customers. To state the obvious, the \u2013 it\u2019s fantastic to get new logos into the family. As you know, historically, two-thirds of our new software business each quarter comes from the existing customer base where we cross sell and upsell. So being able to get new logos into the family that we believe that will provide future revenue opportunity for us is really fantastic and very exciting.\nTerry Tillman: That\u2019s great. Dennis, I was just going to ask about you gave us the good color on cash taxes, it\u2019s going to be larger in 2Q, and then I guess it\u2019s evened out at a small level in 3Q, 4Q, is there any kind of guidepost you could give us on how we think about free cash flow margin for the year? Does it build from the first quarter level? Just any more color on how to think about cash flow? Thank you and congrats.\nDennis Story: I think it will build through the back end of the year and start to normalize and track pretty close to the operating margin profile. Second half operating margin.\nTerry Tillman: Thank you.\nDennis Story: Yes, thank you, Terry.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink of Baird. Sir, your line is open.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I wanted to go back to the strategic SaaS deal where you\u2019re migrating a full on-prem suite to the new active platform. What sort of opportunity does that represent within your existing installed base or maybe not even share of customers that are using every offering, but any sense of maybe customers that use more than one on-prem product today and what this could represent?\nEddie Capel: Not metric, frankly, Joe, but the point we were making, of course, now we have these as their known evergreen applications, they are versionless, which makes the seamless integration and the cross-sell and upsell and the integration of one application with another, frankly, a good bit easier than it\u2019s done in decades past. And so frankly, the purpose of highlighting that was just to make it clear that, that really is an exciting avenue for us with both existing customers and new customers that procure more than one solution originally.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. There was a big supply chain trade event in your backyard about a month ago down in Atlanta. And two big takeaways it seemed to me, one was just the emphasis on TMS, really, it seemed like across the industry. And then the second was achieving a better integration between your online storefront activity or shopping cart and actually having that in for \u2013 you\u2019re picking operations on the floor. I\u2019d imagine how your cloud product is architected, you\u2019re well suited to address both opportunities. Are you starting to see some of the TMS as a category, but maybe some of these more advanced use cases actually attract customers your way? And is maybe some of this filtering into why the new logo participation is stepping up for you?\nEddie Capel: Most definitely on question number one. Honestly, not so much on the new logo acquisition, that\u2019s kind of spread across individual products and various different initiatives. So, I couldn\u2019t say that it would be wrong for me to say there is a concentration on \u2013 around modern unification in the new logos. But that obviously is a great opportunity for us to reach into in the future. But back to the original question, most certainly, integrated WMS and fully integrated seamless WMS and TMS has been the holy grail for a long, long time. And the seamless integration of OMS and WMS is also, as you pointed out, very important in today\u2019s world to provide the responsiveness to the consumer, both on the forward part of the fulfillment cycle, but also when adjustments need to be made. How late in the cycle can consumers still make adjustments to orders, whether it would be quantities, items, shipping destinations and so forth. And when you have got an order management system that is very tightly integrated with the warehouse management system and the capability to be able to make all these late order changes and so forth, you have really got a differentiating offer for the consumer.\nJoe Vruwink: Alright. Great. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks gentlemen and congrats on the RPO number. So first one, Eddie, I just wanted to hear on the big win with the large home improvement retailer. Obviously, they bought a lot of products from you at once. I am just curious, is that a common theme that you see in the later-stage pipeline now that you have kind of the multi-tenant cloud portfolio or would you still expect maybe one or two? I am just kind of curious where the appetite is from customers there?\nEddie Capel: Yes. So, it\u2019s an interesting one. So, that\u2019s an existing customer that they have all those products from our portfolio in their landscape. But they didn\u2019t buy them all at once, right. They had acquired those on-prem solutions. I forget the exact sequence, but they acquired them along the way. They build up that portfolio and now they are transitioning or migrating them all to the cloud. In terms of multiproduct purchases, honestly, there aren\u2019t that many of them. And we have talked about this a little bit before. And the primary reason for that is most of our systems take quite a bit of implementation. And usually, to take on two or two product implementations all at one time is a pretty heavy lift. Now, what happens in the way the conversation goes as we are selling frankly, pick your product, whether it would be WMS, TMS, OMS, or whatever it is, we are setting out a roadmap. It may not be for purchase today, but we are setting out a roadmap to get to those products and those complementary products in the future.\nBrian Peterson: Got it. Eddie, and maybe a follow-up just on Europe. I am curious what you guys are seeing in bookings or maybe the late-stage pipeline. Not trying to get too granular, but obviously, there is a lot of turmoil in the region. Just anything that you can share in terms of deal activity or pipeline?\nEddie Capel: That is \u2013 yes, pretty strong. pretty strong, Brian. EMEA had a very nice quarter. Pipeline looks frankly, even stronger for the balance of the year and obviously, there is very difficult times going on in Eastern Europe and Europe overall. But to be honest with you, it\u2019s not impacting our business at all.\nBrian Peterson: Good to hear. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMatt Pfau: Hi guys. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first just ask is we have seen perhaps the mix of retail between e-commerce and bricks and mortar perhaps normalize a bit as we have come out of the pandemic. Has that impacted which products you are seeing more demand for within your customer base?\nEddie Capel: It really hasn\u2019t, Matt. The one thing and we have sort of talked about this a little bit over the last 12 months or so. We have seen omni and order management pick back up, but that\u2019s obvious because it was super quiet in 2020 when those stores were closed and so forth. So, that\u2019s really been the only change. But it\u2019s a back to normal phenomenon versus a shift, I would say.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. Okay. And then how should we think about the strong performance you are having in your professional services business relative to the commentary about cloud applications being easier to implement and evergreen that sort of commentary would almost make you think that you would need less professional services, but obviously, that segment is performing quite well.\nEddie Capel: Well, we are showing quite a bit of software, Matt. That\u2019s really what it comes down to. And regardless of whether it is implemented in the cloud, which almost all of our software is now or on-premise, those solutions still have to be designed. They still have to be integrated. They still have to be tested. The change management still has to be performed, certainly the technical aspects of how you deploy or nuanced a little different. But still plenty of work to be done there and demand is strong for both us and our partners, frankly.\nDennis Story: Yes. And we are guiding to about 13% growth year-over-year. So, very strong demand.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Just last one for me on the win rates with Active WM being at record levels. Is that the same competitive set that you would see with your on-prem product? Are you seeing different competitors there? Just anything that is different from a competition perspective?\nEddie Capel: No. Pretty much the same competitive landscape, Matt. Things shift around us just a little bit here and there and they adjust modestly geo-by-geo, but really no change.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nDennis Story: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel of Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nMark Schappel: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Also congrats on the RPO number, the RPO front.\nEddie Capel: Thank you.\nMark Schappel: Just Eddie, building on an earlier question with respect to your new customer additions. Are these new customers typically coming from your core verticals such as like retail and apparel, or are you starting to see more and more customers come from different industries?\nEddie Capel: Yes. It\u2019s a pretty good balance, Mark. But there is no question that we are seeing more business come from manufacturing and wholesale. And look, at the end of the day, whilst a lot of those companies are still categorized rightly as manufacturers and wholesalers. They are selling direct to consumers today. And they haven\u2019t done for in the previous slide. So, as soon as any one of those companies start selling direct-to-consumer. To us, they look at awful lot like a retailer, right. They have got a \u2013 obviously, the order size is way different. The number of destinations they are shipping to is way different. They have got to deal with payments direct. And frankly, for them, goodness for bid, they have got to deal with all those dirty things like returns and so forth, they didn\u2019t have to deal with before. And they just look like a lot like a retailer, which obviously our strength, we have got a pretty good strength in that vertical and it\u2019s very helpful.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then Eddie, based on your prepared remarks, it appears that you are on plan or the company is on plan with respect to the aggressive hiring plans you had set for the year. Many companies that we talked to are having some difficulty on that front. And I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit about that and maybe what you are doing differently to\u2026?\nEddie Capel: Yes, sure. I don\u2019t know what we might be doing differently, frankly, but we are certainly putting a lot of effort into hiring and recruiting. And we feel like that people \u2013 individuals like to work for winners. So, that\u2019s a real arrow in a quiver, I know I do, frankly. And we have exciting customers to work alongside. We have the most modern technology that is available in the \u2013 certainly in the supply chain space. We have global opportunities and our compensation levels are pretty competitive. So, with all those things combined, we think we have a pretty attractive proposition here. We got an incredible team. We have got an incredible culture, incredible diversity. And it\u2019s \u2013 I am probably a little biased here, Mark, but I think it\u2019s a pretty fun environment to work in.\nMark Schappel: With that RPO front, I think you have a right to be biased. Well, thanks. That\u2019s helpful.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Blair Abernethy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks very much and nice quarter, gentlemen. I just want to ask a little bit more \u2013 dig a little more into the new logos, the mix. I just want to understand, are these coming from primarily North America, or are you seeing now that you have got a predominantly cloud offering, are you getting more international interest in the platform? And are you reaching out to these new customers directly or are partners stepping up and helping you there?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Let\u2019s see a few questions there. Look, we have a great partner community and their influence is terrific. We get some introductions through partners. Certainly, nothing is handed to us on a plate. We have got to win under any circumstances on our own merits. But the partner community is fantastic and has been serving \u2013 helping us and serving our customers really, really, really well. With regard to geographic reach, honestly, it hasn\u2019t changed a great deal. About 80% of our businesses in the Americas and about 20% is international. It does bounce around a little bit, but holds reasonably steady around those metrics. And as I mentioned before, the verticals, we are seeing more reach into manufacturing and wholesale than maybe we have seen in prior years. But the summary of all of that is a pretty good balance player across the geographies, across the product portfolios, across the tiers and across vertical industries.\nBlair Abernethy: Great. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: My pleasure, Blair. Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Eddie Capel, President and CEO of Manhattan Associates.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Terrific. Thank you, Leah, and thank you, everybody, for joining us to listen to the Q1 earnings call. We look forward to continuing to focus on our customers, focus on our people and focus on innovation and reporting out on those things about 90 days from now. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Good. Thanks Mike. Well, good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter results and discuss our increased full year 2022 outlook. Manhattan Associates is off to a strong start in 2022. We are reporting record results. Our Q1 total revenue increased 14% to $179 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 40% to $0.60 and both of these metrics exceeded our expectations. Our global teams are busy and are executing very well for our customers, resulting in very strong customer satisfaction, broad revenue outperformance and earnings leverage. And furthermore, our investment in innovation and our people continues to payoff as product differentiation between Manhattan and other supply chain software vendors is widening. And this differentiation contributed to our 75% win rates in the quarter and the growing demand for our industry leading mission-critical cloud solutions. In Q1, RPO, which tends to be the leading indicator for growth, increased 92% to $810 million and we are tracking well towards achieving the $1 billion RPO milestone later this year. Demand for our cloud offerings remains strong across products, industry verticals and geographic locations. Demand also remains robust from both new and existing customers. And while the mix of bookings will certainly vary on a quarterly basis, in Q1, over half of our contracted bookings came from net new customers, showcasing the unique value that we bring to the market and the runway that's in front of us. And from a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter, but drilling in the sub-verticals are pretty diverse and include apparel, department stores, home furnishings, grocery, consumer goods, manufacturing as well as durable and non-durable goods. Our pipeline also remains robust with solid demand across all of our product suites. Over 90% of our pipeline consists of cloud opportunities, probably you would expect with net new potential customers representing about 35% of that demand. And with strong business momentum and our forward revenue visibility improving, we are going to be increasing our 2022 revenue and earnings guidance and Dennis will cover those details in a moment. On the services front, our team continues to execute very well, conducting about 100 go-lives in the quarter. And our global teams are also making really good progress against our goal of adding about 500 net new employees this year. In Q1, we added about 120 talented individuals from Manhattan family and have a large new plant scheduled to begin in Q2 as well. Across our organization, these hires will contribute to our ability to meet the future needs of our customers, grow our market share and extend our addressable market. So now, let's move on to a short update on some of our products. And I'd like to start with an update on our store fulfillment application part of our Manhattan Active Omni suite. A wide range of retail brands use store fulfillment to power their ship from store, pick up in store, curbside and same-day delivery customer experiences. The solution is flexible enough to scale down to support individual order picking in the boutiques of some of the world's best-known luxury retailers. But it also can scale up to power team picking, allowing dozens of associates to pick orders in department stores and other large footprint retail formats. And beyond its industry leading functionality, the platform independent nature of the application allows it to be used across a variety of form factors and operating systems with our customers mixing and matching windows in either iOS or Android. And that solution stands apart in the market for its functional depth, its platform flexibility, and of course, the fact that it can be deployed in conjunction with our point-of-sale application, delivering a mobile-first cloud-native and omnichannel-enabled experience for all store associates. And we are happy to report that each and everyday, more than 18,000 stores across the globe use our store fulfillment application to deliver best-in-class delivery experiences for consumers worldwide. And speaking of stores and our point-of-sale application specifically, we continue to activate more stores across more retailers in 2022. Point-of-sale remains a key strategic initiative for us and we are making solid progress on our journey to being the world's leading retail point-of-sale provider. Now, I provided a more exhaustive update on Manhattan Active Warehouse Management in the last quarter's update. So I will keep my remarks on this flagship application, a little more concise this quarter. Suffice to say though we continue to see very strong interest and adoption for Manhattan Active WM, the cloud-native WMS that we launched in May of 2020. This quarter saw a number of additional go-lives, including several high-volume, highly complex distribution centers, and the applications feature-richness, intuitive mobile application and ability to automatically scale in periods of peak workload set it apart in the market. And these factors have combined to deliver a competitive win rate with Manhattan Active WM, unlike anything we have seen in our 32-year history. And turning now to the other foundational element of Manhattan Active supply chain, that's Manhattan Active Transportation Management. In Q1, we were once again named to the Leaders quadrant in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for TMS. And this results \u2013 this result marks the fourth consecutive year to be named a leader in the transportation industry's most respective landscape report. And in addition to recognition from the industry analysts, Q1 was another strong quarter from an execution perspective for Manhattan Active TM. We continue to add new cloud customers across a diverse industry base and some of our early subscribing customers are now coming live with the solution. And as a testament to our geographic diversity of our TMS customer base, our first go-live for Manhattan Active TM was actually the largest drugstore retail chain in Latin America. And the power of our unified supply chain offering is resonating around the globe, helping drive TMS pipeline and customer acquisition both in the Americas and in Europe. Speaking in the Americas, kind of interesting, we have recently signed a strategic SaaS agreement with a large home improvement retailer. And as part of the project, this customer will migrate their existing on-premise deployments of WMS, TMS, OMS and our demand forecasting inventory optimization solutions to the cloud. And one of the unique benefits of our completely rewritten truly cloud-native applications is how easy it is for our customers to use adjacent solutions, because the solutions are now evergreen and it's relatively easy for us to design and maintain flows connecting the Manhattan Active applications. And I will close out my product remarks by mentioning Momentum, our annual customer conference. And thankfully, for the first time since 2019, we plan to be back together in-person. This year we will be in Hollywood, Florida, one of our favorite venues and the theme for this year's conference is Assemble, Agents of Change. And we will bring that theme to life in several ways, aside from the obvious advantage of being able to assemble in-person again this year, we'll also be demonstrating the unique advantages that we deliver when we assemble multiple applications at Manhattan Active applications together, a flexible and powerful Manhattan Active architecture empowers our customers and partners to easily unify solutions to take our market leading applications and extend them to do even more and drive positive change for their business and their customers. And before I hand it off to Dennis, I am also excited to share that we have recently launched our ESG website and published metrics for years 2020 and 2021. Manhattan is committed to providing clear communication to all of our stakeholders and we encourage you to view these materials to better understand our commitment to the environment, how we support a diverse and inclusive workplace, and our efforts to strengthen the communities in which we live and work. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of our financial performance and outlook, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a very brief summary before we move on to Q&A. So, Dennis? Terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well, we are very pleased with our strong start to 2022, and our record Q1 results. A more turbulent global macro environment persists, we continue to perform very well and feel like we're very well positioned for future growth. So in summary, Manhattan is the industry leader offering world-class technology. Demand is strong, the competitive environment is favorable and that pipeline has continued to progress very well as new and existing customers want to shift to our industry-leading cloud-native applications that are scalable, versionless and extensible. So, thank you to everyone joining the call and thank you to our employees for all the great work that you are doing around the planet. Leah, we are now ready to take questions. I think it's a bit of both, Terry. I mean look, we have a product that's been anchored for, if you will, by the industry for a long, long time, specifically being able to get access to new innovation much faster. You combine that with the continued transition to digital supply chains, the need for speed agility, faster delivery times, a great deal of flexibility inside of the four walls of the distribution center blending man and machine, meaning automation and robotics. And it calls to be \u2013 those facilities calls to be operated by today's modern flexible warehouse management systems. And so there is a combination of both of those things going on, I think. Well, I'll take the new customer logo and Dennis, you'll take the free cash flow. No, the deal sizes for the new logo customers, there is no discernible difference between new customers and deals with existing customers. To state the obvious, the \u2013 it's fantastic to get new logos into the family. As you know, historically, two-thirds of our new software business each quarter comes from the existing customer base where we cross sell and upsell. So being able to get new logos into the family that we believe that will provide future revenue opportunity for us is really fantastic and very exciting. Not metric, frankly, Joe, but the point we were making, of course, now we have these as their known evergreen applications, they are versionless, which makes the seamless integration and the cross-sell and upsell and the integration of one application with another, frankly, a good bit easier than it's done in decades past. And so frankly, the purpose of highlighting that was just to make it clear that, that really is an exciting avenue for us with both existing customers and new customers that procure more than one solution originally. Most definitely on question number one. Honestly, not so much on the new logo acquisition, that's kind of spread across individual products and various different initiatives. So, I couldn't say that it would be wrong for me to say there is a concentration on \u2013 around modern unification in the new logos. But that obviously is a great opportunity for us to reach into in the future. But back to the original question, most certainly, integrated WMS and fully integrated seamless WMS and TMS has been the holy grail for a long, long time. And the seamless integration of OMS and WMS is also, as you pointed out, very important in today's world to provide the responsiveness to the consumer, both on the forward part of the fulfillment cycle, but also when adjustments need to be made. How late in the cycle can consumers still make adjustments to orders, whether it would be quantities, items, shipping destinations and so forth. And when you have got an order management system that is very tightly integrated with the warehouse management system and the capability to be able to make all these late order changes and so forth, you have really got a differentiating offer for the consumer. Thank you, Joe. Yes. So, it's an interesting one. So, that's an existing customer that they have all those products from our portfolio in their landscape. But they didn't buy them all at once, right. They had acquired those on-prem solutions. I forget the exact sequence, but they acquired them along the way. They build up that portfolio and now they are transitioning or migrating them all to the cloud. In terms of multiproduct purchases, honestly, there aren't that many of them. And we have talked about this a little bit before. And the primary reason for that is most of our systems take quite a bit of implementation. And usually, to take on two or two product implementations all at one time is a pretty heavy lift. Now, what happens in the way the conversation goes as we are selling frankly, pick your product, whether it would be WMS, TMS, OMS, or whatever it is, we are setting out a roadmap. It may not be for purchase today, but we are setting out a roadmap to get to those products and those complementary products in the future. That is \u2013 yes, pretty strong. pretty strong, Brian. EMEA had a very nice quarter. Pipeline looks frankly, even stronger for the balance of the year and obviously, there is very difficult times going on in Eastern Europe and Europe overall. But to be honest with you, it's not impacting our business at all. Thank you, Brian. It really hasn't, Matt. The one thing and we have sort of talked about this a little bit over the last 12 months or so. We have seen omni and order management pick back up, but that's obvious because it was super quiet in 2020 when those stores were closed and so forth. So, that's really been the only change. But it's a back to normal phenomenon versus a shift, I would say. Well, we are showing quite a bit of software, Matt. That's really what it comes down to. And regardless of whether it is implemented in the cloud, which almost all of our software is now or on-premise, those solutions still have to be designed. They still have to be integrated. They still have to be tested. The change management still has to be performed, certainly the technical aspects of how you deploy or nuanced a little different. But still plenty of work to be done there and demand is strong for both us and our partners, frankly. No. Pretty much the same competitive landscape, Matt. Things shift around us just a little bit here and there and they adjust modestly geo-by-geo, but really no change. Thank you. Yes. It's a pretty good balance, Mark. But there is no question that we are seeing more business come from manufacturing and wholesale. And look, at the end of the day, whilst a lot of those companies are still categorized rightly as manufacturers and wholesalers. They are selling direct to consumers today. And they haven't done for in the previous slide. So, as soon as any one of those companies start selling direct-to-consumer. To us, they look at awful lot like a retailer, right. They have got a \u2013 obviously, the order size is way different. The number of destinations they are shipping to is way different. They have got to deal with payments direct. And frankly, for them, goodness for bid, they have got to deal with all those dirty things like returns and so forth, they didn't have to deal with before. And they just look like a lot like a retailer, which obviously our strength, we have got a pretty good strength in that vertical and it's very helpful. Yes, sure. I don't know what we might be doing differently, frankly, but we are certainly putting a lot of effort into hiring and recruiting. And we feel like that people \u2013 individuals like to work for winners. So, that's a real arrow in a quiver, I know I do, frankly. And we have exciting customers to work alongside. We have the most modern technology that is available in the \u2013 certainly in the supply chain space. We have global opportunities and our compensation levels are pretty competitive. So, with all those things combined, we think we have a pretty attractive proposition here. We got an incredible team. We have got an incredible culture, incredible diversity. And it's \u2013 I am probably a little biased here, Mark, but I think it's a pretty fun environment to work in. Thank you, Mark. Yes. Let's see a few questions there. Look, we have a great partner community and their influence is terrific. We get some introductions through partners. Certainly, nothing is handed to us on a plate. We have got to win under any circumstances on our own merits. But the partner community is fantastic and has been serving \u2013 helping us and serving our customers really, really, really well. With regard to geographic reach, honestly, it hasn't changed a great deal. About 80% of our businesses in the Americas and about 20% is international. It does bounce around a little bit, but holds reasonably steady around those metrics. And as I mentioned before, the verticals, we are seeing more reach into manufacturing and wholesale than maybe we have seen in prior years. But the summary of all of that is a pretty good balance player across the geographies, across the product portfolios, across the tiers and across vertical industries. My pleasure, Blair. Thank you. Okay. Terrific. Thank you, Leah, and thank you, everybody, for joining us to listen to the Q1 earnings call. We look forward to continuing to focus on our customers, focus on our people and focus on innovation and reporting out on those things about 90 days from now. Thanks a lot."

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Thanks, Eddie and hats off to our Manhattan strong global teams who continue to execute exceptionally well. We delivered strong financial results across the board, while significantly investing in the business. All 3 major geos were in the money, Americas, EMEA and APAC delivered double-digit top line growth and double-digit operating profit growth. Our growth, profitability and cash flow metrics continue to be solid. I will start with a quick recap of the quarter with growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Total revenue was a record $179 million, up 14%. This included 2 points of FX headwind excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 20%. Q1 cloud revenue totaled $37 million, up 40%. We ended the quarter with RPO of $810 million, growing 92% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. As an FYI, as of March 31, 2022, over 97% of our RPO is cloud-native subscriptions. As Eddie highlighted, demand continues to be broad and robust, well positioning us to achieve the $1 billion RPO milestone this year. Services set a new Q1 revenue record of $90 million, up 12%. How about them apples? As cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Cloud and services revenue combined represented 71% of our total revenue in the quarter. Our Q1 operating profit totaled $48 million, with adjusted operating margin of 26.9%, up 420 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth, combined with operating leverage as our cloud business scales. This resulted in record Q1 earnings per share of $0.60, up 40% and GAAP EPS was $0.48, up 37%. Turning to cash, Q1 operating cash flow was a solid $32 million. We absorbed $25 million related to 2021 bonus compensation payout and 2022 merit compensation increases. Overall, this resulted in a 28% adjusted EBITDA margin and 17% free cash flow margin. Our balance sheet is rock solid with $216 million in cash and zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position, investing our full $50 million share repurchase authority in the quarter. Given the strength of our balance sheet, solid cash collections and increasing visibility, our Board has increased our share repurchase authority to $75 million. So on to 2022 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. With our strong start to the year and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2022 outlook. As a reminder, it is our intention to only update our multiyear guidepost on an annual basis. In today's earnings release showcases the guidepost we originally published in conjunction with our Q4 call. For 2022 total revenue, we now expect a range of $720 million to $727 million, with a $723.5 million midpoint representing 9% year-over-year growth, up from our prior midpoint guidance of $708 million. For Q2, we expect total revenue of $178 million to $182 million. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, we estimate 19% growth for full year and Q2 representing sound underlying growth fundamentals. For operating margin, we are increasing our range to 24.2% to 24.8% up from our prior range of 23% to 24%, and we continue to target 75 to 125 basis points of operating margin expansion per year beginning in 2023. As highlighted on our Q4 call, 2022 operating margin guidance incorporates the following: an impact of 300 basis points from license and maintenance attrition on customer demand for our cloud solutions; 250 basis points of investment for talent hiring and retention; and 200 basis points of additional investment in our business, including the return of pandemic-impacted expenses. Yes, we are investing in the business. Regarding full year adjusted EPS, we are raising the range to $2.14 to $2.22, with a $2.18 midpoint, which is up from our prior $2.04 estimate. For GAAP EPS, our guidance range is moving up to $1.45 to $1.53. For Q2, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 and GAAP EPS of $0.33 to $0.35 with the difference between adjusted EPS and GAAP EPS solely representing investment in equity-based compensation. I'll now provide some additional color for full year 2022. This is good stuff. We are increasing our cloud revenue range to $167 million to $170 million, representing 38% growth at the $168.5 million midpoint. We estimate cloud revenue will be approximately $40.5 million in Q2 and that it will increase to $43.5 million in Q3 and $47 million in Q4. That's precision target volume there. For services revenue, we are increasing our forecast of $375 million to $379 million, representing 13% growth at the $377 million midpoint. We estimate Q2 services revenue of $96 million, $98.5 million in Q3 and to account for retail peak seasonality, $92 million in Q4. For maintenance revenue, we are slightly refining our revenue range lower to $134 million to $135 million as customers convert to cloud. For Q2, we estimate maintenance revenue of $34 million for Q3 $33 million and about $32 million in Q4. Overall, by end of year 2022, we expect license revenue to be about 2% of total revenue averaging about $3 million in license revenue per quarter for the remainder of the year. And for hardware, we expect about $6 million in revenue per quarter. Yes, I said $3 million in license per quarter versus $6 million from our hardware team. Clearly, demand has shifted to cloud. Moving to profitability. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services, we expect margin to be about 54% for the remaining quarters of 2022. For operating margin, we are estimating about 24% for Q2 and Q3 and 23% in Q4, as timing of investments in hiring, marketing and pandemic-related expenses will push to the second half of the year. All said, though, we expect to achieve full year operating margin of 24.5%. Turning to operating cash flow. Starting January 1, 2022, as most of you are aware, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires the capitalization of R&D for tax purposes. I refer you to item nine in our supplemental schedules. We anticipate the newly enacted tax legislation to increase this year's cash income taxes paid by approximately $30 million to $35 million compared to 2021 of which about $15 million will be paid in Q2 with the remainder paid evenly over Q3 and Q4. While there is still a possibility that legislation will be enacted that defers or eliminates the requirement to capitalize these costs, our current outlook factors in higher cash taxes as we will be required to make these payments unless the existing law is amended. To be clear, this legislation does not impact earnings per share and it does not create any incremental expense obligation and, importantly, does not impact our ability to operationally grow cash flow. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.7% and diluted share count to be approximately 64 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So that covers a super fantastic Q1 performance. Thanks to all Manhattan Associates, and thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks. I think it will build through the back end of the year and start to normalize and track pretty close to the operating margin profile. Second half operating margin. Yes, thank you, Terry. Yes. And we are guiding to about 13% growth year-over-year. So, very strong demand. Thank you, Matt."

At this time, I would like to welcome everybody to Manhattan Associates' Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, the call is being recorded today, January 30, 2024. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Okay. Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates' 2023 fourth quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding the future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are not guarantees of future performance, and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note that turbulent global macro environment could impact our performance and cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Thanks Mike. Good afternoon, everybody, and a belated happy New Year. And thanks for joining us as we review our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 as well as provide our outlook for 2024. So 2023 was a very successful year for Manhattan, setting new records in total revenue, RPO, operating profit, free cash flow and earnings per share. And to drive future growth and innovation, we also invested record amounts in our people and in research and development. In 2023, we increased our headcount by about 10%, and our R&D investment was over $125 million. Now for perspective, over the past five years, we've invested over $0.5 billion in R&D across mission-critical commerce and supply chain technology solutions. And this level of consistent commitment is really unmatched in our industry and is one of the Manhattan's important differentiators. And given the size of the opportunity and growing demand, we're committed to increasing these investments in 2024 and beyond. These investments will also contribute to our industry-leading levels of customer satisfaction, growing our addressable market and extending our position as the leading innovator in supply chain execution, omnichannel and point-of-sale solutions. Now while we remain appropriately cautious regarding the global economy, our business fundamentals are solid, and we're optimistic about our long-term market opportunity. Like prior years, we're entering 2024 with good visibility and benefiting from several growth drivers, which include the acquisition of new customers, conversions of on-premise customers to cloud and cross-selling our growing unified product portfolio. So pivoting to our quarterly results, Q4 was a record quarter that frankly exceeded our expectations. Revenue increased 20% as reported to $238 million, highlighted by 38% growth in cloud, 19% growth in services and double-digit revenue growth across all of our geographies. These strong results drove top-line outperformance and solid earnings leverage in the quarter with adjusted earnings per diluted share increasing 27% to $1.03. RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 36% to $1.4 billion at the end of 2023. Customer satisfaction levels are high and win rates remain at about 75% with demand for our cloud solutions continuing to be solid across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter and across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. And the following is just a sample of some of the cloud deals we won this quarter: an industrial automation and energy management conglomerate, an airline, a fast-food restaurant chain, a sporting goods retailer, a health care and supplies company, and a specialty retailer, as well as a number of others. And this quarter's wins contributed to a healthy mix of bookings across sub-verticals for the full year. Additionally, and aided by secular tailwinds and the clear benefit of resilient, modern supply chains, roughly one third of our total bookings were generated from new logos for the full year 2023. Our pipeline continues to be strong with solid demand across our product suites. Net new potential customers represent about 35% of that demand, and we have significant conversion opportunity, as we enter 2024 with over 85% of our on-premise customers yet to begin their migration to our cloud solutions. For this quarter's brief product update, I'd like to start with three exciting announcements that we made at the National Retail Federation Conference in mid-January, two of which have to do with a pretty large step forward with our Manhattan Active Omni applications, and the third is an important new partnership for us. So starting with the product enhancements, this quarter, we announced general availability of Iris, the next big step forward for our store associate app. Running on top of Manhattan Active Omni \u2013 our Manhattan Active Omni platform, Iris offers unmatched transactional performance, resiliency that\u2019s purpose built for the connectivity issues inherent in store networks and a great new associate experience design. And we believe that Iris is the first cloud-native point-of-sale truly designed and built to offer the next best of both worlds, continuous innovation in the form of quarter releases and onboard resiliency to handle centralized cloud deployments at scale. Many of our customers face ongoing battles to provide fast and reliable network connectivity to every register in every store. And Iris insulates the store associate from the whims of networks, offering unmatched checkout performance, whether the device is connected, partially disconnected or completely offline. And Iris also offers a great new visual experience for the store associates, seamlessly blending the three Cs of a best-in-class point-of-sale system: card, catalog and customer. Iris empowers store associates to maximize sales conversion rates in the store, the ability to sell both what\u2019s in the physical store and what\u2019s in the broader supply chain in a single transaction, ensuring every possible sale is converted. Furthermore, the highly visual customer profile within Iris empowers a store associate to truly deliver a personalized selling experience. Staying with retail store just for a moment, our point-of-sale system performed incredibly well during this recent holiday selling period with about 30,000 retail associates using our solution and customer transaction volumes exceeding any other cloud-native point-of-sale solution in the market. Now at NRF, we also highlighted our fulfillment experience insight dashboard. This capability is unique to Manhattan Active Omni and allows our omnichannel customers to compare their fulfillment performance against their peers and competitors. A key omnichannel fulfillment experience metrics like click-to-deliver, order rejection rates, pick up in store penetration percentage and abandonment rates, among others, that display dynamically for each of our customers. And we built this capability so that our Manhattan Active Omni customers can understand exactly how they stack up against the field. Fulfillment experience insights lays out these metrics for them in a clear and comprehensive manner. And frankly, armed with this information, our professional services team members can provide corresponding process and technology recommendations to help move these metrics forward in the right direction over time. And we were \u2013 finally, we're also excited to announce our new partnership with Shopify. Over the last several years, we've witnessed Shopify surfacing more and more often in our Manhattan Active Omni prospect and customer base. And we thought the time was right to team up with Shopify to offer the market end-to-end omnichannel commerce solutions. Shopify shares our vision of providing solution which lower purchase friction, increase conversion and improve transparency and reliability during the fulfillment process. And for our customers, both Manhattan and Shopify are focused on delivering functionality-rich solutions, which can be implemented on time and on budget and we start delivering value immediately for them. We believe that in the near to medium term, the market will further emphasize total cost of ownership and lower project risk and the Manhattan Active Omni and Shopify partnership is well-suited to deliver on both of these. Now speaking of partners, I\u2019m proud to report that we finished 2023 by adding a record number of new partners to our Manhattan Value Partner or MVP program. Whether it's SaaS providers like Shopify or Adient, transportation visibility providers like FourKites or project44 or Shippeo, or material handling and robotics vendors for use within the four walls of the DC, Manhattan Active platform applications are easy to connect and offer our partners access to a world-class customer base. And we continue to \u2013 we'll continue to add and strengthen our relationships with premier third-party integration and advisory firms as well. Our network of technology and consulting partners help us connect with the broader market of target customers and improve the speed and success of our deployments. So next quarter, I'll likely focus my product updates within our Manhattan Active supply chain execution suite. But for now, I'll simply mention that we continue to see strong demand and deal activity for our market-leading unified supply chain execution offering consisting basically of WMS and TMS. This demand is coming from across the globe and across the industries. And finally, throughout 2024, we'll also continue to update you on the progress that our R&D team is making as we incorporate the latest generative AI technologies into our supply chain and omnichannel retail solutions. So in summary, 2023 was a terrific year for Manhattan and we're very excited for the numerous opportunities that lie ahead to deliver simply world-class innovation into a growing customer base. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of financial performance for 2023 and our outlook for 2024. And then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we before we move on to Q&A. So Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. As Eddie highlighted, in 2023, we set all-time records in RPO, total revenue, operating profit, free cash flow and earnings per share. So a big shout out to 4,600 team members across the globe, great execution through the year. For both the quarter and the year, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance on top line growth and operating margin. Both our Q4 and full year results exceeded expectations and compare favorably to the Rule of 50. And if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance attrition, our performance is even stronger. Importantly, Manhattan continues to deliver strong, consistent results across revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll start with recapping our financial performance for the quarter and year. Regarding FX, it was a one-point tailwind to Q4 revenue growth and did not impact our full year revenue growth rate. For RPO, FX was a one-point tailwind to both year-over-year and sequential growth. Now to our results. All growth rates are on an as-reported year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. For Q4, total revenue, total revenue was up 238 or was $238 million, up 20%, and full year revenue totaled $929 million, up 21%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the revenue compression by our Cloud transition, Q4 revenue growth was 24% and full year 28%, some nice double-digit returns here. Q4 Cloud revenue totaled $71 million, up 38% with full year revenue totaling $255 million, up 44%. We closed out 2023 with RPO of $1.4 billion growing 36% year-over-year and 8% sequentially as we experienced strength from across our Manhattan Active Suite of products. Excluding FX impacts, RPO exceeded the high end of our $1.4 billion outlook by $13 million, which was stronger than expected. Services had another fantastic year and great performance with Q4 revenue increasing 19% to $119 million with full year Services revenue up 24% to $488 million as Cloud sales continue to fuel Services growth globally. Q4 adjusted operating profit was $77 million with an operating margin of 32.2% representing a 200 basis point year-over-year improvement. Full year adjusted operating profit totaled $281 million with a 30.3% operating margin and represents a 265 basis point improvement over 2022. Both Q4 and 2023 results were driven by strong Cloud and Services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our Cloud business scales. Q4 earnings per share increased 27% to $1.3 and GAAP earnings per share increased 30% to $0.78. Full year adjusted earnings per share increased 36% to $3.74 and GAAP earnings per share increased 39% to $2.82. Q4 operating cash flow increased 60% to $88 million with a 36.3% free cash flow margin and a 32.9% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our full year operating cash flow was $246 million, while generating 26% free cash flow margin and 30.9% adjusted EBITDA margin. So turning to the balance sheet, our deferred revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $239 million. We increased our cash position to $271 million with zero debt, up from $182 million at the end of Q3. In 2023, we invested $166 million in share repurchases and we are entering 2024 with a Board approved $75 million share repurchase authority. Moving to the outlook, as consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against any enterprise SaaS comps. As noted on prior earnings calls, our goal is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. Additionally, as previously discussed, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. With that, we are raising the mid-point of our preliminary 2024 RPO, revenue, operating margin and EPS targets that we provided last quarter. For RPO, we are now targeting $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The $1.78 billion mid-point compares favorably to our prior mid-point of $1.75 billion and represents 25% growth. For full year 2024 guidance, we now expect total revenue of $1.015 billion to $1.025 billion with a $1.02 billion midpoint, comparing favorably to our prior midpoint of roughly $1 billion. Bunch of billions in there, represents 16% growth excluding license and maintenance attrition and all in, our target is 10%. For Q1, we are targeting total revenue of $241 million to $245 million, which at the midpoint represents 16% growth excluding license and maintenance attrition and 10% growth all in. For the rest of the year, at the midpoint, we are targeting total revenue of about $255 million in Q2, $264 million in Q3 and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $258 million in Q4. Driven by our revenue growth and the inherent leverage in our business model, we continue to track ahead of our original margin expectations. As such, we are raising our 2024 adjusted operating margin guidance range to 28.75% to 29.25%, with the 29% midpoint comparing favorably to our prior midpoint that we provided last quarter of 28.25%. Additionally, included in our outlook is 175 basis points of headwind from our license and maintenance revenue attrition to cloud. At the midpoint, adjusted operating margin on a quarterly basis is expected to be about 28% in Q1, 28.5% in Q2, 30% in Q3 and accounting for retail peak seasonality, 29.5% in Q4. The results in a full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.69 and $3.79 and a GAAP EPS range of $2.81 to $2.91. For a comparison purposes, our 2024 adjusted tax rate is nearly 350 basis points higher than our 2023 adjusted tax rate. For Q1, we are targeting adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.87 and GAAP EPS of $0.71 to $0.73. For Q2 through Q4, we expect GAAP EPS to be about $0.25 lower than adjusted EPS per quarter, which accounts for our investment in equity based compensation. Here are some additional details on our 2024 outlook. For full year 2024, we continue to expect cloud revenue of $326 million to $330 million. At the midpoint, this represents 29% growth and assumes roughly $75 million in Q1, $79 million in Q2, $85 million in Q3 and $89 million in Q4. For services revenue, we are increasing our forecast to $532 million to $542 million, representing 10% growth at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 services revenue of roughly $128 million, $137 million in Q2, $141 million in Q3 and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $131 million in Q4. On attrition to cloud, we expect maintenance and license to represent about a 6-point headwind to total revenue growth in 2024. For maintenance, we expect a range of $121 million to $123 million or a 15% decline at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 to be $32.5 million, Q2 $31 million, Q3 $29.5 million, and Q4 $29 million. We expect license revenue to be roughly $6 million or less than 1% of 2024 total revenue in hardware to be between $5 million to $7 million per quarter. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin, we are targeting about 100 basis points of year-over-year improvement for 2024 and Q1. We expect our effective tax rate to be 21.5% and our diluted share count to be 62.8 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. Finally, in summary, 2023 was a great year, and we expect 2024 to be another year of balanced performance across revenue, growth, profitability and cash flow. Thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Thanks, Dennis. Well, indeed, 2023 was a very successful year for Manhattan. And while we remain appropriately cautious, given the volatile macro conditions that are out there, our business fundamentals and momentum are very solid, right. Manhattan enters 2024 as the industry leader with world class technology, with record levels of R&D investment that\u2019s contributing to our 75% plus win rates in the field, with industry leading levels of customer satisfaction, and a strong pipeline with numerous drivers for sustainable long-term growth. So, in closing, I\u2019d just like to echo Dennis\u2019 comments and thank all of the Manhattan team members around the world for a fantastic 2023. Your dedication and commitment to our growing customer base is just unparalleled and clearly one of our key differentiators. So, Sherry, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we\u2019d be happy to take any questions at this point.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nTerry Tillman: Hey, good afternoon, Eddie, Dennis and Mike. And it\u2019s great to hear all the talk about the billions. Maybe, Eddie a question for you and then I had a couple of follow-ups for Dennis. As we just get further along in kind of the monetizing the cloud innovation cycles that you have. I\u2019m curious, are you starting to see customers, whether it\u2019s existing customers or prospects kind of look at all the things you have from a platform perspective, so supply chain unified commerce, and starting to think about, hey, we want to go \u2013 get more aggressive initially with more like a platform deal where it\u2019s a couple of major kind of sets of products as opposed to maybe WMS or OMS or PS. I\u2019m just kind of curious about the buying behaviour. If they\u2019re starting to feel like, hey, yes, we want to go bigger, faster, or does it still feel like, no, there\u2019s the initial wedge, and then over time they add the other products. Kind of curious about the buying behaviour around just all the way you\u2019ve delivered with the platform.\nEddie Capel: Yes, sure. It\u2019s a great question, Terry and it\u2019s really latter. Primarily if you think about it, because these are pretty big initiatives let\u2019s just say, WMS and order management or something, any two of the major products, they\u2019re pretty big initiatives in themselves. And usually our customers can only digest one of them at a time. So they\u2019re unlikely, let\u2019s take that example, to buy WMS and OMS, knowing that they\u2019ve got to pay OMS SaaS fees, whilst not beginning an implementation for six, nine, maybe even 12 months. So I think they have a vision to be able to build on the platform and acquire additional products down the road. But just practically speaking, it doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense, frankly, to pay SaaS fees for products that you can\u2019t get to the implementation of.\nTerry Tillman: Okay, I understood on that. And I guess maybe, Dennis, just to follow-up in terms of the cloud booking strength in the quarter. It was great to see in the upside. I\u2019m curious, if you could talk a little bit double clicking into that in terms of was there just some greater large deal exposure or benefits in the quarter or was there a larger number of just actual kind of units or customers signed up? Just kind of curious if there was anything that was interesting or different versus the prior couple quarters. And then I had a follow-up.\nDennis Story: I don\u2019t know about interesting or different. I thought it was pretty consistent, kind of across the board, Terry.\nEddie Capel: Yep, I would agree with that Dennis. I mean, I\u2019ll tell you, we had no record size deals in the quarter. We always liked those, but we had no record sized deals in the quarter. I would say from a geographic perspective, we had very good and very nice sort of balanced contribution from both the Americas, EMEA and APAC that that was enjoyable.\nTerry Tillman: Yes. Yes, it sounds enjoyable. I guess just a follow-up question for Dennis or Eddie or Mike, it\u2019s just related to \u2013 did move up the RPO balance a little bit. So that was nice to see, just given that we\u2019re still in the beginning of the year. One thing I\u2019m curious about is, it does look like 1Q and 4Q were the biggest RPO or the bookings quarters in 2023. I\u2019m not trying to pin you down the quarter where you kind of guided. But is there starting to be a common buying pattern with these cloud deals? Maybe it\u2019s at the very beginning of the year or very end of the year with budget flush. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense on if you could kind of foretell how like there\u2019s a pattern recognition now around booking? Thank you guys. Great job.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry. No, not really. So, I would say definitely no budget flush at the end of the year, given that, obviously, their annual subscription fees. So there\u2019s no license buys right at the end of the year or anything like that in terms of budget flush. Q1, I can see maybe \u2013 thank you for saying you\u2019re not going to pin us down on this. But I think in Q1, we sometimes see a little bit of a stronger buying pattern, because there\u2019s still time to get systems in before peak, if you kind of buy early in Q1. So that is definitely an opportunity there for us, but no budget flush at the end of the Q4 [ph]. Thanks.\nTerry Tillman: Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks gentlemen. Congrats on the strong quarter. So Eddie, I\u2019d love to get an update. I know in the past, you\u2019ve shared some details on the number of booked customers or implemented customers for Active WM. Any updated perspective that you can share there?\nEddie Capel: Yes. I think I can. We\u2019re at somewhere \u2013 I don\u2019t have the exact number, frankly, off the top of my head, but we\u2019re 120-plus of contracted customers. Live customers, again, don\u2019t quote me to the exact; we\u2019re about 75 live customers and right at 200 \u2013 just over 200 facilities live around the globe. So \u2013 and some of those, of course, are very large facilities, highly automated and so forth. So with, call it, 125, 75 and 200, I mean, this is a rock-solid proven solution now. We went through, of course, the peak season of 2022 with live Manhattan Active WM customers but as you can tell, we had hundreds of facilities that went through peak of 2023. So, I think it\u2019s sort of a take it to the bank bulletproof solution that\u2019s proven at the top end of the market now.\nBrian Peterson: No, it\u2019s great to see that progress. And maybe just a follow-up on services hiring and anything on productivity. I just \u2013 obviously, we got the guide for the margins, but I\u2019d love to understand how you guys are thinking about services capacity in 2024? Thanks guys.\nEddie Capel: Yes. We plan on increasing capacity, obviously, to help with customer satisfaction and so forth. As we\u2019ve talked about before, hiring came in a little lower in 2023 than we had originally projected at the beginning of the year, only because we saw attrition very low, frankly. So, we modulated our hiring accordingly. The onboarding and the productivity of the team members that we brought on has been outstanding, frankly. Now that\u2019s a combination to our kind of services operations team, all of the training programs, the center of excellence we have and so forth that is very focused on making those individuals productive as soon as we possibly can, but certainly expect several hundred hires this year as well.\nBrian Peterson: Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Pleasure, Brian. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed.\nJoe Vruwink: Hi great. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start with the Shopify alliance, which sounds pretty interesting. You mentioned there\u2019s some existing customer overlap. Can you maybe quantify that or where you see the most synergies in the customer base today? And then obviously, when you think about the global Shopify merchant count, that\u2019s a massive number. I would imagine that\u2019s not all addressable by kind of your enterprise-grade technology. But what sort of expansion in audience do you think this could ultimately mean for Manhattan?\nEddie Capel: Yes. So let\u2019s see, great question. Look, this is driven probably a little more to be perfectly honest Joe with Shopify obviously has a fabulous history, a really great technology platform, and have been doing exceptionally well in. I hope they won't be offended by this, but in the SMB space and have gradually been coming up the stack toward the enterprise where we play. So that's why we've started to see a lot more sort of cross fertilization of prospects and customers as they come up into kind of the real enterprise class versus us going down so much into SMB. We've had that conversation many, many times about our focus on both Tier 1 and Tier 2. But we really do think the combination of our advanced technology and platform and Shopify's advanced technology and platform can really deliver some substantial and very effective and efficient results for our customer base and so forth. And one of the beauties and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. Both they and we are very focused on essentially speed to value. They\u2019ve become \u2013 they are experts at this for the smaller merchants and so forth. And we think together we can bring that fast, efficient, effective enablement up into the enterprise.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That's great. And then maybe one for you and Dennis. Just the maintenance revenues they have been exceeding plan still growing here in 4Q. Obviously appreciate the 2024 outlook and maybe the pace of attrition picking up. I'm wondering if you just have any updated thoughts on kind of the migration timeline and those existing on-prem customers. You mentioned at the beginning, what sort of duration might you expect for the majority to ultimately choose one of your cloud offerings?\nDennis Story: Yes. I mean, look, I've been saying it for a pretty long time. I think it's a six to seven year run. Now, it would be fair of you to say, but Eddie, you said six to seven years at the beginning of the year, and now you're saying six to seven years at the beginning of this year as well. Yes, it's still in that range, Joe, would be my estimate to get through the bulk of the transitions. My guess is they'll still be 5%, 10% at the end of that period of time. There'll be sort of laggards and so forth, but it's a six or seven year journey in my view.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, very good. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nDennis Story: I'm sorry. The one thing I'll mention, just a reminder there, Joe. We essentially offer no incentives for either our customers or for our sales guys in a sales team to promote it. Our strategy is when the time is right, we're there for you. So there's no incentive and frankly, there's no\u2026\nJoe Vruwink: Gun to the head.\nDennis Story: Gun to the head. Thank you. I was going to try and look for a better, nicer expression than that, but there's no threats of lack of support or anything else.\nJoe Vruwink: Yes. Okay, I understood. Thank you.\nDennis Story: Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nMark Schappel: Thank you for taking my question and nice job on the quarter, guys. Eddie, with respect to your point-of-sale business, I was wondering if you could just highlight or point out some of the biggest opportunities you face and also some of the challenges you're facing right now. So, for instance, are you facing challenge wise, are you facing more so in the marketing side or maybe in the product side?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Great question, Mark. So let's start with the challenges, get those out of the way. I just think we've still got a little bit of an awareness challenge at this. We are beating the drums and telling neighbors, friends, and aunts and uncles as best as we possibly can about this world class solution that we have. Number one. Now at the National Retail Federation Show Conference, I should say a couple of weeks ago, and I mentioned in my prepared comments, we launched the next generation. So we still have got the most revolutionary cloud native point-of-sale in the industry. But we updated it yet again, next generation and launched it at NRF and very well received. So I think awareness is still kind of a challenge. Now you and others have heard me talk about the goal by the end of the year was to have about 10 live customers. Well, we've got that. We've got about 10 because I think that sort of gets you over the hump in terms of, okay this is not a little early cycle product anymore. And the fact of the matter is we went through the holiday peak season here with 10 live customers, 30,000 store associates using our system. Every penny of revenue, if you think about the customers that run both Manhattan Active omni and point-of-sale, right, all of the wholesale business if they have it, their direct-to-consumer business is all running through Manhattan Active omni, all of their foot traffic revenue is running through point-of-sale. So every single penny of their revenue is running through the Manhattan solutions. 30,000 associates and right around 1,500 more now, but right around 1,500 stores live on point-of-sale through the peak season. And transaction volumes that are substantial, let's just call it that and certainly exceed any other cloud-native point-of-sale system out there. So feel really good about kind of where we are with the product. We've noted, so a long answer here, but we noted some of the wins we've had against best-of-breed point-of-sale companies, head-to-head with no other solutions for Manhattan and no previous experience with Manhattan. So clearly, we can go head-to-head. And now, I mean, if there was ever any question about scalability and so forth, we sailed through Q4 with, again 30,000, 1,500 stores, very high transaction volume. So feel like we're there. We just got to beat the drum, get the word out.\nMark Schappel: That's helpful. Thanks. And then shifting gears a little bit here. With respect to your sales motion, could you just give us a sense of what percentage of bookings were cross-sell upsell during the quarter or actually during the year?\nEddie Capel: I think, let's see, we're right around \u2013 give me a percentage here and there, but we were just under 30% for the quarter, and I think for the year we are right in the 26%, 27%.\nMark Schappel: Perfect. Thank you. That's all for me.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please proceed.\nMatt Pfau: Hey. Great. Thanks and nice quarter guys. I wanted to ask on the Shopify partnership. Is that just a product integration partnership? Or is there a go-to-market motion there as well with them?\nEddie Capel: Yes, both. I mean, as is, obviously, we've announced the partnership as is customary with us, and I think Shopify too. We're going to make sure that we've got all of the technical aspects of product integration, end-to-end integration and process flows completely ironed out before we do anything more. But now it's \u2013 at the moment, it is, we're working on the certified integration. We've got joint clients that are in active implementation, we expect to be live in Q2.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. Great. And then I wanted to ask on the margins. I understand that \u2013 I think the margin \u2013 slight margin decline, operating margin decline you're guiding for in 2024 is effectively all driven by revenue mix, with the runoff of maintenance and license. As we think like longer term, about the cloud gross margin, which you don't break out specifically, but is that still ramping? Is there still upside to that as you scale? How do we think about that?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Yes, there is. I mean, we're effectively continuing to increase operating margins if you take out the drag, and we still think there's scale opportunity in client operations and up and down the P&L, frankly.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks very much and nice quarter, guys. Dennis, just wondering on the professional services side of the business. If you look at your overall hiring, your total employee headcount was up around 10% in the year. But your professional services revenues were up around 24%. Can you just help reconcile sort of capacity in that professional services business and pricing in the market, how that performed in 2023 and sort of what you're looking at for 2024?\nEddie Capel: Well, Eddie here. Just a couple of points. I mean, obviously, we have seen a little bit, not a ton, but we have passed on a little bit of wage inflation and so forth for that customer. So you've seen hourly rates tick up a little bit. But most of the leverage comes from the efficiency of the organization, for sure, particularly as we continue to focus on the center of excellence that I talked about, the training and the onboarding of the new resources. Now the other thing that I mentioned, we had forecasted a little bit higher headcount acquisition in 2023 than we needed because attrition was lower than we expected, that helps efficiency for sure.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay. Great. And is there \u2013 with the Shopify relationship, will that also drive some professional services, I guess, it would if larger customers adopt your solution?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Sure. Sure. Yes. No doubt it will. Now part of our objective there, just to be clear, is to take out any of base integration work that's needed to be done. Between us, we'll carry that cost. So the idea is to speed up implementations, reduce the total cost of ownership and so forth. But nonetheless, there's still professional services fees associated with implementing that joint solution.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay. Great. Great. And then my next question was just really around \u2013 just maybe a little more color on the guidance, the revenue guidance for fiscal 2024. So 10% on the top line, did 21% in 2023, did 15% in 2022 and is there \u2013 I just want to get your sense of sort of how you came to your 2024 revenue view?\nEddie Capel: Well, we're \u2013 our revenue growth guidance coming into 2024 is roughly the same as it was coming into 2023, slightly higher actually.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay. Is the environment feeling about the same as 2023 at the end of last year?\nEddie Capel: Yes, in the same ballpark. Obviously, there's a few things going on around the world that are happening now that weren't happening at the beginning of 2023. 2024 is an election year, et cetera, et cetera. So the things that you know about. But aside from those things, everything feels about the same.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Blair. Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Eddie for closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Terrific, Sherry. Well, thanks, everybody, for attending today. Again, we're pleased with 2023. Looking forward to a fabulous 2024, and we look forward to updating you on the Q1 results in about 90 days. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good afternoon, everybody, and a belated happy New Year. And thanks for joining us as we review our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 as well as provide our outlook for 2024. So 2023 was a very successful year for Manhattan, setting new records in total revenue, RPO, operating profit, free cash flow and earnings per share. And to drive future growth and innovation, we also invested record amounts in our people and in research and development. In 2023, we increased our headcount by about 10%, and our R&D investment was over $125 million. Now for perspective, over the past five years, we've invested over $0.5 billion in R&D across mission-critical commerce and supply chain technology solutions. And this level of consistent commitment is really unmatched in our industry and is one of the Manhattan's important differentiators. And given the size of the opportunity and growing demand, we're committed to increasing these investments in 2024 and beyond. These investments will also contribute to our industry-leading levels of customer satisfaction, growing our addressable market and extending our position as the leading innovator in supply chain execution, omnichannel and point-of-sale solutions. Now while we remain appropriately cautious regarding the global economy, our business fundamentals are solid, and we're optimistic about our long-term market opportunity. Like prior years, we're entering 2024 with good visibility and benefiting from several growth drivers, which include the acquisition of new customers, conversions of on-premise customers to cloud and cross-selling our growing unified product portfolio. So pivoting to our quarterly results, Q4 was a record quarter that frankly exceeded our expectations. Revenue increased 20% as reported to $238 million, highlighted by 38% growth in cloud, 19% growth in services and double-digit revenue growth across all of our geographies. These strong results drove top-line outperformance and solid earnings leverage in the quarter with adjusted earnings per diluted share increasing 27% to $1.03. RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 36% to $1.4 billion at the end of 2023. Customer satisfaction levels are high and win rates remain at about 75% with demand for our cloud solutions continuing to be solid across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter and across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. And the following is just a sample of some of the cloud deals we won this quarter: an industrial automation and energy management conglomerate, an airline, a fast-food restaurant chain, a sporting goods retailer, a health care and supplies company, and a specialty retailer, as well as a number of others. And this quarter's wins contributed to a healthy mix of bookings across sub-verticals for the full year. Additionally, and aided by secular tailwinds and the clear benefit of resilient, modern supply chains, roughly one third of our total bookings were generated from new logos for the full year 2023. Our pipeline continues to be strong with solid demand across our product suites. Net new potential customers represent about 35% of that demand, and we have significant conversion opportunity, as we enter 2024 with over 85% of our on-premise customers yet to begin their migration to our cloud solutions. For this quarter's brief product update, I'd like to start with three exciting announcements that we made at the National Retail Federation Conference in mid-January, two of which have to do with a pretty large step forward with our Manhattan Active Omni applications, and the third is an important new partnership for us. So starting with the product enhancements, this quarter, we announced general availability of Iris, the next big step forward for our store associate app. Running on top of Manhattan Active Omni \u2013 our Manhattan Active Omni platform, Iris offers unmatched transactional performance, resiliency that's purpose built for the connectivity issues inherent in store networks and a great new associate experience design. And we believe that Iris is the first cloud-native point-of-sale truly designed and built to offer the next best of both worlds, continuous innovation in the form of quarter releases and onboard resiliency to handle centralized cloud deployments at scale. Many of our customers face ongoing battles to provide fast and reliable network connectivity to every register in every store. And Iris insulates the store associate from the whims of networks, offering unmatched checkout performance, whether the device is connected, partially disconnected or completely offline. And Iris also offers a great new visual experience for the store associates, seamlessly blending the three Cs of a best-in-class point-of-sale system: card, catalog and customer. Iris empowers store associates to maximize sales conversion rates in the store, the ability to sell both what's in the physical store and what's in the broader supply chain in a single transaction, ensuring every possible sale is converted. Furthermore, the highly visual customer profile within Iris empowers a store associate to truly deliver a personalized selling experience. Staying with retail store just for a moment, our point-of-sale system performed incredibly well during this recent holiday selling period with about 30,000 retail associates using our solution and customer transaction volumes exceeding any other cloud-native point-of-sale solution in the market. Now at NRF, we also highlighted our fulfillment experience insight dashboard. This capability is unique to Manhattan Active Omni and allows our omnichannel customers to compare their fulfillment performance against their peers and competitors. A key omnichannel fulfillment experience metrics like click-to-deliver, order rejection rates, pick up in store penetration percentage and abandonment rates, among others, that display dynamically for each of our customers. And we built this capability so that our Manhattan Active Omni customers can understand exactly how they stack up against the field. Fulfillment experience insights lays out these metrics for them in a clear and comprehensive manner. And frankly, armed with this information, our professional services team members can provide corresponding process and technology recommendations to help move these metrics forward in the right direction over time. And we were \u2013 finally, we're also excited to announce our new partnership with Shopify. Over the last several years, we've witnessed Shopify surfacing more and more often in our Manhattan Active Omni prospect and customer base. And we thought the time was right to team up with Shopify to offer the market end-to-end omnichannel commerce solutions. Shopify shares our vision of providing solution which lower purchase friction, increase conversion and improve transparency and reliability during the fulfillment process. And for our customers, both Manhattan and Shopify are focused on delivering functionality-rich solutions, which can be implemented on time and on budget and we start delivering value immediately for them. We believe that in the near to medium term, the market will further emphasize total cost of ownership and lower project risk and the Manhattan Active Omni and Shopify partnership is well-suited to deliver on both of these. Now speaking of partners, I'm proud to report that we finished 2023 by adding a record number of new partners to our Manhattan Value Partner or MVP program. Whether it's SaaS providers like Shopify or Adient, transportation visibility providers like FourKites or project44 or Shippeo, or material handling and robotics vendors for use within the four walls of the DC, Manhattan Active platform applications are easy to connect and offer our partners access to a world-class customer base. And we continue to \u2013 we'll continue to add and strengthen our relationships with premier third-party integration and advisory firms as well. Our network of technology and consulting partners help us connect with the broader market of target customers and improve the speed and success of our deployments. So next quarter, I'll likely focus my product updates within our Manhattan Active supply chain execution suite. But for now, I'll simply mention that we continue to see strong demand and deal activity for our market-leading unified supply chain execution offering consisting basically of WMS and TMS. This demand is coming from across the globe and across the industries. And finally, throughout 2024, we'll also continue to update you on the progress that our R&D team is making as we incorporate the latest generative AI technologies into our supply chain and omnichannel retail solutions. So in summary, 2023 was a terrific year for Manhattan and we're very excited for the numerous opportunities that lie ahead to deliver simply world-class innovation into a growing customer base. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update of financial performance for 2023 and our outlook for 2024. And then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we before we move on to Q&A. So Dennis? Thanks, Dennis. Well, indeed, 2023 was a very successful year for Manhattan. And while we remain appropriately cautious, given the volatile macro conditions that are out there, our business fundamentals and momentum are very solid, right. Manhattan enters 2024 as the industry leader with world class technology, with record levels of R&D investment that's contributing to our 75% plus win rates in the field, with industry leading levels of customer satisfaction, and a strong pipeline with numerous drivers for sustainable long-term growth. So, in closing, I'd just like to echo Dennis' comments and thank all of the Manhattan team members around the world for a fantastic 2023. Your dedication and commitment to our growing customer base is just unparalleled and clearly one of our key differentiators. So, Sherry, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we'd be happy to take any questions at this point. Yes, sure. It's a great question, Terry and it's really latter. Primarily if you think about it, because these are pretty big initiatives let's just say, WMS and order management or something, any two of the major products, they're pretty big initiatives in themselves. And usually our customers can only digest one of them at a time. So they're unlikely, let's take that example, to buy WMS and OMS, knowing that they've got to pay OMS SaaS fees, whilst not beginning an implementation for six, nine, maybe even 12 months. So I think they have a vision to be able to build on the platform and acquire additional products down the road. But just practically speaking, it doesn't make a ton of sense, frankly, to pay SaaS fees for products that you can't get to the implementation of. Yep, I would agree with that Dennis. I mean, I'll tell you, we had no record size deals in the quarter. We always liked those, but we had no record sized deals in the quarter. I would say from a geographic perspective, we had very good and very nice sort of balanced contribution from both the Americas, EMEA and APAC that that was enjoyable. Thank you, Terry. No, not really. So, I would say definitely no budget flush at the end of the year, given that, obviously, their annual subscription fees. So there's no license buys right at the end of the year or anything like that in terms of budget flush. Q1, I can see maybe \u2013 thank you for saying you're not going to pin us down on this. But I think in Q1, we sometimes see a little bit of a stronger buying pattern, because there's still time to get systems in before peak, if you kind of buy early in Q1. So that is definitely an opportunity there for us, but no budget flush at the end of the Q4 [ph]. Thanks. Thank you, Terry. Yes. I think I can. We're at somewhere \u2013 I don't have the exact number, frankly, off the top of my head, but we're 120-plus of contracted customers. Live customers, again, don't quote me to the exact; we're about 75 live customers and right at 200 \u2013 just over 200 facilities live around the globe. So \u2013 and some of those, of course, are very large facilities, highly automated and so forth. So with, call it, 125, 75 and 200, I mean, this is a rock-solid proven solution now. We went through, of course, the peak season of 2022 with live Manhattan Active WM customers but as you can tell, we had hundreds of facilities that went through peak of 2023. So, I think it's sort of a take it to the bank bulletproof solution that's proven at the top end of the market now. Yes. We plan on increasing capacity, obviously, to help with customer satisfaction and so forth. As we've talked about before, hiring came in a little lower in 2023 than we had originally projected at the beginning of the year, only because we saw attrition very low, frankly. So, we modulated our hiring accordingly. The onboarding and the productivity of the team members that we brought on has been outstanding, frankly. Now that's a combination to our kind of services operations team, all of the training programs, the center of excellence we have and so forth that is very focused on making those individuals productive as soon as we possibly can, but certainly expect several hundred hires this year as well. Pleasure, Brian. Thank you. Yes. So let's see, great question. Look, this is driven probably a little more to be perfectly honest Joe with Shopify obviously has a fabulous history, a really great technology platform, and have been doing exceptionally well in. I hope they won't be offended by this, but in the SMB space and have gradually been coming up the stack toward the enterprise where we play. So that's why we've started to see a lot more sort of cross fertilization of prospects and customers as they come up into kind of the real enterprise class versus us going down so much into SMB. We've had that conversation many, many times about our focus on both Tier 1 and Tier 2. But we really do think the combination of our advanced technology and platform and Shopify's advanced technology and platform can really deliver some substantial and very effective and efficient results for our customer base and so forth. And one of the beauties and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. Both they and we are very focused on essentially speed to value. They've become \u2013 they are experts at this for the smaller merchants and so forth. And we think together we can bring that fast, efficient, effective enablement up into the enterprise. Yes. Great question, Mark. So let's start with the challenges, get those out of the way. I just think we've still got a little bit of an awareness challenge at this. We are beating the drums and telling neighbors, friends, and aunts and uncles as best as we possibly can about this world class solution that we have. Number one. Now at the National Retail Federation Show Conference, I should say a couple of weeks ago, and I mentioned in my prepared comments, we launched the next generation. So we still have got the most revolutionary cloud native point-of-sale in the industry. But we updated it yet again, next generation and launched it at NRF and very well received. So I think awareness is still kind of a challenge. Now you and others have heard me talk about the goal by the end of the year was to have about 10 live customers. Well, we've got that. We've got about 10 because I think that sort of gets you over the hump in terms of, okay this is not a little early cycle product anymore. And the fact of the matter is we went through the holiday peak season here with 10 live customers, 30,000 store associates using our system. Every penny of revenue, if you think about the customers that run both Manhattan Active omni and point-of-sale, right, all of the wholesale business if they have it, their direct-to-consumer business is all running through Manhattan Active omni, all of their foot traffic revenue is running through point-of-sale. So every single penny of their revenue is running through the Manhattan solutions. 30,000 associates and right around 1,500 more now, but right around 1,500 stores live on point-of-sale through the peak season. And transaction volumes that are substantial, let's just call it that and certainly exceed any other cloud-native point-of-sale system out there. So feel really good about kind of where we are with the product. We've noted, so a long answer here, but we noted some of the wins we've had against best-of-breed point-of-sale companies, head-to-head with no other solutions for Manhattan and no previous experience with Manhattan. So clearly, we can go head-to-head. And now, I mean, if there was ever any question about scalability and so forth, we sailed through Q4 with, again 30,000, 1,500 stores, very high transaction volume. So feel like we're there. We just got to beat the drum, get the word out. I think, let's see, we're right around \u2013 give me a percentage here and there, but we were just under 30% for the quarter, and I think for the year we are right in the 26%, 27%. Okay. Thank you, Mark. Yes, both. I mean, as is, obviously, we've announced the partnership as is customary with us, and I think Shopify too. We're going to make sure that we've got all of the technical aspects of product integration, end-to-end integration and process flows completely ironed out before we do anything more. But now it's \u2013 at the moment, it is, we're working on the certified integration. We've got joint clients that are in active implementation, we expect to be live in Q2. Yes. Yes, there is. I mean, we're effectively continuing to increase operating margins if you take out the drag, and we still think there's scale opportunity in client operations and up and down the P&L, frankly. Thank you, Matt. Well, Eddie here. Just a couple of points. I mean, obviously, we have seen a little bit, not a ton, but we have passed on a little bit of wage inflation and so forth for that customer. So you've seen hourly rates tick up a little bit. But most of the leverage comes from the efficiency of the organization, for sure, particularly as we continue to focus on the center of excellence that I talked about, the training and the onboarding of the new resources. Now the other thing that I mentioned, we had forecasted a little bit higher headcount acquisition in 2023 than we needed because attrition was lower than we expected, that helps efficiency for sure. Yes. Sure. Sure. Yes. No doubt it will. Now part of our objective there, just to be clear, is to take out any of base integration work that's needed to be done. Between us, we'll carry that cost. So the idea is to speed up implementations, reduce the total cost of ownership and so forth. But nonetheless, there's still professional services fees associated with implementing that joint solution. Well, we're \u2013 our revenue growth guidance coming into 2024 is roughly the same as it was coming into 2023, slightly higher actually. Yes, in the same ballpark. Obviously, there's a few things going on around the world that are happening now that weren't happening at the beginning of 2023. 2024 is an election year, et cetera, et cetera. So the things that you know about. But aside from those things, everything feels about the same. Our pleasure, Blair. Thank you. Okay. Terrific, Sherry. Well, thanks, everybody, for attending today. Again, we're pleased with 2023. Looking forward to a fabulous 2024, and we look forward to updating you on the Q1 results in about 90 days. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. As Eddie highlighted, in 2023, we set all-time records in RPO, total revenue, operating profit, free cash flow and earnings per share. So a big shout out to 4,600 team members across the globe, great execution through the year. For both the quarter and the year, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance on top line growth and operating margin. Both our Q4 and full year results exceeded expectations and compare favorably to the Rule of 50. And if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance attrition, our performance is even stronger. Importantly, Manhattan continues to deliver strong, consistent results across revenue growth, profitability and cash flow. I'll start with recapping our financial performance for the quarter and year. Regarding FX, it was a one-point tailwind to Q4 revenue growth and did not impact our full year revenue growth rate. For RPO, FX was a one-point tailwind to both year-over-year and sequential growth. Now to our results. All growth rates are on an as-reported year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. For Q4, total revenue, total revenue was up 238 or was $238 million, up 20%, and full year revenue totaled $929 million, up 21%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the revenue compression by our Cloud transition, Q4 revenue growth was 24% and full year 28%, some nice double-digit returns here. Q4 Cloud revenue totaled $71 million, up 38% with full year revenue totaling $255 million, up 44%. We closed out 2023 with RPO of $1.4 billion growing 36% year-over-year and 8% sequentially as we experienced strength from across our Manhattan Active Suite of products. Excluding FX impacts, RPO exceeded the high end of our $1.4 billion outlook by $13 million, which was stronger than expected. Services had another fantastic year and great performance with Q4 revenue increasing 19% to $119 million with full year Services revenue up 24% to $488 million as Cloud sales continue to fuel Services growth globally. Q4 adjusted operating profit was $77 million with an operating margin of 32.2% representing a 200 basis point year-over-year improvement. Full year adjusted operating profit totaled $281 million with a 30.3% operating margin and represents a 265 basis point improvement over 2022. Both Q4 and 2023 results were driven by strong Cloud and Services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our Cloud business scales. Q4 earnings per share increased 27% to $1.3 and GAAP earnings per share increased 30% to $0.78. Full year adjusted earnings per share increased 36% to $3.74 and GAAP earnings per share increased 39% to $2.82. Q4 operating cash flow increased 60% to $88 million with a 36.3% free cash flow margin and a 32.9% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our full year operating cash flow was $246 million, while generating 26% free cash flow margin and 30.9% adjusted EBITDA margin. So turning to the balance sheet, our deferred revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $239 million. We increased our cash position to $271 million with zero debt, up from $182 million at the end of Q3. In 2023, we invested $166 million in share repurchases and we are entering 2024 with a Board approved $75 million share repurchase authority. Moving to the outlook, as consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against any enterprise SaaS comps. As noted on prior earnings calls, our goal is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. Additionally, as previously discussed, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. With that, we are raising the mid-point of our preliminary 2024 RPO, revenue, operating margin and EPS targets that we provided last quarter. For RPO, we are now targeting $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The $1.78 billion mid-point compares favorably to our prior mid-point of $1.75 billion and represents 25% growth. For full year 2024 guidance, we now expect total revenue of $1.015 billion to $1.025 billion with a $1.02 billion midpoint, comparing favorably to our prior midpoint of roughly $1 billion. Bunch of billions in there, represents 16% growth excluding license and maintenance attrition and all in, our target is 10%. For Q1, we are targeting total revenue of $241 million to $245 million, which at the midpoint represents 16% growth excluding license and maintenance attrition and 10% growth all in. For the rest of the year, at the midpoint, we are targeting total revenue of about $255 million in Q2, $264 million in Q3 and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $258 million in Q4. Driven by our revenue growth and the inherent leverage in our business model, we continue to track ahead of our original margin expectations. As such, we are raising our 2024 adjusted operating margin guidance range to 28.75% to 29.25%, with the 29% midpoint comparing favorably to our prior midpoint that we provided last quarter of 28.25%. Additionally, included in our outlook is 175 basis points of headwind from our license and maintenance revenue attrition to cloud. At the midpoint, adjusted operating margin on a quarterly basis is expected to be about 28% in Q1, 28.5% in Q2, 30% in Q3 and accounting for retail peak seasonality, 29.5% in Q4. The results in a full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.69 and $3.79 and a GAAP EPS range of $2.81 to $2.91. For a comparison purposes, our 2024 adjusted tax rate is nearly 350 basis points higher than our 2023 adjusted tax rate. For Q1, we are targeting adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.87 and GAAP EPS of $0.71 to $0.73. For Q2 through Q4, we expect GAAP EPS to be about $0.25 lower than adjusted EPS per quarter, which accounts for our investment in equity based compensation. Here are some additional details on our 2024 outlook. For full year 2024, we continue to expect cloud revenue of $326 million to $330 million. At the midpoint, this represents 29% growth and assumes roughly $75 million in Q1, $79 million in Q2, $85 million in Q3 and $89 million in Q4. For services revenue, we are increasing our forecast to $532 million to $542 million, representing 10% growth at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 services revenue of roughly $128 million, $137 million in Q2, $141 million in Q3 and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $131 million in Q4. On attrition to cloud, we expect maintenance and license to represent about a 6-point headwind to total revenue growth in 2024. For maintenance, we expect a range of $121 million to $123 million or a 15% decline at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we expect Q1 to be $32.5 million, Q2 $31 million, Q3 $29.5 million, and Q4 $29 million. We expect license revenue to be roughly $6 million or less than 1% of 2024 total revenue in hardware to be between $5 million to $7 million per quarter. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin, we are targeting about 100 basis points of year-over-year improvement for 2024 and Q1. We expect our effective tax rate to be 21.5% and our diluted share count to be 62.8 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. Finally, in summary, 2023 was a great year, and we expect 2024 to be another year of balanced performance across revenue, growth, profitability and cash flow. Thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks. I don't know about interesting or different. I thought it was pretty consistent, kind of across the board, Terry. Yes. I mean, look, I've been saying it for a pretty long time. I think it's a six to seven year run. Now, it would be fair of you to say, but Eddie, you said six to seven years at the beginning of the year, and now you're saying six to seven years at the beginning of this year as well. Yes, it's still in that range, Joe, would be my estimate to get through the bulk of the transitions. My guess is they'll still be 5%, 10% at the end of that period of time. There'll be sort of laggards and so forth, but it's a six or seven year journey in my view. I'm sorry. The one thing I'll mention, just a reminder there, Joe. We essentially offer no incentives for either our customers or for our sales guys in a sales team to promote it. Our strategy is when the time is right, we're there for you. So there's no incentive and frankly, there's no... Gun to the head. Thank you. I was going to try and look for a better, nicer expression than that, but there's no threats of lack of support or anything else. Thank you, Joe."

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates\u2019 Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, October 24th, 2023. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Thank you, Robert. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates\u2019 2023 third quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events, or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You will caution that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are not guarantees of future performance, and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022, and the risk factor discussion in that report, as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note, the turbulent global macro environment could impact our performance and cause the actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to relate to GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You\u2019ll find a reconciliation scheduled in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Great. Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everybody and thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter results and discuss our increased full year 2023 outlook. In a little later in the call, we\u2019ll provide some preliminary color anyway on our 2024 guidance. Q3 and year-to-date results set all-time records, on both top and bottom lines. For the quarter, total revenue increased 20% to $238 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 59% to $1.05. Both of these metrics were above our expectations. Q3 was our 10th consecutive all-time record revenue quarter. Driving top line outperformance was 44% growth in Cloud revenue and 24% growth in Services revenue. This encompasses double-digit top line growth across all our geographies because that global teams continue to execute very well for our customers. While the global macro environment certainly remains volatile, Manhattan\u2019s business fundamentals are solid, demand for our solutions is robust, customer satisfaction is high, and as Dennis is going to elaborate later on in the call as strong balance sheet and cash flow provides us with plenty of capacity to steadily invest across our growing supply chain execution, omnichannel and retail point-of-sale end markets. Now, RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 37% to just over $1.3 billion. Demand for our mission-critical Cloud solutions remained strong and resilient across our entire product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to \u2013 drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And across our solutions, where the sub verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter, Cloud deals won include an omnichannel multi-brand retailer, a grocery distributor, and national e-commerce company, an aerospace parts distributor, a multi-channel apparel retailer, and a multinational food manufacturer and distributor, as well as several others. For the quarter, competitive win rates were solid at about 75% and we experienced strength from our new customers, with approximately 50% of new Cloud bookings being generated from net new logos. In addition to the healthy new logo activity, we also experienced a good mix of conversions, upsells and cross-sells. And certainly while the timing of large deals and the mix of bookings will vary on a quarterly basis, we believe the year-to-date, variety and breadth of deals across sales categories and products exemplifies the value that we deliver and our multiple opportunities for sustainable growth. As Solution pipeline remains robust, with potential new customers representing about 35% of that demand. Our ability to deliver industry-leading solutions and service to our customers are key drivers for our steady demand. In fact, during Q3, Google recognized Manhattan for this core competency as a Google Cloud Partner of the Year. Our best of breed cloud-native platform and solutions provide unmatched access to innovation, and a uniquely capable of unifying mission-critical commerce and supply chain functions. And this is differentiating, and helps our clients improve customer service and loyalty, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. As I mentioned earlier, our business fundamentals are solid, and we continue to invest for growth. This includes strategic investments in industry-leading innovation, further enablement of our customer success and expanding our addressable market. From a hiring standpoint, we\u2019ve added over 400 new team members year-to-date, this represents about a 10% increase, and its\u2019 terrific progress towards their goal of achieving \u2013 of adding 450 new hires in 2023. With our R&D investment at record levels and growing, but let\u2019s move to a quick update or two on our industry-leading solutions. I\u2019m happy to tell you that while small, our point-of-sale business continues to slowly build momentum. We\u2019re seeing success on both new sales and implementation fronts, with stores being activated at a record pace. It\u2019s now I think beyond dispute, the store network will remain an essential part of the overall consumer retail experience. And the vast majority of retailers are in need of a store technology refresh in order to maximize their store fleets\u2019 potential. Only with an omnichannel native point-of-sale system can retailers maximize revenue and margin, while simultaneously delivering that seamless shopping experience that today\u2019s consumer demands. This quarter saw the fastest pace of point-of-sale activations in our history, with customers working quickly and efficiently to get that new technology in place before the holidays. And we look forward to seeing a record number of stores this holiday period driving incremental sales there, endless aisle capabilities and providing seamless in-store fulfillment execution for pickup, shipping, curbside, same-day delivery and beyond. And speaking of best-in-class customer service, our Manhattan Active customer engagement solution is also having an encouraging 2023. With a number of customers now live and several more activating before the end of the year, we\u2019re having success expanding our operational footprint to the contact center as well. Now as a reminder, our customer engagement solution enables agents in the contact center to go far beyond just that basic order management. We enable call center agents to manage cases, manage interactions across our half a dozen inbound communication channels and provide differentiated service capabilities like triggering refunds upon carrier scans and dynamic order fulfillment strategies. With some exciting go-lives imminent and several recent wins for customer engagement, we\u2019re looking forward to the continued growth of this offering within the broader Manhattan Active omni suite. And finally, on the omnichannel front this quarter, we launched an exciting new capability called Fulfillment Insights. It\u2019s a first of a kind in the industry. Fulfillment Insights provides our customers with live omnichannel fulfillment performance benchmark data, allowing them to compare their performance against anonymized data from their peers and their competitors. Now our customers can track live performance versus the industry on important KPIs such as click-to-ship times, click-to-deliver times, store order rejection rates, BOPUS pickup rates and a host of others. Here service and experience continue to play a critical role defining the brand\u2019s image, Fulfillment Insights provides our Manhattan Active customers with a quantitative way to ensure that they\u2019re meeting or exceeding customer expectations. At the platform level, we continue to work closely with Google to bring Generative AI solutions to life within our Manhattan Active Solutions. And we\u2019re hard at work \u2013 embedding a variety of Google\u2019s Vertex AI models within the Manhattan Active platform to achieve a number of key benefits, including configuration management and automation, extension code development, guided intelligence for operations and consumer-facing chatbots. And we\u2019ll have a lot more to say about Generative AI at the NeRF Show in New York in January. And closing out my commentary on our products, I\u2019ll make a brief mention of the Manhattan Active supply chain solutions. We continue to see strong demand and win rates for our Manhattan Active Warehouse Management solution. This quarter, we\u2019ll set a record for the number of Manhattan Active WM go-lives. And like our point-of-sale, one of the real advantages of our cloud-native technology is its rapid pace of rollout. Once global design has been completed, many of our customers have been very successful using our platform technology tools to get new sites ready for fast activation. So looking to next year and beyond, Manhattan is going to continue our aggressive investments in organic innovation that not only benefit our growing customer base, but also help us continue to expand our addressable market. So that concludes my business update. Dennis will provide you with an update on our financial performance and our outlook, and then I\u2019ll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. So our Manhattan global teams continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance across top and bottom lines. This includes posting record results across RPO, revenue, operating income and earnings per share. This resulted in our Q3 and year-to-date results slightly exceeding the Rule of 50 and if our revenue growth is normalized for our Cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, both results approached the Rule of 60. FX had a minor impact in the quarter and was an approximate 1-point tailwind to revenue growth, a 2-point tailwind to year-over-year RPO growth and a 1-point headwind to sequential RPO growth. Now turning to our Q3 results. Our growth rates are reported on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. Total revenue was $238 million, up 20%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our Cloud transition, our total revenue was up 28%. Cloud revenue totaled $65 million, up 44%. And as Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $1.3 billion, up 37% compared to the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Our RPO performance was driven by a healthy mix of sales across our sales categories with notable strength from new logos. Also in the quarter, we had solid results from across our Manhattan Active suite of products. Our global services teams are knocking it out of the park, delivering record revenue, totaling $128 million, up 24% as Cloud sales continue to fuel Services revenue growth globally. Adjusted operating profit was $72 million with adjusted operating margin of 30.4%. This is up 450 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong Cloud and Services revenue growth, combined with operating leverage as our Cloud business scales. Importantly, as Eddie discussed, we continue to invest for sustainable long-term growth. This resulted in Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, up 59% and GAAP EPS of $0.79, up 68%. How about that? Included in our earnings per share is a $0.12 benefit predominantly from the US Treasury, temporary delay of foreign tax credit regulations. Removing this tax benefit, adjusted earnings per share was up 41% and GAAP earnings per share up 43%. Turning to cash. Q3 operating cash flow increased 47% to a solid $59 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow increased 27% to $158 million, which includes the payment of about $50 million in cash taxes, resulting in free cash flow margin of 24% for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue increased 26% to $215 million. We ended the quarter with $182 million in cash and zero debt, which includes $25 million in share repurchases in the quarter and $166 million year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishing of our $75 million share repurchase authority. On to our updated 2023 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins, benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. This includes a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our strong year-to-date performance and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2023 RPO revenue, operating margin and earnings per share guidance. All guidance references made on today\u2019s call will be at the midpoint of their respective ranges. As noted on prior earnings calls, our objective is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly, on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. So for the full year 2023, we expect RPO to exceed the high end of our $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range by approximately $5 million to $10 million. We expect full year total revenue to increase 19% to $914 million. This is up $24 million or about 3% higher versus our prior midpoint of $890 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 27% overall growth. For operating margin, we are increasing our midpoint to 29%, which is up 150 basis points from our prior midpoint of 27.5%. As Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business for growth. Our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook is increasing by $0.43 to $3.52, up 14% from our prior midpoint of $3.09 and up 28% from 2022. For GAAP earnings per share, our midpoint increases by $0.40 to $2.60, up 18% from our prior midpoint of $2.20 and up 28% from 2022. So in a nutshell, our 2023 guidance implies Q4 total revenue of $223 million, targeting Cloud revenue of $67.5 million, Services revenue of $115 million and Maintenance revenue of $33 million. Operating margin is targeted to be 27%, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.80. As previously mentioned on prior calls, our Q4 services revenue and operating margin accounts for retail peak seasonality, which traditionally is down sequentially as customers idle implementations to focus on their busy season. So that covers our Q4 guidance. Now I\u2019ll turn to addressing our 2024 preliminary parameters. We are currently in our early stages of our 2024 budget cycle and will firm up this outlook on our Q4 call. With that said, our preliminary total revenue is expected to increase 10% to $1 billion to $1.01 billion, representing 16% growth, excluding license and maintenance attrition. This includes our Cloud revenue target of $328 million, representing 31% year-over-year growth. To help you with comparisons, our target would be at our prior guidepost high end of $345 million if FX rates remained unchanged from October 2021 levels, which is when we provided our initial 2024 guidepost and normalized for the bankruptcies that we highlighted on our prior Q2 call. For RPO, we are targeting a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. The $1.75 billion midpoint compares favorably to our prior guidepost midpoint of $1.7 billion, and represents approximately 25% growth. For Services, our demand continues to be driven by Cloud, resulting in solid visibility. In 2024, we are targeting Services revenue of $530 million, which represents 10% year-over-year growth. On license and maintenance attrition to Cloud, we are targeting Maintenance revenue to be about $119 million, which represents a 15% decline and for License revenue to be about $4 million which is below 1% of total revenue. We anticipate operating margin to be about 28.25%. In 2024, we expect our license and maintenance revenue attrition to Cloud will result in an approximate 175 basis point headwind to operating margin. Normalized for this transition, our 2024 operating margin would expand 100 basis points year-over-year. Like prior years, in 2024, we will continue to opportunistically invest in our business and hire leading supply chain talent. We expect our 2024 tax rate to be 21.5% and diluted share count to be approximately 63 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, our preliminary 2024 parameters on an as-reported basis are: total revenue ex license and maintenance attrition to increase 16%; Cloud revenue to increase 31%; Services revenue to increase 10%; RPO to increase 25%; and for operating margin to exceed 28%. In summary, fantastic execution by the Manhattan team, and let\u2019s finish the year strong. Thank you, and back to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Terrific. Thank you, Dennis. Well, clearly we\u2019re very pleased with our outstanding Q3 and year-to-date results. And while we remain appropriately cautious on the volatile macro conditions, and that\u2019s reflected in what we consider to be responsible growth targets for 2024, our business momentum and fundamentals remain very solid. Now thank you for everybody for joining the call, and thank you to our global team for all the exceptional work that they\u2019re doing for our customers. Robert, that concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll be happy to take any questions at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTerry Tillman: Hey, good afternoon, Eddie, Dennis and Mike. First and foremost, congrats on the quarter, a strong quarter. Also, Dennis, thanks for all the color on \u201824, that was helpful. My two questions, I guess, the first question, I\u2019m going to start with, unless I got this wrong, and I get plenty of things wrong. The new logo activity in terms of bookings composition was 50%. Is that right? Did I get that right? Because I was going to ask about that.\nEddie Capel: Yep, 50% for the quarter, Terry.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah. And you\u2019re a 30-year-old company and you have that kind of new logo activity is pretty impressive. What do you think is driving it? Is it more of this kind of like because you have the Cloud products, you can kind of dip more into that mid-market with these fast-growing D2C brands? Or is it you\u2019re seeing more shots on go with like less traditional kind of end markets. I\u2019m just trying to understand that because that\u2019s pretty striking. And then the second part of that question is, going forward, I mean I\u2019m not saying it needs to be in that ZIP code, but do you expect still ongoing vibrancy in terms of the new logo stuff? And then I was going to ask Dennis a question.\nEddie Capel: Yeah. That\u2019s a lot packed in there. Good question. So, we still continue to be focused on what we categorizes Tier 1 and Tier 2. So certainly making some progress moving the end market, but that is not where the new logos is really coming from. It\u2019s not a dip down into SMB or anything. It\u2019s really a function, I think of our innovative solutions that we\u2019re bringing to market, number one; and number two, the breadth of the portfolio that we\u2019re bringing to the market. I do expect \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to maintain a 50% new logo territory every quarter. We certainly like to. We\u2019ve seen it be 50% before. And as you know, we\u2019ve seen it be as low as, I think 27% or something like that. We generally, again, as you know, think about overall, one-third roughly of our net new software bookings coming from new logos. That generally is how it normalized. It\u2019s been a bit higher than that for the last couple of years, but I think that\u2019s the way to \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the way to think about it.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. And I\u2019ll have less packed in this next question, I promise. And I\u2019ll try to ask this for Dennis, but maybe Eddie, you want to chime in. But it is good to see because people want to know kind of the RPO and how it looks a year out. It looks like the midpoint is moving higher to $1.75 billion. So that\u2019s positive. But what I\u2019m curious about is 90 days since the last update call, and that $1.75 billion midpoint for RPO, do you all assume a similar kind of consumer and IT spending environment? Or is it a little bit choppier? Or does it improve? What\u2019s baked into that increased midpoint? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Look, the phrase I used, Terry, was we think we\u2019ve set responsible targets. Given the various turbulent conditions around the world, what we think we\u2019ve done is build a responsible set of growth targets, of course, including RPO. So, we are very optimistic about our market leadership position. We\u2019re very optimistic about the breadth of products, the technology, their geographic reach and so forth. But I think it would be dangerous to assume that there wasn\u2019t going to be a little bit of chop in the water, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve assumed.\nTerry Tillman: All right, great. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just a follow-up to Terry, I\u2019d love to understand, Eddie, what you\u2019ve seen from a linearity perspective so far this year. I know it\u2019s been kind of a choppy macro. But how has that net new business kind of come in over the course of the year up relative to your expectations?\nEddie Capel: Honestly, I think it\u2019s been a bad spot on, Brian. Again, kind of back to \u2013 we generally think about net new being about a third of our business. Again, we benched around a little bit between the high 20s, up to 50 now, pipeline continues to be strong. If you think about and look at net new opportunities in the pipeline, again, it\u2019s about a third or a little higher. So I think \u2013 honestly, I think we\u2019re going to see a profile or the same profile going forward. We\u2019ll see a little bit of bouncing around quarter-by-quarter. I think it will normalize on an annualized basis that somewhere around about a third net new logos.\nBrian Peterson: Got it. And maybe a follow-up, and I appreciate that you guys have given \u201824 way before some other folks. But I\u2019d love to understand what sort of service hiring assumptions you guys have in the 2024 targets that you guys did? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Yeah. We haven\u2019t got all the way there yet, Brian, and we\u2019ll certainly provide some of that specific commentary in the Q4 call in January. But I think we probably see a little less aggressive hiring than this year but still certainly quite solid. In the 100s, let\u2019s put it that way.\nBrian Peterson: I see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I maybe wanted to start with the Fulfillment Insights\u2019 product \u2013 and just wondering, does that typically be the full suite of active products in order to generate its most value. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s maybe one incremental reason customers would pursue cross-sells across the platform. And then that kind of relates to my ultimate question of whether you are seeing more cross-selling interest given the nature of just all the applications being on the same platform, but also maybe some of the go-to-market changes you\u2019ve made.\nEddie Capel: Yeah. So let\u2019s see I\u2019ll maybe take it a little bit in reverse order. We saw some very nice cross-sell in the quarter, and we have done for the year, frankly. Cross-sell has been running, I think, in the 25% to 27% range. So we still like to see it there. In terms of the Insights\u2019 capability, it\u2019s not a product, it\u2019s frankly just a feature today of Manhattan Active omni. And it\u2019s very focused on commerce performance for our customers. So benchmarking, again, things like click-to-ship, click-to-deliver, BOPUS pickup rate percentage, the store order rejection, all of those kinds of things that are right on the front end. And look, at the end of the day, it\u2019s the ability to be able to aggregate all that data inside of our native cloud solutions that gives us the ability to offer this really very valuable real-time or almost real-time benchmark data to our customers. We have begun the journey of providing Insights just within Manhattan Active omni for the moment, Joe, and we\u2019ll be looking to expand that across the portfolio as it makes sense.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, that\u2019s great. And then, Eddie a few comments in your prepared remarks, new stores activating at a record pace, warehouse management record go-lives. That \u2013 Cloud is certainly more efficient. I\u2019m just wondering like for instance, this quarter, there was a really strong RPO billings quarter. Does kind of the relationship between what\u2019s going in the cloud RPO in the current period and the timeline for when you see it in Services and ultimately see it in Cloud, is that all coming in sooner so that\u2019s within a 12 \u2013 you typically talk about a next 24-month RPO contribution. But are you seeing more go-live than kind of that 12-month timeframe has a virtue of just more being on Cloud?\nEddie Capel: No. I think the initial implementation of whether it be Warehouse Management, point-of-sale or order management really hasn\u2019t changed very much from an on-prem world to a Cloud world. Because, frankly, the design work that you do, the configuration work, the testing work isn\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t see a lot of positive impact by moving to the Cloud. A little, because you don\u2019t have to deploy infrastructure and so forth, but not a ton. But where it really kicks in is when you start rolling out across either multiple distribution centers or multiple stores because, of course, you\u2019ve got a single version of the software that\u2019s in the Cloud, and you can roll out much faster. So you don\u2019t really see a faster move from RPO to revenue. That\u2019s remained pretty consistent. But then, as I say, the activation, once you get into the flywheel gets moving, tends to move a little faster.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: Well, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Schappel: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. And guys, nice job on the quarter, especially around the new logo business. And on the new logo front, just kind of building on an earlier question there. Eddie, could you just talk whether you\u2019re seeing your new logo business concentrated around certain solutions more than others, like whether it\u2019s WM \u2013 WMS or like the Active omni solution?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. No, I can comment on that, Mark, and it\u2019s really \u2013 there is no concentration particularly. It\u2019s pretty well balanced. We know that roughly, and it bounces by quarter, but 50% of our revenue comes from WMS and 25% or 30% from omni, 30% from our solution and so forth. And it\u2019s pretty balanced across those parameters. As we always say, bounces quarter-by-quarter a little bit. But generally, it\u2019s across the portfolio and across geographies as well. So it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s no real point of concentration for the new logos and of course, we love it that way.\nMark Schappel: Great, thanks. And then I appreciate your comments around the new customer engagement solution and particularly expanding your operational footprint into the contact center. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about \u2013 or maybe give an example or two of how your solutions are actually interacting with contact center agents?\nEddie Capel: Well, you tend to think about traditional call center agents just taking a query, right? Taking a call, where is my order, kind of like maybe a change of shipment destination, maybe a change the color of a product, goodness to bid, maybe even canceling an order. And of course, we take care of all of those capabilities. But now you can think about a broader set of engagement from that call center agent, all within the Active omni solution. So any type of case management, exception case management, you call in and need to have something found in \u2013 discovered and found in a shipping hub. You need it moved from one location to another. You need to add some kind of service capability, all of that case management can now be handled inside of our call center application as well as all of the other engagement actions, sophisticated returns, sophisticated exchanges. And \u2013 anything that you might take a real lot of manual effort. And possibly, as I think most of us had experienced, having the banks from department to department, right? Nothing more frustrating and let me put you on hold and transfer to you to that department or that department or that department. We can handle all of that customer engagement in one single solution. And that\u2019s really, as you know, where a lot of the power of our capability comes from.\nMark Schappel: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Eddie Capel for closing comments.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Very good, Robert. Thank you very much. And thank you all for your time today, for your support of Manhattan Associates. It\u2019s a little early to say this, of course. But since I won\u2019t speak to you before, everybody, have a happy holiday season, and we\u2019ll look forward to speaking to you again in January. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everybody and thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter results and discuss our increased full year 2023 outlook. In a little later in the call, we'll provide some preliminary color anyway on our 2024 guidance. Q3 and year-to-date results set all-time records, on both top and bottom lines. For the quarter, total revenue increased 20% to $238 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 59% to $1.05. Both of these metrics were above our expectations. Q3 was our 10th consecutive all-time record revenue quarter. Driving top line outperformance was 44% growth in Cloud revenue and 24% growth in Services revenue. This encompasses double-digit top line growth across all our geographies because that global teams continue to execute very well for our customers. While the global macro environment certainly remains volatile, Manhattan's business fundamentals are solid, demand for our solutions is robust, customer satisfaction is high, and as Dennis is going to elaborate later on in the call as strong balance sheet and cash flow provides us with plenty of capacity to steadily invest across our growing supply chain execution, omnichannel and retail point-of-sale end markets. Now, RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 37% to just over $1.3 billion. Demand for our mission-critical Cloud solutions remained strong and resilient across our entire product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to \u2013 drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And across our solutions, where the sub verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter, Cloud deals won include an omnichannel multi-brand retailer, a grocery distributor, and national e-commerce company, an aerospace parts distributor, a multi-channel apparel retailer, and a multinational food manufacturer and distributor, as well as several others. For the quarter, competitive win rates were solid at about 75% and we experienced strength from our new customers, with approximately 50% of new Cloud bookings being generated from net new logos. In addition to the healthy new logo activity, we also experienced a good mix of conversions, upsells and cross-sells. And certainly while the timing of large deals and the mix of bookings will vary on a quarterly basis, we believe the year-to-date, variety and breadth of deals across sales categories and products exemplifies the value that we deliver and our multiple opportunities for sustainable growth. As Solution pipeline remains robust, with potential new customers representing about 35% of that demand. Our ability to deliver industry-leading solutions and service to our customers are key drivers for our steady demand. In fact, during Q3, Google recognized Manhattan for this core competency as a Google Cloud Partner of the Year. Our best of breed cloud-native platform and solutions provide unmatched access to innovation, and a uniquely capable of unifying mission-critical commerce and supply chain functions. And this is differentiating, and helps our clients improve customer service and loyalty, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. As I mentioned earlier, our business fundamentals are solid, and we continue to invest for growth. This includes strategic investments in industry-leading innovation, further enablement of our customer success and expanding our addressable market. From a hiring standpoint, we've added over 400 new team members year-to-date, this represents about a 10% increase, and its' terrific progress towards their goal of achieving \u2013 of adding 450 new hires in 2023. With our R&D investment at record levels and growing, but let's move to a quick update or two on our industry-leading solutions. I'm happy to tell you that while small, our point-of-sale business continues to slowly build momentum. We're seeing success on both new sales and implementation fronts, with stores being activated at a record pace. It's now I think beyond dispute, the store network will remain an essential part of the overall consumer retail experience. And the vast majority of retailers are in need of a store technology refresh in order to maximize their store fleets' potential. Only with an omnichannel native point-of-sale system can retailers maximize revenue and margin, while simultaneously delivering that seamless shopping experience that today's consumer demands. This quarter saw the fastest pace of point-of-sale activations in our history, with customers working quickly and efficiently to get that new technology in place before the holidays. And we look forward to seeing a record number of stores this holiday period driving incremental sales there, endless aisle capabilities and providing seamless in-store fulfillment execution for pickup, shipping, curbside, same-day delivery and beyond. And speaking of best-in-class customer service, our Manhattan Active customer engagement solution is also having an encouraging 2023. With a number of customers now live and several more activating before the end of the year, we're having success expanding our operational footprint to the contact center as well. Now as a reminder, our customer engagement solution enables agents in the contact center to go far beyond just that basic order management. We enable call center agents to manage cases, manage interactions across our half a dozen inbound communication channels and provide differentiated service capabilities like triggering refunds upon carrier scans and dynamic order fulfillment strategies. With some exciting go-lives imminent and several recent wins for customer engagement, we're looking forward to the continued growth of this offering within the broader Manhattan Active omni suite. And finally, on the omnichannel front this quarter, we launched an exciting new capability called Fulfillment Insights. It's a first of a kind in the industry. Fulfillment Insights provides our customers with live omnichannel fulfillment performance benchmark data, allowing them to compare their performance against anonymized data from their peers and their competitors. Now our customers can track live performance versus the industry on important KPIs such as click-to-ship times, click-to-deliver times, store order rejection rates, BOPUS pickup rates and a host of others. Here service and experience continue to play a critical role defining the brand's image, Fulfillment Insights provides our Manhattan Active customers with a quantitative way to ensure that they're meeting or exceeding customer expectations. At the platform level, we continue to work closely with Google to bring Generative AI solutions to life within our Manhattan Active Solutions. And we're hard at work \u2013 embedding a variety of Google's Vertex AI models within the Manhattan Active platform to achieve a number of key benefits, including configuration management and automation, extension code development, guided intelligence for operations and consumer-facing chatbots. And we'll have a lot more to say about Generative AI at the NeRF Show in New York in January. And closing out my commentary on our products, I'll make a brief mention of the Manhattan Active supply chain solutions. We continue to see strong demand and win rates for our Manhattan Active Warehouse Management solution. This quarter, we'll set a record for the number of Manhattan Active WM go-lives. And like our point-of-sale, one of the real advantages of our cloud-native technology is its rapid pace of rollout. Once global design has been completed, many of our customers have been very successful using our platform technology tools to get new sites ready for fast activation. So looking to next year and beyond, Manhattan is going to continue our aggressive investments in organic innovation that not only benefit our growing customer base, but also help us continue to expand our addressable market. So that concludes my business update. Dennis will provide you with an update on our financial performance and our outlook, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis? Terrific. Thank you, Dennis. Well, clearly we're very pleased with our outstanding Q3 and year-to-date results. And while we remain appropriately cautious on the volatile macro conditions, and that's reflected in what we consider to be responsible growth targets for 2024, our business momentum and fundamentals remain very solid. Now thank you for everybody for joining the call, and thank you to our global team for all the exceptional work that they're doing for our customers. Robert, that concludes our prepared remarks and we'll be happy to take any questions at this point. Yep, 50% for the quarter, Terry. Yeah. That's a lot packed in there. Good question. So, we still continue to be focused on what we categorizes Tier 1 and Tier 2. So certainly making some progress moving the end market, but that is not where the new logos is really coming from. It's not a dip down into SMB or anything. It's really a function, I think of our innovative solutions that we're bringing to market, number one; and number two, the breadth of the portfolio that we're bringing to the market. I do expect \u2013 I don't know that we're going to maintain a 50% new logo territory every quarter. We certainly like to. We've seen it be 50% before. And as you know, we've seen it be as low as, I think 27% or something like that. We generally, again, as you know, think about overall, one-third roughly of our net new software bookings coming from new logos. That generally is how it normalized. It's been a bit higher than that for the last couple of years, but I think that's the way to \u2013 that's kind of the way to think about it. Yes. Look, the phrase I used, Terry, was we think we've set responsible targets. Given the various turbulent conditions around the world, what we think we've done is build a responsible set of growth targets, of course, including RPO. So, we are very optimistic about our market leadership position. We're very optimistic about the breadth of products, the technology, their geographic reach and so forth. But I think it would be dangerous to assume that there wasn't going to be a little bit of chop in the water, and that's what we've assumed. Thank you, Terry. Honestly, I think it's been a bad spot on, Brian. Again, kind of back to \u2013 we generally think about net new being about a third of our business. Again, we benched around a little bit between the high 20s, up to 50 now, pipeline continues to be strong. If you think about and look at net new opportunities in the pipeline, again, it's about a third or a little higher. So I think \u2013 honestly, I think we're going to see a profile or the same profile going forward. We'll see a little bit of bouncing around quarter-by-quarter. I think it will normalize on an annualized basis that somewhere around about a third net new logos. Yeah. We haven't got all the way there yet, Brian, and we'll certainly provide some of that specific commentary in the Q4 call in January. But I think we probably see a little less aggressive hiring than this year but still certainly quite solid. In the 100s, let's put it that way. Yeah. So let's see I'll maybe take it a little bit in reverse order. We saw some very nice cross-sell in the quarter, and we have done for the year, frankly. Cross-sell has been running, I think, in the 25% to 27% range. So we still like to see it there.

You need to add some kind of service capability, all of that case management can now be handled inside of our call center application as well as all of the other engagement actions, sophisticated returns, sophisticated exchanges. And \u2013 anything that you might take a real lot of manual effort. And possibly, as I think most of us had experienced, having the banks from department to department, right? Nothing more frustrating and let me put you on hold and transfer to you to that department or that department or that department. We can handle all of that customer engagement in one single solution. And that's really, as you know, where a lot of the power of our capability comes from. Thank you, Mark. Okay. Very good, Robert. Thank you very much. And thank you all for your time today, for your support of Manhattan Associates. It's a little early to say this, of course. But since I won't speak to you before, everybody, have a happy holiday season, and we'll look forward to speaking to you again in January. Bye-bye."

            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. So our Manhattan global teams continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance across top and bottom lines. This includes posting record results across RPO, revenue, operating income and earnings per share. This resulted in our Q3 and year-to-date results slightly exceeding the Rule of 50 and if our revenue growth is normalized for our Cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, both results approached the Rule of 60. FX had a minor impact in the quarter and was an approximate 1-point tailwind to revenue growth, a 2-point tailwind to year-over-year RPO growth and a 1-point headwind to sequential RPO growth. Now turning to our Q3 results. Our growth rates are reported on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. Total revenue was $238 million, up 20%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our Cloud transition, our total revenue was up 28%. Cloud revenue totaled $65 million, up 44%. And as Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $1.3 billion, up 37% compared to the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Our RPO performance was driven by a healthy mix of sales across our sales categories with notable strength from new logos. Also in the quarter, we had solid results from across our Manhattan Active suite of products. Our global services teams are knocking it out of the park, delivering record revenue, totaling $128 million, up 24% as Cloud sales continue to fuel Services revenue growth globally. Adjusted operating profit was $72 million with adjusted operating margin of 30.4%. This is up 450 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong Cloud and Services revenue growth, combined with operating leverage as our Cloud business scales. Importantly, as Eddie discussed, we continue to invest for sustainable long-term growth. This resulted in Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, up 59% and GAAP EPS of $0.79, up 68%. How about that? Included in our earnings per share is a $0.12 benefit predominantly from the US Treasury, temporary delay of foreign tax credit regulations. Removing this tax benefit, adjusted earnings per share was up 41% and GAAP earnings per share up 43%. Turning to cash. Q3 operating cash flow increased 47% to a solid $59 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow increased 27% to $158 million, which includes the payment of about $50 million in cash taxes, resulting in free cash flow margin of 24% for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue increased 26% to $215 million. We ended the quarter with $182 million in cash and zero debt, which includes $25 million in share repurchases in the quarter and $166 million year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishing of our $75 million share repurchase authority. On to our updated 2023 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins, benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. This includes a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our strong year-to-date performance and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2023 RPO revenue, operating margin and earnings per share guidance. All guidance references made on today's call will be at the midpoint of their respective ranges. As noted on prior earnings calls, our objective is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly, on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. So for the full year 2023, we expect RPO to exceed the high end of our $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range by approximately $5 million to $10 million. We expect full year total revenue to increase 19% to $914 million. This is up $24 million or about 3% higher versus our prior midpoint of $890 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 27% overall growth. For operating margin, we are increasing our midpoint to 29%, which is up 150 basis points from our prior midpoint of 27.5%. As Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business for growth. Our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook is increasing by $0.43 to $3.52, up 14% from our prior midpoint of $3.09 and up 28% from 2022. For GAAP earnings per share, our midpoint increases by $0.40 to $2.60, up 18% from our prior midpoint of $2.20 and up 28% from 2022. So in a nutshell, our 2023 guidance implies Q4 total revenue of $223 million, targeting Cloud revenue of $67.5 million, Services revenue of $115 million and Maintenance revenue of $33 million. Operating margin is targeted to be 27%, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.80. As previously mentioned on prior calls, our Q4 services revenue and operating margin accounts for retail peak seasonality, which traditionally is down sequentially as customers idle implementations to focus on their busy season. So that covers our Q4 guidance. Now I'll turn to addressing our 2024 preliminary parameters. We are currently in our early stages of our 2024 budget cycle and will firm up this outlook on our Q4 call. With that said, our preliminary total revenue is expected to increase 10% to $1 billion to $1.01 billion, representing 16% growth, excluding license and maintenance attrition. This includes our Cloud revenue target of $328 million, representing 31% year-over-year growth. To help you with comparisons, our target would be at our prior guidepost high end of $345 million if FX rates remained unchanged from October 2021 levels, which is when we provided our initial 2024 guidepost and normalized for the bankruptcies that we highlighted on our prior Q2 call. For RPO, we are targeting a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. The $1.75 billion midpoint compares favorably to our prior guidepost midpoint of $1.7 billion, and represents approximately 25% growth. For Services, our demand continues to be driven by Cloud, resulting in solid visibility. In 2024, we are targeting Services revenue of $530 million, which represents 10% year-over-year growth. On license and maintenance attrition to Cloud, we are targeting Maintenance revenue to be about $119 million, which represents a 15% decline and for License revenue to be about $4 million which is below 1% of total revenue. We anticipate operating margin to be about 28.25%. In 2024, we expect our license and maintenance revenue attrition to Cloud will result in an approximate 175 basis point headwind to operating margin. Normalized for this transition, our 2024 operating margin would expand 100 basis points year-over-year. Like prior years, in 2024, we will continue to opportunistically invest in our business and hire leading supply chain talent. We expect our 2024 tax rate to be 21.5% and diluted share count to be approximately 63 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, our preliminary 2024 parameters on an as-reported basis are: total revenue ex license and maintenance attrition to increase 16%; Cloud revenue to increase 31%; Services revenue to increase 10%; RPO to increase 25%; and for operating margin to exceed 28%. In summary, fantastic execution by the Manhattan team, and let's finish the year strong. Thank you, and back to Eddie."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, July 25, 2023. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Great. Thank you, Camilla, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates' 2023 second quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to reports Manhattan Associates filed with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note that turbulent global macro environment could impact our performance and cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Very good. Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results and discuss our increased full year 2023 outlook. Manhattan delivered record Q2 and first half results. For the quarter, total revenue increased 20% to $231 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $0.88, both exceeding our expectations. Q2 was our ninth consecutive all-time record revenue quarter. Driving top-line outperformance and earnings leverage was 44% growth in cloud revenue and 23% growth in services revenue. And this encompasses double-digit top-line growth across all our geographies as our global teams continue to execute very well for our customers. While global macro volatility continues to be persistent, Manhattan's business fundamentals are solid. Demand for our solutions are robust, customer satisfaction is high, and investment in research and development and our associates continues to widen our technological leadership across supply chain execution, omnichannel and retail point of sale markets. Now, RPO, the leading indicator of that growth, increased 38% to just over $1.2 billion. Demand for our mission-critical cloud solutions remains strong and resilient across all of our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continued to drive more than 80% of our bookings for the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter, cloud deals won include a beverage distributor, a luxury brand and specialty retailer, a food distribution services company, an office supply retailer, a technology distributor, and a home furnishing brands and manufacturer, as well as a number of others. Now year-to-date, competitive win rates continue to be pretty solid at about 75%, with 25% of our new cloud bookings being generated from net new logos. Additionally, in Q2, we had a healthy mix of conversions, upsells and cross-sells. While the timing of large deals and bookings mix will certainly vary on a quarterly basis, we believe the breadth across sales categories and products exemplifies our multiple opportunities for sustainable future growth. Foundational to our growth is the combination of our ability to deliver industry-leading solution and service to our customers. Our best-of-breed cloud native platform and solutions provide unmatched access to innovation and are a key component to our customer success, helping our clients strengthen their relationships with their end customers, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. These powerful benefits are translating into a robust solutions pipeline that has new potential customers representing about 35% of our demand. Our solid product activity is also driving our services growth and pipeline. For example, our professional services team completed over 100 go-lives in the quarter and continues to perform superbly for our customers. Now to support our growth, we're making pretty solid progress on a hiring goal of approximately 450 new associates for 2023. In Q2, we added over 150 new team members, bringing our total new hires to over 330 for the first half of the year and over 900 over the past 18 months. And while we remain appropriately cautious regarding the global economy, we continue to invest for growth. This includes strategic investments in industry innovation, further enablement of our customer success and expanding our addressable market. In late May, at our global conference, Momentum, we showcased some of our industry-leading innovation. Our customer attendance trends continue to be strong, with both 2022 and 2023 conferences running above pre-pandemic attendance levels. A part of the explanation for our continued engagement growth of Momentum is the expanded breadth of the customer personas that we serve. And this includes significant participation level increases from both store systems leadership and technologists within our customer base. And this will be the focus of my brief product update today. Now, as you'll recall from prior calls, and it's clearly noted in the recent Forrester Wave for omnichannel order management with a definitive market leader when it comes to providing store capabilities around order fulfillment. In fact, every day, nearly 100,000 store associates use our cloud native technology to ship orders to customers' homes, get them ready for pickup in curbside, and perform other critical omnichannel retail functions. Additionally, as our customers evolve their consumer experiences, we have cutting--edge advancements waiting to help them. For example, this year, we unveiled native support for RFID within our store applications and we're currently working with several leading retailers to deploy this technology. Support for RFID delivers a dramatic improvement in store inventory accuracy, a metric which has a direct impact on store fulfillment of online orders and the digital consumer experience. RFID can also deliver significant reduction in store associate labor hours. And we've also built RFID supporting that point -- into at point of sale application, so checkouts and returns are faster and easier for the customer. Now speaking of point of sale, we recently closed a new point of sale deal with a leading North American outdoor apparel brand. And this deal was notable for a few reasons, including that our point of sale is the very first application that they're subscribing to from Manhattan. While we believe more strongly than ever in the power of unification within omni channel and supply chain, it's also important to be able to compete successfully on an application by an application basis for a brand new business. Now, turning to another key customer constituency -- a constituent that was present at our Momentum conference, technologists. Ever since the first release of Manhattan Active platform in 2017, we've made it a priority to deliver new capabilities each quarter focused on the technologies within our customer base from unmatched library of API endpoints, extension points and a full extensibility focused application. The focus we have on service -- serving technologists and developers has never been more apparent. Now, it's easier than ever for our customers to tie our APIs into their broader supply chain commerce system landscape. Now, our Manhattan Active platform technology sessions at Momentum this year were frankly standing room only. But our customers weren't just there to hear about the tools for their technologists. Given the modern API-first architecture of the Manhattan Active platform, they also wanted to learn about the possibilities the OpenAI might afford us all. We believe that the combination of best-in-class supply chain commerce solutions, a modern technology architecture and generative AI has strategic and game-changing potential for all of us. But what we wanted to do at Momentum was feature some real-world working generative AI prototypes for our customers. so that we could bring the abstract to life for them. So, I thought I'd share a couple of those proof of concepts that we demonstrated at Momentum with you today. Now, one of the challenges of using best-in-class agile supply chain technology is to run the almost infinite flexibility and configurability that it offers. And whilst machine learning can help with system self-tuning, workflow adaptation and optimization through manual configuration can sometimes be pretty time consuming and sometimes even challenging, and we believe the power of natural language models can help on both fronts, by providing superfast and easy access to key documentation, knowledge bases and explainer videos, but also by giving our customers the ability to configure our application directly from text-based dialogue. Once fully productized, this powerful facility will allow us -- allow for both faster initial implementation of our systems and the ability to quickly adapt configurations to changing business conditions and new innovation. And we've also had some initial success by using large language models to write code. During an implementation, for example, integration to our systems into the broader ecosystem can sometimes be one of the proverbial long poles in the tent. But in our labs, we've seen these LLMs successfully develop integration code across several key endpoints. And whilst progress in this area is very early, it is meaningful and very encouraging nonetheless. And my final example is we're also optimistic about this technology's ability to deliver strategic step change in chatbots, focused on the end consumer. Chatbot technology of the past has certainly successfully automated simple questions and answers around things like order and delivery status, but by and large these capabilities have been confined to a pretty finite and fairly narrow set of capabilities. Using LLMs, we think the range of what chatbots can do can expand enormously. And given our focus on all things customer service related is a real opportunity to deliver next-generation end consumer experiences around chatbot and customer engagement. As you can probably tell, we're pretty excited about the potential opportunities around LLMs, and we'll continue to work and collaborate with our technology partners to progress our strategy into the future. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on the financial performance and our outlook. And then, I'll close our prepared remarks with a very brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis?\nDennis Story: Okay. Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute very well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance across top-line growth, operating margin and cash flow. This includes posting record results across revenue, RPO, adjusted operating margin and earnings per share. On an as reported basis, our Q2 results came in at the Rule of 50, and if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceeded the Rule of 50. FX really did not have a meaningful impact to RPO or revenue in the quarter. Also in reviewing our strong financial performance, growth rates are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Looking at total revenue. Total revenue was $230 million, up 20%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 27%. Cloud revenue totaled $61 million, up 44%. As Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $1.2 billion, up 38% compared to the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Our RPO performance was a healthy, healthy mix of sales across our sales categories, including conversions, new logos and upsells, cross-sells, as well as solid results from our Manhattan Active suite of products. We also experienced some larger deals push on a timing combined with a few customers experiencing bankruptcies. While immaterial as a percentage of RPO, without the bankruptcy contraction, our sequential RPO increase would have been roughly in line with Q1 or about $100 million. Also as of June 30, 98% of our RPO represents cloud-native subscriptions. Global services smoked it, delivering record revenue, totaling $125 million, up 23% as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Adjusted operating profit, we like profit, was $68 million, with adjusted operating margin of 29.6%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth, combined with operating leverage as our cloud business scales. Importantly, as Eddie discussed, we continue to also invest for future growth. This resulted in Q2 earnings per share of $0.88, up 28%, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.63, up 29%. We don't take GAAP for granted. Turning to cash. Operating cash flow was a solid $41 million with timing of collections driving the year-over-year change. This resulted in free cash flow margin of 17% for the quarter, with year-to-date free cash flow margin totaling 22%. Year-to-date operating cash flow increased 18% to $99 million, and includes absorbing about $37 million in cash taxes paid in the first half of the year. For the full year 2023, we are on pace to pay approximately $75 million to Uncle Sam in cash taxes. Moving to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue increased 28% to $227 million. We ended the quarter with $153 million in cash and zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $67 million in share repurchases in the quarter, resulting in $141 million in buybacks year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. On to our updated 2023 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top-line growth and top-quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. This includes a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our strong first half performance and increasing visibility, we are again raising our 2023 revenue, operating margin and EPS guidance. We are also reiterating our 2023 RPO guidepost range and midpoint of $1.35 billion. Consistent with our recent earnings releases, our guidepost and guidance ranges can be found in today's earnings release, supplemental schedules. All guidance references made on today's call will be the midpoint of their respective ranges. As noted on prior earnings calls, we will be updating our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly, on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. So for full year 2023, we expect total revenue of $890 million, up $30 million or 3% from our prior midpoint of $860 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 24% growth. All in, our target is 16%. For Q3, we expect total revenue of $226 million, with 24% year-over-year growth ex license and maintenance. All in, our target is 14%. And for operating margin, we are increasing our midpoint to 27.5%, up from our prior midpoint of 26.5%. Included in this outlook is a 150-plus basis points headwind from the reduction in license and maintenance revenue. As Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we are continuing to invest in our business. At the midpoint, we are targeting Q3 operating margin of 27% and 24.3% in Q4, which accounts for retail peak seasonality. Our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook is increasing by $0.21 to $3.09, up 7% from our prior midpoint of $2.88. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 to be $0.77 and $0.65 in Q4, which again accounts for Q4 retail peak seasonality. For GAAP earnings per share, our midpoint increases by $0.17 to $2.20, up 8% from our prior $2.03 midpoint. And for Q3, we are targeting GAAP earnings per share of $0.53. Here are some additional details on our 2023 outlook. We are increasing our cloud revenue midpoint to $247 million, representing 40% growth, and is up 3% from our prior midpoint of $240 million. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $63 million in Q3 and about $66 million in Q4. For services, we are increasing our forecast of $473 million to $479 million. The $476 million midpoint represents 21% growth, and is up $17 million or 4% from our prior $459 million midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 services revenue of $125 million and $110 million in Q4, which accounts for retail peak seasonality. For maintenance, we are targeting $131.5 million or an 8% decline. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 at $31 million and Q4 at $29 million. We expect hardware revenue of about $5.5 million per quarter and expect license of $1.5 million per quarter. For consolidation subscription, maintenance and services margin, we continue to target about 54% for the full year. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting approximately 54.5% in Q3 and 53.5% in Q4 on retail peak seasonality. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% and our diluted share count to be 62.6 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So, in summary, solid execution by the Manhattan global team and a great Q2 and first half performance. Thank you, and back to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Very good. Thank you, Dennis. Well, we're pleased. We're pleased with our second quarter and our first half results. And while we certainly continue to be appropriately cautious on the volatile macro conditions, Manhattan's business momentum remains positive. And we're just very optimistic about our long-term market opportunity. So, thank you, everybody, for joining the call, and thank you to our global team for all of the really terrific work that you're doing for our customers out there. Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. And Camilla, we'd be happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTerry Tillman: Hey, good afternoon, Eddie, Dennis and Mike. Great GAAP earnings performance, by the way, in the quarter. Maybe, Eddie, I got a question for you and then, Dennis, I had a two-parter for you. I guess first question for you, Eddie. I mean it's a really important event every year, you all put a lot of effort into it in terms of Momentum. The kind of the theme around Unified Commerce, I think, is intriguing. How does that resonate with some of the interactions and maybe even some of the prospects there at the conference? Because what I'm getting at is they're using a lot of tools probably to do buy online, pick up in store, but it's a lot of point solutions. Do you all see an opportunity, whether it's like that POS win or with your OMS or your other store-level technologies to almost start to be able to create a vendor consolidation play and actually win net new business that way versus just like a WMS deal?\nEddie Capel: Yes. I mean, that's certainly part of the strategy, Terry. And the good news is that across our OMS and store systems customer base, we're leading with different capabilities, frankly, and then gradually rolling out more and more capabilities as those customers need them. And certainly, you can feel some of the vendor consolidation play, as you call it, coming into play and certainly part of the strategy and seems to be taking hold.\nTerry Tillman: That's good to hear. And I guess, maybe, Dennis, a follow-up question, the two-parter. The first part is, you definitely handily beat my RPO addition estimate, but I think you did call out a couple of things and puts and takes. I'm curious around a couple of maybe larger deals slipping in the quarter. Is that something that you think timing-wise can be made up in the second half of the year? Or just how do you think about that going forward? And then, the second part -- and I can repeat all this because I'm long-winded. The second part is just we're getting further and further along through this transformation, both in the business model and the financial model. I'm curious about the visibility as you look into '24 and '25. And just how it's shaping up, both on subscription revenue and services? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, I'll take just that front-end piece of lumpiness and kind of deals moving around. Terry, that hasn't changed in the -- frankly, in the 23 years or so that I've been here, you used the expression puts and takes, and that's what it is. And it's always going to be a little lumpy. We feel like we had a pretty solid Q2 actually. And, hey, there's always seems like there's a couple that got away, but we'll pick those up at the down the river a little bit.\nDennis Story: Yes. Just the final point, Terry, is visibility is great. We've got a super pipeline in front of us. We've got to execute, obviously, but real happy with the visibility.\nTerry Tillman: Okay. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Very good. Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Eddie, maybe just starting with you, you spent some time on generative AI in your prepared remarks. I'm curious to think about the magnitude of what that could do for you guys internally. I know that's early. And as you guys have kind of built this microservices cloud architecture, what does that do to the monetization potential of the business longer term?\nEddie Capel: Well, certainly, we think it's got a ton of potential, for sure. There is -- a little aside, I think all of us are wondering exactly how much this is going to cost. So, we've got to figure -- as we move forward with the practicalities of implementing generative AI, we've got to make sure that we keep our eye on the return on investment, both for internal usage and for our customers. But there is no question that we are, what can only be described, as fortunate. When we designed and architected API-first micro services architecture a number of years ago, we did know that generative AI was on sort of the horizon. But the fact of the matter is, in order to be able to really benefit from the implementation of generative AI, you need an API-first architecture. It's pretty hard to banks generative AI up against the monolithic architecture, because it really doesn't have very good years and doesn't have a matter to speak back. So, we feel very fortunate about that. As I mentioned, we're in the early stages, but whether it be from a knowledge-based perspective, a navigation perspective, a configuration perspective and a code generation perspective, I sort of highlighted all of those just a little bit today, we are doing real work and creating real proof of concepts, so that as the technology hardens and becomes more regularly available, we are right on the forefront of being able to, a, use the capability to increase our internal efficiency, but also be able to offer a differentiated capability to our customers.\nBrian Peterson: Great. Thanks for the perspective, Eddie. And maybe just one on hiring, very good progress this quarter. I'm just curious, has the hiring environment eased at all? And given what you've seen in RPO, was there a temptation to kind of raise that hiring target for the year? Thanks, guys.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Look, we've got a pretty healthy target. We did 550 or so last year. 450 is the target for this year. We're on track for that. And no, hiring hasn't got any easier. Now bear in mind, we're after the top technical talent on the planet and nothing has waned in terms of that demand profile. But we're still at it. And we think that if there are folks out there that are looking for a place to invest their career than a market-leading company using forward and modern technology like ours is a really terrific place.\nDennis Story: Pretty solid operating margin adding that headcount, Brian.\nEddie Capel: Yes.\nBrian Peterson: Yes, it is. Good. Nice job, guys.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. Maybe just a discussion on point of sale and how big that business could become over time, and maybe one way to tackle the question, so if I just think about the size of the order management business and appreciating how long Active Omni has been in market, do you think that's maybe a relevant starting point for how big point of sale could be? And could point-of-sale approach that size over a similar point in its life cycle? I guess, what are kind of the puts and takes as you think about forecasting that business, because it's obviously a much larger TAM but also comparably newer offering from Manhattan?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Good question, Joe. I think the opportunity for point of sale is -- for us, is at least as big as our warehouse management system business. Now that is sort of on a go-forward basis, right? I mean, we're not going to pick up 30 years of WMS revenue and everything that goes along with that in a short period of time. But if you were to damn that up, start the clock over, over time, I think the opportunity for us is point of sale can be as big as WMS. So in other words, bigger than OMS.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Very good. And then, just following up on RPO. So good bookings quarter, some big deals slipped, but good bookings, nonetheless. Is kind of the read here that if big deals slipped a bit, then this quarter just had a standout volume of deals and the volume of transactions made up the difference? And I guess if that's true, and we are looking at a higher volume of transactions, does that suggest anything about maybe underlying market health or just how you think about handicapping pipeline conversion? Because it sounds like the pipeline is also in a good spot.\nEddie Capel: No, I don't think there's really anything to read, Joe, to be perfectly honest into one quarter. And I know we frankly get a little boring with how frequently we repeat that there is opportunity for lumpiness in all kinds of different ways, whether it be big deals, new logo acquisition, customer migrations, all those kinds of things. And they do. They bounce around every quarter. And there was nothing really particularly different. When you look across multiple quarters, there was nothing particularly different about this quarter than any other. It was a little different to last quarter, but next quarter will be a little bit different to the one that we've just concluded. So, I really don't think there's anything to read into one 90-day period in that regard.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Joe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to first ask on the commentary around bankruptcies. I think you said it would have been closer to $100 million in sequential RPO added, if it weren't for those, basically implying a $15 million impact. Was that all driven by one customer, or were there multiple customers in that number?\nEddie Capel: A small handful of customers.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. Got it. And then I wanted to follow up on the commentary around the point of sale customer that you added and that, that was the first product that they elected to go with Manhattan. Maybe just a little bit more detail on how that came about? And do they have a roadmap to add additional products from you?\nEddie Capel: Yes, I think -- look, it's -- there's no guarantee there. We've got to execute well on the work in front of us to be able to garner more business from this customer. But this was a full-on RFP-driven multi-vendor selection process for a standalone point of sale system. Nothing else alongside it, and really nothing else being considered. And that's really why we called it out. As you know, we're very high on the opportunity around whether it be commerce or supply chain unification. But our ability to be able to, frankly, beat the best of the best in the point of sale industry on the merits of that particular product alone was encouraging.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it, guys.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Our pleasure, Matt. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Schappel: Hi. Thank you for taking my question and nice job on the quarter. Eddie, starting with you, with respect to the new Active Yard Management solution that you introduced at the user conference. I was wondering if -- I know it's still early, but I was wondering if you could just add some additional insight in maybe some of the interest you're seeing around the solution and what type of customers are giving you the most interest?\nEddie Capel: Yes. We're excited about it, Mark. And look, it's not the biggest product that we've ever released, of course, but it's sort of an important one. Yard Management is, as you know, the physical intersection and unification, the physical unification of WMS and TMS is where those things kind of come together. And so, we're excited to get out in the field. We're seeing good early interest. And currently, the plan is to have the first live customer in the fall of this year. So pretty good early adoption, frankly.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Great. And then kind of building on that question. Product-wise, at the user conference, you mentioned that the company is kind of focused on filling in the white space between the solutions. And I think Yard Management is one of those white spaces. I was wondering if you could just give us some insights maybe what some of the other white spaces might look like?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Obviously, without getting into the specifics, which I'd get my wrist slapped by all kinds of people if I got into the specifics, Mark, but there's a healthy amount of white space still in the supply chain execution area. So, in the -- still inside the four walls of the distribution center, certainly, the extended execution portfolio, and also around the commerce space. There is, frankly, still a lot to be done. And there's a lot of changes shaping up in the commerce space. Whereas there used to be a very strong powerful e-commerce platforms, such names as WebSphere Commerce, Hybris, ATG and the like. We're certainly seeing those channels truly starting to collapse from a technology perspective now and certainly more headless approaches to bringing those physical stores and e-commerce stores together. And of course, we're right in the middle of all of that. So a lot of opportunities still in front of us and a lot of places for us to deploy our 1,000-plus research and development engineers.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thanks. That's all from me.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Mark. Thank you very much for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question is from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks. Great quarter, gentlemen. Just wanted to ask, for starters, more of a macro question. I noticed the EMEA region kind of grew 29% this quarter. It seems to be doing fairly well in what I perceive as a slightly more difficult macro environment there. I'm just wondering if you can give us your sense of how the geographies are looking comparably. And maybe back to sort of at the beginning of this year when you set your guidance for 2023, are we trending about the same generally from your perspective, or are things getting worse or better?\nEddie Capel: About the same from a geographic performance perspective. There are a couple of spots I don't want to overstate them because -- but they have moved on us a little bit. The U.K. is frankly pretty flat. We had thought there might be a little more supply chain expansion as a function of Brexit and the movement of goods across borders not being quite so straightforward. So that's a little flatter than maybe than we expected. We thought China might bounce back a little faster, particularly on the luxury side of the world than it has. So there are a couple of spots that deviated from our original plan, but as part of the reason we have a multi-geography business here, so we can absorb those ups and downs. And again, I don't want to make a big deal of either of those, I'm just giving you a couple of examples. Sure, there's a few things that are moved around on us a little bit. We put what we thought was a perfect plan together, and guess what, it's changed along the way. And my guess is it will change just a little bit even between now and the end of the year, probably.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay. Great. Thanks, Eddie. And then just back on the product side for a moment, your commentary and some of the things you were talking about at Momentum, what would you say sitting back here with a crystal ball? What do you think are going to be the most impactful areas for Manhattan Associates with leveraging some of this new technology?\nEddie Capel: Well, look, we've got a market-leading position with next-generation warehouse management. And I think that the continued need for distribution -- advanced distribution capability is going to continue for as far as we can see. Our order management suite of solutions is market-leading as well. And certainly, there's the continued evolution of the commerce side of the world. Bringing together transportation management, warehouse management, inventory management, commerce solutions and a unified suite of solutions has a great deal of promise and upside for us. If you were to ask me what has got the greatest CAGR opportunity, it would be our point of sale solution, simply because we are so early to the game in a market that is being disrupted. So maybe if the question is where do we maybe get the most -- the single most leverage, it may be there because the potential for CAGR is greatest.\nBlair Abernethy: Great. Thanks very much, guys.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Blair. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to CEO and President, Eddie Capel, for closing comments.\nEddie Capel: Terrific. Thank you, Camilla. Well, I'll just say thank you very much for your time, your support and your diligence. We would appreciate getting on these calls and sharing our results and listening to the feedback. And we look forward to doing the same again about 90 days from now. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Very good. Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our second quarter results and discuss our increased full year 2023 outlook. Manhattan delivered record Q2 and first half results. For the quarter, total revenue increased 20% to $231 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $0.88, both exceeding our expectations. Q2 was our ninth consecutive all-time record revenue quarter. Driving top-line outperformance and earnings leverage was 44% growth in cloud revenue and 23% growth in services revenue. And this encompasses double-digit top-line growth across all our geographies as our global teams continue to execute very well for our customers. While global macro volatility continues to be persistent, Manhattan's business fundamentals are solid. Demand for our solutions are robust, customer satisfaction is high, and investment in research and development and our associates continues to widen our technological leadership across supply chain execution, omnichannel and retail point of sale markets. Now, RPO, the leading indicator of that growth, increased 38% to just over $1.2 billion. Demand for our mission-critical cloud solutions remains strong and resilient across all of our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continued to drive more than 80% of our bookings for the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter, cloud deals won include a beverage distributor, a luxury brand and specialty retailer, a food distribution services company, an office supply retailer, a technology distributor, and a home furnishing brands and manufacturer, as well as a number of others. Now year-to-date, competitive win rates continue to be pretty solid at about 75%, with 25% of our new cloud bookings being generated from net new logos. Additionally, in Q2, we had a healthy mix of conversions, upsells and cross-sells. While the timing of large deals and bookings mix will certainly vary on a quarterly basis, we believe the breadth across sales categories and products exemplifies our multiple opportunities for sustainable future growth. Foundational to our growth is the combination of our ability to deliver industry-leading solution and service to our customers. Our best-of-breed cloud native platform and solutions provide unmatched access to innovation and are a key component to our customer success, helping our clients strengthen their relationships with their end customers, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. These powerful benefits are translating into a robust solutions pipeline that has new potential customers representing about 35% of our demand. Our solid product activity is also driving our services growth and pipeline. For example, our professional services team completed over 100 go-lives in the quarter and continues to perform superbly for our customers. Now to support our growth, we're making pretty solid progress on a hiring goal of approximately 450 new associates for 2023. In Q2, we added over 150 new team members, bringing our total new hires to over 330 for the first half of the year and over 900 over the past 18 months. And while we remain appropriately cautious regarding the global economy, we continue to invest for growth. This includes strategic investments in industry innovation, further enablement of our customer success and expanding our addressable market. In late May, at our global conference, Momentum, we showcased some of our industry-leading innovation. Our customer attendance trends continue to be strong, with both 2022 and 2023 conferences running above pre-pandemic attendance levels. A part of the explanation for our continued engagement growth of Momentum is the expanded breadth of the customer personas that we serve. And this includes significant participation level increases from both store systems leadership and technologists within our customer base. And this will be the focus of my brief product update today. Now, as you'll recall from prior calls, and it's clearly noted in the recent Forrester Wave for omnichannel order management with a definitive market leader when it comes to providing store capabilities around order fulfillment. In fact, every day, nearly 100,000 store associates use our cloud native technology to ship orders to customers' homes, get them ready for pickup in curbside, and perform other critical omnichannel retail functions. Additionally, as our customers evolve their consumer experiences, we have cutting--edge advancements waiting to help them. For example, this year, we unveiled native support for RFID within our store applications and we're currently working with several leading retailers to deploy this technology. Support for RFID delivers a dramatic improvement in store inventory accuracy, a metric which has a direct impact on store fulfillment of online orders and the digital consumer experience. RFID can also deliver significant reduction in store associate labor hours. And we've also built RFID supporting that point -- into at point of sale application, so checkouts and returns are faster and easier for the customer. Now speaking of point of sale, we recently closed a new point of sale deal with a leading North American outdoor apparel brand. And this deal was notable for a few reasons, including that our point of sale is the very first application that they're subscribing to from Manhattan. While we believe more strongly than ever in the power of unification within omni channel and supply chain, it's also important to be able to compete successfully on an application by an application basis for a brand new business. Now, turning to another key customer constituency -- a constituent that was present at our Momentum conference, technologists. Ever since the first release of Manhattan Active platform in 2017, we've made it a priority to deliver new capabilities each quarter focused on the technologies within our customer base from unmatched library of API endpoints, extension points and a full extensibility focused application. The focus we have on service -- serving technologists and developers has never been more apparent. Now, it's easier than ever for our customers to tie our APIs into their broader supply chain commerce system landscape. Now, our Manhattan Active platform technology sessions at Momentum this year were frankly standing room only. But our customers weren't just there to hear about the tools for their technologists. Given the modern API-first architecture of the Manhattan Active platform, they also wanted to learn about the possibilities the OpenAI might afford us all. We believe that the combination of best-in-class supply chain commerce solutions, a modern technology architecture and generative AI has strategic and game-changing potential for all of us. But what we wanted to do at Momentum was feature some real-world working generative AI prototypes for our customers. so that we could bring the abstract to life for them. So, I thought I'd share a couple of those proof of concepts that we demonstrated at Momentum with you today. Now, one of the challenges of using best-in-class agile supply chain technology is to run the almost infinite flexibility and configurability that it offers. And whilst machine learning can help with system self-tuning, workflow adaptation and optimization through manual configuration can sometimes be pretty time consuming and sometimes even challenging, and we believe the power of natural language models can help on both fronts, by providing superfast and easy access to key documentation, knowledge bases and explainer videos, but also by giving our customers the ability to configure our application directly from text-based dialogue. Once fully productized, this powerful facility will allow us -- allow for both faster initial implementation of our systems and the ability to quickly adapt configurations to changing business conditions and new innovation. And we've also had some initial success by using large language models to write code. During an implementation, for example, integration to our systems into the broader ecosystem can sometimes be one of the proverbial long poles in the tent. But in our labs, we've seen these LLMs successfully develop integration code across several key endpoints. And whilst progress in this area is very early, it is meaningful and very encouraging nonetheless. And my final example is we're also optimistic about this technology's ability to deliver strategic step change in chatbots, focused on the end consumer. Chatbot technology of the past has certainly successfully automated simple questions and answers around things like order and delivery status, but by and large these capabilities have been confined to a pretty finite and fairly narrow set of capabilities. Using LLMs, we think the range of what chatbots can do can expand enormously. And given our focus on all things customer service related is a real opportunity to deliver next-generation end consumer experiences around chatbot and customer engagement. As you can probably tell, we're pretty excited about the potential opportunities around LLMs, and we'll continue to work and collaborate with our technology partners to progress our strategy into the future. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on the financial performance and our outlook. And then, I'll close our prepared remarks with a very brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis? Very good. Thank you, Dennis. Well, we're pleased. We're pleased with our second quarter and our first half results. And while we certainly continue to be appropriately cautious on the volatile macro conditions, Manhattan's business momentum remains positive. And we're just very optimistic about our long-term market opportunity. So, thank you, everybody, for joining the call, and thank you to our global team for all of the really terrific work that you're doing for our customers out there. Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. And Camilla, we'd be happy to take any questions. Yes. I mean, that's certainly part of the strategy, Terry. And the good news is that across our OMS and store systems customer base, we're leading with different capabilities, frankly, and then gradually rolling out more and more capabilities as those customers need them. And certainly, you can feel some of the vendor consolidation play, as you call it, coming into play and certainly part of the strategy and seems to be taking hold. Yes. Well, I'll take just that front-end piece of lumpiness and kind of deals moving around. Terry, that hasn't changed in the -- frankly, in the 23 years or so that I've been here, you used the expression puts and takes, and that's what it is. And it's always going to be a little lumpy. We feel like we had a pretty solid Q2 actually. And, hey, there's always seems like there's a couple that got away, but we'll pick those up at the down the river a little bit. Very good. Thank you, Terry. Well, certainly, we think it's got a ton of potential, for sure. There is -- a little aside, I think all of us are wondering exactly how much this is going to cost. So, we've got to figure -- as we move forward with the practicalities of implementing generative AI, we've got to make sure that we keep our eye on the return on investment, both for internal usage and for our customers. But there is no question that we are, what can only be described, as fortunate. When we designed and architected API-first micro services architecture a number of years ago, we did know that generative AI was on sort of the horizon. But the fact of the matter is, in order to be able to really benefit from the implementation of generative AI, you need an API-first architecture. It's pretty hard to banks generative AI up against the monolithic architecture, because it really doesn't have very good years and doesn't have a matter to speak back. So, we feel very fortunate about that. As I mentioned, we're in the early stages, but whether it be from a knowledge-based perspective, a navigation perspective, a configuration perspective and a code generation perspective, I sort of highlighted all of those just a little bit today, we are doing real work and creating real proof of concepts, so that as the technology hardens and becomes more regularly available, we are right on the forefront of being able to, a, use the capability to increase our internal efficiency, but also be able to offer a differentiated capability to our customers. Yes. Look, we've got a pretty healthy target. We did 550 or so last year. 450 is the target for this year. We're on track for that. And no, hiring hasn't got any easier. Now bear in mind, we're after the top technical talent on the planet and nothing has waned in terms of that demand profile. But we're still at it. And we think that if there are folks out there that are looking for a place to invest their career than a market-leading company using forward and modern technology like ours is a really terrific place. Yes. Thank you, Brian. Yes. Good question, Joe. I think the opportunity for point of sale is -- for us, is at least as big as our warehouse management system business. Now that is sort of on a go-forward basis, right? I mean, we're not going to pick up 30 years of WMS revenue and everything that goes along with that in a short period of time. But if you were to damn that up, start the clock over, over time, I think the opportunity for us is point of sale can be as big as WMS. So in other words, bigger than OMS. No, I don't think there's really anything to read, Joe, to be perfectly honest into one quarter.

And they do. They bounce around every quarter. And there was nothing really particularly different. When you look across multiple quarters, there was nothing particularly different about this quarter than any other. It was a little different to last quarter, but next quarter will be a little bit different to the one that we've just concluded. So, I really don't think there's anything to read into one 90-day period in that regard. Our pleasure, Joe. Thank you. A small handful of customers. Yes, I think -- look, it's -- there's no guarantee there. We've got to execute well on the work in front of us to be able to garner more business from this customer. But this was a full-on RFP-driven multi-vendor selection process for a standalone point of sale system. Nothing else alongside it, and really nothing else being considered.

Our pleasure, Mark. Thank you very much for your time. About the same from a geographic performance perspective. There are a couple of spots I don't want to overstate them because -- but they have moved on us a little bit. The U.K. is frankly pretty flat. We had thought there might be a little more supply chain expansion as a function of Brexit and the movement of goods across borders not being quite so straightforward. So that's a little flatter than maybe than we expected. We thought China might bounce back a little faster, particularly on the luxury side of the world than it has. So there are a couple of spots that deviated from our original plan, but as part of the reason we have a multi-geography business here, so we can absorb those ups and downs.

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute very well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance across top-line growth, operating margin and cash flow. This includes posting record results across revenue, RPO, adjusted operating margin and earnings per share. On an as reported basis, our Q2 results came in at the Rule of 50, and if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceeded the Rule of 50. FX really did not have a meaningful impact to RPO or revenue in the quarter. Also in reviewing our strong financial performance, growth rates are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Looking at total revenue. Total revenue was $230 million, up 20%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 27%. Cloud revenue totaled $61 million, up 44%. As Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $1.2 billion, up 38% compared to the prior year and up 7% sequentially. Our RPO performance was a healthy, healthy mix of sales across our sales categories, including conversions, new logos and upsells, cross-sells, as well as solid results from our Manhattan Active suite of products. We also experienced some larger deals push on a timing combined with a few customers experiencing bankruptcies. While immaterial as a percentage of RPO, without the bankruptcy contraction, our sequential RPO increase would have been roughly in line with Q1 or about $100 million. Also as of June 30, 98% of our RPO represents cloud-native subscriptions. Global services smoked it, delivering record revenue, totaling $125 million, up 23% as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Adjusted operating profit, we like profit, was $68 million, with adjusted operating margin of 29.6%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth, combined with operating leverage as our cloud business scales. Importantly, as Eddie discussed, we continue to also invest for future growth. This resulted in Q2 earnings per share of $0.88, up 28%, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.63, up 29%. We don't take GAAP for granted. Turning to cash. Operating cash flow was a solid $41 million with timing of collections driving the year-over-year change. This resulted in free cash flow margin of 17% for the quarter, with year-to-date free cash flow margin totaling 22%. Year-to-date operating cash flow increased 18% to $99 million, and includes absorbing about $37 million in cash taxes paid in the first half of the year. For the full year 2023, we are on pace to pay approximately $75 million to Uncle Sam in cash taxes. Moving to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue increased 28% to $227 million. We ended the quarter with $153 million in cash and zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $67 million in share repurchases in the quarter, resulting in $141 million in buybacks year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. On to our updated 2023 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top-line growth and top-quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. This includes a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our strong first half performance and increasing visibility, we are again raising our 2023 revenue, operating margin and EPS guidance. We are also reiterating our 2023 RPO guidepost range and midpoint of $1.35 billion. Consistent with our recent earnings releases, our guidepost and guidance ranges can be found in today's earnings release, supplemental schedules. All guidance references made on today's call will be the midpoint of their respective ranges. As noted on prior earnings calls, we will be updating our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly, on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. So for full year 2023, we expect total revenue of $890 million, up $30 million or 3% from our prior midpoint of $860 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 24% growth. All in, our target is 16%. For Q3, we expect total revenue of $226 million, with 24% year-over-year growth ex license and maintenance. All in, our target is 14%. And for operating margin, we are increasing our midpoint to 27.5%, up from our prior midpoint of 26.5%. Included in this outlook is a 150-plus basis points headwind from the reduction in license and maintenance revenue. As Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we are continuing to invest in our business. At the midpoint, we are targeting Q3 operating margin of 27% and 24.3% in Q4, which accounts for retail peak seasonality. Our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook is increasing by $0.21 to $3.09, up 7% from our prior midpoint of $2.88. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 to be $0.77 and $0.65 in Q4, which again accounts for Q4 retail peak seasonality. For GAAP earnings per share, our midpoint increases by $0.17 to $2.20, up 8% from our prior $2.03 midpoint. And for Q3, we are targeting GAAP earnings per share of $0.53. Here are some additional details on our 2023 outlook. We are increasing our cloud revenue midpoint to $247 million, representing 40% growth, and is up 3% from our prior midpoint of $240 million. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $63 million in Q3 and about $66 million in Q4. For services, we are increasing our forecast of $473 million to $479 million. The $476 million midpoint represents 21% growth, and is up $17 million or 4% from our prior $459 million midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 services revenue of $125 million and $110 million in Q4, which accounts for retail peak seasonality. For maintenance, we are targeting $131.5 million or an 8% decline. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 at $31 million and Q4 at $29 million. We expect hardware revenue of about $5.5 million per quarter and expect license of $1.5 million per quarter. For consolidation subscription, maintenance and services margin, we continue to target about 54% for the full year. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting approximately 54.5% in Q3 and 53.5% in Q4 on retail peak seasonality. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% and our diluted share count to be 62.6 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So, in summary, solid execution by the Manhattan global team and a great Q2 and first half performance. Thank you, and back to Eddie. Yes. Just the final point, Terry, is visibility is great. We've got a super pipeline in front of us. We've got to execute, obviously, but real happy with the visibility. Pretty solid operating margin adding that headcount, Brian."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Great. Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates 2023 first quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the reports Manhattan Associates filed with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note in particular that turbulent global macro environment could impact our performance and cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter results and discuss our updated full year 2023 outlook. Well, Manhattan Associates is off to a strong start in 2023, reporting record results. Q1 total revenue was $221 million, up 24% as reported and 33% if normalized for our cloud transition. Earnings per share was $0.80, also up 33%. Both this top and bottom line results exceeded our expectations. Demand is strong, customer satisfaction is high and our growing investment in research and development has positioned Manhattan as the leading innovator in supply chain execution, omni-channel solutions and retail point-of-sale. And these favorable characteristics contributed to Q1 being our eighth consecutive record revenue quarter, highlighted by year-over-year 53% growth in cloud revenue, 29% growth in services revenue, and 20% revenue growth across all our geographies. And these strong results drove our top line outperformance and solid earnings leverage in the quarter. RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 42% to $1.2 billion over Q1 2022 as demand for our mission-critical cloud solutions continues to be strong and resilient across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continued to drive more than 80% of our bookings for the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub-verticals are nicely diversified. For example, in the quarter, cloud deals won include a discount retailer, a health solutions company, a grocery retailer, an industrial manufacturer, a specialty retailer of automotive parts and a fashion brand as well as a number of others. Win rates in the quarter were about 75%, with 25% of new cloud bookings being generated from net new logos. And additionally, whilst the mix of bookings will vary on a quarterly basis, we had notable cross-sell strength in the quarter. And as discussed in prior calls, Manhattans' cloud-native platform makes unifying mission-critical commerce and supply chain systems a real option versus simply an aspiration. For our customers, this can result in reduced IT complexity, increased revenue and improved profitability. And for Manhattan, it's a natural catalyst to extend our best-of-breed product footprint within our existing customer base. And this differentiation provides Manhattan Active Solutions with another clear advantage over our competition. Our strong product activity continues to drive our services pipeline and growth. Importantly, our Professional Services team continues to perform very well for our customers and completed well over 100 go-lives in the quarter. Our solution pipeline remains robust with encouraging demands across our product suites with new potential customers representing about 35% of our total pipeline. And while we remain appropriately cautious regarding the global economy, we continue to set aggressive growth and investment goals. This includes strategic investments in industry-leading innovation, further enablement of customer success, and expanding our addressable market. From a hiring standpoint, we continue to anticipate adding roughly 400 to 500 new employees this year and have already welcomed over 150 new employees to the Manhattan family just in Q1 alone. Now, turning to the product front. Each year around about this time, we participate in a definitive vendor landscape -- set of definitive landscape studies for our WMS, TMS, and OMS applications. For WMS and TMS, Gartner publishes an annual Magic Quadrant report. And for OMS, Forrester publishes the Omnichannel Wave report every other year. And while the results of the WMS Magic Quadrant won't be released until early next month, we're hopeful to make it 15 consecutive times as a definitive leader for WMS in this report. And for TMS though, I'm happy to share for the fifth consecutive year -- or fifth consecutive time actually, we've been named a leader in the TMS Magic Quadrant. And our commitment to high levels of investment and innovation in TMS is born in both the strong showing in the MQ and strong levels of project activity across four continents. The Forrester Omnichannel OMS Wave was published this month. And for the second consecutive time, Manhattan Associates is the only leader in the Wave. Having a single leader across consecutive Waves, given its -- the report only comes out every two years, is highly unusual and it reflects our technical strength and unmatched functionality that has been generated from our 18 years of strong investment in this critical solution. And as the Forrester analysis shows, no vendor really comes close to matching our depth and breadth of capability across customer service, inventory availability, real-time order promising, fulfillment optimization and in-store execution. And of course, we deliver each of WMS and TMS and OMS on our industry-leading and unified Manhattan Active platform, which is our cloud-native application architecture and development platform. And Manhattan Active WM continues its strong performance measured in terms of new wins and successful customer adoption and go-lives. Now with over 100 Manhattan Active WM customers, we continue our strong track record of being selected to run the largest and most sophisticated supply chains. And we also continue to strengthen our diversity of industry and geographic coverage. Shifting gears just a little bit to our omni-channel solutions, we are happy to report that we took another very significant customer live with our point-of-sale solution this quarter. And in addition to delivering our cloud-native point-of-sale across their store fleet, we also executed a three-channel order management go-live simultaneously. Our OMS is really unique in its ability to simultaneously optimize retail, wholesale, and e-commerce orders. And this combined with our point-of-sale gives us the ability to help this particular customer deliver omni-channel operational excellence and to provide a technology template for a number of other significant specialty apparel brand within their group. At the Momentum this year, we're thrilled to have a number of point-of-sale customers presenting on the value that they're deriving from the rollout of our omni-channel point-of-sale. Now, speaking of Momentum, our annual user conference which is coming up here in a month or so, I will be in Scottsdale, Arizona, one of our favorite venues. And this year's theme is moving life and commerce forward. And we, our customers, and our partners will bring that theme to life in many creative and informative ways, and we're excited. We're excited to have our customer and our partner community come together with so many critical supply chain commerce topics to discuss at this time. We'll also be demonstrating the unique advantages that we deliver when we assemble multiple Manhattan Active applications together. The Manhattan Active architecture empowers our customers and our partners to leverage their creativity and technical prowess, to start with our market-leading application functionality and to extend it to do -- to drive even more positive change for their businesses and their customers. And finally, we're very excited about the advanced work that we're doing determining how to best take advantage and leverage modern natural language models like ChatGPT and Bard, another topic that we'll be presenting on and discussing in detail at Momentum. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. So our Manhattan global teams continue to execute exceptionally well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong, balanced financial performance across top line growth, operating margin, and cash flow. On an as reported basis, our Q1 results compare favorably to the Rule of 50. And if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceed the Rule of 60. FX in the quarter was a 1-point headwind to revenue growth, a nearly 2-point headwind to year-over-year RPO growth, and about 40 basis points of tailwind to sequential RPO growth. Now to our Q1 results. Growth rates are reported on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. And I'll let the numbers speak for themselves. Total revenue was a record $221 million, up 24%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 33%. Cloud revenue totaled $57 million, up 53%. And as Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $1.2 billion, up 42% compared to the prior year and up 10% sequentially. As of March 31, 98% of our RPO represents cloud-native subscriptions. And how about the global services team? Global services revenue was a record $116 million, up 29% as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Operating profit totaled $64 million with adjusted operating margin of 28.8%, up 190 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our cloud business scales. Importantly as Eddie discussed, we continue to invest for future growth. This resulted in Q1 earnings per share of $0.80, up 33%, and GAAP EPS of $0.62, up 29%, a company that generates GAAP earnings. Turning to cash, operating cash flow was $59 million, up 85%. This resulted in a 30% adjusted EBITDA margin and a 26% free cash flow margin. Remember, like full year 2022, full year 2023 cash taxes will be negatively impacted by the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Moving to the balance sheet, deferred revenue increased 34% to $218 million. We ended the quarter with $182 million in cash and, lo and behold, zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $74 million in share repurchases in the quarter. Also, our Board has approved the replenishing of our $75 million share repurchase authority. How about them apples? That covers the Q1 quarter, so on to our updated 2023 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. This includes a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our strong start to the year and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2023 revenue operating margin and earnings per share guidance. We are also reiterating our 2023 RPO guidepost range and midpoint of $1.35 billion. Consistent with our recent earnings releases, our guideposts and guidance ranges can be found in today's earnings release, supplemental schedules. All guidance references made on today's call will be the midpoint of their respective ranges. As noted on prior earnings calls, we will be updating our RPO outlook on an annual basis. So as previously discussed, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. So for full year 2023, we expect total revenue of $860 million, up $34 million or 4% from our prior midpoint of $826.5 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 20% growth. All in, our target is 12%. And for Q2, we expect total revenue of $216 million, or 21% growth, ex license and maintenance. All in, our target is 13% growth. For operating margin, we are increasing the midpoint to 26.5%, up from our prior midpoint of 26%. Included in this outlook is roughly 200 basis points of headwind from the reduction in license and maintenance revenue. And as Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business. We believe this near-term margin trade-off well positions Manhattan Associates to expand our TAM, deliver long-term recurring revenue growth and cash flows. At the midpoint, we are targeting Q2 operating margin of 26.5%; Q3, 26%; and accounting for Q4 retail peak seasonality, 24.5%. Our full year adjusted EPS outlook is increasing by $0.20 to $2.88, up 7% from our prior midpoint of $2.68. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 and Q3 to be $0.72; and accounting for Q4 retail peak seasonality, $0.64. For GAAP EPS, our midpoint increases by $0.15 to $2.03, up 8% from our prior $1.88 midpoint. For Q2, we are targeting GAAP EPS of $0.50. Here are some additional details on our 2023 outlook. Yes, we are increasing our cloud revenue midpoint to $240 million, representing 36% growth and is up 3% over our prior midpoint of $234 million. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $59 million in Q2, $61 million in Q3, and $63 million in Q4. For services, we are increasing our forecast of $455 million to $463 million. The $459 million midpoint represents 17% growth and is up $27 million or 6% from our prior $432.5 million midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 services revenue of $118 million; Q3, $119 million; and accounting for Q4 retail peak seasonality, $106 million. Moving to maintenance, we are targeting a range of $126 million to $128 million, or an 11% decline at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 $32 million, Q3 $30.5 million and Q4 $29 million. We expect hardware revenue of $5 million per quarter and expect license of $2 million in Q2, and $1.5 million in Q3 and in Q4. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin, we continue to target about 54% for the full year. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting approximately 54.5% in Q2 and Q3, and 54% in Q4. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% and our diluted share count to be 62.8 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, fantastic execution by the Manhattan team, thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well, we're very pleased. We're pleased with the strong start to the year and our record financial results. As always, we expect this year to be one of great accomplishments. And before opening up the call to questions, I'd like to share a couple of recent ones. Firstly, earlier this week, Manhattan Associates celebrated an important milestone, 25 years as a NASDAQ-listed public company. We're very proud of that. And second, for the 11th consecutive year our team members voted Manhattan as a top workplace in Atlanta. And this award follows similar recognitions that Manhattan has earned around the globe over the past 12 months. So congratulations to all of our team members, and thank you for all the great work and your dedication to our customers. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And Rob, we'd be happy to take any questions now.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTerry Tillman: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. And really strong results, congrats on that, and I guess happy birthday, MANH. The first question, I guess, Eddie, do you still have that office in Manhattan Beach, that little cute office? Is that still in the office portfolio?\nEddie Capel: We don't, Terry, and we've been very happy with our financial performance over the last 25 years. If only we had owned that real estate, I think it might have outstripped us. But no, we don't, unfortunately.\nTerry Tillman: Okay. Fair enough. So yes, just a quick question for you, Eddie. I think in the prepared remarks you were talking about the increased cross-selling. What I'm curious about now is, you've got 100-plus customers on the cloud WMS, so that's great to see. The idea here is, these become unified workflows and -- when folks get on the microservices architecture. How are the conversations going in kind of the light bulb or the aha moments in terms of, wow, these are integrated workflows and really kind of starting to tip the scales and getting them to buy then the OMS or the TMS or other solutions? Just maybe an update on where you are in those kind of, hopefully, aha moments and then I had a question for Dennis.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, I think that certainly, those -- your expression is the light bulbs are going on. Frankly, I think it's a little different. Honestly, I think our customers in the marketplace have been looking for integrated workflows and hoping for integrated workflows for a long, long time. But it's frankly been very difficult to realize them. We now have a solution to be able to actually realize that objective, and it becomes a real option versus, as I mentioned, just an aspiration. So in answer to your question, the conversations are going very well, particularly with our strategic customers. Usually, when we're talking about, whether it be WMS or TMS or OMS and the specific need of that specific customer at that specific time, there are also conversations about all of our other solutions in terms of what that road map looks like to move from one to the other to the other. And so we had mentioned cross-sell was a particularly strong this quarter. It's going to bounce around a little bit for sure. But certainly, those conversations are very encouraging.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. And I guess, Dennis, for you, congrats on DSOs and GAAP earnings. My question relates to the cloud subscription revenue has been accelerating strongly, and it accelerated again in 1Q and it was really actually notable upside. I'm curious, and maybe each quarter could be different variables that drive notable upside. But is there anything you can share about in the first quarter, whether it was just accelerated kind of go-lives or maybe more users or expansion deals? Just anything more on just the level of positive variance? Thank you.\nDennis Story: I mean, the primary drivers, the ramp, the compounding starting with these ramp deals, highly successful for us. That's the big driver.\nEddie Capel: We've had a few. I wouldn't say it's a landslide. We've had -- we certainly had a few projects that moved more quickly. So sort of a little different -- subtly different to the ramp that was projected that the customers brought in production environments more quickly than they were expecting. So that was helpful, too.\nTerry Tillman: Congrats again. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry.\nDennis Story: Thanks, Terry.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. So Eddie, I wanted to start on point-of-sale. So you guys have had some success there. I'd love to hear about maybe the ramp of that product and how we should think about that contributing to RPO or growth over the long term? And how excited are you in that portfolio and how they can ultimately fit in?\nEddie Capel: Yes. I mean, look, it's a reiteration of me saying I'm very excited about where we are there. The objective is to get a 10 or a dozen live and referenceable customers by the end of the year because I think that's when sort of the flywheel begins to start. And we're certainly on track for that. In terms of the financial impact of point-of-sale on our financial results, frankly, it's pretty minimal at the moment, which is frankly is great. Now, that's a function of a solid performance across the rest of the product portfolio as well, but the opportunity for strong CAGR in that space is certainly there for us. And look, back to a little bit of same -- about the same response to the previous question, the conversations about the road map for modern technology in the retail store are definitely ramping up, and I think continue to be more excited than ever about the opportunity that lies in front of us.\nBrian Peterson: Understood. Maybe a follow-up to Terry's question on cross-sell. How do you think about what was really strong this quarter? And as you guys build out the portfolio, the cross-sell motion changed a little bit, right? So I guess I'm just curious how that could evolve potentially over the next three to five years? Thanks guys.\nEddie Capel: Yes. It was good balance, Brian. There was nothing that really stood out. It was a nice balance across WMS, TMS and OMS, sort of typical ratios for us and across the geographies. So that was good to see. But I would -- in terms of what the typical motion, if you think about which products might come first in the portfolio of implementations and so forth, it really depends. It depends on the customers' needs. The vertical focus changes that dependency of need a little bit across the product suite. But again, for us, it's not really that important which goes, first, because we've got a unified suite of solutions that could meet any road map needs. And we've -- our cross-sell this quarter was -- a little -- a tick over 35% of our new bookings this quarter came from cross-sell. So again, pretty encouraging.\nBrian Peterson: Big brands.\nEddie Capel: Yes, big brands.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I guess I'll start with the macro question. The general indications we've heard this year have been that larger enterprise customer is still very much forging ahead and thinking about what modernization needs to happen. And if there's maybe any signs of stresses, it's probably at the lower end of the market, which I imagine isn't served by Manhattan to begin with. I guess, I'll ask, any changes you're seeing from a macro sense or even changes within any particular segment of the business?\nEddie Capel: No, not really, Joe. We've got -- we've diversified more -- obviously, more and more over the last few years. So less retail focus for us, although still a lot of work going on in retail, but a lot of manufacturers and wholesalers going direct-to-consumer. So that obviously is very important to us. In terms of where the slowness, where the softness might be, we haven't seen it in any particular segment or, frankly, in any particular tier. There are winners and losers in every tier. Obviously, we've seen some of the larger and maybe not the largest, but some of the larger retailers pretty negatively impacted as well as some of the specialty guys. But if I have 35 - the other thing is, about 35% of our pipeline is coming from new logos, companies that we've never done business with before. And a lot of those tend to be outside of our typical vertical focus. So look, we all see the macro challenges. We hear the headlines from the companies that are struggling. And -- but we've seen no particular concentration across either our customer base, our geographies, or our verticals.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Great. And then I guess I'll ask a cross-sell question too, but maybe a bit open ended. How do you think this begins to change your model in a financial sense? So, do you think this maybe becomes a driver of higher services utilization, does new cloud revenue end up activating more quickly than in the past being tied to more of a long WMS rollout? And what might be a reasonable time frame when you think about this increasing share of bookings coming from cross-sell? When do some of these things maybe start to impact the revenue model as it's reported?\nEddie Capel: You mean product cross-selling, Joe?\nJoe Vruwink: Yes.\nEddie Capel: Well, we feel like we're doing pretty good. As I mentioned, a little more than 35% of our new bookings this quarter came from cross-sell, okay? 25% of our new bookings came from brand new logos, okay? So obviously, the balance is from existing customers and buying more of what they've already got. So we look at that and feel like it's pretty balanced, frankly. As you know, we've been in recent quarters, the past six, eight quarters, we've been as high as 50% of our new bookings coming from new logos. We've been as low as 25% from cross-sell. So it bounces around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but that balance of cross-sell, increased sales of the same product to existing customers and new logos is pretty strong. And we don't see that changing other than the variability quarter-by-quarter for the foreseeable future.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Thank you very much.\nEddie Capel: Pleasure, Joe. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Pfau: Nice results and thanks for taking my questions, guys. I just wanted to ask -- yes, can you hear me?\nEddie Capel: Yes.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. Hi, just wanted to ask, when you look at your business, what sort of tie is there to perhaps your new build out of warehouse or fulfillment space? And as the cost of capital has increased and some of these developers have pulled back a bit on their development of new space, does that have any impact on you? Is it more of conversion of existing warehouse space for you?\nEddie Capel: It's mostly the conversion and modernization of existing space. You asked an interesting question. I don't have the percentage off the top of my head to be perfectly honest with you. But it's in the range of 10%, maybe even less of our implementations going into new buildings. So certainly, the preponderance of what we're doing is sort of brandfield work, whether it be only the modernization of the software or the retrofit of a building with additional automation and software.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. That's helpful. And then when we look at the number of net new customers or bookings coming from net new customers this quarter, it's lower than that 35% in the pipeline this quarter. I think it was higher in the past several quarters before that. How do you sort of think about the ideal mix there where you're bringing enough new customers on to have enough cross-sell opportunities down the road?\nEddie Capel: Yes. I think, look, clearly, it's important to look at it at least annually, not as a quarterly number, if not even a longer duration. Our target is about a third. We feel like if we can get about a third of our new bookings from new logos, that will fuel the future cross-sell opportunity like crazy, frankly.\nDennis Story: Yes. And for the past 10-plus years, we've carried about a 30% to 35% new logo balance in our pipeline.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Our pleasure, Matt. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Schappel: Hi, thank you for taking my question and nice job on the quarter, exceptionally good job. Eddie, in an earlier question you noted that many of your new customers are coming from verticals outside of the core markets or the core verticals. I wonder if you could just go a little deeper into what verticals these customers are coming from? And also, how are -- many of these new customers and new logos, how are they finding a way to Manhattan?\nEddie Capel: I think -- well, first of all, industrial manufacturers, life sciences, high tech would be three that sort of jump out to me that are new or bigger verticals for us now than they were historically. And really, most of that work is driven by those companies doing something that's more direct-to-consumer. It may not be direct-to-consumer in the purest sense of to the doorstep and so forth. But a lot of the life sciences and health care solutions companies, for example, are shipping smaller quantities, a very high value goods to individual pharmacies, doctors' offices and so forth. So it looks just a lot more like retail. And that capability, as you know, requires a good deal of sophistication, a great deal of control and a great deal of precision. And so I think, look, we could talk a lot about this space. But those would be the highlights, I think.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then one follow-up. On the marketing front, I mean, the company is very well known in the warehouse. It's less known in, say, order management. I was wondering if you could just give us a little insight into what some of your marketing efforts are to drive awareness of your order management and point-of-sale solutions. I think you gave a little bit of that in your prepared remarks, you're talking about some of the industry analysts, but I wonder if you could just expand on that?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Well, we feel pretty good about our position in the order management space. Now, Mark, to be perfectly honest with you, sort of the preeminent analyst in that space -- analyst firm in that space tends to be Forrester. And for the last four to six years, they put us as the only leader -- they have a Wave process versus a Quadrant, but we're positioned as the only leader in that space. So we feel pretty good about our awareness there. Clearly, point-of-sale is where we've got to continue to cross the bridge and to bang the drum. We're doing that. At every possible turn, we're talking about the next generation of point-of-sale solution that we believe retailers need. And we're not going to continue to stop banging that drum. But there is that but of we've got to have a material number of live referenceable customers in that space to really get that flywheel going and be representative of what our solutions can do. And of course, the beauty of point-of-sale solutions is, you can test them as a consumer pretty quickly anytime you want. And so we feel good about getting the reach of our solutions out there. And the target has been to have, again, about a dozen referenceable customers for point-of-sale by the end of the year because it's just my personal opinion, about that number starts to get sort of -- to bring gravity and materiality to what we're doing. We already operate from a store execution perspective. We're a little -- in a little over 20,000 stores today installed and live, not with point-of-sale, but with the execution system, buy online pick up in store, curbside pickup, store inventory management, ship from store, fulfill from store, all of those kinds of things live in over 20,000 stores. And of course, our objective is to bring our point-of-sale solution to all of those stores and more as well and feel like we're making pretty good progress.\nMark Schappel: Thanks. That was helpful. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: But let me just say, Mark, if you got any neighbors that are retailers, feel free to share the news, we will -- we'd love everybody to be talking about it.\nMark Schappel: I'll send them your way.\nEddie Capel: Thank you.\nDennis Story: Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question is from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks. Nice quarter guys. Just -- Eddie, just following on your point-of-sale comments there. If you look 25 -- customers, a total of 20,000 stores today, are you 10% penetrated that with POS or 5%? Is there some sense of how big that opportunity could be for Manhattan?\nEddie Capel: And the penetration, well, first of all, 20,000 as we're proud of it is only scratching the surface and our penetration into that 20,000 is -- don't quote me, but somewhere in the 2% to 3% range. So that's why we're on one hand incredibly enthusiastic and excited about the space because we're making good progress, it really isn't impacting our financial results just yet, but of course, you can capture the vision forward in your mind forward and think about the potential positive impact that it can have on the future.\nBlair Abernethy: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just shifting over to the international business, both EMEA and APAC, growing at or above the company overall rate, which is encouraging. Can you just give us a little more color on what's happening in EMEA and APAC for Manhattan? Is it -- these net new customers, are they coming? Do you offer cloud in APAC? just kind of wondering what sort of -- what's the dynamic look like there from a new customer stand point?\nEddie Capel: Yes. Good question. So the answer is yes, we offer cloud across the globe, in fact, many of our customers are international and global organizations that are rolling out internationally, but so, yes is the answer to that question. In terms of both APAC and EMEA, the -- if you look at the sub-regions or the countries inside of those theaters, some are more vibrant than others. Look, this is not the time to go down every single country and so forth, but if you go through Europe, you'd say, well, certainly, things in the UK are a little more suppressed than elsewhere. We used to have a not huge, but reasonably healthy business in Russia of course, which we've shut down, we can move to APAC and Australia is certainly quite vibrant, Southeast Asia is quite vibrant, China for a variety of reasons has been a bit slower, but look, that's why we have an international business to help -- supporting our customers where they need us to be, but also to smooth out some of those lumps here and there by specific region. But at the end of the day, we're managing through all that lumpiness region by region, I think, exceptionally well and that's why you see the performance from the international markets.\nDennis Story: Nice growth rates and generating earnings.\nBlair Abernethy: Yes. Yes, that's great. Okay, thanks, guys.\nEddie Capel: Pleasure, Blair. Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end-of-the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eddie Capel for closing comments.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Thank you, Rob, and thanks everybody for joining us to review the Q1 results. As I said, we feel really good about the start that we've made to 2023 here, but we are just getting started. We've got big aspirations as you know and expecting an exciting year ahead. So we'll look forward to speaking with you in about 90 days to review our next chapter of the year. Thanks. Bye, bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter results and discuss our updated full year 2023 outlook. Well, Manhattan Associates is off to a strong start in 2023, reporting record results. Q1 total revenue was $221 million, up 24% as reported and 33% if normalized for our cloud transition. Earnings per share was $0.80, also up 33%. Both this top and bottom line results exceeded our expectations. Demand is strong, customer satisfaction is high and our growing investment in research and development has positioned Manhattan as the leading innovator in supply chain execution, omni-channel solutions and retail point-of-sale. And these favorable characteristics contributed to Q1 being our eighth consecutive record revenue quarter, highlighted by year-over-year 53% growth in cloud revenue, 29% growth in services revenue, and 20% revenue growth across all our geographies. And these strong results drove our top line outperformance and solid earnings leverage in the quarter. RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 42% to $1.2 billion over Q1 2022 as demand for our mission-critical cloud solutions continues to be strong and resilient across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continued to drive more than 80% of our bookings for the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub-verticals are nicely diversified. For example, in the quarter, cloud deals won include a discount retailer, a health solutions company, a grocery retailer, an industrial manufacturer, a specialty retailer of automotive parts and a fashion brand as well as a number of others. Win rates in the quarter were about 75%, with 25% of new cloud bookings being generated from net new logos. And additionally, whilst the mix of bookings will vary on a quarterly basis, we had notable cross-sell strength in the quarter. And as discussed in prior calls, Manhattans' cloud-native platform makes unifying mission-critical commerce and supply chain systems a real option versus simply an aspiration. For our customers, this can result in reduced IT complexity, increased revenue and improved profitability. And for Manhattan, it's a natural catalyst to extend our best-of-breed product footprint within our existing customer base. And this differentiation provides Manhattan Active Solutions with another clear advantage over our competition. Our strong product activity continues to drive our services pipeline and growth. Importantly, our Professional Services team continues to perform very well for our customers and completed well over 100 go-lives in the quarter. Our solution pipeline remains robust with encouraging demands across our product suites with new potential customers representing about 35% of our total pipeline. And while we remain appropriately cautious regarding the global economy, we continue to set aggressive growth and investment goals. This includes strategic investments in industry-leading innovation, further enablement of customer success, and expanding our addressable market. From a hiring standpoint, we continue to anticipate adding roughly 400 to 500 new employees this year and have already welcomed over 150 new employees to the Manhattan family just in Q1 alone. Now, turning to the product front. Each year around about this time, we participate in a definitive vendor landscape -- set of definitive landscape studies for our WMS, TMS, and OMS applications. For WMS and TMS, Gartner publishes an annual Magic Quadrant report. And for OMS, Forrester publishes the Omnichannel Wave report every other year. And while the results of the WMS Magic Quadrant won't be released until early next month, we're hopeful to make it 15 consecutive times as a definitive leader for WMS in this report. And for TMS though, I'm happy to share for the fifth consecutive year -- or fifth consecutive time actually, we've been named a leader in the TMS Magic Quadrant. And our commitment to high levels of investment and innovation in TMS is born in both the strong showing in the MQ and strong levels of project activity across four continents. The Forrester Omnichannel OMS Wave was published this month. And for the second consecutive time, Manhattan Associates is the only leader in the Wave. Having a single leader across consecutive Waves, given its -- the report only comes out every two years, is highly unusual and it reflects our technical strength and unmatched functionality that has been generated from our 18 years of strong investment in this critical solution. And as the Forrester analysis shows, no vendor really comes close to matching our depth and breadth of capability across customer service, inventory availability, real-time order promising, fulfillment optimization and in-store execution. And of course, we deliver each of WMS and TMS and OMS on our industry-leading and unified Manhattan Active platform, which is our cloud-native application architecture and development platform. And Manhattan Active WM continues its strong performance measured in terms of new wins and successful customer adoption and go-lives. Now with over 100 Manhattan Active WM customers, we continue our strong track record of being selected to run the largest and most sophisticated supply chains. And we also continue to strengthen our diversity of industry and geographic coverage. Shifting gears just a little bit to our omni-channel solutions, we are happy to report that we took another very significant customer live with our point-of-sale solution this quarter. And in addition to delivering our cloud-native point-of-sale across their store fleet, we also executed a three-channel order management go-live simultaneously. Our OMS is really unique in its ability to simultaneously optimize retail, wholesale, and e-commerce orders. And this combined with our point-of-sale gives us the ability to help this particular customer deliver omni-channel operational excellence and to provide a technology template for a number of other significant specialty apparel brand within their group. At the Momentum this year, we're thrilled to have a number of point-of-sale customers presenting on the value that they're deriving from the rollout of our omni-channel point-of-sale. Now, speaking of Momentum, our annual user conference which is coming up here in a month or so, I will be in Scottsdale, Arizona, one of our favorite venues. And this year's theme is moving life and commerce forward. And we, our customers, and our partners will bring that theme to life in many creative and informative ways, and we're excited. We're excited to have our customer and our partner community come together with so many critical supply chain commerce topics to discuss at this time. We'll also be demonstrating the unique advantages that we deliver when we assemble multiple Manhattan Active applications together. The Manhattan Active architecture empowers our customers and our partners to leverage their creativity and technical prowess, to start with our market-leading application functionality and to extend it to do -- to drive even more positive change for their businesses and their customers. And finally, we're very excited about the advanced work that we're doing determining how to best take advantage and leverage modern natural language models like ChatGPT and Bard, another topic that we'll be presenting on and discussing in detail at Momentum. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and outlook for the rest of the year, and then I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis? Yes. Terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well, we're very pleased. We're pleased with the strong start to the year and our record financial results. As always, we expect this year to be one of great accomplishments. And before opening up the call to questions, I'd like to share a couple of recent ones. Firstly, earlier this week, Manhattan Associates celebrated an important milestone, 25 years as a NASDAQ-listed public company. We're very proud of that. And second, for the 11th consecutive year our team members voted Manhattan as a top workplace in Atlanta. And this award follows similar recognitions that Manhattan has earned around the globe over the past 12 months. So congratulations to all of our team members, and thank you for all the great work and your dedication to our customers. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And Rob, we'd be happy to take any questions now. We don't, Terry, and we've been very happy with our financial performance over the last 25 years. If only we had owned that real estate, I think it might have outstripped us. But no, we don't, unfortunately. Yes. Well, I think that certainly, those -- your expression is the light bulbs are going on. Frankly, I think it's a little different. Honestly, I think our customers in the marketplace have been looking for integrated workflows and hoping for integrated workflows for a long, long time. But it's frankly been very difficult to realize them. We now have a solution to be able to actually realize that objective, and it becomes a real option versus, as I mentioned, just an aspiration. So in answer to your question, the conversations are going very well, particularly with our strategic customers. Usually, when we're talking about, whether it be WMS or TMS or OMS and the specific need of that specific customer at that specific time, there are also conversations about all of our other solutions in terms of what that road map looks like to move from one to the other to the other. And so we had mentioned cross-sell was a particularly strong this quarter. It's going to bounce around a little bit for sure. But certainly, those conversations are very encouraging. We've had a few. I wouldn't say it's a landslide. We've had -- we certainly had a few projects that moved more quickly. So sort of a little different -- subtly different to the ramp that was projected that the customers brought in production environments more quickly than they were expecting. So that was helpful, too. Thank you, Terry. Yes. I mean, look, it's a reiteration of me saying I'm very excited about where we are there. The objective is to get a 10 or a dozen live and referenceable customers by the end of the year because I think that's when sort of the flywheel begins to start. And we're certainly on track for that. In terms of the financial impact of point-of-sale on our financial results, frankly, it's pretty minimal at the moment, which is frankly is great. Now, that's a function of a solid performance across the rest of the product portfolio as well, but the opportunity for strong CAGR in that space is certainly there for us. And look, back to a little bit of same -- about the same response to the previous question, the conversations about the road map for modern technology in the retail store are definitely ramping up, and I think continue to be more excited than ever about the opportunity that lies in front of us. Yes. It was good balance, Brian. There was nothing that really stood out. It was a nice balance across WMS, TMS and OMS, sort of typical ratios for us and across the geographies. So that was good to see. But I would -- in terms of what the typical motion, if you think about which products might come first in the portfolio of implementations and so forth, it really depends. It depends on the customers' needs. The vertical focus changes that dependency of need a little bit across the product suite. But again, for us, it's not really that important which goes, first, because we've got a unified suite of solutions that could meet any road map needs. And we've -- our cross-sell this quarter was -- a little -- a tick over 35% of our new bookings this quarter came from cross-sell. So again, pretty encouraging. Yes, big brands. No, not really, Joe. We've got -- we've diversified more -- obviously, more and more over the last few years. So less retail focus for us, although still a lot of work going on in retail, but a lot of manufacturers and wholesalers going direct-to-consumer. So that obviously is very important to us. In terms of where the slowness, where the softness might be, we haven't seen it in any particular segment or, frankly, in any particular tier. There are winners and losers in every tier. Obviously, we've seen some of the larger and maybe not the largest, but some of the larger retailers pretty negatively impacted as well as some of the specialty guys. But if I have 35 - the other thing is, about 35% of our pipeline is coming from new logos, companies that we've never done business with before. And a lot of those tend to be outside of our typical vertical focus. So look, we all see the macro challenges. We hear the headlines from the companies that are struggling. And -- but we've seen no particular concentration across either our customer base, our geographies, or our verticals. You mean product cross-selling, Joe? Well, we feel like we're doing pretty good. As I mentioned, a little more than 35% of our new bookings this quarter came from cross-sell, okay? 25% of our new bookings came from brand new logos, okay? So obviously, the balance is from existing customers and buying more of what they've already got. So we look at that and feel like it's pretty balanced, frankly. As you know, we've been in recent quarters, the past six, eight quarters, we've been as high as 50% of our new bookings coming from new logos. We've been as low as 25% from cross-sell. So it bounces around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but that balance of cross-sell, increased sales of the same product to existing customers and new logos is pretty strong. And we don't see that changing other than the variability quarter-by-quarter for the foreseeable future. Pleasure, Joe. Thank you. Yes. It's mostly the conversion and modernization of existing space. You asked an interesting question. I don't have the percentage off the top of my head to be perfectly honest with you. But it's in the range of 10%, maybe even less of our implementations going into new buildings. So certainly, the preponderance of what we're doing is sort of brandfield work, whether it be only the modernization of the software or the retrofit of a building with additional automation and software. Yes. I think, look, clearly, it's important to look at it at least annually, not as a quarterly number, if not even a longer duration. Our target is about a third. We feel like if we can get about a third of our new bookings from new logos, that will fuel the future cross-sell opportunity like crazy, frankly. Our pleasure, Matt. Thank you. I think -- well, first of all, industrial manufacturers, life sciences, high tech would be three that sort of jump out to me that are new or bigger verticals for us now than they were historically. And really, most of that work is driven by those companies doing something that's more direct-to-consumer. It may not be direct-to-consumer in the purest sense of to the doorstep and so forth. But a lot of the life sciences and health care solutions companies, for example, are shipping smaller quantities, a very high value goods to individual pharmacies, doctors' offices and so forth. So it looks just a lot more like retail. And that capability, as you know, requires a good deal of sophistication, a great deal of control and a great deal of precision. And so I think, look, we could talk a lot about this space. But those would be the highlights, I think. Yes. Well, we feel pretty good about our position in the order management space. Now, Mark, to be perfectly honest with you, sort of the preeminent analyst in that space -- analyst firm in that space tends to be Forrester. And for the last four to six years, they put us as the only leader -- they have a Wave process versus a Quadrant, but we're positioned as the only leader in that space. So we feel pretty good about our awareness there. Clearly, point-of-sale is where we've got to continue to cross the bridge and to bang the drum. We're doing that. At every possible turn, we're talking about the next generation of point-of-sale solution that we believe retailers need. And we're not going to continue to stop banging that drum. But there is that but of we've got to have a material number of live referenceable customers in that space to really get that flywheel going and be representative of what our solutions can do. And of course, the beauty of point-of-sale solutions is, you can test them as a consumer pretty quickly anytime you want. And so we feel good about getting the reach of our solutions out there. And the target has been to have, again, about a dozen referenceable customers for point-of-sale by the end of the year because it's just my personal opinion, about that number starts to get sort of -- to bring gravity and materiality to what we're doing. We already operate from a store execution perspective. We're a little -- in a little over 20,000 stores today installed and live, not with point-of-sale, but with the execution system, buy online pick up in store, curbside pickup, store inventory management, ship from store, fulfill from store, all of those kinds of things live in over 20,000 stores. And of course, our objective is to bring our point-of-sale solution to all of those stores and more as well and feel like we're making pretty good progress. But let me just say, Mark, if you got any neighbors that are retailers, feel free to share the news, we will -- we'd love everybody to be talking about it. Thank you. And the penetration, well, first of all, 20,000 as we're proud of it is only scratching the surface and our penetration into that 20,000 is -- don't quote me, but somewhere in the 2% to 3% range. So that's why we're on one hand incredibly enthusiastic and excited about the space because we're making good progress, it really isn't impacting our financial results just yet, but of course, you can capture the vision forward in your mind forward and think about the potential positive impact that it can have on the future. Yes. Good question. So the answer is yes, we offer cloud across the globe, in fact, many of our customers are international and global organizations that are rolling out internationally, but so, yes is the answer to that question. In terms of both APAC and EMEA, the -- if you look at the sub-regions or the countries inside of those theaters, some are more vibrant than others. Look, this is not the time to go down every single country and so forth, but if you go through Europe, you'd say, well, certainly, things in the UK are a little more suppressed than elsewhere. We used to have a not huge, but reasonably healthy business in Russia of course, which we've shut down, we can move to APAC and Australia is certainly quite vibrant, Southeast Asia is quite vibrant, China for a variety of reasons has been a bit slower, but look, that's why we have an international business to help -- supporting our customers where they need us to be, but also to smooth out some of those lumps here and there by specific region. But at the end of the day, we're managing through all that lumpiness region by region, I think, exceptionally well and that's why you see the performance from the international markets. Pleasure, Blair. Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Rob, and thanks everybody for joining us to review the Q1 results. As I said, we feel really good about the start that we've made to 2023 here, but we are just getting started. We've got big aspirations as you know and expecting an exciting year ahead. So we'll look forward to speaking with you in about 90 days to review our next chapter of the year. Thanks. Bye, bye."

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. So our Manhattan global teams continue to execute exceptionally well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong, balanced financial performance across top line growth, operating margin, and cash flow. On an as reported basis, our Q1 results compare favorably to the Rule of 50. And if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceed the Rule of 60. FX in the quarter was a 1-point headwind to revenue growth, a nearly 2-point headwind to year-over-year RPO growth, and about 40 basis points of tailwind to sequential RPO growth. Now to our Q1 results. Growth rates are reported on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. And I'll let the numbers speak for themselves. Total revenue was a record $221 million, up 24%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 33%. Cloud revenue totaled $57 million, up 53%. And as Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $1.2 billion, up 42% compared to the prior year and up 10% sequentially. As of March 31, 98% of our RPO represents cloud-native subscriptions. And how about the global services team? Global services revenue was a record $116 million, up 29% as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Operating profit totaled $64 million with adjusted operating margin of 28.8%, up 190 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our cloud business scales. Importantly as Eddie discussed, we continue to invest for future growth. This resulted in Q1 earnings per share of $0.80, up 33%, and GAAP EPS of $0.62, up 29%, a company that generates GAAP earnings. Turning to cash, operating cash flow was $59 million, up 85%. This resulted in a 30% adjusted EBITDA margin and a 26% free cash flow margin. Remember, like full year 2022, full year 2023 cash taxes will be negatively impacted by the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Moving to the balance sheet, deferred revenue increased 34% to $218 million. We ended the quarter with $182 million in cash and, lo and behold, zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $74 million in share repurchases in the quarter. Also, our Board has approved the replenishing of our $75 million share repurchase authority. How about them apples? That covers the Q1 quarter, so on to our updated 2023 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. This includes a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our strong start to the year and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2023 revenue operating margin and earnings per share guidance. We are also reiterating our 2023 RPO guidepost range and midpoint of $1.35 billion. Consistent with our recent earnings releases, our guideposts and guidance ranges can be found in today's earnings release, supplemental schedules. All guidance references made on today's call will be the midpoint of their respective ranges. As noted on prior earnings calls, we will be updating our RPO outlook on an annual basis. So as previously discussed, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. So for full year 2023, we expect total revenue of $860 million, up $34 million or 4% from our prior midpoint of $826.5 million. Excluding license and maintenance attrition, this represents 20% growth. All in, our target is 12%. And for Q2, we expect total revenue of $216 million, or 21% growth, ex license and maintenance. All in, our target is 13% growth. For operating margin, we are increasing the midpoint to 26.5%, up from our prior midpoint of 26%. Included in this outlook is roughly 200 basis points of headwind from the reduction in license and maintenance revenue. And as Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business. We believe this near-term margin trade-off well positions Manhattan Associates to expand our TAM, deliver long-term recurring revenue growth and cash flows. At the midpoint, we are targeting Q2 operating margin of 26.5%; Q3, 26%; and accounting for Q4 retail peak seasonality, 24.5%. Our full year adjusted EPS outlook is increasing by $0.20 to $2.88, up 7% from our prior midpoint of $2.68. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 and Q3 to be $0.72; and accounting for Q4 retail peak seasonality, $0.64. For GAAP EPS, our midpoint increases by $0.15 to $2.03, up 8% from our prior $1.88 midpoint. For Q2, we are targeting GAAP EPS of $0.50. Here are some additional details on our 2023 outlook. Yes, we are increasing our cloud revenue midpoint to $240 million, representing 36% growth and is up 3% over our prior midpoint of $234 million. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $59 million in Q2, $61 million in Q3, and $63 million in Q4. For services, we are increasing our forecast of $455 million to $463 million. The $459 million midpoint represents 17% growth and is up $27 million or 6% from our prior $432.5 million midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 services revenue of $118 million; Q3, $119 million; and accounting for Q4 retail peak seasonality, $106 million. Moving to maintenance, we are targeting a range of $126 million to $128 million, or an 11% decline at the midpoint. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 $32 million, Q3 $30.5 million and Q4 $29 million. We expect hardware revenue of $5 million per quarter and expect license of $2 million in Q2, and $1.5 million in Q3 and in Q4. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin, we continue to target about 54% for the full year. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting approximately 54.5% in Q2 and Q3, and 54% in Q4. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% and our diluted share count to be 62.8 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, fantastic execution by the Manhattan team, thank you. And back to Eddie for some closing remarks. I mean, the primary drivers, the ramp, the compounding starting with these ramp deals, highly successful for us. That's the big driver. Thanks, Terry. Yes. And for the past 10-plus years, we've carried about a 30% to 35% new logo balance in our pipeline. Thanks. Nice growth rates and generating earnings."

We note the turbulent global macro environment could impact our performance and cause the actual results to differ materially from our projections. We're under no obligation to update these statements. In addition, our comments include certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide additional information to investors. We have reconciled all non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation schedules in the Form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Great. Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter results, discuss our Q4 outlook and provide some very preliminary color at least on 2025. Q3 and year-to-date results set all-time records on both bottom- and top-lines. For the quarter, total revenue increased 12% to $267 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 29% to $1.35, both of these metrics were above our expectations. Driving the top-line outperformance and earnings leverage was solid cloud and services revenue growth across all geographies, with cloud subscription revenue posting 33% growth in the quarter. Manhattan's business fundamentals are solid and we remain confident and very optimistic about our business opportunity. While the global macro environment remains challenging, demand for our solutions is robust, customer satisfaction is high, and as evidenced by our recent release of the Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning solution, the investments we're making in R&D and our people are creating a clear differentiation. Delivering consistent market-leading innovation is creating more opportunities across supply chain, omnichannel retail and at the world's best -- as the world's best brands look to unify and digitally transform. RPO, remaining performance obligation, increased 27% to roughly $1.7 billion. And as we've often cautioned, large, complex deals can be lumpy on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And whilst we haven't seen much of that lumpiness over the past three or four years, this quarter and, to a lesser extent, last quarter, we have seen some. And our third quarter RPO growth was impacted by some large digital transformational projects pushing it. That said, our fourth quarter is off to a great start and demand is solid. And attributes that give us confidence that we will actually achieve at the high end of our 2024 RPO bookings guidance of $1.8 billion. Across our industry-leading product portfolio and -- global pipeline sits at record levels, our win rates remain strong at about 70%. And these factors, despite the uncertain macro environment, again, give us confidence that we'll achieve the high end of our 2024 RPO bookings goals and equally important, are well-positioned for continued success in 2025, 2026, and of course, beyond that. Now, looking a little deeper into our Q3 bookings, from a vertical perspective, 80% of our deals came from retail, manufacturing and wholesale. Across our solutions, the sub-verticals continue to be pretty diverse. And just some of the cloud deals we won this quarter include a North American supply chain solutions provider, a global plastics manufacturer, a multinational home improvement retailer, a global manufacturer of HVAC and refrigeration products, a global life sciences and clinical research company, a global apparel retailer and many others. In Q3, 14% of our new bookings were generated from net new logos, and we continue to have a very healthy mix of conversions, upsells and cross-sells. And we believe this demonstrates the many and varied opportunities we have for sustainable future growth. And as stated earlier, our solution pipeline is at record levels and new potential customers represent about 35% of that demand. This strong demand is driven by a best-of-breed cloud native solutions that provide continuous access to innovation and are helping our customers digitally transform their businesses to drive success. Our mission-critical solutions help our clients improve customer satisfaction, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. And this strong demand for our solutions is also fueling opportunities and growth for our internal services organization and our systems integration partners. In Q3, our global services team completed over 100 go lives and continue to perform very well for our customers. Now, turning to a few product updates. I mentioned last quarter at our annual customer conference, Momentum, we unveiled the Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning solution. And I'm happy to report that as planned, we completed the development and shipped this latest addition to the Manhattan Active family right on schedule 17 days ago, just at the beginning of October. Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning is now generally available, deployed in our evergreen cloud environments, and just like all of the Manhattan Active platform applications, it will receive functional and technical enhancements every single quarter. Since announcing this new offering in May, we've seen notable interest from around the globe. And as we'd hoped and kind of suspected, our WMS and TMS users are fascinated by our vision of combining these solutions with planning to improve their ability to execute in the field. And our Manhattan Active Omni users are digging in as well to see how a real-time view of inventory health can help them make better promising fulfillment decisions, which will yield even more margin advantages for their businesses. Now, as a reminder, Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning is the first planning solution prewired directly into the operations. When combined with Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, for example, our new planning solution will deliver detailed and accurate projections of your DC labor and operational needs for the next 52 weeks, all the way down to the department and job function, if necessary. Now, having been in the WMS business and helping our customers plan their labor for over 30 years now, we feel very confident in saying that today, very few operations are getting anywhere near that level of forward visibility. Being able to match your labor plans to your labor needs from the next 30 minutes down -- up to the next 30 weeks improves just about every operational metric, from on-time shipping to total cost of labor. But we didn't stop there, because just like we put more planning into our WMS solution, we put more execution into our planning solutions as well. Unlike traditional solutions, Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning runs continuously, constantly fine-tuning order quantities, even on orders that are already processing in a distribution center. And this is really transformative, because it allows real-time demand data from throughout the day to continuously shape the final order quantities right up until those orders are ready to be shipped. This level of supply chain agility is simply unachievable without the industry's leading cloud native platform that we call the Manhattan Active Platform. The sub-second always-connected nature of the Manhattan Active applications allows them to collaborate with zero latency, a true industry first. Now, I went into a little bit of detail on that scenario involving Manhattan Active WM, because I thought it would help illustrate the types of benefits that we're going to be -- we're delivering. But rest assured, many other similar use cases exist for that solution, Manhattan Active TM and Manhattan Active Omni as well. And we're in conversations with several customers beginning to activate Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning in early to mid-2025. So, certainly stay tuned for more news, albeit in the early stages of our newest Manhattan Active offering. Now, we take a lot of pride in building software that enables our customers to gain a competitive advantage in their respective markets. Along those lines, we've recently released a few new capabilities with the Manhattan Active Omni that our customers are really applauding. In an earlier quarter, I mentioned that our first-of-a-kind Fulfillment Experience Insights dashboard. This Fulfillment Experience Insights allows our customers to continuously benchmark their omnichannel fulfillment performance against their peers and against their competitors. But we didn't stop there. We knew that this level of insight and visibility was really great, but operational recommendations are better. So, to that end, we recently introduced a capability that we call [Postgame Spotlight] (ph). And Postgame Spotlight provides detailed recommendations on how fulfillment performance can be improved from both a customer experience and a cost point -- standpoint. And this is done by making detailed recommendations on elements like inventory deployment and fulfillment staffing in stores. And we put the spotlight on specific operational changes that we believe will move the needle for our customers. Both Fulfillment Experience Insights and Postgame Spotlight are really great examples of why our prospects choose and customers stay with Manhattan Active Omni. We've moved far beyond enablement and we're now helping customers optimize and finetune their ever-evolving omnichannel fulfillment processes. And finally, on our products, I'd like to provide a brief update on, yes, generative AI. As we've said before, AI is far from a new phenomenon here at Manhattan. We've had our operations, research and data science team embedding AI into nearly every Manhattan application for several decades now. Generative AI is the latest of these powerful technologies, and we're off to a really good start shipping production-ready generative AI capabilities. At Momentum, again, we introduced Manhattan Assist, for example, a generative AI capability accessible from all Manhattan Active solutions. Our customers use Manhattan Assist every single day now, helping them quickly understand the many capabilities within our applications and it's really been great, and kind of fun to be honest, to see the questions that they're asking and some of the answers that we're providing, and frankly, where we can still tune our large language model. Our partners at Google, of course, have continued to be a great help here as they continue to improve the underlying technology at a really rapid pace. So, we're hard at work on our next-generation of GenAI-based capabilities right now and we'll be rolling those out in the first half of 2025. So, that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and our outlook. And then, I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary, and then we'll move to Q&A. So, Dennis?\nDennis Story: Okay. Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance across top-line growth, operating margin and cash flows. This includes posting record results across RPO, revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On an as-reported basis, our Q3 results came in slightly below the Rule of 50. And if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceeded the Rule of 50. Of course, FX has remained volatile. It did not have a meaningful impact to Q3 revenue growth, but was a $9 million tailwind to year-to-date RPO growth and an $18 million tailwind to sequential RPO growth. Now, to our results. All growth rates are on an as-reported year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Total revenue was $267 million, up 12%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 15%. Cloud revenue totaled $86 million, up 33%. We ended the quarter with RPO of roughly $1.7 billion, up 27% compared to the prior year and up 5% sequentially. And as Eddie discussed, several large strategic digital transformational deals pushed. Importantly, Manhattan continues to benefit from a record pipeline that includes solid demand from both new and existing customers, and strong win rates are giving us confidence in achieving the high end of our 2024 RPO bookings outlook and the ability to provide strong 2025 outlook parameters. Our global services teams delivered record revenue, totaling $137 million, up 7%, as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth for Manhattan. Adjusted operating profit was $99 million, with adjusted operating margin of 37.1%. This is 670 basis points year-over-year up. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our cloud business continues to scale. As Eddie discussed, we are very optimistic on our business opportunity and continue to invest in innovation to drive sustainable long-term growth. Turning to EPS, earnings per share, we delivered Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $1.35, up 29%, and GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 30%. Moving to cash, Q3 operating cash flow increased 6% to a solid $62 million. This resulted in 23% free cash flow margin and 38% adjusted EBITDA margin. Regarding the balance sheet, total deferred revenue increased 18% to $253 million. We ended the quarter with $215 million in cash and zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $50 million in share repurchases in the quarter, resulting in $198 million in buybacks year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. On to our updated 2024 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top-line growth and top-quartile operating margins, benchmarked against any enterprise SaaS comps. These are important drivers to our best-in-class return on invested capital as we maintain a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our strong year-to-date performance in an uneven macro environment, we are tightening our 2024 revenue guidance and increasing our operating margin and EPS guidance. Details can be found in today's earnings release. Also, as discussed earlier, we expect to achieve the high end of our 2024 RPO outlook of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. As noticed on the -- as noted on the prior earnings calls, our objective is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly, on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year as evidenced by our Q3 deal pushes. All guidance references made on today's call will be at the midpoint of their respective ranges. With that, for the full year 2024, we expect total revenue of $1.039 billion to $1.041 billion, with a $1.04 billion midpoint, which represents 12% growth. For operating margin, we are increasing our midpoint to 34%. This compares favorably from our prior midpoint of 32.1% and 30.4% in the prior-year period. As Eddie highlighted, given the demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business to fully leverage the new large TAM expansion revenue streams through investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Our full year earnings per share midpoint is increasing $0.35 to $4.61 and represents 23% growth compared to the prior year. For GAAP earnings per share, our midpoint increases by $0.36 to $3.48 and also represents 23% growth compared to the prior year. This implies Q4 total revenue of $253.5 million, which is $3.5 million lower than our prior Q4 midpoint as we now anticipate services revenue of $121.5 million, as the choppy macro environment has resulted in several transformational deal pushes, some customers shifting services projects to 2025 and a more pronounced pausing impact from this year's retail peak season. We are increasing our cloud target to $89.5 million and maintenance revenue upticks to $33.5 million. Our operating margin target is increasing to 32.5% and is up from our prior 30.5% estimate. The Q4 sequential change in operating margin accounts for retail peak seasonality, which as a reminder is when customers idle implementations to focus on their peak busy season. Now moving to 2025, we're going to provide some preliminary parameters here. We are currently in the very early stages of our 2025 budget cycle and will firm up this outlook on our Q4 call as we get through the U.S. election process and our final market analysis. With that, we are targeting total revenue of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion, representing 9% to 10% growth, with license and maintenance attrition masking total growth by 5 percentage points. This includes our cloud revenue target of $415 million, representing 23% year-over-year growth. For RPO, we are targeting $2.15 billion, which represents 21% growth. In 2025, we are targeting services revenue of $565 million to $575 million. The $570 million midpoint represents 8% growth. On license and maintenance attrition to cloud, we are targeting maintenance revenue to be about $118 million, which represents a 15% decline, and for license revenue to be about $5 million, which is well below 1% of total revenue. We anticipate operating margin to be about 33.5%. Normalizing for our license and maintenance revenue attrition to cloud, our 2025 operating margin increases roughly 100 bps year-over-year, while we simultaneously increase our investment in our business and hire leading supply chain talent. We expect our 2025 tax rate to be 21% and diluted share count to be approximately 63 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, our preliminary 2025 parameters include: total revenue, excluding license and maintenance attrition, to increase 14%; cloud revenue to increase 23%; services revenue to increase 8%; and RPO to increase 21%; and for an operating margin of 33.5% while increasing our investment in Manhattan leading innovation. All-in, solid execution by our global Manhattan team and looking forward to the ending the year strong. Thank you very much, and back to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Yeah, thanks, Dennis. Well, we're pleased with our Q3 and our year-to-date results. While we continue to be appropriately cautious, I think, on the volatile macro conditions, and we did experience a more pronounced impact this quarter, as we said earlier though, we're still very confident in achieving the high end of our RPO goals for 2024. Longer term, our business fundamentals, win rates and innovation strategies are really solid. And accordingly, we're optimistic about expanding our opportunity and we've provided what we consider to be albeit preliminary, but responsible targets for 2025. So, we thank everybody for joining the call, and we thank our global team for all the great work that they do for our customers. So, that concludes our prepared remarks, and Alicia, we'll be happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Great. Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTerry Tillman: Yeah, thanks. Hi, Eddie, Dennis and Mike. Just two questions for me. The first question is, Eddie, I don't recall usually in press releases giving commentary on the current quarter. So, you said off to a good start and you talked about it on in your prepared remarks. Could we just dig into that or double-click into that a little bit more? Have you actually seen some of those deals slip have actually closed? And the second part of that first question is, what kind of signals are you getting particularly on these bigger transformational deals that there's some budget flush in store here in 4Q and are you assuming that? And then, I had a follow-up for Dennis.\nEddie Capel: Good luck about -- packing there, Terry. Thanks. Yeah, so let's see, in the start to Q4 -- the good start to Q4 has been a combination of some of the deals that slipped from Q3 into Q4 closing, but also some of the deals that we expected to close early in Q4 to indeed close. So, just feel good about where we are in that regard, hence the reiteration of the full year RPO guidance. In terms of budget flush, don't expect to see that frankly. I think for the most part, the days of end-of-year budget flush seem to have disappeared because we're talking about OpEx here and a longer-term revenue stream for us and cost commitment for our customers. So, the days where customers and products mix may well flush a little budget on a one-time license payment seems to largely have gone away.\nTerry Tillman: Okay, got it. Thanks, Eddie. And I guess, Dennis, just a follow-up. Thanks for all the commentary for '25. The one thing on services, what I'm curious about is because you're talking about hitting at least the high end of your RPO guidance for this year and it looks pretty constructive in terms of the initial RPO targets for next year. On the services side, I'm curious is there something to be said about some of these customers just maybe being more frugal when they sign a contract maybe they're just using less resources and you're assuming that, or they're just kind of using maybe a longer duration of rolling it out, so it could impact services, and/or is there just maybe some incremental conservatism you're baking in because of some of these risk factors like the global macro, elections, et cetera?\nEddie Capel: Terry, I'll take the first half of that. Dennis can talk about any conservatism and so forth contingent that he may have built into the model, but I would tell you that there is kind of two components. One is, frankly, we are getting more efficient. There's no question as we've been -- gone down this journey, the cost of implementing our Manhattan Active Solutions is getting better and better and better. We've seen on a number of fronts, straight efficiency is getting better on the services side. We're seeing far less customization because of the richness of solutions. So, that's on our side of the fence. And secondly, as I think you know, we've advanced and enhanced our system integrator network. And the good news is they're doing a healthy amount of the work as well. So, we're getting a global reach across those systems integrators. So, that's a little bit of what's going on in there, strong software, but not quite as strong on the services side, but we see that as a largely as a positive.\nTerry Tillman: That's helpful. And then, I guess, maybe just like on the idea though, just kind of finishing up here, Dennis in terms of -- there's always an \"under promise and over deliver\" kind of philosophy here. Is there some incremental conservatism because of some of these things that you can't really control? And then, the thing that I didn't even plan on asking, I'm going to ask, you all benefited from some of these customers committing for long durations. Are you still seeing that kind of multiyear, five-year-plus contracting? Thank you.\nDennis Story: Yeah, on the multiyear, five-year contracting, and you hit the nail on the head, we like to under promise and over deliver, Terry. Yeah.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Thanks. Hi, everyone. I want to begin by following up on the share of bookings coming from net new 14% was the lowest it's been in some time. I guess, is that just emblematic of the type of environment we're in where naturally you'd expect more of the book of business to come from existing customers? And I'm wondering if that's true, within the interest existing customers are expressing, is that leaning more into maybe migrations and that's part of the strong 4Q activity you're seeing, or is the cross-sell vision and truly getting [buy-in] (ph) the Active Supply Chain, is that actually factoring in more prominently?\nEddie Capel: No. I think, Joe, you bring up a good point that it is, I think, the lowest we've seen certainly for quite some time. So, now our spread is 14% to -- I think 52% or 53%, but as you look across the deals, you look across the pipeline and so forth, there was nothing particularly trend worthy in that number. When you look at the pipeline, about 35% of the pipeline is new logos. I'm not calling this, but I would expect this to get back to historical norms in Q4 and going forward.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, that's great. On the large digital transformation projects that sound like they're converting already in 4Q, is that still largely around WMS? Is there a multi-product scope and that's why it's truly digital transformation? And how -- yeah, I think over recent quarters, there's been some cautious optimism that things like Point of Sale might factor more prominently in 2025. Certainly, it seems like Supply Chain Planning is going to start to be more common in the deal flow. Any way to kind of maybe size or quantify or frame kind of those newer products that's kind of playing into the cloud activity?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. Let's see. So, in terms of product mix, you asked specifically about the strong start to Q4, nice product mix in this strong start to Q4. We don't have those percentages and all those kinds of things laid out yet of course, but I know off the top of my head, we've got some WMS deals, we've got some nice OMS deals, we've got a Point of Sale deal in the mix already closed for Q4. So, pretty nice mix. In terms of -- I suppose you're sort of asking for closer to the top of the pipeline funnel on Supply Chain Planning and Point of Sale and those kinds of things. Point of Sale, we're enthused about the pipeline specifically for Q4 and on into 2025. As far as Supply Chain Planning is concerned, obviously, we're 17 days post GA. So, it's a little early to be calling that, but I would tell you the interest and the enthusiasm, as I said in my prepared comments, has been maybe a little -- just a little on the positive side of surprising, both here in the U.S. and in Europe and in APAC, so as we've traveled around the world doing this launch. So, these things don't move the needle overnight, but we are certainly encouraged by the early conversations we're having, and I would also say, both with existing customers and net new conversations around Supply Chain Planning.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Peterson: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, Eddie, I appreciate all the color. We would love to understand if there's any commonality in what's driving the delayed deals for some of these larger customers. Is that a certain end market or getting implementation plans over the finish line? We just love to understand if there's any commonality there.\nEddie Capel: No, nothing that I would call out, Brian. Nobody -- when we talk to folks, there may be just a little -- something a little bit ahead of all others, maybe a little -- a few folks wanted to wait to see how the election shakes down, I don't know how that really impacts their decision, but sometimes that is cited, but all of the other things that are going around the planet are not discussed. So, I think it's just a -- for us, just a little bit of a confidence matter that we've got to get through with our customers. The great news is that our win rates and our selection being selected continues to be very strong. So, some of the deals that have pushed both into Q4 and even further than that, we've been selected. It's just a question of the customer and the prospect getting comfortable that the time is right. So, hence, the reason for, frankly, some of our confidence and enthusiasm.\nBrian Peterson: Understood. Thanks, Eddie. Dennis, maybe one for you. Just -- you, obviously, gave a lot in a preliminary outlook for '25, but at a high level, how should we think about the underlying demand environment that's going to underpinning your assumptions for '25? Thanks, guys.\nDennis Story: No change, Brian.\nEddie Capel: Yeah, no -- I would agree with that. No real change in the demand environment. Obviously, we continue as we have done for a number of years, our vertical diversification. Our global diversification, frankly, remains about the same. So, we're pleased with that. There's no real change there. It moves a little bit again from quarter to quarter. Our product mix remains about the same. And our new logo to existing customer kind of cross-sell and upsell opportunity remains about the same as well. So, no change there and continue to feel optimistic about the near term, but especially our competitive advantage and differentiation going forward.\nBrian Peterson: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nEddie Capel: Sure thing, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [Tim Kurosawa] (ph) with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Kurosawa: Hi, this is George here. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe the first one on the pace of cloud migrations that you guys have seen, I think in the past you've given 15% of the base has migrated over to cloud at this point. Maybe an update either on that number or directionally and how that's trended relative to expectations?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. Up a couple of points as sort of you would expect and continuing to track in about the same direction. So, we're a little less than 20%. It's hard to put an exact number on it, but right in there the midpoint of 15% to 20% or so is sort of where we are. The trajectory seems about the same. I think we're still on about a six year -- my opinion, six-year trajectory to get the bulk of our customers across the bridge.\nGeorge Kurosawa: Okay, great. And then, I did want to follow-up on a line of discussion earlier on the duration of contracts and seeing some longer duration contracts. Was that -- I guess, to put a finer point on it, has duration of contracts on average been increasing and has that had a meaningful impact on RPO?\nEddie Capel: No. Well, so when we first started the transitional process five, six years ago, we originally thought this goes way back. We originally thought three years was sort of going to be the number, but a long time ago, I want to say 2019 or so, maybe even '18, we started to see these five-year contracts being requested primarily because of the stickiness of our systems. And our customers I think thought it made sense for them to be five years, and it's held pretty solid there from -- so that what is that, five or six years now it's been pretty stable maybe 5.5 years.\nDennis Story: No major change.\nEddie Capel: Yeah.\nGeorge Kurosawa: Okay, great. And then, one last if I may, on the margin upside, I think it was pretty impressive. Last quarter, I think you called out mix being a tailwind here. Is that also a story in this quarter? It sounds like scaling was also a benefit, but just how would you frame kind of the upside that you saw in the quarter and in the guidance?\nDennis Story: Absolutely. From a mix standpoint, so fantastic execution by the business, record cloud and services. Yeah, just a great performance there.\nGeorge Kurosawa: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nEddie Capel: Pleasure, George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Schappel: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Eddie, with respect to the tone around your Point of Sale business, maybe just talk about whether there are any Point of Sale deals during the quarter? You may have mentioned this in the call, but I didn't catch it.\nEddie Capel: Yeah. I actually did not. But no Point of Sale deals in Q3, but we have -- I did mention that we have closed one in early Q4. And the near-term pipeline for Point of Sale is encouraging. We're excited about the opportunities even inside the quarter here that we might be able to close.\nMark Schappel: Okay, great. And then, with respect to your sales motion in the quarter, you mentioned new logos, I think were 14%. What about the remaining sales balance in terms of cross-sells and conversions?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. So, 14% was the low. Cross-sells were just a little over 20% and conversions pretty high this quarter at about, call it, 60%, maybe even a little tick above 60% in terms of migrations.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. That's all for me.\nEddie Capel: My pleasure, Mark. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will be from the line of Dylan Becker with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nDylan Becker: Hey, gentlemen. Appreciate the questions here. Maybe, Eddie, starting for you, you called out kind of the Insight offering and Spotlights. Seems like there's a lot more value that you guys can add through these solutions and the data set that you've scaled, but wonder how you're thinking about the opportunity to kind of narrow those benchmarking capabilities over time now that you can reconcile planning and execution, and maybe how this further incentivizes the broader adoption across kind of your platform over time.\nEddie Capel: Well, Dylan, our strategy, no question, is a land-and-expand strategy. We think that as we continue to innovate and increase our TAM in kind of adjacent products and so forth, that ability to cross-sell into our existing customer base is very, very important. Not always, but most of the time customers and prospects buy one SaaS solution at a time, because obviously it takes some time to implement and so forth, no point in paying SaaS fees for something that is going to be implemented nine or 12 months from now, but it's all part and parcel of our strategy to expand our breadth and be able to address greater total addressable market and across an expanded set of verticals.\nDylan Becker: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe for you, Eddie or Dennis here too, you guys called out kind of the internal efficiencies on the services side. You also talked about kind of the evolution of the partner ecosystem. Would love to just kind of get an update on how you're thinking about offloading maybe more of that kind of services work to partners' kind of receptivity appetite and growing that ecosystem? Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, certainly, our services team have done a fabulous job, always have, but continue to get more and more and more efficient. There's no doubt that over the last -- if you kind of look back over the last couple of years, 24 to 30 months or so, frankly, we did a lot of campus recruiting and those guys are really becoming experienced and efficient at what they do now. Our attrition has been low. So again, we're just sort of in fusing experience into our services organization that's creating a great deal of efficiency. On top of that, we're seeing the need for customers to customize our solution go down, and that is because of the thoughtfulness and the richness of the new solutions that we're introducing into the market. We've always said every time we reengineer one of our solutions from the ground floor up, it's based upon all the product experience that we've gained. WMS, for example, 30 years of experience that we put into Manhattan Active WM, everything you could possibly imagine. And we were able and fortunate enough to be able to start from a clean sheet of paper. So, less customization is required, that drives services down. And we've been able to attract a larger systems integrator community for sure and frankly a number of the bigger global systems integrators that are in the program. They're all important, don't get me wrong, all of our partners, but when you look at the guys with global reach like the Accentures and the Caps and Deloitte's and IBMs and so forth, it's not that we're pushing services to them, but if our customers choose to use them either on a regional or a global basis, that's fine by us and we're just seeing a little bit more of that, that's all.\nDylan Becker: Okay, great. Thanks, Eddie.\nEddie Capel: My pleasure, Dylan. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to pass the call back over to Eddie for closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Very good. Thank you, Alicia. Well, thank you very much everybody for joining us today. Thank you for support as always. We'll look forward to getting back together in 90 days or so and reporting on Q4, and also, of course, tightening up then our 2025 guidance for you. But until then, I guess it's very early, but it would be appropriate for me to say happy holidays to everybody, even though it's a little premature, I guess the next time we speak to you it will be after. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter results, discuss our Q4 outlook and provide some very preliminary color at least on 2025. Q3 and year-to-date results set all-time records on both bottom- and top-lines. For the quarter, total revenue increased 12% to $267 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 29% to $1.35, both of these metrics were above our expectations. Driving the top-line outperformance and earnings leverage was solid cloud and services revenue growth across all geographies, with cloud subscription revenue posting 33% growth in the quarter. Manhattan's business fundamentals are solid and we remain confident and very optimistic about our business opportunity. While the global macro environment remains challenging, demand for our solutions is robust, customer satisfaction is high, and as evidenced by our recent release of the Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning solution, the investments we're making in R&D and our people are creating a clear differentiation. Delivering consistent market-leading innovation is creating more opportunities across supply chain, omnichannel retail and at the world's best -- as the world's best brands look to unify and digitally transform. RPO, remaining performance obligation, increased 27% to roughly $1.7 billion. And as we've often cautioned, large, complex deals can be lumpy on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And whilst we haven't seen much of that lumpiness over the past three or four years, this quarter and, to a lesser extent, last quarter, we have seen some. And our third quarter RPO growth was impacted by some large digital transformational projects pushing it. That said, our fourth quarter is off to a great start and demand is solid. And attributes that give us confidence that we will actually achieve at the high end of our 2024 RPO bookings guidance of $1.8 billion. Across our industry-leading product portfolio and -- global pipeline sits at record levels, our win rates remain strong at about 70%. And these factors, despite the uncertain macro environment, again, give us confidence that we'll achieve the high end of our 2024 RPO bookings goals and equally important, are well-positioned for continued success in 2025, 2026, and of course, beyond that. Now, looking a little deeper into our Q3 bookings, from a vertical perspective, 80% of our deals came from retail, manufacturing and wholesale. Across our solutions, the sub-verticals continue to be pretty diverse. And just some of the cloud deals we won this quarter include a North American supply chain solutions provider, a global plastics manufacturer, a multinational home improvement retailer, a global manufacturer of HVAC and refrigeration products, a global life sciences and clinical research company, a global apparel retailer and many others. In Q3, 14% of our new bookings were generated from net new logos, and we continue to have a very healthy mix of conversions, upsells and cross-sells. And we believe this demonstrates the many and varied opportunities we have for sustainable future growth. And as stated earlier, our solution pipeline is at record levels and new potential customers represent about 35% of that demand. This strong demand is driven by a best-of-breed cloud native solutions that provide continuous access to innovation and are helping our customers digitally transform their businesses to drive success. Our mission-critical solutions help our clients improve customer satisfaction, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. And this strong demand for our solutions is also fueling opportunities and growth for our internal services organization and our systems integration partners. In Q3, our global services team completed over 100 go lives and continue to perform very well for our customers. Now, turning to a few product updates. I mentioned last quarter at our annual customer conference, Momentum, we unveiled the Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning solution. And I'm happy to report that as planned, we completed the development and shipped this latest addition to the Manhattan Active family right on schedule 17 days ago, just at the beginning of October. Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning is now generally available, deployed in our evergreen cloud environments, and just like all of the Manhattan Active platform applications, it will receive functional and technical enhancements every single quarter. Since announcing this new offering in May, we've seen notable interest from around the globe. And as we'd hoped and kind of suspected, our WMS and TMS users are fascinated by our vision of combining these solutions with planning to improve their ability to execute in the field. And our Manhattan Active Omni users are digging in as well to see how a real-time view of inventory health can help them make better promising fulfillment decisions, which will yield even more margin advantages for their businesses. Now, as a reminder, Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning is the first planning solution prewired directly into the operations. When combined with Manhattan Active Warehouse Management, for example, our new planning solution will deliver detailed and accurate projections of your DC labor and operational needs for the next 52 weeks, all the way down to the department and job function, if necessary. Now, having been in the WMS business and helping our customers plan their labor for over 30 years now, we feel very confident in saying that today, very few operations are getting anywhere near that level of forward visibility. Being able to match your labor plans to your labor needs from the next 30 minutes down -- up to the next 30 weeks improves just about every operational metric, from on-time shipping to total cost of labor. But we didn't stop there, because just like we put more planning into our WMS solution, we put more execution into our planning solutions as well. Unlike traditional solutions, Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning runs continuously, constantly fine-tuning order quantities, even on orders that are already processing in a distribution center. And this is really transformative, because it allows real-time demand data from throughout the day to continuously shape the final order quantities right up until those orders are ready to be shipped. This level of supply chain agility is simply unachievable without the industry's leading cloud native platform that we call the Manhattan Active Platform. The sub-second always-connected nature of the Manhattan Active applications allows them to collaborate with zero latency, a true industry first. Now, I went into a little bit of detail on that scenario involving Manhattan Active WM, because I thought it would help illustrate the types of benefits that we're going to be -- we're delivering. But rest assured, many other similar use cases exist for that solution, Manhattan Active TM and Manhattan Active Omni as well. And we're in conversations with several customers beginning to activate Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning in early to mid-2025. So, certainly stay tuned for more news, albeit in the early stages of our newest Manhattan Active offering. Now, we take a lot of pride in building software that enables our customers to gain a competitive advantage in their respective markets. Along those lines, we've recently released a few new capabilities with the Manhattan Active Omni that our customers are really applauding. In an earlier quarter, I mentioned that our first-of-a-kind Fulfillment Experience Insights dashboard. This Fulfillment Experience Insights allows our customers to continuously benchmark their omnichannel fulfillment performance against their peers and against their competitors. But we didn't stop there. We knew that this level of insight and visibility was really great, but operational recommendations are better. So, to that end, we recently introduced a capability that we call [Postgame Spotlight] (ph). And Postgame Spotlight provides detailed recommendations on how fulfillment performance can be improved from both a customer experience and a cost point -- standpoint. And this is done by making detailed recommendations on elements like inventory deployment and fulfillment staffing in stores. And we put the spotlight on specific operational changes that we believe will move the needle for our customers. Both Fulfillment Experience Insights and Postgame Spotlight are really great examples of why our prospects choose and customers stay with Manhattan Active Omni. We've moved far beyond enablement and we're now helping customers optimize and finetune their ever-evolving omnichannel fulfillment processes. And finally, on our products, I'd like to provide a brief update on, yes, generative AI. As we've said before, AI is far from a new phenomenon here at Manhattan. We've had our operations, research and data science team embedding AI into nearly every Manhattan application for several decades now. Generative AI is the latest of these powerful technologies, and we're off to a really good start shipping production-ready generative AI capabilities. At Momentum, again, we introduced Manhattan Assist, for example, a generative AI capability accessible from all Manhattan Active solutions. Our customers use Manhattan Assist every single day now, helping them quickly understand the many capabilities within our applications and it's really been great, and kind of fun to be honest, to see the questions that they're asking and some of the answers that we're providing, and frankly, where we can still tune our large language model. Our partners at Google, of course, have continued to be a great help here as they continue to improve the underlying technology at a really rapid pace. So, we're hard at work on our next-generation of GenAI-based capabilities right now and we'll be rolling those out in the first half of 2025. So, that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and our outlook. And then, I'll close our prepared remarks with a brief summary, and then we'll move to Q&A. So, Dennis? Yeah, thanks, Dennis. Well, we're pleased with our Q3 and our year-to-date results. While we continue to be appropriately cautious, I think, on the volatile macro conditions, and we did experience a more pronounced impact this quarter, as we said earlier though, we're still very confident in achieving the high end of our RPO goals for 2024. Longer term, our business fundamentals, win rates and innovation strategies are really solid. And accordingly, we're optimistic about expanding our opportunity and we've provided what we consider to be albeit preliminary, but responsible targets for 2025. So, we thank everybody for joining the call, and we thank our global team for all the great work that they do for our customers. So, that concludes our prepared remarks, and Alicia, we'll be happy to take any questions. Good luck about -- packing there, Terry. Thanks. Yeah, so let's see, in the start to Q4 -- the good start to Q4 has been a combination of some of the deals that slipped from Q3 into Q4 closing, but also some of the deals that we expected to close early in Q4 to indeed close. So, just feel good about where we are in that regard, hence the reiteration of the full year RPO guidance. In terms of budget flush, don't expect to see that frankly. I think for the most part, the days of end-of-year budget flush seem to have disappeared because we're talking about OpEx here and a longer-term revenue stream for us and cost commitment for our customers. So, the days where customers and products mix may well flush a little budget on a one-time license payment seems to largely have gone away. Terry, I'll take the first half of that. Dennis can talk about any conservatism and so forth contingent that he may have built into the model, but I would tell you that there is kind of two components. One is, frankly, we are getting more efficient. There's no question as we've been -- gone down this journey, the cost of implementing our Manhattan Active Solutions is getting better and better and better. We've seen on a number of fronts, straight efficiency is getting better on the services side. We're seeing far less customization because of the richness of solutions. So, that's on our side of the fence. And secondly, as I think you know, we've advanced and enhanced our system integrator network. And the good news is they're doing a healthy amount of the work as well. So, we're getting a global reach across those systems integrators. So, that's a little bit of what's going on in there, strong software, but not quite as strong on the services side, but we see that as a largely as a positive. Thank you, Terry. No. I think, Joe, you bring up a good point that it is, I think, the lowest we've seen certainly for quite some time. So, now our spread is 14% to -- I think 52% or 53%, but as you look across the deals, you look across the pipeline and so forth, there was nothing particularly trend worthy in that number. When you look at the pipeline, about 35% of the pipeline is new logos. I'm not calling this, but I would expect this to get back to historical norms in Q4 and going forward. Yeah. Let's see. So, in terms of product mix, you asked specifically about the strong start to Q4, nice product mix in this strong start to Q4. We don't have those percentages and all those kinds of things laid out yet of course, but I know off the top of my head, we've got some WMS deals, we've got some nice OMS deals, we've got a Point of Sale deal in the mix already closed for Q4. So, pretty nice mix. In terms of -- I suppose you're sort of asking for closer to the top of the pipeline funnel on Supply Chain Planning and Point of Sale and those kinds of things. Point of Sale, we're enthused about the pipeline specifically for Q4 and on into 2025. As far as Supply Chain Planning is concerned, obviously, we're 17 days post GA. So, it's a little early to be calling that, but I would tell you the interest and the enthusiasm, as I said in my prepared comments, has been maybe a little -- just a little on the positive side of surprising, both here in the U.S. and in Europe and in APAC, so as we've traveled around the world doing this launch. So, these things don't move the needle overnight, but we are certainly encouraged by the early conversations we're having, and I would also say, both with existing customers and net new conversations around Supply Chain Planning. Okay. Thank you, Joe. No, nothing that I would call out, Brian. Nobody -- when we talk to folks, there may be just a little -- something a little bit ahead of all others, maybe a little -- a few folks wanted to wait to see how the election shakes down, I don't know how that really impacts their decision, but sometimes that is cited, but all of the other things that are going around the planet are not discussed. So, I think it's just a -- for us, just a little bit of a confidence matter that we've got to get through with our customers. The great news is that our win rates and our selection being selected continues to be very strong. So, some of the deals that have pushed both into Q4 and even further than that, we've been selected. It's just a question of the customer and the prospect getting comfortable that the time is right. So, hence, the reason for, frankly, some of our confidence and enthusiasm. Yeah, no -- I would agree with that. No real change in the demand environment. Obviously, we continue as we have done for a number of years, our vertical diversification. Our global diversification, frankly, remains about the same. So, we're pleased with that. There's no real change there. It moves a little bit again from quarter to quarter. Our product mix remains about the same. And our new logo to existing customer kind of cross-sell and upsell opportunity remains about the same as well. So, no change there and continue to feel optimistic about the near term, but especially our competitive advantage and differentiation going forward. Sure thing, Brian. Yeah. Up a couple of points as sort of you would expect and continuing to track in about the same direction. So, we're a little less than 20%. It's hard to put an exact number on it, but right in there the midpoint of 15% to 20% or so is sort of where we are. The trajectory seems about the same. I think we're still on about a six year -- my opinion, six-year trajectory to get the bulk of our customers across the bridge. No. Well, so when we first started the transitional process five, six years ago, we originally thought this goes way back. We originally thought three years was sort of going to be the number, but a long time ago, I want to say 2019 or so, maybe even '18, we started to see these five-year contracts being requested primarily because of the stickiness of our systems. And our customers I think thought it made sense for them to be five years, and it's held pretty solid there from -- so that what is that, five or six years now it's been pretty stable maybe 5.5 years. Yeah. Pleasure, George. Yeah. I actually did not. But no Point of Sale deals in Q3, but we have -- I did mention that we have closed one in early Q4. And the near-term pipeline for Point of Sale is encouraging. We're excited about the opportunities even inside the quarter here that we might be able to close. Yeah. So, 14% was the low. Cross-sells were just a little over 20% and conversions pretty high this quarter at about, call it, 60%, maybe even a little tick above 60% in terms of migrations. My pleasure, Mark. Thank you. Well, Dylan, our strategy, no question, is a land-and-expand strategy. We think that as we continue to innovate and increase our TAM in kind of adjacent products and so forth, that ability to cross-sell into our existing customer base is very, very important. Not always, but most of the time customers and prospects buy one SaaS solution at a time, because obviously it takes some time to implement and so forth, no point in paying SaaS fees for something that is going to be implemented nine or 12 months from now, but it's all part and parcel of our strategy to expand our breadth and be able to address greater total addressable market and across an expanded set of verticals. Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, certainly, our services team have done a fabulous job, always have, but continue to get more and more and more efficient. There's no doubt that over the last -- if you kind of look back over the last couple of years, 24 to 30 months or so, frankly, we did a lot of campus recruiting and those guys are really becoming experienced and efficient at what they do now. Our attrition has been low. So again, we're just sort of in fusing experience into our services organization that's creating a great deal of efficiency. On top of that, we're seeing the need for customers to customize our solution go down, and that is because of the thoughtfulness and the richness of the new solutions that we're introducing into the market. We've always said every time we reengineer one of our solutions from the ground floor up, it's based upon all the product experience that we've gained. WMS, for example, 30 years of experience that we put into Manhattan Active WM, everything you could possibly imagine. And we were able and fortunate enough to be able to start from a clean sheet of paper. So, less customization is required, that drives services down. And we've been able to attract a larger systems integrator community for sure and frankly a number of the bigger global systems integrators that are in the program. They're all important, don't get me wrong, all of our partners, but when you look at the guys with global reach like the Accentures and the Caps and Deloitte's and IBMs and so forth, it's not that we're pushing services to them, but if our customers choose to use them either on a regional or a global basis, that's fine by us and we're just seeing a little bit more of that, that's all. My pleasure, Dylan. Thank you. Very good. Thank you, Alicia. Well, thank you very much everybody for joining us today. Thank you for support as always. We'll look forward to getting back together in 90 days or so and reporting on Q4, and also, of course, tightening up then our 2025 guidance for you. But until then, I guess it's very early, but it would be appropriate for me to say happy holidays to everybody, even though it's a little premature, I guess the next time we speak to you it will be after. Thank you. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan global teams continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong balanced financial performance across top-line growth, operating margin and cash flows. This includes posting record results across RPO, revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On an as-reported basis, our Q3 results came in slightly below the Rule of 50. And if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceeded the Rule of 50. Of course, FX has remained volatile. It did not have a meaningful impact to Q3 revenue growth, but was a $9 million tailwind to year-to-date RPO growth and an $18 million tailwind to sequential RPO growth. Now, to our results. All growth rates are on an as-reported year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. Total revenue was $267 million, up 12%. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 15%. Cloud revenue totaled $86 million, up 33%. We ended the quarter with RPO of roughly $1.7 billion, up 27% compared to the prior year and up 5% sequentially. And as Eddie discussed, several large strategic digital transformational deals pushed. Importantly, Manhattan continues to benefit from a record pipeline that includes solid demand from both new and existing customers, and strong win rates are giving us confidence in achieving the high end of our 2024 RPO bookings outlook and the ability to provide strong 2025 outlook parameters. Our global services teams delivered record revenue, totaling $137 million, up 7%, as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth for Manhattan. Adjusted operating profit was $99 million, with adjusted operating margin of 37.1%. This is 670 basis points year-over-year up. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our cloud business continues to scale. As Eddie discussed, we are very optimistic on our business opportunity and continue to invest in innovation to drive sustainable long-term growth. Turning to EPS, earnings per share, we delivered Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $1.35, up 29%, and GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, up 30%. Moving to cash, Q3 operating cash flow increased 6% to a solid $62 million. This resulted in 23% free cash flow margin and 38% adjusted EBITDA margin. Regarding the balance sheet, total deferred revenue increased 18% to $253 million. We ended the quarter with $215 million in cash and zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $50 million in share repurchases in the quarter, resulting in $198 million in buybacks year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. On to our updated 2024 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top-line growth and top-quartile operating margins, benchmarked against any enterprise SaaS comps. These are important drivers to our best-in-class return on invested capital as we maintain a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our strong year-to-date performance in an uneven macro environment, we are tightening our 2024 revenue guidance and increasing our operating margin and EPS guidance. Details can be found in today's earnings release. Also, as discussed earlier, we expect to achieve the high end of our 2024 RPO outlook of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. As noticed on the -- as noted on the prior earnings calls, our objective is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly, on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year as evidenced by our Q3 deal pushes. All guidance references made on today's call will be at the midpoint of their respective ranges. With that, for the full year 2024, we expect total revenue of $1.039 billion to $1.041 billion, with a $1.04 billion midpoint, which represents 12% growth. For operating margin, we are increasing our midpoint to 34%. This compares favorably from our prior midpoint of 32.1% and 30.4% in the prior-year period. As Eddie highlighted, given the demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business to fully leverage the new large TAM expansion revenue streams through investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Our full year earnings per share midpoint is increasing $0.35 to $4.61 and represents 23% growth compared to the prior year. For GAAP earnings per share, our midpoint increases by $0.36 to $3.48 and also represents 23% growth compared to the prior year. This implies Q4 total revenue of $253.5 million, which is $3.5 million lower than our prior Q4 midpoint as we now anticipate services revenue of $121.5 million, as the choppy macro environment has resulted in several transformational deal pushes, some customers shifting services projects to 2025 and a more pronounced pausing impact from this year's retail peak season. We are increasing our cloud target to $89.5 million and maintenance revenue upticks to $33.5 million. Our operating margin target is increasing to 32.5% and is up from our prior 30.5% estimate. The Q4 sequential change in operating margin accounts for retail peak seasonality, which as a reminder is when customers idle implementations to focus on their peak busy season. Now moving to 2025, we're going to provide some preliminary parameters here. We are currently in the very early stages of our 2025 budget cycle and will firm up this outlook on our Q4 call as we get through the U.S. election process and our final market analysis. With that, we are targeting total revenue of $1.13 billion to $1.14 billion, representing 9% to 10% growth, with license and maintenance attrition masking total growth by 5 percentage points. This includes our cloud revenue target of $415 million, representing 23% year-over-year growth. For RPO, we are targeting $2.15 billion, which represents 21% growth. In 2025, we are targeting services revenue of $565 million to $575 million. The $570 million midpoint represents 8% growth. On license and maintenance attrition to cloud, we are targeting maintenance revenue to be about $118 million, which represents a 15% decline, and for license revenue to be about $5 million, which is well below 1% of total revenue. We anticipate operating margin to be about 33.5%. Normalizing for our license and maintenance revenue attrition to cloud, our 2025 operating margin increases roughly 100 bps year-over-year, while we simultaneously increase our investment in our business and hire leading supply chain talent. We expect our 2025 tax rate to be 21% and diluted share count to be approximately 63 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. In summary, our preliminary 2025 parameters include: total revenue, excluding license and maintenance attrition, to increase 14%; cloud revenue to increase 23%; services revenue to increase 8%; and RPO to increase 21%; and for an operating margin of 33.5% while increasing our investment in Manhattan leading innovation. All-in, solid execution by our global Manhattan team and looking forward to the ending the year strong. Thank you very much, and back to Eddie. Yeah, on the multiyear, five-year contracting, and you hit the nail on the head, we like to under promise and over deliver, Terry. Yeah. No change, Brian. No major change. Absolutely. From a mix standpoint, so fantastic execution by the business, record cloud and services. Yeah, just a great performance there."

Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our second quarter results and discuss our increased full year financial 2024 outlook. Manhattan delivered record Q2 and first half results. For the quarter, total revenue increased 15% to $265 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 34% to $1.18, both exceeding our expectations. Driving the topline outperformance in earnings leverage was 35% growth in cloud revenue and 10% growth in services revenue, and this encompasses double-digit topline growth across all of our geographies as our global teams continue to execute very well for our customers. While the global macro environment certainly remains volatile, Manhattan\u2019s business is solid, and we\u2019re very optimistic about our business opportunity. Demand for our solutions are robust, customer satisfaction is high and investment in R&D and our associates continue to widen our technological leadership across our supply chain planning, execution and omni-channel retail offerings. Now, RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 29% to just over $1.6 billion. Demand for our mission-critical cloud solutions remains strong and resilient across all of our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter, deals won include a global apparel and home fashions retailer, a global developer and manufacturer of construction equipment, a grocery chain, a global manufacturer of HVAC and refrigeration products, a global supply chain management company, a beauty and wellness retailer, as well as a number of others. Overall, competitive win rates remain solid at about 75%. 20% of our Q2 new bookings were generated from net new logos and we continue to have a healthy mix of conversions, upsells and cross-sells. While the timing of large deals and bookings mix will certainly vary on a quarterly basis, we believe our sales breadth exemplifies the many and varied opportunities for sustainable future growth. The key to this growth and steady execution is unparalleled combination of industry-leading solutions and world-class service that we provide to our customers. Our best-of-breed cloud-native platform and solutions provide continuous access to innovation and are a key component of our customer success. These mission-critical solutions help our clients strengthen their relationships with their end customers, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. These powerful benefits are translating into record solutions pipeline for us with new potential customers representing about 35% of the demand. A solid product demand is also fueling opportunities for growth of our internal services organization, as well as the growing roster of Manhattan value partners. Now like the last few quarters, our global services team completed over 100 go-lives in Q2 and continue to perform very well for our customers. And while we remain appropriately cautious on the global economy, we continue to invest to drive growth from our numerous opportunities. This includes monetizing strategic investments in industry-leading innovation, further enablement of our customer success and the expansion of our addressable market. From a hiring perspective, we\u2019ve hired just over 100 new team members year-to-date and plan on continuing our hiring posture for the remainder of the year. Turning now to just a few updates on our products. But before I cover the important new product announcements we made in May at our Momentum Customer Conference, I\u2019d like to highlight some recent external validation of the innovation that we\u2019ve been delivering within applications. And certainly while the most important validation we get is from our customers, it is also gratifying to see our product recognized by some of these third parties. So first, we had two of our applications named Innovation of the Year by two industry publications. The first recipient was our recently released Fulfillment Experience Insight Dashboard, part of Manhattan Active Omni. This new capability allows our Manhattan Active Omni customers to benchmark their omni-channel fulfillment performance against a group of peers. And Manhattan Yard Management was also recognized as an Innovation of the Year. This is part of our Manhattan Active Supply Chain Execution Platform and the solution unifies distribution and logistics where they come together in the physical world. And a quick mention of the most recently published Gartner Magic Quadrants for Warehouse Management and Transportation Management. For the 16th consecutive year, Manhattan was the definitive leader in the WMS Magic Quadrant and for the sixth consecutive year, Manhattan was amongst a small group of vendors in the leaders\u2019 category in the TMS Magic Quadrant, and we\u2019re certainly very appreciative of Gartner\u2019s recognition of our serial investment in innovation. Now let\u2019s turn to a couple of important product updates. First, let\u2019s talk about generative AI. As I\u2019ve mentioned on prior calls, since the initial availability of generative AI models, our engineers have been hard at work designing and building and testing, of course, generative AI-based capabilities. At Momentum, we announced the first of these capabilities in the form of a new product called Manhattan Active Maven. Part of our Manhattan Active Omni Platform, the Manhattan Active Maven is a gen AI-powered application which provides both best-in-class consumer-facing chatbots and the powerful set of capabilities to assist contact center agents. Generative AI technologies, provided they\u2019ve been trained on the right underlying data, are particularly well-suited to automating customer service tasks, because of their ability to answer a very wide range of questions. And leveraging the underlying data is where the Manhattan Active Platform really shines. Because from day one, we\u2019ve built the Manhattan Active Platform applications as API-first. Literally everything in our applications and everything our applications do is available via an API. And this approach gives Manhattan a major advantage when it comes to leveraging generative AI. Our API-first approach is one of the key reasons Manhattan Active Maven is proving to be so very powerful, going far beyond answering the basic questions of where\u2019s my order. Maven can answer detailed questions about payments, check inventory at local stores or even change delivery methods for orders that are already being processed. Manhattan Active Maven also provides power efficiency enhancing capabilities for call center agents as well. Manhattan Active Maven makes its debut this month. Like all Manhattan Active Platform applications, we\u2019ll get better and better and better each quarter thereafter. At Momentum, we also announced Manhattan Assist, a gen AI powered feature available across all Manhattan Active applications. Manhattan Assist\u2019s first set of capabilities focus on helping our customers get maximum value from their investments in our platform applications. Our users can now ask Assist detailed questions about the best way to achieve a particular business objective, how to configure a specific behavior and then be guided directly to the relevant configuration screens. And last, but certainly not least though, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes talking about the biggest announcement that we made a few months back at Momentum. Coming this fall, we\u2019ll be releasing Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning, the culmination of about a decade of investment to move our enterprise applications to an industry-leading cloud-native platform. The release of Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning will complete our work to fully transform our solution portfolio to being cloud-first. And just as importantly, we\u2019ll make the first, we\u2019ll be the first and only vendor to enable a unified cloud-nating offering, spanning both Supply Chain Planning and Supply Chain Execution. And consistent with the vision that we brought to market with Manhattan Active Omni and Manhattan Active Supply Chain Execution, Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning customers will benefit substantially from the power of unification. Now in this case, unification works at several levels. First, via composable set of APIs we use to unify demand forecasting, allocation and replenishment all into a single application. The vast majority of businesses you see distribute and sell both allocated and replenished products. And today, this dual inventory flow method really necessitates either using two disparate systems with the enterprise or planning one pool of items without systemic support for all of them. And now for the first time, customers are going to be able to use a single demand forecast to drive both allocated and replenished products. But it\u2019s actually the second and larger form of unification which is proving to be the most exciting and interesting to our customers so far. We call this next level of unification unified business planning because it enables our customers to drive their inventory, labor and transportation forecasts all from a single demand forecast in order projection. Now our supply chain practitioners are going to be able to see everything from a transportation forecast on a particular outbound transit lane six months out to a required picking associate forecast 26 hours out and everything in between. And this detailed operational forecast enables much more effective labor planning and ensuring that adequate label capacity to meet customer demand and orders is driven without expensive overtime. On the transportation front, the ability for our customers to collaborate with their strategic carriers using detailed transportation capacity forecasts ensure that they\u2019ve got the exact capacity they need at the best of available rates, limiting how often they have to go out to the spot market. But beyond forecast visibility, Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning is going to enable dynamic collaboration between planning and execution, whether it\u2019s turning an inbound purchase order quantity to enable the more efficient transportation or dynamically changing the quantities of in-flight store replenishment orders based upon the very latest sales data. Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning uses dynamic, always-on optimization to process and adjust the plan in real time based on sales and operating data. It\u2019s truly the first of a kind and we\u2019re very excited to debut this in the fall of this year. Now this concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and outlook, and then I\u2019ll close off prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan Global teams continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong, balanced financial performance across topline growth, operating margin and cash flow. This includes posting record results across RPO, revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On an as-reported basis, our Q2 results came in at the Rule of 50 and if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceeded the Rule of 50. FX did not have a meaningful impact to RPO or revenue in the quarter. Also, in reviewing our financial performance, growth rates are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. So, for the quarter, total revenue was $265 million, up 15%, that\u2019s a double-digit. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 19%. Cloud revenue totaled $82 million, up 35%. We ended the quarter with RPO of $1.6 billion, up 29% compared to the prior year and up 6% sequentially. This solid performance was driven by a healthy mix of sales from both new and existing customers, and transactions from across our Manhattan Active Suite of products. Growth was partially offset by some deals pushing into future periods at quarter end. On an FX-adjusted basis, our first half RPO results tracked towards the high end of our RPO guidance. And as Eddie highlighted, we are entering the second half of 2024 with a record pipeline and are confident in our ability to hit our bookings goals. Our global services teams delivered record revenue totaling $137 million, up 10%. This was in line with our expectations as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth for Manhattan. Adjusted operating profit was $93 million, up 36%, with adjusted operating margin of 35%. This is up 540 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our cloud business continues to scale. Importantly, as Eddie discussed, we are very optimistic on our business opportunity and continue to invest in innovation to drive sustainable long-term growth. Turning to earnings per share, we delivered Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $1.18, up 34%. And GAAP earnings per share of the $0.85, up 35%. Moving to cash, Q2 operating cash flow increased 81% to a solid $73 million. This resulted in 27% free cash flow margin and 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. The difference is due to $35 million in cash taxes paid in the quarter. Year-to-date, our operating cash flow is up 29% to $128 million. Regarding the balance sheet, total deferred revenue increased 14% to $260 million. We ended the quarter with $203 million in cash and zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $75 million in share repurchases in the quarter, resulting in $148 million in buybacks year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. So that covers the Q2 summary, which our associates delivered 13 double-digit returns on key metrics in the quarter. Now on to our updated 2024 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit topline growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. These are important drivers to our best-in-class return on invested capital as we maintain a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our solid first half performance, we are again raising our 2024 revenue and operating margin in earnings per share guidance, which can be found in today\u2019s earnings release. We are also reiterating our 2024 RPO target range and midpoint of $1.78 billion. As noted on the prior earnings calls, our objective is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly, on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or nonlinear bookings throughout the year. With that, for the full year 2024, we expect total revenue of $1.036 billion to $1.044 billion, with a $1.04 billion midpoint comparing favorably to our prior outlook and representing 17% growth, excluding license and maintenance, and 12% all-in. For Q3, we are targeting total revenue of $261 million to $265 million, accounting for retail peak seasonality. For Q4, we are targeting a midpoint of $257 million. For adjusted operating margin, we are increasing the midpoint to 32.1% from our prior midpoint of 29.8%, which includes 120-basis-point headwind from our license and maintenance revenue attrition to cloud. And as Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business. At the midpoint, we are targeting Q3 adjusted operating margin of 31.5% and accounting for retail peak seasonality of 30.5% in Q4. Our full year adjusted earnings per share is increasing by $0.36 to $4.26 up 9% from our prior midpoint of $3.90. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 earnings per share of $1.06 and accounting for retail peak seasonality of $1 in Q4. Similarly, for GAAP earnings per share, our midpoint increases by $0.30 to $3.12. For Q3, we are targeting GAAP earnings per share of $0.74. Here are some additional details on our 2024 outlook. We are increasing our cloud revenue midpoint to $334.5 million, representing 31% growth. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $85 million in Q3 and $89 million in Q4. Due to the timing of project go-lives and several deal pushes, we are tweaking our services forecast slightly lower by $4 million to $535 million to $539 million, with the $537 million midpoint representing 10% growth. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 services revenue of $136 million and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $130 million in Q4. For maintenance, our midpoint upticks to $134 million, which represents a 7% decline. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $34 million in Q3 and $30 million in Q4. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin, we are targeting 140 basis points of margin improvement for the year. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% for Q3 and Q4, and our diluted share count to be 62.2 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. That covers the financial update. I\u2019ll turn it back to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thanks, Dennis. Terrific. Well, we\u2019re certainly very pleased with our second quarter and our first half results. Of course, we continue to be appropriately cautious on the volatile macro conditions that are out there, and there\u2019s no doubt that we experience more, a little more choppiness this quarter than we usually do, but clearly our business fundamentals are very solid. We continue to be very optimistic about expanding our market opportunity and we enter the second half of 2024 from a -- certainly from a position of strength. So, we thank everybody for joining the call, and thank you to our global team for all the great work that they\u2019re doing for our customers out there in the field. So, that concludes our prepared remarks, and Alicia, we\u2019d be happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTerry Tillman: Hey. Good afternoon, Eddie, Dennis and Mike. Thanks for taking my questions, and I guess, I would say congratulations, especially on the operating margin and the operating profit. It\u2019s very impressive. I\u2019m going to go a little bit different here and ask maybe two and a half questions versus two questions, so hopefully that\u2019s okay. But maybe the first question for you, Eddie, is you have a large WMS installed base. I think I asked last quarter or the quarter prior as well, just where are we now on the cycle in terms of folks somewhere in the journey of kicking off a move to cloud WMS? So whether they\u2019ve signed deals, they\u2019re in flight or they\u2019re fully up and running, just whether it\u2019s sites or percentage of the installed base, we\u2019d love to get an update on that. And then I had, like I said, maybe one and a half other questions.\nEddie Capel: Sure. Certainly, Terry. In terms of migrating our existing customers to the cloud, we\u2019re about 15% through the journey. Now, I\u2019ve said that we think the journey is about a six-year or seven-year journey. Now, to be clear, I\u2019ve been saying it\u2019s a six-year or seven-year journey for about a year and a half now. It does seem to sort of extend out a little bit. But I still think that horizon is about what we\u2019re looking at. Maybe there\u2019ll be a couple of stragglers at the end of it. But to specifically ask your question, within a couple of decimal places, we\u2019re about 15% through the migration.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful, Eddie. And I guess maybe the second question and then just one more follow-up. If we looked at demand, so whether it\u2019s WMS or your other SKUs, how does it feel from a geo perspective across the different geographies you\u2019re in? You talked about a couple of large deals or deals that flipped, but overall, it sounded pretty solid. But what are you seeing? Is it pretty balanced across geos or do you see any kind of interesting patterns across geos? And then I had a follow-up.\nEddie Capel: Yeah. It\u2019s pretty balanced, Terry, across geos and across products. I would say that given we focus mostly on finished goods, less on manufacturing and with a little bit of tension between the U.S. and China, our Chinese market is probably a little flatter, but it\u2019s a very small piece of our business to begin with. So honestly, the flatness there, you don\u2019t really see. It\u2019s not terribly consequential to the overall topline.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. And then just the last question for you, Dennis. I mean, 27%, if I have this right, free cash flow margin is pretty strong, and that\u2019s, I guess, with $35 million or so in cash taxes. Can you share whether it\u2019s in third quarter or the second half? Is it about the same level of cash taxes you\u2019re assuming or do you get a little bit of benefit than the second half or less of a headwind? Thank you.\nDennis Story: It\u2019s about the same level, Terry. So it\u2019ll be in the neighborhood of $35 million to $38 million in the second half.\nTerry Tillman: In the second half, not per quarter, second half.\nDennis Story: That\u2019s right.\nTerry Tillman: Okay. Thank you all. Congrats.\nDennis Story: Basically, we\u2019ll spread it across the second half.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. All right. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Very good. Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start by asking about the opportunity created within SAP\u2019s installed base by needing to migrate off legacy on-prem versions of their WM and ERP. I think Manhattan has already signed customers. That initiated RFPs because of these migration events. Do you think this is starting to register more prominently in your pipeline activity or could it actually become bigger as end-of-life dates approach? I think there\u2019s one next year and then also in 2027?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. It\u2019s a good question, Joe. I mean, it\u2019s certainly not anything that we\u2019re banking on to be perfectly honest with you. But it is a, I would say, sort of a growing trend. We\u2019ve seen some customers being quite public about it, frankly. They\u2019re moving from on-prem to S4 HANA, moving to the CLAG with SAP. It\u2019s a like-for-like move for them. And they -- these -- the customers that we have, have concluded that they need to innovate in the supply chain area and fortunately have chosen us to be able to do that. They tend to be the larger global players, so the decision-making process is not super-fast or anything, but it\u2019s very strategic for us. And I think there\u2019s more of it to come. It\u2019s not going to be hundreds of customers or anything like that, that I don\u2019t think, but it will be a strategic advantage for us to be able to provide that immediate access to innovation in areas that they need it.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. That\u2019s great. And then maybe another strategic advantage for you. So your qualitative comments, Eddie, about just the deal signs in the quarter, you mentioned a number of global customers and brands. I don\u2019t quite remember the global descriptor as often as this quarter. I guess, are these bigger deals by virtue of being with global accounts and is the global scope something that is maybe a bit new relative to the demand you\u2019ve seen so far?\nEddie Capel: No. I\u2019d love to tell you it was something new, but we\u2019ve got a lot of global customers, Joe. There was a nice spread this quarter, there\u2019s no question, both across vertical and across geo. But honestly, it wasn\u2019t typically or particularly unusual this quarter.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Fair enough. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. So, Eddie, you had a lot of product innovation, you mentioned out of Momentum, a lot of new products that are coming to market later this year. I\u2019d be curious, as we think about maybe the next 12 months to 18 months in that cross-sell opportunity, what are you most excited about?\nEddie Capel: Oh! Wow! That\u2019s a great question. I\u2019m excited about a lot of things, I really am. I mean, the -- certainly Supply Chain Planning that we announced at Momentum a couple of months ago, it launches right at the end of Q3. This quarter for us is very exciting. It\u2019s a journey, frankly, and something that the supply chain software industry has been chasing for decades now to bring together Supply Chain Planning and Supply Chain Execution on a truly unified platform, and we\u2019re the first ones to get there and so forth, and obviously, we\u2019re excited. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity and we\u2019re excited for the first mover opportunity. I would tell you that I continue to be very excited about our opportunity in point-of-sale and retail store systems. Before you ask, we didn\u2019t actually close any point-of-sale deals in Q2, but that does not douse my enthusiasm at all. The pipeline is in a pretty state for us. We continue to have very encouraging conversations, both with existing customers and new prospects in that area and making what we think is really good progress. We did have some nice new go-lives in the quarter with customers that we\u2019d signed in prior quarters going live for the first time with point-of-sale in Q2. But listen, let us not lose that focus on Warehouse Management. It continues to be a very important part of our portfolio. We\u2019ve got a terrific pipeline for WMS as well. So I\u2019m pretty much going down the product portfolio telling them I\u2019m excited about everything we\u2019re doing. But I suppose in the near-term, the true release of Supply Chain Planning in the fall would have to be top of the list at the moment.\nBrian Peterson: Great color. Thanks, Eddie. And Dennis, maybe a follow-up for you. If I\u2019m looking at the gross margins for subscriptions and maintenance and services, that was much higher than we had modeled up north of 300 basis points year-over-year. Anything you call out that\u2019s driving that? Thanks, guys.\nDennis Story: Just a positive mix between services and cloud and the gross margin.\nBrian Peterson: Okay. So just more on the mix of the revenue components.\nDennis Story: Yeah.\nBrian Peterson: Got it. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dylan Becker with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nDylan Becker: Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe, Eddie, starting with you, obviously, a lot of the retailers and businesses you\u2019re talking to are looking to operate more efficiently. I think labor constraints are a big component of that. I wonder how are your conversations trending as you think about the opportunity for a modern platform or point-of-sale as a key enabler of driving not only efficiency, upscaling, obviously, employee retention tied to that tangible ROI and how that\u2019s maybe helping continue to kind of contribute to some of the resiliency or decisioning that you\u2019re seeing today?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s true in the retail stores, efficiency is important, obviously, revenue generation is the key factor in stores. But you quickly mentioned a quick point there, the retention of team members in stores, being able to have them or enable them with modern technology both from an efficiency and a retention perspective is super important. But also the labor component inside distribution centers, hard to find, hard to keep, the need to be flexible and so forth is very, very important. And the level of automation that our customers are putting into distribution centers is continuing to increase because of that lack of availability of labor and the need to improve efficiency. And we -- as you know, we thrive in environments that are complex in that nature, highly automated and the need for a great deal of velocity and throughput from those distribution centers. We think that the innovation that we\u2019ve built over the last 10 years meets those market needs and is definitely a differentiator for us.\nDylan Becker: Okay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe switching over to you, Dennis, and sticking with the gross margin theme, obviously, that favorable mix shift is going to continue, but how much -- how should we think about kind of the opportunity for further leverage, maybe even more towards the steady state dynamic as we think about where the cloud business sits today, leverage and efficiencies as that continues to scale paired with the opportunity of that becoming a larger share of the business here over the next three years to five years or so?\nDennis Story: Yeah. Early -- I mean early days, we\u2019ll give more commentary in the Q3 call on our outlook for next year, not trying to push you off there, but we feel real good around our margin profiles and very confident.\nDylan Becker: Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks guys.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Dylan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Kurosawa with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Kurosawa: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a good result here in a choppy environment. I wanted to touch on the deal pushouts you called out. Any kind of commonalities between those deals and are those situations where they signed in the first few weeks here of July or maybe there\u2019s kind of budgetary situations those might kind of push out till later in the year?\nEddie Capel: Yeah. No particular comment -- no commonality, excuse me, there, George. They spanned geographies, they spanned industries, they spanned product offerings and proposals that we had out there, so I\u2019d love to point at something and tell you it was funds being put towards gen AI or whatever, some thread, but it really wasn\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t anything specific there. I\u2019m not going to go into a ton of details this early in the quarter. Yes, a couple of them have closed, so that\u2019s been helpful. The good news is across all of that is that win rates are at 75%, so they weren\u2019t losses. They were just sort of stutter steps for a variety of reasons across the Board.\nGeorge Kurosawa: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on services, I think, there\u2019s a commentary about kind of retaining your hiring posture. Maybe just kind of to double click on what exactly you meant there in terms of does that imply kind of hiring for replacement or maybe expanding by, let\u2019s say, another 100 heads in the kind of back half? Just any color would be helpful.\nEddie Capel: Yeah. We plan to continue to hire. Now, the good news is that our attrition rate is for this year is lower than we had forecasted, so that helps in all kinds of different ways, not least of which on efficiency, margin, customer satisfaction and so forth. But lower attrition does mean potentially a little bit less hiring, but we do definitely plan to expand that team in the second half of the year for sure and those hires will be largely in customer-facing and services roles.\nGeorge Kurosawa: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.\nEddie Capel: Certainly. Our pleasure, George. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Schappel: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here and nice job on the quarter. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just have one here with respect to Active Supply Chain Planning. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about whether that solution is designed to go head-to-head with some of the more established supply chain planning systems out there, like from Blue Yonder and Kinaxis.\nEddie Capel: Well, yes, probably not so much Kinaxis, because it\u2019s a little further down market and a little more manufacturing focused. But, yes, it certainly is. Obviously, we -- Mark, as you know, are not focused on the manufacturing side of planning, so it\u2019s certainly in the finished goods side of the world and so forth. But the answer to that is yes, but of course we\u2019re taking quite a different approach with this being not a batch-based solution as they traditionally have been for the last several decades. Number one, continuous planning and inventory optimization integrated and unified with Supply Chain Execution systems. So, definitely the holy grail of the things that we\u2019ve been -- the world and market has been chasing for quite some time now.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all for me.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Eddie for closing comments.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Well, thank you, Alicia, and thank you everybody for joining the call. We\u2019re excited about where we are. We\u2019re excited about the results for the first half, even more excited about the second half of 2024 and beyond. So, thanks a ton for joining the call and we\u2019ll speak to you in about three months from now with Q3 update. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our second quarter results and discuss our increased full year financial 2024 outlook. Manhattan delivered record Q2 and first half results. For the quarter, total revenue increased 15% to $265 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 34% to $1.18, both exceeding our expectations. Driving the topline outperformance in earnings leverage was 35% growth in cloud revenue and 10% growth in services revenue, and this encompasses double-digit topline growth across all of our geographies as our global teams continue to execute very well for our customers. While the global macro environment certainly remains volatile, Manhattan's business is solid, and we're very optimistic about our business opportunity. Demand for our solutions are robust, customer satisfaction is high and investment in R&D and our associates continue to widen our technological leadership across our supply chain planning, execution and omni-channel retail offerings. Now, RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 29% to just over $1.6 billion. Demand for our mission-critical cloud solutions remains strong and resilient across all of our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing and wholesale continue to drive more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. And across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter, deals won include a global apparel and home fashions retailer, a global developer and manufacturer of construction equipment, a grocery chain, a global manufacturer of HVAC and refrigeration products, a global supply chain management company, a beauty and wellness retailer, as well as a number of others. Overall, competitive win rates remain solid at about 75%. 20% of our Q2 new bookings were generated from net new logos and we continue to have a healthy mix of conversions, upsells and cross-sells. While the timing of large deals and bookings mix will certainly vary on a quarterly basis, we believe our sales breadth exemplifies the many and varied opportunities for sustainable future growth. The key to this growth and steady execution is unparalleled combination of industry-leading solutions and world-class service that we provide to our customers. Our best-of-breed cloud-native platform and solutions provide continuous access to innovation and are a key component of our customer success. These mission-critical solutions help our clients strengthen their relationships with their end customers, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. These powerful benefits are translating into record solutions pipeline for us with new potential customers representing about 35% of the demand. A solid product demand is also fueling opportunities for growth of our internal services organization, as well as the growing roster of Manhattan value partners. Now like the last few quarters, our global services team completed over 100 go-lives in Q2 and continue to perform very well for our customers. And while we remain appropriately cautious on the global economy, we continue to invest to drive growth from our numerous opportunities. This includes monetizing strategic investments in industry-leading innovation, further enablement of our customer success and the expansion of our addressable market. From a hiring perspective, we've hired just over 100 new team members year-to-date and plan on continuing our hiring posture for the remainder of the year. Turning now to just a few updates on our products. But before I cover the important new product announcements we made in May at our Momentum Customer Conference, I'd like to highlight some recent external validation of the innovation that we've been delivering within applications. And certainly while the most important validation we get is from our customers, it is also gratifying to see our product recognized by some of these third parties. So first, we had two of our applications named Innovation of the Year by two industry publications. The first recipient was our recently released Fulfillment Experience Insight Dashboard, part of Manhattan Active Omni. This new capability allows our Manhattan Active Omni customers to benchmark their omni-channel fulfillment performance against a group of peers. And Manhattan Yard Management was also recognized as an Innovation of the Year. This is part of our Manhattan Active Supply Chain Execution Platform and the solution unifies distribution and logistics where they come together in the physical world. And a quick mention of the most recently published Gartner Magic Quadrants for Warehouse Management and Transportation Management. For the 16th consecutive year, Manhattan was the definitive leader in the WMS Magic Quadrant and for the sixth consecutive year, Manhattan was amongst a small group of vendors in the leaders' category in the TMS Magic Quadrant, and we're certainly very appreciative of Gartner's recognition of our serial investment in innovation. Now let's turn to a couple of important product updates. First, let's talk about generative AI. As I've mentioned on prior calls, since the initial availability of generative AI models, our engineers have been hard at work designing and building and testing, of course, generative AI-based capabilities. At Momentum, we announced the first of these capabilities in the form of a new product called Manhattan Active Maven. Part of our Manhattan Active Omni Platform, the Manhattan Active Maven is a gen AI-powered application which provides both best-in-class consumer-facing chatbots and the powerful set of capabilities to assist contact center agents. Generative AI technologies, provided they've been trained on the right underlying data, are particularly well-suited to automating customer service tasks, because of their ability to answer a very wide range of questions. And leveraging the underlying data is where the Manhattan Active Platform really shines. Because from day one, we've built the Manhattan Active Platform applications as API-first. Literally everything in our applications and everything our applications do is available via an API. And this approach gives Manhattan a major advantage when it comes to leveraging generative AI. Our API-first approach is one of the key reasons Manhattan Active Maven is proving to be so very powerful, going far beyond answering the basic questions of where's my order. Maven can answer detailed questions about payments, check inventory at local stores or even change delivery methods for orders that are already being processed. Manhattan Active Maven also provides power efficiency enhancing capabilities for call center agents as well. Manhattan Active Maven makes its debut this month. Like all Manhattan Active Platform applications, we'll get better and better and better each quarter thereafter. At Momentum, we also announced Manhattan Assist, a gen AI powered feature available across all Manhattan Active applications. Manhattan Assist's first set of capabilities focus on helping our customers get maximum value from their investments in our platform applications. Our users can now ask Assist detailed questions about the best way to achieve a particular business objective, how to configure a specific behavior and then be guided directly to the relevant configuration screens. And last, but certainly not least though, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the biggest announcement that we made a few months back at Momentum. Coming this fall, we'll be releasing Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning, the culmination of about a decade of investment to move our enterprise applications to an industry-leading cloud-native platform. The release of Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning will complete our work to fully transform our solution portfolio to being cloud-first. And just as importantly, we'll make the first, we'll be the first and only vendor to enable a unified cloud-nating offering, spanning both Supply Chain Planning and Supply Chain Execution. And consistent with the vision that we brought to market with Manhattan Active Omni and Manhattan Active Supply Chain Execution, Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning customers will benefit substantially from the power of unification. Now in this case, unification works at several levels. First, via composable set of APIs we use to unify demand forecasting, allocation and replenishment all into a single application. The vast majority of businesses you see distribute and sell both allocated and replenished products. And today, this dual inventory flow method really necessitates either using two disparate systems with the enterprise or planning one pool of items without systemic support for all of them. And now for the first time, customers are going to be able to use a single demand forecast to drive both allocated and replenished products. But it's actually the second and larger form of unification which is proving to be the most exciting and interesting to our customers so far. We call this next level of unification unified business planning because it enables our customers to drive their inventory, labor and transportation forecasts all from a single demand forecast in order projection. Now our supply chain practitioners are going to be able to see everything from a transportation forecast on a particular outbound transit lane six months out to a required picking associate forecast 26 hours out and everything in between. And this detailed operational forecast enables much more effective labor planning and ensuring that adequate label capacity to meet customer demand and orders is driven without expensive overtime. On the transportation front, the ability for our customers to collaborate with their strategic carriers using detailed transportation capacity forecasts ensure that they've got the exact capacity they need at the best of available rates, limiting how often they have to go out to the spot market. But beyond forecast visibility, Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning is going to enable dynamic collaboration between planning and execution, whether it's turning an inbound purchase order quantity to enable the more efficient transportation or dynamically changing the quantities of in-flight store replenishment orders based upon the very latest sales data. Manhattan Active Supply Chain Planning uses dynamic, always-on optimization to process and adjust the plan in real time based on sales and operating data. It's truly the first of a kind and we're very excited to debut this in the fall of this year. Now this concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide you with an update on our financial performance and outlook, and then I'll close off prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So, Dennis? Okay. Thanks, Dennis. Terrific. Well, we're certainly very pleased with our second quarter and our first half results. Of course, we continue to be appropriately cautious on the volatile macro conditions that are out there, and there's no doubt that we experience more, a little more choppiness this quarter than we usually do, but clearly our business fundamentals are very solid. We continue to be very optimistic about expanding our market opportunity and we enter the second half of 2024 from a -- certainly from a position of strength. So, we thank everybody for joining the call, and thank you to our global team for all the great work that they're doing for our customers out there in the field. So, that concludes our prepared remarks, and Alicia, we'd be happy to take any questions. Sure. Certainly, Terry. In terms of migrating our existing customers to the cloud, we're about 15% through the journey. Now, I've said that we think the journey is about a six-year or seven-year journey. Now, to be clear, I've been saying it's a six-year or seven-year journey for about a year and a half now. It does seem to sort of extend out a little bit. But I still think that horizon is about what we're looking at. Maybe there'll be a couple of stragglers at the end of it. But to specifically ask your question, within a couple of decimal places, we're about 15% through the migration. Yeah. It's pretty balanced, Terry, across geos and across products. I would say that given we focus mostly on finished goods, less on manufacturing and with a little bit of tension between the U.S. and China, our Chinese market is probably a little flatter, but it's a very small piece of our business to begin with. So honestly, the flatness there, you don't really see. It's not terribly consequential to the overall topline. Very good. Thank you, Terry. Yeah. It's a good question, Joe. I mean, it's certainly not anything that we're banking on to be perfectly honest with you. But it is a, I would say, sort of a growing trend. We've seen some customers being quite public about it, frankly. They're moving from on-prem to S4 HANA, moving to the CLAG with SAP. It's a like-for-like move for them. And they -- these -- the customers that we have, have concluded that they need to innovate in the supply chain area and fortunately have chosen us to be able to do that. They tend to be the larger global players, so the decision-making process is not super-fast or anything, but it's very strategic for us. And I think there's more of it to come. It's not going to be hundreds of customers or anything like that, that I don't think, but it will be a strategic advantage for us to be able to provide that immediate access to innovation in areas that they need it. No. I'd love to tell you it was something new, but we've got a lot of global customers, Joe. There was a nice spread this quarter, there's no question, both across vertical and across geo. But honestly, it wasn't typically or particularly unusual this quarter. Okay. Thank you, Joe. Oh! Wow! That's a great question. I'm excited about a lot of things, I really am. I mean, the -- certainly Supply Chain Planning that we announced at Momentum a couple of months ago, it launches right at the end of Q3. This quarter for us is very exciting. It's a journey, frankly, and something that the supply chain software industry has been chasing for decades now to bring together Supply Chain Planning and Supply Chain Execution on a truly unified platform, and we're the first ones to get there and so forth, and obviously, we're excited. We're excited about the opportunity and we're excited for the first mover opportunity. I would tell you that I continue to be very excited about our opportunity in point-of-sale and retail store systems. Before you ask, we didn't actually close any point-of-sale deals in Q2, but that does not douse my enthusiasm at all. The pipeline is in a pretty state for us. We continue to have very encouraging conversations, both with existing customers and new prospects in that area and making what we think is really good progress. We did have some nice new go-lives in the quarter with customers that we'd signed in prior quarters going live for the first time with point-of-sale in Q2. But listen, let us not lose that focus on Warehouse Management. It continues to be a very important part of our portfolio. We've got a terrific pipeline for WMS as well. So I'm pretty much going down the product portfolio telling them I'm excited about everything we're doing. But I suppose in the near-term, the true release of Supply Chain Planning in the fall would have to be top of the list at the moment. Thank you, Brian. Yeah. I mean, it's true in the retail stores, efficiency is important, obviously, revenue generation is the key factor in stores. But you quickly mentioned a quick point there, the retention of team members in stores, being able to have them or enable them with modern technology both from an efficiency and a retention perspective is super important. But also the labor component inside distribution centers, hard to find, hard to keep, the need to be flexible and so forth is very, very important. And the level of automation that our customers are putting into distribution centers is continuing to increase because of that lack of availability of labor and the need to improve efficiency. And we -- as you know, we thrive in environments that are complex in that nature, highly automated and the need for a great deal of velocity and throughput from those distribution centers. We think that the innovation that we've built over the last 10 years meets those market needs and is definitely a differentiator for us. Thank you, Dylan. Yeah. No particular comment -- no commonality, excuse me, there, George. They spanned geographies, they spanned industries, they spanned product offerings and proposals that we had out there, so I'd love to point at something and tell you it was funds being put towards gen AI or whatever, some thread, but it really wasn't. There wasn't anything specific there. I'm not going to go into a ton of details this early in the quarter. Yes, a couple of them have closed, so that's been helpful. The good news is across all of that is that win rates are at 75%, so they weren't losses. They were just sort of stutter steps for a variety of reasons across the Board. Yeah. We plan to continue to hire. Now, the good news is that our attrition rate is for this year is lower than we had forecasted, so that helps in all kinds of different ways, not least of which on efficiency, margin, customer satisfaction and so forth. But lower attrition does mean potentially a little bit less hiring, but we do definitely plan to expand that team in the second half of the year for sure and those hires will be largely in customer-facing and services roles. Certainly. Our pleasure, George. Thank you. Well, yes, probably not so much Kinaxis, because it's a little further down market and a little more manufacturing focused. But, yes, it certainly is. Obviously, we -- Mark, as you know, are not focused on the manufacturing side of planning, so it's certainly in the finished goods side of the world and so forth. But the answer to that is yes, but of course we're taking quite a different approach with this being not a batch-based solution as they traditionally have been for the last several decades. Number one, continuous planning and inventory optimization integrated and unified with Supply Chain Execution systems. So, definitely the holy grail of the things that we've been -- the world and market has been chasing for quite some time now. Thank you, Mark. Okay. Well, thank you, Alicia, and thank you everybody for joining the call. We're excited about where we are. We're excited about the results for the first half, even more excited about the second half of 2024 and beyond. So, thanks a ton for joining the call and we'll speak to you in about three months from now with Q3 update. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan Global teams continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong, balanced financial performance across topline growth, operating margin and cash flow. This includes posting record results across RPO, revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share. On an as-reported basis, our Q2 results came in at the Rule of 50 and if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceeded the Rule of 50. FX did not have a meaningful impact to RPO or revenue in the quarter. Also, in reviewing our financial performance, growth rates are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. So, for the quarter, total revenue was $265 million, up 15%, that's a double-digit. Excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue was up 19%. Cloud revenue totaled $82 million, up 35%. We ended the quarter with RPO of $1.6 billion, up 29% compared to the prior year and up 6% sequentially. This solid performance was driven by a healthy mix of sales from both new and existing customers, and transactions from across our Manhattan Active Suite of products. Growth was partially offset by some deals pushing into future periods at quarter end. On an FX-adjusted basis, our first half RPO results tracked towards the high end of our RPO guidance. And as Eddie highlighted, we are entering the second half of 2024 with a record pipeline and are confident in our ability to hit our bookings goals. Our global services teams delivered record revenue totaling $137 million, up 10%. This was in line with our expectations as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth for Manhattan. Adjusted operating profit was $93 million, up 36%, with adjusted operating margin of 35%. This is up 540 basis points year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our cloud business continues to scale. Importantly, as Eddie discussed, we are very optimistic on our business opportunity and continue to invest in innovation to drive sustainable long-term growth. Turning to earnings per share, we delivered Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $1.18, up 34%. And GAAP earnings per share of the $0.85, up 35%. Moving to cash, Q2 operating cash flow increased 81% to a solid $73 million. This resulted in 27% free cash flow margin and 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. The difference is due to $35 million in cash taxes paid in the quarter. Year-to-date, our operating cash flow is up 29% to $128 million. Regarding the balance sheet, total deferred revenue increased 14% to $260 million. We ended the quarter with $203 million in cash and zero debt. Accordingly, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $75 million in share repurchases in the quarter, resulting in $148 million in buybacks year-to-date. Also, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. So that covers the Q2 summary, which our associates delivered 13 double-digit returns on key metrics in the quarter. Now on to our updated 2024 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit topline growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SaaS comps. These are important drivers to our best-in-class return on invested capital as we maintain a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our solid first half performance, we are again raising our 2024 revenue and operating margin in earnings per share guidance, which can be found in today's earnings release. We are also reiterating our 2024 RPO target range and midpoint of $1.78 billion. As noted on the prior earnings calls, our objective is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly, on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or nonlinear bookings throughout the year. With that, for the full year 2024, we expect total revenue of $1.036 billion to $1.044 billion, with a $1.04 billion midpoint comparing favorably to our prior outlook and representing 17% growth, excluding license and maintenance, and 12% all-in. For Q3, we are targeting total revenue of $261 million to $265 million, accounting for retail peak seasonality. For Q4, we are targeting a midpoint of $257 million. For adjusted operating margin, we are increasing the midpoint to 32.1% from our prior midpoint of 29.8%, which includes 120-basis-point headwind from our license and maintenance revenue attrition to cloud. And as Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business. At the midpoint, we are targeting Q3 adjusted operating margin of 31.5% and accounting for retail peak seasonality of 30.5% in Q4. Our full year adjusted earnings per share is increasing by $0.36 to $4.26 up 9% from our prior midpoint of $3.90. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 earnings per share of $1.06 and accounting for retail peak seasonality of $1 in Q4. Similarly, for GAAP earnings per share, our midpoint increases by $0.30 to $3.12. For Q3, we are targeting GAAP earnings per share of $0.74. Here are some additional details on our 2024 outlook. We are increasing our cloud revenue midpoint to $334.5 million, representing 31% growth. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $85 million in Q3 and $89 million in Q4. Due to the timing of project go-lives and several deal pushes, we are tweaking our services forecast slightly lower by $4 million to $535 million to $539 million, with the $537 million midpoint representing 10% growth. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q3 services revenue of $136 million and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $130 million in Q4. For maintenance, our midpoint upticks to $134 million, which represents a 7% decline. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $34 million in Q3 and $30 million in Q4. For consolidated subscription, maintenance and services margin, we are targeting 140 basis points of margin improvement for the year. Finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% for Q3 and Q4, and our diluted share count to be 62.2 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. That covers the financial update. I'll turn it back to Eddie. It's about the same level, Terry. So it'll be in the neighborhood of $35 million to $38 million in the second half. That's right. Basically, we'll spread it across the second half. Just a positive mix between services and cloud and the gross margin. Yeah. Yeah. Early -- I mean early days, we'll give more commentary in the Q3 call on our outlook for next year, not trying to push you off there, but we feel real good around our margin profiles and very confident."

My name is Rob and I'll be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Manhattan Associates First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, April 23, 2024. I will now introduce your host, Mr. Michael Bauer, Head of Investor Relations of Manhattan Associates. Mr. Bauer, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Bauer: Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Manhattan Associates' 2024 first quarter earnings call. I will review our cautionary language and then turn the call over to Eddie Capel, our CEO. During this call, including the question-and-answer session, we may make forward-looking statements regarding the future events or the future financial performance of Manhattan Associates. You will caution that these forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from the projections contained in our forward-looking statements. I refer you to the report's Manhattan Associates files with the SEC for important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our projections, particularly our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023 and the risk factor discussion in that report as well as any risk factor updates we provide in our subsequent Form 10-Qs. We note the turbulent global macro environment could impact our performance and cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. We are under no obligation to update these statements.

You'll find reconciliation schedules in the form 8-K we submitted to the SEC earlier today and on our website at manh.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Terrific. Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter results and discuss our increased full-year 2024 outlook. Manhattan is off to a solid start in 2024, once again reporting record results. Q1 total revenue increased 15% to $255 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 29% to $1.03, both exceeding expectations. Driving top-line out performance and earnings leverage was 36% growth in cloud revenue and 14% growth in services revenue. Well global macro uncertainty and volatility certainly persists. Manhattan's business fundamentals are solid. Our teams continue to execute well for our customers, and our steady investment in research and development has firmly established Manhattan as the leading innovator in supply chain execution, omni-channel solutions, and retail point of sale. RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 31% to just over $1.5 billion. As demand for our mission critical cloud solutions remain strong and resilient across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing, and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. Across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter, cloud deals won include an omnichannel multi-brand retailer, a manufacturer and distributor of golf equipment, one of the world's largest airlines, a paint manufacturer, an apparel and accessories retailer, a tire distributor, as well as a number of others. For the quarter, competitive win rates were solid at about 75%. And we experienced strength from new customers with approximately one-third of our new bookings being generated from net new logos. That's in addition to healthy new logo activity, we continue to experience a good mix of conversions, upsells, and cross-sells. And while the timing of large deals and the mix of bookings is certainly going to vary on a quarterly basis, we believe our bookings breadth from both new and existing customers and also across our product portfolio exemplifies our multiple opportunities for sustainable growth. Now to this point, our solutions pipeline remains robust with new potential customers representing approximately 35% of the demand. An important driver to our growth is our ability to deliver industry-leading solutions to service our customers. At best of breed, cloud-native platform solutions provide unmatched access to innovation and are uniquely capable of unifying mission critical commerce and supply chain functions. This is differentiating for us and helps our clients improve customer service and loyalty, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. Now product sales activity also drives our services growth and pipeline. In Q1, our professional services team completed over 100 go lives and continues to execute very well for our customers. And while we remain appropriately cautious on the global economy, we continue to invest to drive growth. This includes strategic investments in industry leading innovation, further enablement of our customer success, and the expansion of our addressable market. From a hiring perspective, in Q1 we've welcomed over 100 highly talented individuals into the Manhattan family, and are on track to meet our 2024 hiring goal of a few 100s of associates. Now let's turn to some quick updates on our products. Last quarter, I focused on some key updates to our omni-channel commerce solutions. So for this quarter, I'll focus most of my time on updates to our supply chain execution products. One of Manhattan's guiding principles is a relentless focus on innovation. We've found the move to evergreen software to be a real game changer for both our teams and our customers. Our quarterly release process allows our customers to benefit from new features in record time. Each quarter we deliver a combination of smaller, more tactical features focused on customer enablement, as well as larger, more strategic features, which create an operational step change for our customers. Within Manhattan Active WM, we released several of these larger, more strategic features in region quarters. Now, you may recall that we announced yard management at last year's Momentum Conference, and we're seeing great reaction and adoption for this best-in-class YMS. Manhattan Active Yard Management helps out where it has operators enjoy the same level of process discipline and optimization in the yard as they've had within the four walls of the distribution center. Yard Management also serves to further reinforce process unification between warehouse management and transportation management, allowing for the seamless transition of a trailer moving from transportation management control to warehouse management control. A unified yard offering is an important step in helping our customers evolve toward managing an end-to-end flow of inventory, in band from their suppliers to the distribution center and out band from their distribution centers to their customers. But as I mentioned earlier, we released yard management just a little less than a year ago. So the question is, what have we done for our Manhattan Active WM customers lately? Well, in January, we released Dynamic Load Building for Manhattan Active WM, a feature that not only optimizes the way the cartons are palletized and optimized, but also the way that they're laid out in the trailer, considering temperature, axle load, vehicle stop sequence, and so on. Dynamic Load Building is a pretty critical process in industries like grocery, food service, industrial distribution, and a number of others. And many of our customers in those industries have historically used third-party tools or even manual processes, but now they're able to take advantage of load building right within Manhattan Active Supply Chain execution as part of a unified planning process. The release of new strategic capabilities like yard management, dynamic load building, along with in-app analytics and embedded generative AI is one of our most important market differentiators. Given that strong track record of delivery, prospective customers understand that a subscription to Manhattan Active WM, for example, delivers more than what they saw in the initial product demonstration in RFP response. They're also subscribing to a continuous innovation pipeline built on design thinking principles and conducted in collaboration with some of the most forward thinking supply chain practitioners. Customers rest assured that their investment in innovation will continue to deliver industry leading features, all seamlessly woven into the Manhattan Active WM environments and ready for them to activate. Now, further on the supply chain front, we continue to see great results from the activation of our Manhattan Active Transportation Management application, which recently was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for TMS, six consecutive year, by the way. And as a reminder, this solution is now live on four continents, serving industry-spanning grocery, food service, convenience stores, consumer products, apparel retail, and a number of others. And frankly, our supply chain unification message continues to resonate very well in the market. And to that end, one of our key deals from last year was with Schneider Electric, a multinational, multibillion dollar corporation that specializes in digital automation and energy management. And we're currently working with Schneider to deploy a unified supply chain execution offering all the way across the globe. We're starting with a distribution center in the Netherlands, and Schneider shares their vision for unified inbound and outbound supply chain processes. In fact, they'll be sharing their vision in more detail at our customer conference Momentum next month. And finally, speaking of Momentum, we're planning a couple of major product announcements for an event in San Antonio, Texas. And we're looking forward to unveiling those major steps forward to both our Manhattan Associates and our Manhattan customers. And I'll look forward to telling you more about them in next quarter's update. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide an update on that financial performance and outlook, and then I'll close that prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So Dennis?\nDennis Story: Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan Global teams continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong, balanced financial performance across top and bottom lines. This includes posting record results across RPO, revenue, and adjusted operating income. On an as-reported basis, our Q1 results compare favorably to the rule of 40. And if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceed the rule of 50. FX had a minor impact in the quarter with a 1% headwind, while it was neutral to year-over-year revenue and RPO growth. Now turning to our Q1 results, our growth rates are reported on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. For the quarter, total revenue was $255 million, up 15% excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue is up 20%. Cloud revenue totaled $78 million, up 36%. And as Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $1.5 billion, up 31%, compared to the prior year, and up 6% sequentially. Removing the impacts of FX, the Q1 sequential increase of $97 million in RPO exceeded the sequential increase we achieved in Q4. The strong Q1 performance was driven by a healthy mix of sales from both new and existing customers with solid results from across our Manhattan Active suite of products. And our global services teams delivered record revenue totaling $132 million, up 14% as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Adjusted operating profit was $80 million with adjusted operating margin of 31.3%. This is 250 basis points year-over-year -- up year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our cloud business continues to scale. Importantly, as Eddie discussed, we continue to invest in innovation to drive sustainable long-term growth. Turning to EPS, we delivered Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $1.03, up 29%, and GAAP EPS of $0.86, up 39%. And moving to cash, operating cash flow was a solid $55 million. This is down slightly from the prior year period due to a record 2023 cash bonus payout and timing of cash collections. This resulted in 21% free cash flow margin and 32% adjusted EBITDA margin. Regarding the balance sheet, deferred revenue increased 21% to $265 million. We ended the quarter with $208 million in cash and zero debt. In the quarter, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $73 million in share repurchases. Additionally, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. That covers the summary results. Now on to our updated 2024 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SAS comps. These are important drivers to our best-in-class return on invested capital as we maintain a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our solid start to the year and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2024 revenue operating margin and earnings per share guidance, which can be found in today's earnings release. We are also reiterating our 2024 RPO target range and midpoint of $1.78 billion. As noted on prior earnings calls, our objective is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. With that, for the full-year 2024, we expect total revenue of $1.026 billion to $1.034 billion, with a $1.03 billion midpoint comparing favorably to our prior outlook and representing 17% growth, excluding license and maintenance and 11% all in. For Q2, we are targeting total revenue of $254 million to $258 million, which at the midpoint represents 17% growth, excluding license and maintenance attrition and 11% growth all in. For the rest of the year, at the midpoint, we are targeting total revenue of about $263 million in Q3 and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $256 million in Q4. For adjusted operating margin, we are increasing the midpoint to 29.75% from our prior midpoint of 29%, which includes a 170 basis point headwind from our license and maintenance revenue attrition to cloud. And as Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business. At the midpoint, adjusted operating margin on a quarterly basis is expected to be about 29.5% for both Q2 and Q3, and accounting for retail peak seasonality 28.5% in Q4. This results in our full-year adjusted earnings per share range to increase to $3.86 to $3.94. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 earnings per share of $0.96, Q3 $0.99, and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $0.93 and Q4. For GAP, earnings per share are midpoint ticks down $0.04 to $2.82 on higher investment and equity-based compensation. For Q2, we are targeting GAAP earnings per share of $0.66. Here's some additional details on our 2024 outlook. We are increasing our cloud revenue midpoint to $332.5 million, representing 31% growth. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $80.5 million in Q2, $85 million in Q3, and $89 million in Q4. For services, we are increasing our forecast to $538 million to $544 million, with $541 million midpoint representing 11% growth. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 services revenue of $137 million, Q3 $140 million, and accounting for Q4 retail peak seasonality $132 million. For maintenance, we are targeting a midpoint of $124.5 million, which represents a 14% decline. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 at $31 million, Q3 $30 million, and Q4 $28.5 million. For consolidated subscription, maintenance, and services margin, we continue to target about 100 basis points of margin improvement for the year. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% for the balance of the year. Our diluted share count to be 62.5 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So in summary, a solid Q1 performance by the Manhattan Global Team. Thank you and back to Eddie for some closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Yes, terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well, look, we're very pleased with that solid start to the year and that record Q1 results. We continue to be appropriately cautious, I think, on the volatile conditions that are out there. But that business momentum remains very favorable, and we remain certainly optimistic about the business opportunities that is in front of us. So thanks, thanks everyone for joining the call, and thank you to our Global Team for all the exceptional work that you do for our customers. So that concludes our prepared remarks, and Rob, we'd be happy to take any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, and our first question is from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nTerry Tillman: Yes, thanks for taking my question. And good afternoon here, Eddie, Dennis, and Mike. First and foremost, great disclosure there on the FX impact to RPO, that's really helpful. So I guess the constant currency adjusted numbers $97 million, so thanks for the disclosure. Just the first question maybe for you, Eddie, is on the -- just an update on stats on Cloud WMS. I got knocked off the call, so I may have missed it. I don't know if you said anything, but I think last quarter when asked about it, you gave something in terms of maybe sites that are up and running, but just anything you can share, whether it's sites, whether it's conversations with some of the folks that hesitated to move going forward. Just would love some statistics that you can share on just where you are on Cloud WMS adoption? And then I had a couple of follow-up.\nEddie Capel: Yes, sure, sure, sure. Terry, I think if we just a little bit of license, we're going live quite frequently with sites these days. So the live site count is right at about 225. Actually, I think it's a little bit more than that, but close enough for this conversation 225. And there's certainly no reticence in terms of moving to the cloud, either for new customers, of course they're moving directly to the cloud with us, or our existing customers that are converting and migrating over time. Some are moving pretty aggressively, frankly. We've got customers that are going more than one site a month on a global basis going live. These are large, automated, be it a million square foot facilities and so forth. So yes, just strong momentum there. We're working hard to keep up with the demand.\nTerry Tillman: That's great, and maybe just a follow-up, and then I had a question for Dennis on the free cashflow. But just, Eddie, in terms of version of software and your customers starting to experience this and kind of the zero downtime, is it starting to kind of accelerate the conversations? Because you all have this vision for your customers of Unified Commerce, but is it starting to kind of accelerate the conversations on well, okay now we have the WMS it really does make sense to do the TMS or OMS. I'm just curious where you are on that's starting to manifest in cross selling and upselling?\nEddie Capel: Yes, you know, I mean it definitely is. You know, we say over and over and over again, these are enterprise class systems. You know, you don't see immediate hockey sticks and so forth, but we definitely see it. In fact, I mentioned Schneider Electric in my prepared remarks. They've actually bought both WMS and TMS simultaneously. You've got a very large global rollout of unified supply chain execution for you know for those guys they'll be talking about a, you know, momentum. And you know there's no question that we're starting to see that unified message pick up momentum, I don't think there is a conversation that we have with either a customer or you know a new logo prospect about TMS that doesn't include WMS and about WMS that doesn't include TMS. Again, they may not all be like Schneider Electric buying both together, but the conversations are certainly conjoined.\nTerry Tillman: Thanks for that Eddie. And Dennis, I guess on cash flow, you called out the largest, you know, kind of cash bonuses in the seasonality and impacting cash flow. But, you know, is 2Q something that sequentially, anything you can share about how to think about it or just maybe even full-year on how you're thinking about maybe a free cash flow margin? Thank you.\nDennis Story: Yes, so Q2 will snap back from Q1 definitely 25%to 26% free cash flow margin on a full-year basis. We may tick up from that. There's a little bit of conservatism there.\nTerry Tillman: Wonderful. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Peterson with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. So Eddie, you mentioned some examples of global supply chain investments for customers with Manhattan. You know, I'm curious for somebody that has a truly global project that's hitting multiple DCs, how long does that product or project take? Is that something that can be done in a few years or is the timeline usually longer than that?\nEddie Capel: Yes, well that's a great question and there's no perfect answer, Brian, frankly. It really depends on the size and the magnitude of course. Look, if I were to pick how long does it take to roll out a unified supply chain execution program, both WMS and TMS, let's assume 30, 40, or 50 distribution centers, something like that. That's probably a three-year program, I would say. You know, could be a little longer, probably not going to be shorter.\nBrian Peterson: Got it, okay, that helps a lot, actually. So, it just made me follow-up, I know this is more on the supply chain execution side. But point of sale, some really strong stats to share last quarter. Curious what the feedback has been from customers and prospects to start in 2024. Thanks, guys.\nEddie Capel: Yes, yes. Continues to go well from an execution perspective in the field. I think we brought a couple of new customers live this quarter. We did secure one nice deal, one nice new logo deal in the quarter. Very pleased about that. I think we've reported this same scenario before. This is a brand new customer. We've never done business with them before. And the only product that they bought from us was point of sale. So it stood alone on its own merit. I forget exactly, but I think it's right around a 225 store chain. So we're looking forward to getting that project rolling as well. So continuing to see strong momentum in the field both from an execution, a go live, and a nice little bit of sales motion there as well.\nBrian Peterson: Great to hear. Thanks, Eddie.\nEddie Capel: Yes. Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. One up front, just on the composition of RPO bookings across WMS, OMS, TMS, have your expectations changed at all in terms of the relative share of what's flowing into your backlog just given how the era started?\nEddie Capel: No, I would say, you know, advances by quarter. You know, we talk about that all the time, Joe. But in terms of the makeup, I think we expect it to be pretty consistent. The way I think about it is on an annual basis, it'll branch around quarter-by-quarter.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, great. And then active WM, that debuted in the spring of 2020. You saw a pretty nice step up in RPO bookings really towards the end of that year and then certainly 2021. So the early adopters at this point, they're in year three, year four some are maybe coming up on renewal conversations, but certainly many are far enough along and live where you probably engage with the new cloud installed base just on cross-selling? How has that experience, both experience at renewal and then maybe net retention experience over the course of that initial five years so engagement. How has that fared so far and does it change at all kind of the evolution of your model as more of the model is just going to reflect cloud financials and how the renewal base is evolving over time?\nEddie Capel: Let's see, quite a bit packed in there. But we haven't seen, obviously, material renewals just yet. Because to your point, we haven't even quite met the four-year mark for launch. So next year and the year after is when we'll start to see more of the renewals, that renewals. Net retention rate is very, very strong. Cross-sells, we're pleased with. I know I'm a bit of a broken record here, but again, banks are around a little bit quarter-by-quarter. You know, this quarter I think the cross-sells were in the 20%, maybe just a tick above 20%, that seems to bounce around, frankly, between anything from 15 to 35 on a quarterly basis, but usually settles in annually to be around about 25% cross-sell, upsell.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nEddie Capel: Okay, thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Schappel with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your questions.\nMark Schappel: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Eddie, could you just provide a little bit of an update on the Shopify partnership that was announced recently, specifically with respect to the product integration efforts?\nEddie Capel: Yes, sure. Sure, I'd be happy to, Mark. So we announced that at NRF in earnest and seen a lot of interest around the Shopify partnership. I'll try to make it short. The gist of it is that Shopify sees an opportunity for them to come up into the enterprise with their web store and e-commerce storefront. We obviously are a great partner for them because they would love to be able to integrate directly into our enterprise class order management system and get after our enterprise order management system customers. So that's, sort of, great news for them. We think there's going to be, over time, a wave of e-commerce platform replacements, given some of the older systems have, kind of, fallen off of the wayside and so forth. Obviously, Shopify do as well. And we'd like to attach to that replacement cycle as it happens over the next few years, hence the benefit of the partnership for Manhattan Associates. You know, we've busily been building standard integration and out of the box integration with Shopify and our R&D teams on both sides have been working very closely together and seems to be -- it is seems to be an -- it is a very productive relationship and partnership. And looking forward to seeing what comes of that in the future. It will feature as one of the things that we talk about in a little more detail, momentum with our existing customers as well. And I think it'll be interesting for them.\nMark Schappel: Great, thanks. And then growth in the Asia-Pac region seemed a little bit softer this quarter than maybe in the past. I was wondering if we should read anything into this, or is this just quarterly variability in the numbers?\nEddie Capel: No, it was actually pretty strong this quarter. Now, as you know, APAC for us is in the 6% to 10% of our revenue, so it can be a little bit on the smaller side from an actual numbers perspective. But we had a good quarter, frankly, good margins, and the pipeline looks pretty good in APAC as well, maybe with the exception of China where things are not quite as strong for us.\nMark Schappel: Great, thank you. That's all.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of George Kurosawa with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nGeorge Kurosawa: Thanks for taking the questions. Happy to be on the call. Maybe just high level on the demand backdrop. You guys described kind of a volatile environment that you're executing through. Maybe you could just double click on kind of what you're seeing there relative to what you saw last quarter and if there's kind of any particular vertical that you described as maybe seeing a little more impact? Thank you.\nEddie Capel: I would say no, George. And look, the macro -- the volatility that I'm referring to is the exact same volatility that every single company on the planet is observing. Look, I'm going to repeat myself from, I think, last quarter, 12-months ago, there was a healthy amount of macro volatility and so forth around the world. And it seems to us that none of those have come off the table, but more issues have been added to the mix, just hence the reference to the volatility and so forth. But it hasn't had a particular impact on any vertical. For us, as I pointed out in some of the wins for the quarter, we've got pretty good diversity across airlines and paint suppliers and golf equipment, retailers, and so forth. So we feel pretty good about the diversity and how we can smooth out some of that volatility. But I think it would be inappropriate for us not to mention you know all of the you know the backdrop of the things that are going on around the world.\nGeorge Kurosawa: Got it that makes sense. And then just on the updated guidance obviously flow through, you know, mostly upside for quarter, but you know thinking about the back half the year maybe a very slight tweak down maybe just any puts and takes and how you're thinking about the rest of the year?\nEddie Capel: Not a big change. I mean, Dennis obviously highlighted the FX challenges. We've already seen in Q1 since we did our budgets and put the plans out. That was just a little bit disappointing, frankly. It's not a material change. We made it clear that we're only going to provide our annual RPO guidance. Now, we did say for the year that our growth would be at about $360 million in RPO growth, $90 million a quarter. In constant currency, we did $97 million in RPO growth for the quarter, so kind of a little bit ahead, again, constant currency-wise. But no material change in, and I look forward for the year at the moment.\nDennis Story: George, we like to under-promise and over-deliver, so there's not a material adjustment in the back half of the year.\nGeorge Kurosawa: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for taking the questions.\nEddie Capel: Sure thing, George.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Dylan Becker with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.\nDylan Becker: Hey, gentlemen. Great to connect to you. Appreciate you taking the questions. Maybe, Eddie, starting with you, we've talked a lot about, kind of, the continued investment and innovation and what that can create from a cross-selling perspective, given kind of this cloud migration, can unlock some of this. I wonder how you were thinking about the like blueprint phase and the importance of that dynamic of services in not only getting the customers live, but maybe giving like a bit of a peek under the hood and maybe a strategic source of helping inform some of those R&D or kind of platform investment initiatives as you work through some of this transition as well?\nEddie Capel: Yes, there's no question. I mean, one of the sort of secret weapons of our company is that services business, from the perspective of being shoulder-to-shoulder with our customers, you know, understanding what market trends look like, understanding what their specific needs look like, and informing, you know, our product roadmap as we, you know, as we go forward. Now, on a more near-term basis, also no doubt is where, blueprinting and designing, maybe it's a WMS or TMS, an auto management system, as it's being deployed, it's quite helpful to have the full portfolio available to us. So we can guide and maybe help our customers understand the benefits of a fully unified product portfolio.\nDylan Becker: Got it. Okay, that makes a ton of sense. And maybe kind of sticking with that theme from a kind of an adjacency perspective, as you migrate more of these customers and consolidate kind of more of these systems around that idea of unified commerce. How should we think about the opportunity for data monetization or embedded analytics use cases and things of the like? I know there's, kind of, some embedded benchmarking today, but maybe connecting data and workflows, what unlocking automation can mean for monetization given these systems that have historically been so disparate? It seems like it's kind of an incremental unlock opportunity?\nEddie Capel: Yes, for sure. I mean, obviously we've got a lot of analytical power in our system. We've got a lot of very valuable data and we've got a lot of analytical power and tools that we provide to our customers as you point out embedded in our solutions. And cross-sell and up-sell for us is certainly the name of the game. We're pretty clear about that. You know, when we sell solutions to our customers, we're very open with them. Hey, we would like the opportunity as the need comes up to help you with all of your supply chain needs, kind of end-to-end. And the unified platform that we have certainly helps enable that. We believe the bridges to get from one of our solutions to another is much shorter given the technology underpinnings that we have, the zero data replication in terms of transactional data replication that's required. It makes it smooth, it makes it seamless, faster, and of course, a lower total cost of ownership.\nDylan Becker: Great, thank you for that. Appreciate it.\nEddie Capel: Sure thing, Dylan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will be coming from the line of Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks, and thanks for taking my question. Just following on the last line of thought there, Eddie, on the migration to the cloud as you get the whole more and more of your customers' data flows, workflows and data flows related to those in the cloud? Are there other opportunities there for you to partner with other outside parties to help the customer leverage their data more?\nEddie Capel: Sure, yes, always. Obviously, our I\u2019d say our principle data partner and technology partner is Google, who I think everybody knows is pretty powerful when it comes to a combination of analytics, data leverage, generative AI, business analytics, of course, BigQuery, and so on and so forth. And they've done some really clever work in enabling their customers and our joint customers to be able to monetize the data that's inside of that system. And we get the benefit from that as well, as we put together at cross-sell and upsell opportunities and roadmaps with our customers and prospects.\nBlair Abernethy: Great, thank you. And just Dennis, one quick one for you. I missed the early part of the call, but I'm not sure if you talked about the hiring environment at all, sort of, how your retention rates are going and your hiring plans for 2024?\nDennis Story: Yes, I did mention it. We welcomed about 100, almost exactly 100 new associates to the family in Q1 and on track with our hiring plans for 2024. Attrition is fortunately running at a very low rate for us, so we're able to keep hold of our great talent and they continue to gain more and more experience, which is really helpful for us, for our customers, and everybody concerned. But hiring plans on track for several 100 hires this year.\nBlair Abernethy: Great. Perfect. Thanks very much.\nEddie Capel: My pleasure, Blair. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we've come to the end of our question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nEddie Capel: Okay. Very good. Well, thank you, Rob, and thanks everybody for joining us. We really appreciate your time. As you mentioned, we're excited about the start to the year and looking forward to more of the same and reporting out to you the results in about 90-days or so. So thanks again.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may have disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eddie Capel",
            "content": "Terrific. Thanks, Mike. Well, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us as we review our first quarter results and discuss our increased full-year 2024 outlook. Manhattan is off to a solid start in 2024, once again reporting record results. Q1 total revenue increased 15% to $255 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 29% to $1.03, both exceeding expectations. Driving top-line out performance and earnings leverage was 36% growth in cloud revenue and 14% growth in services revenue. Well global macro uncertainty and volatility certainly persists. Manhattan's business fundamentals are solid. Our teams continue to execute well for our customers, and our steady investment in research and development has firmly established Manhattan as the leading innovator in supply chain execution, omni-channel solutions, and retail point of sale. RPO, the leading indicator of our growth, increased 31% to just over $1.5 billion. As demand for our mission critical cloud solutions remain strong and resilient across our product portfolio. From a vertical perspective, retail, manufacturing, and wholesale drove more than 80% of our bookings in the quarter. Across our solutions, the sub-verticals are pretty diverse. For example, in the quarter, cloud deals won include an omnichannel multi-brand retailer, a manufacturer and distributor of golf equipment, one of the world's largest airlines, a paint manufacturer, an apparel and accessories retailer, a tire distributor, as well as a number of others. For the quarter, competitive win rates were solid at about 75%. And we experienced strength from new customers with approximately one-third of our new bookings being generated from net new logos. That's in addition to healthy new logo activity, we continue to experience a good mix of conversions, upsells, and cross-sells. And while the timing of large deals and the mix of bookings is certainly going to vary on a quarterly basis, we believe our bookings breadth from both new and existing customers and also across our product portfolio exemplifies our multiple opportunities for sustainable growth. Now to this point, our solutions pipeline remains robust with new potential customers representing approximately 35% of the demand. An important driver to our growth is our ability to deliver industry-leading solutions to service our customers. At best of breed, cloud-native platform solutions provide unmatched access to innovation and are uniquely capable of unifying mission critical commerce and supply chain functions. This is differentiating for us and helps our clients improve customer service and loyalty, drive more revenue and improve efficiency. Now product sales activity also drives our services growth and pipeline. In Q1, our professional services team completed over 100 go lives and continues to execute very well for our customers. And while we remain appropriately cautious on the global economy, we continue to invest to drive growth. This includes strategic investments in industry leading innovation, further enablement of our customer success, and the expansion of our addressable market. From a hiring perspective, in Q1 we've welcomed over 100 highly talented individuals into the Manhattan family, and are on track to meet our 2024 hiring goal of a few 100s of associates. Now let's turn to some quick updates on our products. Last quarter, I focused on some key updates to our omni-channel commerce solutions. So for this quarter, I'll focus most of my time on updates to our supply chain execution products. One of Manhattan's guiding principles is a relentless focus on innovation. We've found the move to evergreen software to be a real game changer for both our teams and our customers. Our quarterly release process allows our customers to benefit from new features in record time. Each quarter we deliver a combination of smaller, more tactical features focused on customer enablement, as well as larger, more strategic features, which create an operational step change for our customers. Within Manhattan Active WM, we released several of these larger, more strategic features in region quarters. Now, you may recall that we announced yard management at last year's Momentum Conference, and we're seeing great reaction and adoption for this best-in-class YMS. Manhattan Active Yard Management helps out where it has operators enjoy the same level of process discipline and optimization in the yard as they've had within the four walls of the distribution center. Yard Management also serves to further reinforce process unification between warehouse management and transportation management, allowing for the seamless transition of a trailer moving from transportation management control to warehouse management control. A unified yard offering is an important step in helping our customers evolve toward managing an end-to-end flow of inventory, in band from their suppliers to the distribution center and out band from their distribution centers to their customers. But as I mentioned earlier, we released yard management just a little less than a year ago. So the question is, what have we done for our Manhattan Active WM customers lately? Well, in January, we released Dynamic Load Building for Manhattan Active WM, a feature that not only optimizes the way the cartons are palletized and optimized, but also the way that they're laid out in the trailer, considering temperature, axle load, vehicle stop sequence, and so on. Dynamic Load Building is a pretty critical process in industries like grocery, food service, industrial distribution, and a number of others. And many of our customers in those industries have historically used third-party tools or even manual processes, but now they're able to take advantage of load building right within Manhattan Active Supply Chain execution as part of a unified planning process. The release of new strategic capabilities like yard management, dynamic load building, along with in-app analytics and embedded generative AI is one of our most important market differentiators. Given that strong track record of delivery, prospective customers understand that a subscription to Manhattan Active WM, for example, delivers more than what they saw in the initial product demonstration in RFP response. They're also subscribing to a continuous innovation pipeline built on design thinking principles and conducted in collaboration with some of the most forward thinking supply chain practitioners. Customers rest assured that their investment in innovation will continue to deliver industry leading features, all seamlessly woven into the Manhattan Active WM environments and ready for them to activate. Now, further on the supply chain front, we continue to see great results from the activation of our Manhattan Active Transportation Management application, which recently was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for TMS, six consecutive year, by the way. And as a reminder, this solution is now live on four continents, serving industry-spanning grocery, food service, convenience stores, consumer products, apparel retail, and a number of others. And frankly, our supply chain unification message continues to resonate very well in the market. And to that end, one of our key deals from last year was with Schneider Electric, a multinational, multibillion dollar corporation that specializes in digital automation and energy management. And we're currently working with Schneider to deploy a unified supply chain execution offering all the way across the globe. We're starting with a distribution center in the Netherlands, and Schneider shares their vision for unified inbound and outbound supply chain processes. In fact, they'll be sharing their vision in more detail at our customer conference Momentum next month. And finally, speaking of Momentum, we're planning a couple of major product announcements for an event in San Antonio, Texas. And we're looking forward to unveiling those major steps forward to both our Manhattan Associates and our Manhattan customers. And I'll look forward to telling you more about them in next quarter's update. So that concludes my business update. Dennis is going to provide an update on that financial performance and outlook, and then I'll close that prepared remarks with a brief summary before we move to Q&A. So Dennis? Yes, terrific. Thanks, Dennis. Well, look, we're very pleased with that solid start to the year and that record Q1 results. We continue to be appropriately cautious, I think, on the volatile conditions that are out there. But that business momentum remains very favorable, and we remain certainly optimistic about the business opportunities that is in front of us. So thanks, thanks everyone for joining the call, and thank you to our Global Team for all the exceptional work that you do for our customers. So that concludes our prepared remarks, and Rob, we'd be happy to take any questions. Yes, sure, sure, sure. Terry, I think if we just a little bit of license, we're going live quite frequently with sites these days. So the live site count is right at about 225. Actually, I think it's a little bit more than that, but close enough for this conversation 225. And there's certainly no reticence in terms of moving to the cloud, either for new customers, of course they're moving directly to the cloud with us, or our existing customers that are converting and migrating over time. Some are moving pretty aggressively, frankly. We've got customers that are going more than one site a month on a global basis going live. These are large, automated, be it a million square foot facilities and so forth. So yes, just strong momentum there. We're working hard to keep up with the demand. Yes, you know, I mean it definitely is. You know, we say over and over and over again, these are enterprise class systems. You know, you don't see immediate hockey sticks and so forth, but we definitely see it. In fact, I mentioned Schneider Electric in my prepared remarks. They've actually bought both WMS and TMS simultaneously. You've got a very large global rollout of unified supply chain execution for you know for those guys they'll be talking about a, you know, momentum. And you know there's no question that we're starting to see that unified message pick up momentum, I don't think there is a conversation that we have with either a customer or you know a new logo prospect about TMS that doesn't include WMS and about WMS that doesn't include TMS. Again, they may not all be like Schneider Electric buying both together, but the conversations are certainly conjoined. Thank you, Terry. Yes, well that's a great question and there's no perfect answer, Brian, frankly. It really depends on the size and the magnitude of course. Look, if I were to pick how long does it take to roll out a unified supply chain execution program, both WMS and TMS, let's assume 30, 40, or 50 distribution centers, something like that. That's probably a three-year program, I would say. You know, could be a little longer, probably not going to be shorter. Yes, yes. Continues to go well from an execution perspective in the field. I think we brought a couple of new customers live this quarter. We did secure one nice deal, one nice new logo deal in the quarter. Very pleased about that. I think we've reported this same scenario before. This is a brand new customer. We've never done business with them before. And the only product that they bought from us was point of sale. So it stood alone on its own merit. I forget exactly, but I think it's right around a 225 store chain. So we're looking forward to getting that project rolling as well. So continuing to see strong momentum in the field both from an execution, a go live, and a nice little bit of sales motion there as well. Yes. Thank you, Brian. No, I would say, you know, advances by quarter. You know, we talk about that all the time, Joe. But in terms of the makeup, I think we expect it to be pretty consistent. The way I think about it is on an annual basis, it'll branch around quarter-by-quarter. Let's see, quite a bit packed in there. But we haven't seen, obviously, material renewals just yet. Because to your point, we haven't even quite met the four-year mark for launch. So next year and the year after is when we'll start to see more of the renewals, that renewals. Net retention rate is very, very strong. Cross-sells, we're pleased with. I know I'm a bit of a broken record here, but again, banks are around a little bit quarter-by-quarter. You know, this quarter I think the cross-sells were in the 20%, maybe just a tick above 20%, that seems to bounce around, frankly, between anything from 15 to 35 on a quarterly basis, but usually settles in annually to be around about 25% cross-sell, upsell. Okay, thank you, Joe. Yes, sure. Sure, I'd be happy to, Mark. So we announced that at NRF in earnest and seen a lot of interest around the Shopify partnership. I'll try to make it short. The gist of it is that Shopify sees an opportunity for them to come up into the enterprise with their web store and e-commerce storefront. We obviously are a great partner for them because they would love to be able to integrate directly into our enterprise class order management system and get after our enterprise order management system customers. So that's, sort of, great news for them. We think there's going to be, over time, a wave of e-commerce platform replacements, given some of the older systems have, kind of, fallen off of the wayside and so forth. Obviously, Shopify do as well. And we'd like to attach to that replacement cycle as it happens over the next few years, hence the benefit of the partnership for Manhattan Associates. You know, we've busily been building standard integration and out of the box integration with Shopify and our R&D teams on both sides have been working very closely together and seems to be -- it is seems to be an -- it is a very productive relationship and partnership. And looking forward to seeing what comes of that in the future. It will feature as one of the things that we talk about in a little more detail, momentum with our existing customers as well. And I think it'll be interesting for them. No, it was actually pretty strong this quarter. Now, as you know, APAC for us is in the 6% to 10% of our revenue, so it can be a little bit on the smaller side from an actual numbers perspective. But we had a good quarter, frankly, good margins, and the pipeline looks pretty good in APAC as well, maybe with the exception of China where things are not quite as strong for us. Okay. Thank you, Mark. I would say no, George. And look, the macro -- the volatility that I'm referring to is the exact same volatility that every single company on the planet is observing. Look, I'm going to repeat myself from, I think, last quarter, 12-months ago, there was a healthy amount of macro volatility and so forth around the world. And it seems to us that none of those have come off the table, but more issues have been added to the mix, just hence the reference to the volatility and so forth. But it hasn't had a particular impact on any vertical. For us, as I pointed out in some of the wins for the quarter, we've got pretty good diversity across airlines and paint suppliers and golf equipment, retailers, and so forth. So we feel pretty good about the diversity and how we can smooth out some of that volatility. But I think it would be inappropriate for us not to mention you know all of the you know the backdrop of the things that are going on around the world. Not a big change. I mean, Dennis obviously highlighted the FX challenges. We've already seen in Q1 since we did our budgets and put the plans out. That was just a little bit disappointing, frankly. It's not a material change. We made it clear that we're only going to provide our annual RPO guidance. Now, we did say for the year that our growth would be at about $360 million in RPO growth, $90 million a quarter. In constant currency, we did $97 million in RPO growth for the quarter, so kind of a little bit ahead, again, constant currency-wise. But no material change in, and I look forward for the year at the moment. Sure thing, George. Yes, there's no question. I mean, one of the sort of secret weapons of our company is that services business, from the perspective of being shoulder-to-shoulder with our customers, you know, understanding what market trends look like, understanding what their specific needs look like, and informing, you know, our product roadmap as we, you know, as we go forward. Now, on a more near-term basis, also no doubt is where, blueprinting and designing, maybe it's a WMS or TMS, an auto management system, as it's being deployed, it's quite helpful to have the full portfolio available to us. So we can guide and maybe help our customers understand the benefits of a fully unified product portfolio. Yes, for sure. I mean, obviously we've got a lot of analytical power in our system. We've got a lot of very valuable data and we've got a lot of analytical power and tools that we provide to our customers as you point out embedded in our solutions. And cross-sell and up-sell for us is certainly the name of the game. We're pretty clear about that. You know, when we sell solutions to our customers, we're very open with them. Hey, we would like the opportunity as the need comes up to help you with all of your supply chain needs, kind of end-to-end. And the unified platform that we have certainly helps enable that. We believe the bridges to get from one of our solutions to another is much shorter given the technology underpinnings that we have, the zero data replication in terms of transactional data replication that's required. It makes it smooth, it makes it seamless, faster, and of course, a lower total cost of ownership. Sure thing, Dylan. Sure, yes, always. Obviously, our I'd say our principle data partner and technology partner is Google, who I think everybody knows is pretty powerful when it comes to a combination of analytics, data leverage, generative AI, business analytics, of course, BigQuery, and so on and so forth. And they've done some really clever work in enabling their customers and our joint customers to be able to monetize the data that's inside of that system. And we get the benefit from that as well, as we put together at cross-sell and upsell opportunities and roadmaps with our customers and prospects. My pleasure, Blair. Thank you. Okay. Very good. Well, thank you, Rob, and thanks everybody for joining us. We really appreciate your time. As you mentioned, we're excited about the start to the year and looking forward to more of the same and reporting out to you the results in about 90-days or so. So thanks again."

            "name": "Dennis Story",
            "content": "Thanks, Eddie. Our Manhattan Global teams continue to execute well in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered a strong, balanced financial performance across top and bottom lines. This includes posting record results across RPO, revenue, and adjusted operating income. On an as-reported basis, our Q1 results compare favorably to the rule of 40. And if our revenue growth is normalized for our cloud transition, which excludes license and maintenance revenue, our results exceed the rule of 50. FX had a minor impact in the quarter with a 1% headwind, while it was neutral to year-over-year revenue and RPO growth. Now turning to our Q1 results, our growth rates are reported on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated. For the quarter, total revenue was $255 million, up 15% excluding license and maintenance revenue, which removes the compression driven by our cloud transition, our total revenue is up 20%. Cloud revenue totaled $78 million, up 36%. And as Eddie highlighted, we ended the quarter with RPO of $1.5 billion, up 31%, compared to the prior year, and up 6% sequentially. Removing the impacts of FX, the Q1 sequential increase of $97 million in RPO exceeded the sequential increase we achieved in Q4. The strong Q1 performance was driven by a healthy mix of sales from both new and existing customers with solid results from across our Manhattan Active suite of products. And our global services teams delivered record revenue totaling $132 million, up 14% as cloud sales continue to fuel services revenue growth globally. Adjusted operating profit was $80 million with adjusted operating margin of 31.3%. This is 250 basis points year-over-year -- up year-over-year. Our performance was driven by strong cloud and services revenue growth combined with operating leverage as our cloud business continues to scale. Importantly, as Eddie discussed, we continue to invest in innovation to drive sustainable long-term growth. Turning to EPS, we delivered Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $1.03, up 29%, and GAAP EPS of $0.86, up 39%. And moving to cash, operating cash flow was a solid $55 million. This is down slightly from the prior year period due to a record 2023 cash bonus payout and timing of cash collections. This resulted in 21% free cash flow margin and 32% adjusted EBITDA margin. Regarding the balance sheet, deferred revenue increased 21% to $265 million. We ended the quarter with $208 million in cash and zero debt. In the quarter, we leveraged our strong cash position and invested $73 million in share repurchases. Additionally, our Board has approved the replenishment of our $75 million share repurchase authority. That covers the summary results. Now on to our updated 2024 guidance. As consistently mentioned, our financial objective is to deliver sustainable double-digit top line growth and top quartile operating margins benchmarked against enterprise SAS comps. These are important drivers to our best-in-class return on invested capital as we maintain a balanced investment approach to growth and profitability. With our solid start to the year and increasing visibility, we are raising our 2024 revenue operating margin and earnings per share guidance, which can be found in today's earnings release. We are also reiterating our 2024 RPO target range and midpoint of $1.78 billion. As noted on prior earnings calls, our objective is to update our RPO outlook on an annual basis. And lastly on RPO, as previously noted, our bookings performance is impacted by the number and relative value of large deals we close in any quarter, which can potentially cause lumpiness or non-linear bookings throughout the year. With that, for the full-year 2024, we expect total revenue of $1.026 billion to $1.034 billion, with a $1.03 billion midpoint comparing favorably to our prior outlook and representing 17% growth, excluding license and maintenance and 11% all in. For Q2, we are targeting total revenue of $254 million to $258 million, which at the midpoint represents 17% growth, excluding license and maintenance attrition and 11% growth all in. For the rest of the year, at the midpoint, we are targeting total revenue of about $263 million in Q3 and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $256 million in Q4. For adjusted operating margin, we are increasing the midpoint to 29.75% from our prior midpoint of 29%, which includes a 170 basis point headwind from our license and maintenance revenue attrition to cloud. And as Eddie highlighted, given the combination of our demand and size of our opportunity, we continue to invest in our business. At the midpoint, adjusted operating margin on a quarterly basis is expected to be about 29.5% for both Q2 and Q3, and accounting for retail peak seasonality 28.5% in Q4. This results in our full-year adjusted earnings per share range to increase to $3.86 to $3.94. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 earnings per share of $0.96, Q3 $0.99, and accounting for retail peak seasonality, $0.93 and Q4. For GAP, earnings per share are midpoint ticks down $0.04 to $2.82 on higher investment and equity-based compensation. For Q2, we are targeting GAAP earnings per share of $0.66. Here's some additional details on our 2024 outlook. We are increasing our cloud revenue midpoint to $332.5 million, representing 31% growth. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting $80.5 million in Q2, $85 million in Q3, and $89 million in Q4. For services, we are increasing our forecast to $538 million to $544 million, with $541 million midpoint representing 11% growth. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 services revenue of $137 million, Q3 $140 million, and accounting for Q4 retail peak seasonality $132 million. For maintenance, we are targeting a midpoint of $124.5 million, which represents a 14% decline. On a quarterly basis, we are targeting Q2 at $31 million, Q3 $30 million, and Q4 $28.5 million. For consolidated subscription, maintenance, and services margin, we continue to target about 100 basis points of margin improvement for the year. And finally, we expect our tax rate to be 21.5% for the balance of the year. Our diluted share count to be 62.5 million shares, which assumes no buyback activity. So in summary, a solid Q1 performance by the Manhattan Global Team. Thank you and back to Eddie for some closing remarks. Yes, so Q2 will snap back from Q1 definitely 25%to 26% free cash flow margin on a full-year basis. We may tick up from that. There's a little bit of conservatism there. George, we like to under-promise and over-deliver, so there's not a material adjustment in the back half of the year. Yes, I did mention it. We welcomed about 100, almost exactly 100 new associates to the family in Q1 and on track with our hiring plans for 2024. Attrition is fortunately running at a very low rate for us, so we're able to keep hold of our great talent and they continue to gain more and more experience, which is really helpful for us, for our customers, and everybody concerned. But hiring plans on track for several 100 hires this year."
