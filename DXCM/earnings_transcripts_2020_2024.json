Now I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start by summarizing some of the themes that DexCom accomplished in 2020. Total revenue grew 31% over 2019, driven by a record number of new patient additions. This translates to more than $415 million in absolute dollar growth, another high watermark for DexCom. We doubled G6 capacity in the first 6 months of the year. Our team has done a great job to meet the ambitious plans that we outlined nearly 2 years ago to scale G6 capacity, leaving the company in the best inventory position that we have been in since the launch of G6.  The scale-up led to strong gross margin expansion in 2020, even as we increasingly shift our business to the pharmacy channel. We closed the full year 2020 with our highest gross margin since 2017. Our enhanced capacity puts us in position to aggressively pursue our growth initiatives. This includes the expansion of our sales force, which we announced in October and have nearly completed as well as our efforts around product sampling and direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. and international markets.  Many of you have seen our most recent effort to drive category awareness as we kicked off a new campaign around one of our DexCom warriors, Nick Jonas, including our ad during the Super Bowl. This bold effort should give you a sense for our belief about the market opportunity ahead of us. We've received great feedback from the campaign so far and look forward to joining forces with Nick and diabetes advocacy groups in the coming months to drive greater awareness of the benefits of CGM.  At the height of the pandemic's first wave, we established a new effort in a matter of days to support hospitals needing to preserve personal protective equipment and utilize our remote monitoring technology. We've made significant progress in our work to bring DexCom CGM to people with type 2 diabetes, including both those on intensive insulin therapy and those who are not. We also announced several new initiatives in 2020 that we believe will position us to meet the kinds of patient growth that we expect over the next several years.  Building on the success of our team in Manila, where we've strengthened our customer service metrics across the board, we announced a new global business services unit in Lithuania that will help serve our international operations. We also announced that we will be building our third manufacturing site and first international manufacturing site in Malaysia. This state-of-the-art facility will be key to scaling our G7 capacity and provide logistical advantages as we look to serve our growing international base.  Speaking of G7, 2020 saw us initiate and complete the first G7 pivotal trial. We're very happy with these results and the feedback we've received from participants and clinicians involved in the trial has been outstanding. Our clinical work is continuing as we progress with the regulatory path in 2021 to support our goal to launch G7 in the second half of the year.  In any given year, these are accomplishments that we would be proud of. But in 2020, our teams accomplished these goals during a global pandemic. I want to use this forum again to say how proud I am of the DexCom employees who have embraced our mission to empower people to take control of diabetes in a year of very unique challenges. It is a privilege to both lead and learn from such a talented team. And rest assured, our team is focused on the growth opportunity ahead of us as we're now well on our way in 2021.  This is shaping up to be another exciting year for the company, featuring our continued momentum as we look to bring G6 to many potential customers yet to use CGM, the ongoing manufacturing scale-up and launch of G7 and investing in several other key initiatives related to the growth pillars that we outlined at our recent Investor Day. We believe there is still a huge growth opportunity ahead, and we are investing to ensure that the company is positioned to deliver CGM as a mass market technology for greater health outcomes.  The pandemic has contributed to structural changes in the way health care is delivered. with DexCom CGM a valuable asset in the growing digital health and the remote monitoring health care ecosystems yet a majority of people with diabetes in the world continue to rely on fingerstick technology. It is because of these developing landscapes and our belief on what DexCom CGM offers that we are announcing the formation of DexCom Ventures today, which Steve Pacelli will lead.  With this entrance into the venture capital space, we believe we will be able to accelerate development for innovative companies that share our commitment to empowering greater health outcomes for customers and their clinicians. This may include technologies with use cases that can be combined with our CGM system as well as independent technology platforms.  To summarize, we are very proud of what we accomplished in 2020 and are moving forward with the same commitment to our users and the growth of DexCom well into the future. With that, I will turn it over to Quentin for a review of the fourth quarter financials and discussion of the 2021 outlook. Quen?\nQuentin Blackford: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  We reported worldwide revenue of $568.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $462.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, representing growth of 23%. Our team did a great job maintaining momentum with new patient additions in the fourth quarter and accelerating our shift of the business into the pharmacy channel.  Even with the increasing COVID lockdowns as the quarter progressed, new patients for the fourth quarter were in line with our original expectations for the year, a new record and a great achievement for our team. U.S. revenue grew 20% over the fourth quarter of 2019, totaling $451 million. We were able to drive more volume into the pharmacy channel than we originally expected, closing the year approaching 50% of our total U.S. commercial volume. This means that we are making excellent progress to position the company for long-term growth in the U.S. and an efficient operating model for the company. And while there is channel mix causing lower revenue per patient in the pharmacy channel, the underlying strength of the business saw fourth quarter unit volumes grow significantly more than our revenue growth rate in the U.S.  Our international business reached a new high-water mark of $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, growing 35% over the fourth quarter of 2019. This growth includes strong performance in both our direct and distributor markets. We began an international DTC campaign in several of our markets in the fourth quarter and will continue to drive awareness of the benefits of our technology, knowing that CGM market penetration internationally remains even less than in the U.S.  Our fourth quarter gross profit was $399.1 million or 70.2% of revenue compared to 66.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 70.2% of revenue represents our highest gross margin quarter in the past 5 years. This is another demonstration of the ability of our team to navigate our strategic shift to the pharmacy channel while delivering strong profitability across the organization.  As Kevin noted, our successful scale-up of G6 has been a key driver of this margin expansion while also placing us in our strongest inventory position to date, allowing us to more aggressively target new users as we continue in 2021.  Operating expenses were $294.7 million for Q4 2020 compared to $205.7 million in Q4 2019. The year-over-year expense growth in the fourth quarter consists of several key areas of strategic investment, which includes roughly $15 million of nonrecurring spend related to enhancing our software development efforts and automation of our production capabilities. We also increased spending related to our DTC programs, product sampling and the expansion of our U.S. sales force. Even with significant investments throughout 2020 to prepare DexCom for future growth and efficiency, total operating expense growth for the year totaled 26%, well below our 31% revenue growth for the year.  Operating income was $104.4 million or 18.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $103.6 million or 22.4% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. For the year, we delivered more than 500 basis points of operating margin expansion, with full year 2020 operating margin of 16.6%, exceeding our most recent guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was $159.2 million or 28% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $141.7 million or 30.6% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.3% also exceeded our most recent guidance and came in more than 300 basis points better than our original 2020 guidance.  As our margin progress shows, the significant steps that we have taken over the past few years are having a great impact on our ability to translate revenue growth into profitability. We are confident that the trend will continue over the long term as we move towards the 5-year targets that we laid out for you at our recent Investor Day by simultaneously taking opportunities that arise to invest in the growth ahead of us.  Net income for the fourth quarter was $90.4 million or $0.91 per share. We significantly increased operating cash flow in 2020 and remain in a strong cash position with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as we exit the year. This gives us the flexibility to pursue the strategic investments that we believe will allow us to maintain a leadership position in our field. These include some of the investments we discussed related to our fourth quarter activities.  Turning to 2021 guidance. As we stated early last month, we anticipate full year revenues of $2.21 billion to $2.31 billion, representing growth of 15% to 20%. We expect new patient growth to continue to exceed our revenue growth rate again in 2021, with our team extending their efforts to drive U.S. commercial business into our preferred pharmacy channel. We've also contemplated potential benefits from our efforts to drive category awareness through our expanded sales force, DTC advertising, product sampling and integrated systems as well as general considerations around the competitive environment.  Turning to margins. We have several considerations in 2021 as we position the business for efficient growth and long-term margin expansion, in line with what we outlined at our recent Investor Day. For 2021, we anticipate gross margins of approximately 65%, in line with our long-term expectations. This anticipates a slight shift from our 67% full year 2020 results, which we expect to be driven by the success of our pharmacy channel initiative as well as our 2021 investments in infrastructure related to our G7 scale up and OUS manufacturing facility in Malaysia.  We expect operating margins of approximately 13%, reflecting our gross margin outlook as well as various investments we've contemplated in 2021. As you know, DexCom has advanced its profitability profile at a much faster pace than originally anticipated over the past few years, while at the same time, building the infrastructure to scale the business profitably.  With the diabetes market still underpenetrated, we're going on the offense with these investments. We are continuing to invest in the growth of the business via DTC, sampling, new markets and the launch of new products that we mentioned at our Investor Day, including G7. We are also making a significant investment in the global sales force, including doubling the size of our U.S.-based commercial field team. We will also continue to work on advanced research and development, which is looking into future generations of products and sensing capability. We're making these investments to accelerate our ability to bring CGM to those in need. Additionally, we believe these investments will support the long-term profitability objectives that we set at Investor Day, while at the same time, yielding significant returns for our shareholders.  However, in the near term, we want to be prudent about incurring these upfront costs in our guidance and let the benefits play out. We expect that adjusted EBITDA margins will be approximately 23% for 2021.  Finally, with the release of the valuation allowance on income taxes in 2020, in 2021, we will start to have a tax rate that is applicable to earnings. We expect that rate, absent any changes in tax law, to be in the low to mid-20% range. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update.\nSteven Pacelli: Thanks, Quentin. As Kevin mentioned, our team did a great job executing on our strategic priorities throughout 2020. We quickly adapted the changes brought about by COVID and ensured not only that our existing patients could rely on their DexCom supplies, but that thousands of new patients could benefit from the use of G6. In fact, we closed the year with greater than 900,000 customers globally, up more than 38% over the end of 2019.  We are excited by this growth, knowing the life-changing impact at CGM and the software tools that we provide with it can have on our patients. Just last month, we published 3 peer review studies in diabetes technology and therapeutics that showed a greater than 1 point A1c reduction for customers new to DexCom CGM in as little as 3 months. This study includes both type 1 and type 2 intensive insulin users, and the result validated the kind of outcomes we have seen before. But we took it one step further.  We also saw a significant quality of life improvement for these patients as measured in terms of anxiety, emotional distress and burden of disease management, results that affirm our corporate mission to empower our users. We also demonstrated that the software tools we are building around our sensors are driving improved outcomes.  Across our base, we see increased time in range for our users of real-time share and follow apps. We see increased time and range for users who engage with our Clarity software, and we see increased time and range for users who take advantage of our integration with Apple's Siri Virtual Assistant. In 2021, we will continue to work aggressively to expand our customer base so that more and more people can experience these improved outcomes with DexCom.  As we outlined in our recent Investor Day and at a conference presentation last month, we prioritized 3 pillars of growth in the near term and look forward to progress on all 3 fronts in 2021 while we also lay the foundation for longer-term market expansion.  In our core business, which we define as people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy, we have several initiatives underway. In the U.S., we are nearing completion of our sales force expansion, which will enhance our footprint across the country, including our reach into primary care offices. We'll continue our push to prioritize the pharmacy channel, which is the most efficient channel for our patients, clinicians and DexCom. And we'll continue our efforts to drive greater access on the awareness of the benefits that DexCom offers, including the DTC campaigns that we've been driving in both the U.S. and international markets.  Outside the U.S., we continue to advocate for greater access in several key markets and look forward to broadening our reach in places where we have had little presence to date. This includes our expansion in France, building from a positive recent reimbursement decision as well as the launch of G6 in Japan with Terumo as our distribution partner.  For our third pillar, expanding the use of CGM in non-intensive type 2 diabetes, we are extending our efforts with level 2 and kicking off commercial pilots with multiple partners on the digital health side. Our work with other providers continues as well as we make the case for the clinical value of DexCom CGM in the broader type 2 population.  Recently, Everside Health, one of the nation's largest providers of on-site health clinics, announced that their health debt unit will make DexCom CGM available to their members with type 2 diabetes. This is a nice extension of our previous work with Healthstats following up on our pilot efforts that utilize CGM in an on-site health screening program. We remain increasingly confident in the market opportunity ahead for DexCom.  And on this basis, today, we announced the formation of DexCom Ventures. We have a chance to identify and accelerate the development of amazing technologies, technologies that can truly make an impact to global health outcomes via innovation. I could not be more excited to lead this effort. I believe we are well positioned to advance our strategies and build connections that will make DexCom stronger in the years ahead. Look for much more from us on this front over the next several years. And in the meantime, I couldn't be more pleased to pass the torch on our day-to-day strategy and corporate development efforts to Quentin and his team.  With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Steve. I think we've all grown tired of the 2020 superlative, so I'll keep this one brief. We're proud of what we accomplished in 2020, and we are pressing forward with excitement for the year ahead in 2021. Much of the discussion this week is centered around our recent Super Bowl ad. We were incredibly pleased by the public response, which drove 11x greater search volume compared to the average 2021 Super Bowl commercial, the highest of any brand that advertised this year. This is why we did the ad, to drive awareness and ultimately bring CGM to more and more people who stand to benefit from this technology.  There may be more people talking about diabetes this week than any other time in recent memory, a conversation that includes health care providers, insurance providers and people with diabetes themselves. We welcome these conversations and look forward to advancing these discussions for greater access for all people with diabetes. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: So I'm going to use my one, Quentin. The guidance came in a little lower on the margin side for 2021. Can you walk us through what's the delta on gross margin and those expenses? I realize the long-term guide is $65 million, but I think people were thinking a little bit higher in 2021 here. And then it seems like to get to 13%, you're going to need a pretty big step-up in SG&A. So maybe just help us walk through SG&A and R&D and what you're expecting in terms of investment, how much DTC will be 2021 versus 2020? And any other notable expenses that we should be thinking about?\nQuentin Blackford: Sure. Thanks, Robbie. Look, I think the first thing I would mention is we've made incredible progress from a profitability perspective over the last couple of years. If you think back to our original Analyst Day, we set an expectation to be at a 25% EBITDA margin by the year 2023, and we delivered 26% EBITDA margin in the year 2020. So we've made incredible progress. And I would say progress even accelerated or went beyond what our original expectations were. But we've always known there are investments we've got to make in this business to open up some of these incredible market opportunities that sit in front of us. And I think more than anything, the fact that we're making these investments ought to be a testament to the fact that we now believe in, and we're seeing that these are going to be real opportunities for us. So we're excited about making that investment.  On the gross margin side, there's a few things to point out this year that makes 2021 a little bit unique. One, we will continue to drive the normal efficiencies and leverage through the gross margin that we have in the last several years. And I would expect there's a couple of hundred basis points of efficiencies to continue to take out of it over the course of '21. But there's 2 headwinds that we have to navigate through. One continues to be the move to the pharmacy channel. We expect that we'll see a significant move over the course of this year. We've seen that pick up in terms of its momentum in the back part of last year. The other one is we're making significant investment in standing up our first international manufacturing capability in Malaysia. We broke ground there. We have teams there as we speak starting to build out that capability, which is going to take -- it is tens of millions of units of production capacity and turns it into hundreds of millions of units of production capacity for us, which we believe is going to be necessary as we open up these markets and begin to really see results from them. So that's what's going to play out on the gross margin side that results in a couple of hundred basis points of headwind from the 67% back to 65%.  On the OpEx side, I think it's important. G&A is going to continue to lever nicely for us. Where the investment is going is purely in the sales expense and into R&D, and there's really a few drivers that drive it. There's the doubling of the U.S. commercial field force that we've talked about. That's pretty much done as we sit here today. Those resources are going to be in place and able to start to contribute over the course of the year, but they obviously bring with it an expense load. We're also turning up the DTC efforts. We've never been better positioned from an inventory perspective to really turn the dials on DTC and sampling and giving our commercial team the tools they need to be as effective as possible. So we're excited to be able to do that.  And then finally, I'll just remind you, over the course of this year, we've got all the G7 expenses that are going on. We got the trial expenses, we got the filing expenses, and then we got the commercial launch behind that as well. So all those things together drive the incremental investment from an OpEx perspective. But that's all going to show up in R&D and selling expense. You will see leverage in G&A. So I hope that answers the question for you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird.\nJeffrey Johnson: I just wanted to follow-up. It's really going back even to the Analyst Day. Quentin, at the time, you talked about 7 to 8 points of channel headwinds kind of through 2022, 7 to 8 points annually. I don't think you really talked about whether that would be front-end loaded, back-end loaded, how even loaded that might be over the 2 years. So one, how much channel headwind are we thinking this year? I think you might have said 10% last quarter for 2021. I just want to check that. And does that then -- if that's the right number, does that imply a fall-off in those channel headwinds in going into '22? If you could just help us out there, understand gating.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes. Great question. 10%, 10 points of headwind is the right way to think about it, primarily driven by that pharmacy channel mix shift that continues to move towards the direction that is important for us to be able to scale the business over the long term. I'd remind you, profit dollars are higher in that channel. But yes, there is some gross margin pressure that comes with it. But from a top line perspective, that's what's driving it is that pharmacy channel, call it, roughly 10 points. I do think you'll see that evolve a little bit over the course of the year. Keep in mind, in the first part of last year, we weren't into the pharmacy channel to the same degree that we were as we exited the year. So you've got a tougher comp in Q1 and Q2. And you see that in the growth rates as well. You're going to see tougher growth comps in the first half of '21 that will start to subside in the back half of the year.  So I do think that you'll see that evolve a bit as we start to anniversary some of the pharmacy shift that we saw in the back part of '20 into the back part of '21. As we head into '22, look, we'll talk about that as we get out there around that time frame. But I do think there's a couple of years here of stepping through it. Once we're through it, I think you're going to see the unit volume growth of this business is going to be much more reflective of the overall dollar growth. Unit volume growth continues to be incredibly strong. We were up 40% in units in the fourth quarter by the time everything settled out. And our unit volume growth in '21 is right around that 25% to 30% growth. So very strong unit growth continue to drive the business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from Blair, William Blair.\nMargaret Andrew: So I'd like to shift maybe a little bit into the non-intensively managed type 2 patients and the consumer health wellness patients. I guess, upfront, do you guys have any sense of utilization or annual revenue per patient amongst these groups? And I guess, as you look at the different types of products or devices that these patients might need, is it different than what you've got right now? And is that one of the goals, I guess, of the new venture fund or are there some internal efforts around that as well?\nKevin Sayer: Margaret, this is Kevin. I'll take that. The annual revenue profile per patient, we think, is going to vary based on condition and use case. We believe internally, or at least what we discuss internally, is for a type 2 non-intensive patient. For example, even if a full-time use, the revenue per year per patient is going to be a lower number because we're solving a different problem. We're not managing the lives and the health and safety of these patients, but we are making them healthier and we are giving a better experience than they have. And ultimately, we will take costs from the system. As far as what that number is going to be, I don't have a number completely. We have numerous models, and many of those depend upon the final use cases. I've also said numerous times, and I'll stick to this as well, I think the ultimate use case and the way we'll ultimately price it will be for full-time use for these patients. And if they choose to use it less often, that will be their choice. So on the health and wellness side, again, many, many more patients, a lower annual revenue number, but more interactions with more different people in a completely different distribution channel.  With respect to the products, certainly, the core technology of sensing glucose, from our perspective, on the glucose side will remain the same. As those of you who listened to our Investor Day heard when I had my chat with Dr. Peter Atia, we talked about accuracy. And he said it's actually more important for his patients because if they only go between 70 and 120, 20 points off is a big deal. And they'd be making a wrong decision as far as their health and what they eat nutrition-wise, et cetera, within accuracy. So we know that fundamental core technology needs to remain accurate. Where we get into different products is the experience that we create, possibly even different wearables based on the category, different places to receive the data. Then as you look at the new ventures unit that Steve will be working in, then you look at software experiences for patients, data platforms to get data to these platforms better, possibly other things we could sense or measure and add to glucose. So we believe these markets are going to require something different. At the end of the day, one size fits all is not going to work for us as we try and expand and hit the goals we've laid out probably being in the future. We're going to have numerous experiences for these patient groups.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: So I guess just to follow-up a little bit more, Quentin, on the operating margin side of things. I know you're running ahead of expectations on the operating margin side of things. But I think everybody is looking at the guidance here and saying, okay, you're making all these investments and a lot of different things to the sales force and DTC. First of all, how do you measure what's most effective between the 2? And then how does it not just you're making these investments basically just to kind of run at the same pace that you've already laid out versus you're making these investments because we think it can even [indiscernible] potentially a little bit better?\nQuentin Blackford: Yes. Well, I think we're incredibly excited and bullish on the future opportunities. But at the same time, our approach has always been we want to see those start to pan out and contribute. And at that point, we'll start to reflect them into guidance. So as we open up some of these new markets and validate that we're able to generate the revenue from them, then hopefully, we've got some very positive updates for you guys over time. I don't think we could be more excited around where we're making these investments. We know for a fact the type 2 intensive space, for example, is going to come on to CGM therapy. We're seeing it happen in our results right now. We're starting to see some of it with the nonintensive. As a matter of fact, if you look at our new patient figures, it's led by type 2 patients. So we're starting to see some of that be validated. But in order to reach those patients, for example, on the sales force side, we've got to be in the primary care physician offices. That's where those patients are seen and that's where our current commercial force does not really play. And so as we've added those resources, that is going to be their primary focus, their primary target.  Similarly, on the DTC side. I'll continue to reiterate, there's not a better investment that we make inside the 4 walls of DexCom today than our DTC efforts. And the returns that we see with the new patients that come out of it, we're very confident that that's the best investment we can possibly make. Now will that return on investment per individual or per patient start to step down into the future? It may as they get harder to bring on. Basically, for the time being, we've been very encouraged by that return that we've seen, and we'll continue to pour resources in there until we see that change. So I don't think there's a better place for us to be focusing our efforts right now than to really be building out the commercial force to see the right individuals where the patients are at and to continue to create awareness for these patients as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS.\nMatthew Taylor: So my question is about the international investments. You're really stepping up with the support center and the new investments in Malaysia. I guess, can you talk about the arc of that opportunity? If you could frame anything in France, Japan and what that means for kind of the future expansion in international, that would be really helpful.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks for the question. We laid out international as 1 of our 3 primary pillars at our investor conference. And as you look at the progress we've made, I recently prepared a speech for the sales guys. We're up 10x where we were 5 years ago from $40-plus million to over $400 million for 2020. And by every indicator, one would say, wow, that is fabulous. And in our mind, as we look at it, the opportunity is bigger than what we've addressed. And we do need to build infrastructure, and we also need to look at doing things more creatively. I think, for example, the Japan partnership with Terumo, whereby we're really letting a partner take our business in that country that is a medical technology leader in that geography is going to be a great business model for us to watch and look at.  In France, we get reimbursement for a group of patients. We will invest some there. But we have other international models we're looking at. We literally break down every country in a type of bucket. There's great reimbursement here. Here's how we need to attack this one. There's no reimbursement here, and we're making plans across all the geographies. Another key investment internationally is going to be our e-commerce platform. We've had great results every place we've launched it, so in geographies where we're not. Where we go, we'll probably go first with an e-commerce platform going forward. And so we're investing on all fronts there. The Malaysia factory is truly an investment in scale for us. It will -- it's going to be ultra modern, as is our Arizona manufacturing facility, don't get me wrong. But we've learned a tremendous amount in building out Arizona that we can apply to Malaysia and really put ourselves in a position to whereby we can go after these businesses. One of the things that we often discuss, as we sit and discuss the what have, should have, could haves, and for a better part, 1.5 years, as far as capacity, we were selling everything we built. With the opportunity now, with the inventory we have and our ops team being able to build as much as they can, we think we can much more aggressively go after these international markets just on a commercial strategy basis as well, and we're going to going forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: You mentioned -- I think Kevin mentioned the goal is to launch G7 in the second half of this year. Historically, you've referred to launching G7 in some markets in '21 and on other markets in '22. You didn't say that this time. Maybe it was implied, but is the expectation that the G7 launched in the second half? Is it a worldwide launch? I'm just wondering what's changed around your G7 launch plans.\nKevin Sayer: Really, Jayson, nothing has changed. We are operating on schedule. We -- as I said, we completed our first pivotal study. And that certainly will provide us enough data to file for a CE Mark. We do not have enough data to file in the U.S. for ICGM approval, and we're working on that with the studies we have ongoing and it will continue to go on for a while. Much of this is a function of regulatory time frame studies. COVID letting us in the clinics, yes or no. There's still some uncertainty around just pulling off the execution necessary to get the submissions prepared, the abilities of the entities to review it. So we're marching to our schedule. At the end of the day, we've never been more bullish on a product. I've spoken with investigators and patients who run our first studies, and they're -- look, they're done with G6 now. They do not want to wear it anymore, and we told them they have to go back. It is everything that we'd hoped it would be. Anything that G6 does, G7 will do better. And for now, it's just a question of timing, commercial availability, manufacturing. And we're pretty tight lipped on these milestones as well. I'm just not going to lay out the yellow brick road for everybody to know and see and prepare for. We kind of like to surprise a few people.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Just, Quentin, a quick one for me. You obviously talked about the 10 points of headwinds here in '21, which obviously implies 25% to 30% volume growth. One of your competitors, your only competitor basically, is talking about 40% growth here in '21. And I just sort of think about, given the size of their business, which is a little larger from a volume perspective and I think about the major investments you're making in DTC, the major commercial investments, how should investors react to sort of your 25% to 30% volume number relative to your larger competitor saying they can grow 40%?\nQuentin Blackford: Yes, David, thanks for the question. Look, I think my takeaway is, I think we all see the market opportunity exactly the same way. There's incredible runway sitting in front of us. There's a lot of adoption yet to be had in the intensive segments of the market and the nonintensive is going to open up as well. Our approach to the guidance is probably a little bit different and unique, which is we're very bullish on some of these new market opportunities and contributions that can come from them, but we're not going to get ahead of ourselves with respect to those expectations as they play out. Over time, if that happens in '21, then fantastic. It's going to be a terrific result. If it comes a bit later in '22, it's still going to be a great result. At the end of the day, we're very confident in what this ultimately has the potential to look at -- look like, and we're going to make the investments to ensure it's a reality for us. But at the same time, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves. So I think more than anything, you've got 2 players in this space who are incredibly bullish on the opportunity, which just validates there's a lot of runway here and a lot of opportunity for all of us to have success together.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG.\nMarie Thibault: My question has to do with the doubling of the sales force, it's certainly an impressive move. So I'm curious about what it means for the legacy sales force in terms of the culture with so many new folks coming on. And are those new folks concentrated in any specific geographies? I know reimbursement is still important to targeting the type 2 patient market.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you. That's a great question. And we have worked very hard to preserve that legacy and that culture and hire the same quality of individuals. I'm actually preparing for our virtual national sales meeting coming up here in a couple of weeks. In 2010, we had 26 territories. And we're going to 260. And of those 26 territories, you'd be amazed at how many of those people are still here. So they are still a big influence on our company, on our culture and training and teaching the new people that come in what's important to DexCom and what are our values. At the same time, as the business is expanding rapidly, our culture has had to change from time to time. We've made moves over the years. For example, if I go back, we did away with having trainers in every territory in addition to a rep, which was different than everybody else in the industry. But we made that move and it proved very successful.  As we go to the pharmacy channel more as we get access easier, the job of our reps continues to evolve and change. And it's our job to provide them with tools to whereby these jobs are meaningful and rewarding, and they want to stay and they want to be with us. And we're working very hard on that in this expansion. And we're being very thoughtful about it. We had many thousand candidates for these jobs and really feel we picked some fantastic people, not only for the field positions, but for some of the leadership positions that were opened up as well. We look forward to meeting with the group and being with them, and we have high expectations.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB.\nDanielle Antalffy: Kevin, I just wanted to clear something up that it sounds like after the Super Bowl ad, which, by the way, I thought was a great ad. I also do love Nick Jonas, but I -- yes. There was some controversy. It sounds like -- or I don't know if you'd call it controversy, but just some chatter, it sounds like around, oh, we can't even afford insulin, how can we afford this technology. And we spent a lot of time with you guys at the Analyst Day talking about how affordable actually the technology is. Is there just a misunderstanding out there in the market around accessing this technology? Or where is the disconnect there?\nKevin Sayer: Well, I don't even know there's a disconnect, Danielle, and we talked about this a lot before we decided to run the ad. And we decided that running the ad, and I'm going to get to this a little bit in my closing remarks. But running the ad, creating more awareness, getting more people on the technology and more demand would actually lead to more accessibility and ultimately lower cost for patients and get more product to them. But if you look at the life of our patients, buying insulin, buying CGM, if they have a -- an insulin delivery system, these people spend a lot of money. And it's a large percent of their income, and it's hard. It's just hard. We empathize with those people. We've done our best with our pharmacy ship, for example. And when we gave some of these statistics at Investor Day, I think somewhere above 30% of our pharmacy patients have zero co-pay. And another group of them have less than $60 a month on their co-pay. So we've done what we can to bring costs down on our side. And we've not only done it bringing costs down, but we've done it while improving our margins. So we've really done the best we can here. We do think it is important to acknowledge the community and listen to them, but we also have to run a business. And ultimately, we felt by making more people aware, we'd have a much more positive effect than negative.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Kevin, can you talk a little bit about the venture fund, specifically the amount of funding, how broad the focus will be? It sounds like it's going to be broader than diabetes. And when could we see an impact?\nKevin Sayer: Well, I'm going to hold Steve to the standard of when he made the investment in tandem many years ago. And our return was several times. No, I'm just kidding. We will focus on diabetes technologies a bit because that's what we do. And there are things in this diabetes or in this health care world that can utilize our technology that we don't have time to develop, that we need to look at and be friendly with and we have capital that we can invest. We will also look at other things that could fit into our business and our technology. I don't see us going and acquiring share interest in 50 different companies that are all over the place. But I do see us with a very focused approach. As far as the level of funding, as I've chatted with our Board, we're going to leave that open right now for the opportunities that we see and dip our foot in the water and get going. But we think we have some really good opportunities to give us platforms to expand our business over time and help some of these companies grow. Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything else?\nSteven Pacelli: Yes. No, the only thing I would comment on is that we're very much approaching this as corporate venture capital, or I would tell you, kind of strategic venture capital. So certainly, while returns are important, although Kevin's holding me to a ridiculous standard out of the gate. Returns aside, look, you're going to see us investing in opportunities that are not only seeking out financial returns but could have some sort of a technology development piece or an in-licensing of technology piece or potentially commercial aspect to it. So they'll all make sense. Many of them you guys won't actually have visibility into unless and until we disclose them, but it's an exciting next step for me.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: I have one, which is, can you comment if there are any changes on -- or any observations on the competitive landscape? And in any particular region that, that may have shifted slightly more positively or slightly more negatively?\nKevin Sayer: Joanne, I would just say it is a competitive landscape and will remain competitive. We're -- both us, Amit and quite frankly, Medtronic, every -- all companies are aggressive here. We'll continue to push. We've done very well in all of our markets. We see opportunities to do better. We see opportunities for improvement across the board. We'll continue to do that. I think our Super Bowl ad really achieved the result that we were looking for as far as creating awareness. I mean, you heard, 11x more searches than the average ad. We have an opportunity to drive some awareness, and we will do that. But it is a very competitive landscape, and it's not going to change. And we're up for it. We have no problem with that. It makes everybody better.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mathew Blackman from Stifel.\nMathew Blackman: I wanted to touch on the sales force expansion. And just remind us how quickly those new reps could start to contribute to revenues. And also remind us, how is the sales force going to be structured? Are these reps going to call on all clinicians or it will somehow be bifurcated between PCPs and endos and specialists?\nKevin Sayer: The way we structure the teams out in the field is very much based upon the number of people with diabetes and intensive insulin users that they see. And that information is already available through the IQVIA data as far as insulin prescriptions in the various territories. And we use that -- those geographies and that data to determine how we structure the territories and where we put our people. The people in their territories will be responsible for all of the medical professionals within that group, and they will continue to do that. I'm trying to think, is there -- if there is another part to his question. Yes, and we structured it similar to how we've done it in the past. We have regions and districts within the sales organization.  We've increased the number of districts, the number of regions from 2 to 4. And so similar structure that way. And then we've worked out a comp plan that we think is very fair for everybody, and our guys are willing to live with. I think the most interesting piece for me in laying out the whole sales force expansion was how it was received by our team in the beginning. You're always wary of that when you start. Instead, the team raised our hands and said, we need more help. We need more exposure here. This is a good thing. There are people we don't call on. So we look forward to it. And as far as time, it takes everybody time to get acclimated to a new position, a new territory. For those who have diabetes relationships, for example, if you hire somebody from an insulin company or an insulin pump company, they can go back to offices they've already been to, and they're up and running quite quickly. For others, it takes more time. And that's why we have our district managers and our regional managers to help with those relationships and train those people. So there is a time. It varies based on the experience level of the rep before they start with us. Some hit the ground running and go faster than the one before. Others, it takes a little time. And we monitor that and we watch and go give those more training that need it. So it will be fun to watch unfold.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ravi Misra.\nRavi Misra: So just wanted to go back to the gross margin and the kind of CapEx investments and scale up that you're looking to make. I'm trying to figure out, Quentin and Kevin, you're building all this capacity presumably for the next, I'm guessing, decade or so. How do we think about that plant or the plants coming online in terms of what level of volume do you think you need to be when it comes to the kind of sales numbers that you put out there for the long term to kind of really truly get those plants to lever the fixed cost investments they've made? I guess what I'm trying to ask is sales ramp faster than we've kind of modeled here. Is there upside to your gross margin conversely if it's kind of in line with the long-term guidance? What gets that 65% higher that contemplate these CapEx investments?\nKevin Sayer: You go first. I'll go after you.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes. Well, I would -- Ravi, it's a great question. I'd remind you, the $4 billion to $4.5 billion revenue figure we put out there out in 2025 or so was more or less our base case. That's how we qualified that to you folks. And it started to open up a bit of the type 2 nonintensive opportunity, but there's a massive market that sits in front of us. And as we open that up in bigger ways, as you start to open up things like hospital or gestational or get further upstream into the diabetes condition and get into prediabetes, those volume numbers are incredible. And so I mentioned earlier, we're talking about going from tens of millions of units to hundreds of millions of units of capability over time, and we're beginning to make those investments as we speak.  In terms of the CapEx investment, I think you're going to see roughly double this year what we've seen in the last couple of years. We've seen about $200 million of CapEx in the last 2 years each year. I think that is going to be north of $400 million, probably as we stand up this building and build out the capability that will then service for years to come into the future. How quickly we're ramping that is really going to be predicated on how quickly we open up some of these markets. What we're not going to do, and we've been very clear about this after having learned from the experience ourselves when we launched G6, we're not going to put ourselves in a position again to where we don't have the inventory to deliver to the patient and create a DexCom experience that is one that we want them to have. And so we are investing ahead of that curve, but we're very confident that the curve is ultimately going to be realized. I think the question is just nailing down that timing and know exactly what that's going to look like. From our perspective, we're going to be ready when it's ready to go. We're not going to be behind it, so...\nKevin Sayer: Yes. Thanks, Quentin. And let me add just a bit. As I look at volumes and why hundreds of millions rather than tens. As we look at the use of CGM, for example, as a diagnostic for somebody who may have prediabetes but may not be sure as part of the annual checkup, there's hundreds of millions of people in the U.S. who would need that checkup every year. As you look at 30 million people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S., I don't know if my 30 million is right, but it's close. If just 10% of those people went on sensors full time, you're looking at 60 million to 90 million sensors we'd be selling on an annual basis. These opportunities are going to require scale. And we've just made the decision going at this in a manner to whereby we do it gradually and hope we have enough when we get there. It's just not going to work. The opportunities are too big and the investment is required. That's why we've raised the money. That's why we've made the plans. That's why we've designed the product and set the relationships that we have. We need to go after this. And when you look at the size of the investment versus the size of the prize, size of the prize is way bigger than the size of the investment.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer.\nSteven Lichtman: So the increased focus on the primary care office here near term with your sales force expansion I assume means targeting non-intensive type 2s sooner rather than later. I guess, first, how should we think about the ramp in this patient population before reimbursement models are established broadly for these patients? And second, do you have the back office capability yet? I know you're building out some more here to handle those patients over the next few years.\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that one, too. Their focus will initially be on insulin-using patients who have reimbursement for the technology. The non-insulin users will, in fact, tag along as they become aware, and there are situations where some of these patients who have coverage. On the type 2 nonintensive patient, we've been very clear from the beginning that we're going to go about that -- this market 4 different ways: through programs, payers, clinicians, and then directly to patients. And over the course of 2021, you will see those 4 initiatives unfold as we gather more data and launch more initiatives. And so awareness will grow. As Quentin said earlier, and Steve, a very reasonable number of our leads from the Super Bowl ad have been type 2 non-intensive patients. Whether we can serve them or not with reimbursement today remains to be seen, but we certainly have a database of these names on people we can call on. As soon as we have the product offering, we want to get in that space ready. So I think we're preparing and getting ready for that. More importantly, though, as we make these clinicians aware, they can look for cases where they can make it available to their patients. They can look at situations where somebody can appeal for coverage if they have type 2 diabetes and out of control, and those appeals have been successful. So we're looking forward to going there and -- but these guys will focus on our core markets and where we play with reimbursement, first and foremost.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: I just wanted to ask a little bit more about just the investments in the SG&A side in 2021. I think the sales force investments are well understood. But maybe just help us understand specifically on DTC and sampling, how does that change the cost and the time line of a customer acquisition? And then also maybe the capture rate in the retention, can you just give us the metrics to understand how to evaluate those investments in 2021?\nQuentin Blackford: Yes. Well, I think when you look at the overall investment in the areas you identified, the most significant increase is likely going to show up in doubling the size of that commercial field force. And then right behind it is DTC and sampling. Sampling is a bit new to us. We've never sampled historically. We just started to roll that out in the fourth quarter and very early in seeing what that looks like. But that's a pretty easy one for us to measure. We're not going to give you the specific results of what that looks like. Although the fact that we're going to continue to double down on it should tell you that we're incredibly happy with what we're seeing. But that's as easy as knowing exactly where we're dropping the samples in the field and knowing exactly what patients are utilizing those samples, and ultimately, turn into a recurring purchase for us. So those are easy measures. And on the DTC side, with social media and the leads that get created from that, that ultimately turn into patients, that becomes relatively easy to measure as well. One of the things that I think was just really fascinating coming out of the Super Bowl ad is that we had 5x more impressions in the last 4 days than we had it for the entire year of 2020 on the heels of that. I think it's just remarkable the type of reach that we're finding with our DTC efforts. So we're going to continue to monitor those things and measure those and hold ourselves accountable to them. And as long as the return is there, we're going to continue to invest aggressively there. If we see the returns start to drop down, then we'll start to think differently. But we're not going to give specific return measures, those sorts of things. But the fact that we're doubling down in these efforts, I think, ought to convey the confidence we have in these investments and what they're bringing to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.\nRobert Hopkins: Quentin, I'll just ask a quick one of you. And you may have just answered this in response to the last question. But you said several times in this call how strong a inventory you're position you're in right now. And I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit specifically about what you're able to do in 2021 that you weren't able to do in 2020 as a result of that very strong inventory position.\nQuentin Blackford: Well, look, Bob, I think it's a good question. But historically, I think we've seen opportunities sit in front of us. And we knew they were available to us, but we couldn't aggressively pursue them because we knew we couldn't get patient to the -- our product to the patient once they became aware of the opportunity. So what you didn't want to do is create all this awareness and then be in a back order situation immediately. And if you go back to 2019, we operated through most all of '19 in a back order situation. We came out of that early in '20 which has now allowed us to build inventories and put ourselves in a position where we can start to get more aggressive with these things. So I think it enables a whole lot of opportunities for us to get a whole lot more strategic than where we could historically just because those opportunities weren't real. We couldn't serve the patient at that point in time. Now we can.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim.\nChristopher Pasquale: I wanted to follow-up on the question about non-intensive type 2s. Back at the analyst meeting, you set a pretty ambitious goal for that segment to contribute 15% of sales by 2025. Can you tell us what that was in 2020, just as a baseline? And what the gating factors might be for starting to provide more visibility into how you're tracking towards that goal?\nKevin Sayer: Yes. We really can't lay that out for 2020. I think the way you'll get more visibility from us, as our programmatic approaches take off, you'll -- we'll be able to speak about revenues from the programs. Additionally, as you look out to 2023, it's my belief and attention on '23, '24 and '25, this will be a product that is distributed through our typical distribution channels, and there will be visibility that way. When we have meaningful revenues to report, we'll certainly let you know that that's going on. But we don't -- right now, these are more investments than they are our revenue opportunities. We need to gather data. We need to show that this works. We need to create relationships like we have at Intermountain Health care, for example, where they're running a study right now to look at CGM in these patients in a couple of different ways. The program we talked about that we ran down in Florida internally is now part of one of our programs where Healthstats is offering CGM to their type 2 patients. Up to this point, even though there's been volumes created here, a lot of this stuff has just been really to invest and to learn, similar to what we did in the hospital business this year as well. It's going to take a while for these markets to develop. But eventually, we'll break it down and report more. But for now, we're just not ready to.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: This is Anthony for Raj. My question would be on gross margin. I'm wondering in the 65% guide for '21, how much trapped overhead actually is in there from the Malaysian plant as that gets up and running. But as you look out and that plant gets up to scale, I'm wondering where the cost per sensor will trend for units coming out of that facility, again, once it gets up to scale?\nQuentin Blackford: Yes. Good question. In 2021, there's about 200 basis points of pressure that we're going to realize from the investments in standing up that Malaysia operating capability. So I think that quantifies for you very clearly what it will be. As we look out into the future, we've said we believe we can get the cost profile to less than $10 per day in a 10-day use case. So think about that as less than $1 per day. Malaysia will certainly be below that, offset by where we're at in the states. So it certainly is a very attractive profile for us. And as we continue to think about ways to innovate there with automation, we're hopeful to take it even further. But that's a big enabler of ultimately getting our cost profile down to those ranges we've discussed both here today and in the past.\nOperator: And we have no more questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Kevin Sayer for final comments.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you. I did a bit of math while we were doing this call. This is my 40th call with Steve. And as he moves into a new role, I just need to acknowledge what a wonderful job he's done with our investors over the years. I think back at our calls in the early years, where we'd sit around and go, okay, what is it we're going to say today and what is it we have to report. This company has changed so much over those 40 calls. A marvelous effort and some incredible work, and he'll still be here, but he's going to have some different investors to please, and we're excited about that.  I do want to thank everybody for being on the call today. As you can tell, we remain extremely bullish about our opportunities going forward. One of our executives was having a conversation with me here one day and he said, the way he described DexCom is just as soon as we climb one mountain, we get to the top of it. And on the other side, there's a bigger one, and we start another climb. And I think as Quentin detailed our financial plans and what we have going on, what we see is a great big mountain and a great big climb. And we're preparing to do that. We think we can do it very effectively. We are very bullish about the future. Over the past several days, a lot of the talk has been around the Super Bowl commercial here. And I have gotten numerous pictures, videos, e-mails, text messages from our patients and their parents or their caregivers saying thank you for creating awareness. Kids in school are telling everybody, remember that commercial, I wear that.  And I have that, and this is how I manage my diabetes. We have seen such a positive reception to this, and the positive energy has just been amazing. So kudos to our marketing team, to Nick Jonas and everybody for getting this done. Our hospital initiatives and the new initiatives we've talked about. As I said, there are investments, but now we're getting numerous physicians reaching out saying, you've got to get this everywhere. It needs to be all throughout the hospital. It needs to be worn by the patients when they go home. We can't have them coming back, and monitoring glucose can be very important. We'll continue to go after those efforts. Our new market efforts are very strong.  And last, I'll go to the intensive type 2s as well. As I said, we created some awareness here. I recently had a conversation. I've had several conversations with people with type 2 diabetes absolutely struggling with what to do. What can I possibly do to take care of myself because they just don't know. And CGM tells them. It tells them what to do. It tells them about foods. It tells them about exercise. It tells them about stress and sleep and everything else. And we are really excited for this opportunity. You'll see us have a lot of good things come to pass in 2021 on all these fronts. But thanks, everybody, for continuing to listen. And great day, great year for DexCom and our team. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start by summarizing some of the themes that DexCom accomplished in 2020. Total revenue grew 31% over 2019, driven by a record number of new patient additions. This translates to more than $415 million in absolute dollar growth, another high watermark for DexCom. We doubled G6 capacity in the first 6 months of the year. Our team has done a great job to meet the ambitious plans that we outlined nearly 2 years ago to scale G6 capacity, leaving the company in the best inventory position that we have been in since the launch of G6.  The scale-up led to strong gross margin expansion in 2020, even as we increasingly shift our business to the pharmacy channel. We closed the full year 2020 with our highest gross margin since 2017. Our enhanced capacity puts us in position to aggressively pursue our growth initiatives. This includes the expansion of our sales force, which we announced in October and have nearly completed as well as our efforts around product sampling and direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. and international markets.  Many of you have seen our most recent effort to drive category awareness as we kicked off a new campaign around one of our DexCom warriors, Nick Jonas, including our ad during the Super Bowl. This bold effort should give you a sense for our belief about the market opportunity ahead of us. We've received great feedback from the campaign so far and look forward to joining forces with Nick and diabetes advocacy groups in the coming months to drive greater awareness of the benefits of CGM.  At the height of the pandemic's first wave, we established a new effort in a matter of days to support hospitals needing to preserve personal protective equipment and utilize our remote monitoring technology. We've made significant progress in our work to bring DexCom CGM to people with type 2 diabetes, including both those on intensive insulin therapy and those who are not. We also announced several new initiatives in 2020 that we believe will position us to meet the kinds of patient growth that we expect over the next several years.  Building on the success of our team in Manila, where we've strengthened our customer service metrics across the board, we announced a new global business services unit in Lithuania that will help serve our international operations. We also announced that we will be building our third manufacturing site and first international manufacturing site in Malaysia. This state-of-the-art facility will be key to scaling our G7 capacity and provide logistical advantages as we look to serve our growing international base.  Speaking of G7, 2020 saw us initiate and complete the first G7 pivotal trial. We're very happy with these results and the feedback we've received from participants and clinicians involved in the trial has been outstanding. Our clinical work is continuing as we progress with the regulatory path in 2021 to support our goal to launch G7 in the second half of the year.  In any given year, these are accomplishments that we would be proud of. But in 2020, our teams accomplished these goals during a global pandemic. I want to use this forum again to say how proud I am of the DexCom employees who have embraced our mission to empower people to take control of diabetes in a year of very unique challenges. It is a privilege to both lead and learn from such a talented team. And rest assured, our team is focused on the growth opportunity ahead of us as we're now well on our way in 2021.  This is shaping up to be another exciting year for the company, featuring our continued momentum as we look to bring G6 to many potential customers yet to use CGM, the ongoing manufacturing scale-up and launch of G7 and investing in several other key initiatives related to the growth pillars that we outlined at our recent Investor Day. We believe there is still a huge growth opportunity ahead, and we are investing to ensure that the company is positioned to deliver CGM as a mass market technology for greater health outcomes.  The pandemic has contributed to structural changes in the way health care is delivered. with DexCom CGM a valuable asset in the growing digital health and the remote monitoring health care ecosystems yet a majority of people with diabetes in the world continue to rely on fingerstick technology. It is because of these developing landscapes and our belief on what DexCom CGM offers that we are announcing the formation of DexCom Ventures today, which Steve Pacelli will lead.  With this entrance into the venture capital space, we believe we will be able to accelerate development for innovative companies that share our commitment to empowering greater health outcomes for customers and their clinicians. This may include technologies with use cases that can be combined with our CGM system as well as independent technology platforms.  To summarize, we are very proud of what we accomplished in 2020 and are moving forward with the same commitment to our users and the growth of DexCom well into the future. With that, I will turn it over to Quentin for a review of the fourth quarter financials and discussion of the 2021 outlook. Quen? Thank you, Steve. I think we've all grown tired of the 2020 superlative, so I'll keep this one brief. We're proud of what we accomplished in 2020, and we are pressing forward with excitement for the year ahead in 2021. Much of the discussion this week is centered around our recent Super Bowl ad. We were incredibly pleased by the public response, which drove 11x greater search volume compared to the average 2021 Super Bowl commercial, the highest of any brand that advertised this year. This is why we did the ad, to drive awareness and ultimately bring CGM to more and more people who stand to benefit from this technology.  There may be more people talking about diabetes this week than any other time in recent memory, a conversation that includes health care providers, insurance providers and people with diabetes themselves. We welcome these conversations and look forward to advancing these discussions for greater access for all people with diabetes. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Margaret, this is Kevin. I'll take that. The annual revenue profile per patient, we think, is going to vary based on condition and use case. We believe internally, or at least what we discuss internally, is for a type 2 non-intensive patient. For example, even if a full-time use, the revenue per year per patient is going to be a lower number because we're solving a different problem. We're not managing the lives and the health and safety of these patients, but we are making them healthier and we are giving a better experience than they have. And ultimately, we will take costs from the system. As far as what that number is going to be, I don't have a number completely. We have numerous models, and many of those depend upon the final use cases. I've also said numerous times, and I'll stick to this as well, I think the ultimate use case and the way we'll ultimately price it will be for full-time use for these patients. And if they choose to use it less often, that will be their choice. So on the health and wellness side, again, many, many more patients, a lower annual revenue number, but more interactions with more different people in a completely different distribution channel.  With respect to the products, certainly, the core technology of sensing glucose, from our perspective, on the glucose side will remain the same. As those of you who listened to our Investor Day heard when I had my chat with Dr. Peter Atia, we talked about accuracy. And he said it's actually more important for his patients because if they only go between 70 and 120, 20 points off is a big deal. And they'd be making a wrong decision as far as their health and what they eat nutrition-wise, et cetera, within accuracy. So we know that fundamental core technology needs to remain accurate. Where we get into different products is the experience that we create, possibly even different wearables based on the category, different places to receive the data. Then as you look at the new ventures unit that Steve will be working in, then you look at software experiences for patients, data platforms to get data to these platforms better, possibly other things we could sense or measure and add to glucose. So we believe these markets are going to require something different. At the end of the day, one size fits all is not going to work for us as we try and expand and hit the goals we've laid out probably being in the future. We're going to have numerous experiences for these patient groups. Thanks for the question. We laid out international as 1 of our 3 primary pillars at our investor conference. And as you look at the progress we've made, I recently prepared a speech for the sales guys. We're up 10x where we were 5 years ago from $40-plus million to over $400 million for 2020. And by every indicator, one would say, wow, that is fabulous. And in our mind, as we look at it, the opportunity is bigger than what we've addressed. And we do need to build infrastructure, and we also need to look at doing things more creatively. I think, for example, the Japan partnership with Terumo, whereby we're really letting a partner take our business in that country that is a medical technology leader in that geography is going to be a great business model for us to watch and look at.  In France, we get reimbursement for a group of patients. We will invest some there. But we have other international models we're looking at. We literally break down every country in a type of bucket. There's great reimbursement here. Here's how we need to attack this one. There's no reimbursement here, and we're making plans across all the geographies. Another key investment internationally is going to be our e-commerce platform. We've had great results every place we've launched it, so in geographies where we're not. Where we go, we'll probably go first with an e-commerce platform going forward. And so we're investing on all fronts there. The Malaysia factory is truly an investment in scale for us. It will -- it's going to be ultra modern, as is our Arizona manufacturing facility, don't get me wrong. But we've learned a tremendous amount in building out Arizona that we can apply to Malaysia and really put ourselves in a position to whereby we can go after these businesses. One of the things that we often discuss, as we sit and discuss the what have, should have, could haves, and for a better part, 1.5 years, as far as capacity, we were selling everything we built. With the opportunity now, with the inventory we have and our ops team being able to build as much as they can, we think we can much more aggressively go after these international markets just on a commercial strategy basis as well, and we're going to going forward. Really, Jayson, nothing has changed. We are operating on schedule. We -- as I said, we completed our first pivotal study. And that certainly will provide us enough data to file for a CE Mark. We do not have enough data to file in the U.S. for ICGM approval, and we're working on that with the studies we have ongoing and it will continue to go on for a while. Much of this is a function of regulatory time frame studies. COVID letting us in the clinics, yes or no. There's still some uncertainty around just pulling off the execution necessary to get the submissions prepared, the abilities of the entities to review it. So we're marching to our schedule. At the end of the day, we've never been more bullish on a product. I've spoken with investigators and patients who run our first studies, and they're -- look, they're done with G6 now. They do not want to wear it anymore, and we told them they have to go back. It is everything that we'd hoped it would be. Anything that G6 does, G7 will do better. And for now, it's just a question of timing, commercial availability, manufacturing. And we're pretty tight lipped on these milestones as well. I'm just not going to lay out the yellow brick road for everybody to know and see and prepare for. We kind of like to surprise a few people. Thank you. That's a great question. And we have worked very hard to preserve that legacy and that culture and hire the same quality of individuals. I'm actually preparing for our virtual national sales meeting coming up here in a couple of weeks. In 2010, we had 26 territories. And we're going to 260. And of those 26 territories, you'd be amazed at how many of those people are still here. So they are still a big influence on our company, on our culture and training and teaching the new people that come in what's important to DexCom and what are our values. At the same time, as the business is expanding rapidly, our culture has had to change from time to time. We've made moves over the years. For example, if I go back, we did away with having trainers in every territory in addition to a rep, which was different than everybody else in the industry. But we made that move and it proved very successful.  As we go to the pharmacy channel more as we get access easier, the job of our reps continues to evolve and change. And it's our job to provide them with tools to whereby these jobs are meaningful and rewarding, and they want to stay and they want to be with us. And we're working very hard on that in this expansion. And we're being very thoughtful about it. We had many thousand candidates for these jobs and really feel we picked some fantastic people, not only for the field positions, but for some of the leadership positions that were opened up as well. We look forward to meeting with the group and being with them, and we have high expectations. Well, I don't even know there's a disconnect, Danielle, and we talked about this a lot before we decided to run the ad. And we decided that running the ad, and I'm going to get to this a little bit in my closing remarks. But running the ad, creating more awareness, getting more people on the technology and more demand would actually lead to more accessibility and ultimately lower cost for patients and get more product to them. But if you look at the life of our patients, buying insulin, buying CGM, if they have a -- an insulin delivery system, these people spend a lot of money. And it's a large percent of their income, and it's hard. It's just hard. We empathize with those people. We've done our best with our pharmacy ship, for example. And when we gave some of these statistics at Investor Day, I think somewhere above 30% of our pharmacy patients have zero co-pay. And another group of them have less than $60 a month on their co-pay. So we've done what we can to bring costs down on our side. And we've not only done it bringing costs down, but we've done it while improving our margins. So we've really done the best we can here. We do think it is important to acknowledge the community and listen to them, but we also have to run a business. And ultimately, we felt by making more people aware, we'd have a much more positive effect than negative. Well, I'm going to hold Steve to the standard of when he made the investment in tandem many years ago. And our return was several times. No, I'm just kidding. We will focus on diabetes technologies a bit because that's what we do. And there are things in this diabetes or in this health care world that can utilize our technology that we don't have time to develop, that we need to look at and be friendly with and we have capital that we can invest. We will also look at other things that could fit into our business and our technology. I don't see us going and acquiring share interest in 50 different companies that are all over the place. But I do see us with a very focused approach. As far as the level of funding, as I've chatted with our Board, we're going to leave that open right now for the opportunities that we see and dip our foot in the water and get going. But we think we have some really good opportunities to give us platforms to expand our business over time and help some of these companies grow. Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything else? Joanne, I would just say it is a competitive landscape and will remain competitive. We're -- both us, Amit and quite frankly, Medtronic, every -- all companies are aggressive here. We'll continue to push. We've done very well in all of our markets. We see opportunities to do better. We see opportunities for improvement across the board. We'll continue to do that. I think our Super Bowl ad really achieved the result that we were looking for as far as creating awareness. I mean, you heard, 11x more searches than the average ad. We have an opportunity to drive some awareness, and we will do that. But it is a very competitive landscape, and it's not going to change. And we're up for it. We have no problem with that. It makes everybody better. The way we structure the teams out in the field is very much based upon the number of people with diabetes and intensive insulin users that they see. And that information is already available through the IQVIA data as far as insulin prescriptions in the various territories. And we use that -- those geographies and that data to determine how we structure the territories and where we put our people. The people in their territories will be responsible for all of the medical professionals within that group, and they will continue to do that. I'm trying to think, is there -- if there is another part to his question. Yes, and we structured it similar to how we've done it in the past. We have regions and districts within the sales organization.  We've increased the number of districts, the number of regions from 2 to 4. And so similar structure that way. And then we've worked out a comp plan that we think is very fair for everybody, and our guys are willing to live with. I think the most interesting piece for me in laying out the whole sales force expansion was how it was received by our team in the beginning. You're always wary of that when you start. Instead, the team raised our hands and said, we need more help. We need more exposure here. This is a good thing. There are people we don't call on. So we look forward to it. And as far as time, it takes everybody time to get acclimated to a new position, a new territory. For those who have diabetes relationships, for example, if you hire somebody from an insulin company or an insulin pump company, they can go back to offices they've already been to, and they're up and running quite quickly. For others, it takes more time. And that's why we have our district managers and our regional managers to help with those relationships and train those people. So there is a time. It varies based on the experience level of the rep before they start with us. Some hit the ground running and go faster than the one before. Others, it takes a little time. And we monitor that and we watch and go give those more training that need it. So it will be fun to watch unfold. You go first. I'll go after you. Yes. Thanks, Quentin. And let me add just a bit. As I look at volumes and why hundreds of millions rather than tens. As we look at the use of CGM, for example, as a diagnostic for somebody who may have prediabetes but may not be sure as part of the annual checkup, there's hundreds of millions of people in the U.S. who would need that checkup every year. As you look at 30 million people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S., I don't know if my 30 million is right, but it's close. If just 10% of those people went on sensors full time, you're looking at 60 million to 90 million sensors we'd be selling on an annual basis. These opportunities are going to require scale. And we've just made the decision going at this in a manner to whereby we do it gradually and hope we have enough when we get there. It's just not going to work. The opportunities are too big and the investment is required. That's why we've raised the money. That's why we've made the plans. That's why we've designed the product and set the relationships that we have. We need to go after this. And when you look at the size of the investment versus the size of the prize, size of the prize is way bigger than the size of the investment. Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that one, too. Their focus will initially be on insulin-using patients who have reimbursement for the technology. The non-insulin users will, in fact, tag along as they become aware, and there are situations where some of these patients who have coverage. On the type 2 nonintensive patient, we've been very clear from the beginning that we're going to go about that -- this market 4 different ways: through programs, payers, clinicians, and then directly to patients. And over the course of 2021, you will see those 4 initiatives unfold as we gather more data and launch more initiatives. And so awareness will grow. As Quentin said earlier, and Steve, a very reasonable number of our leads from the Super Bowl ad have been type 2 non-intensive patients. Whether we can serve them or not with reimbursement today remains to be seen, but we certainly have a database of these names on people we can call on. As soon as we have the product offering, we want to get in that space ready. So I think we're preparing and getting ready for that. More importantly, though, as we make these clinicians aware, they can look for cases where they can make it available to their patients. They can look at situations where somebody can appeal for coverage if they have type 2 diabetes and out of control, and those appeals have been successful. So we're looking forward to going there and -- but these guys will focus on our core markets and where we play with reimbursement, first and foremost. Yes. We really can't lay that out for 2020. I think the way you'll get more visibility from us, as our programmatic approaches take off, you'll -- we'll be able to speak about revenues from the programs. Additionally, as you look out to 2023, it's my belief and attention on '23, '24 and '25, this will be a product that is distributed through our typical distribution channels, and there will be visibility that way. When we have meaningful revenues to report, we'll certainly let you know that that's going on. But we don't -- right now, these are more investments than they are our revenue opportunities. We need to gather data. We need to show that this works. We need to create relationships like we have at Intermountain Health care, for example, where they're running a study right now to look at CGM in these patients in a couple of different ways. The program we talked about that we ran down in Florida internally is now part of one of our programs where Healthstats is offering CGM to their type 2 patients. Up to this point, even though there's been volumes created here, a lot of this stuff has just been really to invest and to learn, similar to what we did in the hospital business this year as well. It's going to take a while for these markets to develop. But eventually, we'll break it down and report more. But for now, we're just not ready to. Thank you. I did a bit of math while we were doing this call. This is my 40th call with Steve. And as he moves into a new role, I just need to acknowledge what a wonderful job he's done with our investors over the years. I think back at our calls in the early years, where we'd sit around and go, okay, what is it we're going to say today and what is it we have to report. This company has changed so much over those 40 calls. A marvelous effort and some incredible work, and he'll still be here, but he's going to have some different investors to please, and we're excited about that.  I do want to thank everybody for being on the call today. As you can tell, we remain extremely bullish about our opportunities going forward. One of our executives was having a conversation with me here one day and he said, the way he described DexCom is just as soon as we climb one mountain, we get to the top of it. And on the other side, there's a bigger one, and we start another climb. And I think as Quentin detailed our financial plans and what we have going on, what we see is a great big mountain and a great big climb. And we're preparing to do that. We think we can do it very effectively. We are very bullish about the future. Over the past several days, a lot of the talk has been around the Super Bowl commercial here. And I have gotten numerous pictures, videos, e-mails, text messages from our patients and their parents or their caregivers saying thank you for creating awareness. Kids in school are telling everybody, remember that commercial, I wear that.  And I have that, and this is how I manage my diabetes. We have seen such a positive reception to this, and the positive energy has just been amazing. So kudos to our marketing team, to Nick Jonas and everybody for getting this done. Our hospital initiatives and the new initiatives we've talked about. As I said, there are investments, but now we're getting numerous physicians reaching out saying, you've got to get this everywhere. It needs to be all throughout the hospital. It needs to be worn by the patients when they go home. We can't have them coming back, and monitoring glucose can be very important. We'll continue to go after those efforts. Our new market efforts are very strong.  And last, I'll go to the intensive type 2s as well. As I said, we created some awareness here. I recently had a conversation. I've had several conversations with people with type 2 diabetes absolutely struggling with what to do. What can I possibly do to take care of myself because they just don't know. And CGM tells them. It tells them what to do. It tells them about foods. It tells them about exercise. It tells them about stress and sleep and everything else. And we are really excited for this opportunity. You'll see us have a lot of good things come to pass in 2021 on all these fronts. But thanks, everybody, for continuing to listen. And great day, great year for DexCom and our team. Thanks, everybody."

            "content": "Thanks, Quentin. As Kevin mentioned, our team did a great job executing on our strategic priorities throughout 2020. We quickly adapted the changes brought about by COVID and ensured not only that our existing patients could rely on their DexCom supplies, but that thousands of new patients could benefit from the use of G6. In fact, we closed the year with greater than 900,000 customers globally, up more than 38% over the end of 2019.  We are excited by this growth, knowing the life-changing impact at CGM and the software tools that we provide with it can have on our patients. Just last month, we published 3 peer review studies in diabetes technology and therapeutics that showed a greater than 1 point A1c reduction for customers new to DexCom CGM in as little as 3 months. This study includes both type 1 and type 2 intensive insulin users, and the result validated the kind of outcomes we have seen before. But we took it one step further.  We also saw a significant quality of life improvement for these patients as measured in terms of anxiety, emotional distress and burden of disease management, results that affirm our corporate mission to empower our users. We also demonstrated that the software tools we are building around our sensors are driving improved outcomes.  Across our base, we see increased time in range for our users of real-time share and follow apps. We see increased time and range for users who engage with our Clarity software, and we see increased time and range for users who take advantage of our integration with Apple's Siri Virtual Assistant. In 2021, we will continue to work aggressively to expand our customer base so that more and more people can experience these improved outcomes with DexCom.  As we outlined in our recent Investor Day and at a conference presentation last month, we prioritized 3 pillars of growth in the near term and look forward to progress on all 3 fronts in 2021 while we also lay the foundation for longer-term market expansion.  In our core business, which we define as people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy, we have several initiatives underway. In the U.S., we are nearing completion of our sales force expansion, which will enhance our footprint across the country, including our reach into primary care offices. We'll continue our push to prioritize the pharmacy channel, which is the most efficient channel for our patients, clinicians and DexCom. And we'll continue our efforts to drive greater access on the awareness of the benefits that DexCom offers, including the DTC campaigns that we've been driving in both the U.S. and international markets.  Outside the U.S., we continue to advocate for greater access in several key markets and look forward to broadening our reach in places where we have had little presence to date. This includes our expansion in France, building from a positive recent reimbursement decision as well as the launch of G6 in Japan with Terumo as our distribution partner.  For our third pillar, expanding the use of CGM in non-intensive type 2 diabetes, we are extending our efforts with level 2 and kicking off commercial pilots with multiple partners on the digital health side. Our work with other providers continues as well as we make the case for the clinical value of DexCom CGM in the broader type 2 population.  Recently, Everside Health, one of the nation's largest providers of on-site health clinics, announced that their health debt unit will make DexCom CGM available to their members with type 2 diabetes. This is a nice extension of our previous work with Healthstats following up on our pilot efforts that utilize CGM in an on-site health screening program. We remain increasingly confident in the market opportunity ahead for DexCom.  And on this basis, today, we announced the formation of DexCom Ventures. We have a chance to identify and accelerate the development of amazing technologies, technologies that can truly make an impact to global health outcomes via innovation. I could not be more excited to lead this effort. I believe we are well positioned to advance our strategies and build connections that will make DexCom stronger in the years ahead. Look for much more from us on this front over the next several years. And in the meantime, I couldn't be more pleased to pass the torch on our day-to-day strategy and corporate development efforts to Quentin and his team.  With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin. Yes. No, the only thing I would comment on is that we're very much approaching this as corporate venture capital, or I would tell you, kind of strategic venture capital. So certainly, while returns are important, although Kevin's holding me to a ridiculous standard out of the gate. Returns aside, look, you're going to see us investing in opportunities that are not only seeking out financial returns but could have some sort of a technology development piece or an in-licensing of technology piece or potentially commercial aspect to it. So they'll all make sense. Many of them you guys won't actually have visibility into unless and until we disclose them, but it's an exciting next step for me."

            "name": "Quentin Blackford",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  We reported worldwide revenue of $568.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $462.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, representing growth of 23%. Our team did a great job maintaining momentum with new patient additions in the fourth quarter and accelerating our shift of the business into the pharmacy channel.  Even with the increasing COVID lockdowns as the quarter progressed, new patients for the fourth quarter were in line with our original expectations for the year, a new record and a great achievement for our team. U.S. revenue grew 20% over the fourth quarter of 2019, totaling $451 million. We were able to drive more volume into the pharmacy channel than we originally expected, closing the year approaching 50% of our total U.S. commercial volume. This means that we are making excellent progress to position the company for long-term growth in the U.S. and an efficient operating model for the company. And while there is channel mix causing lower revenue per patient in the pharmacy channel, the underlying strength of the business saw fourth quarter unit volumes grow significantly more than our revenue growth rate in the U.S.  Our international business reached a new high-water mark of $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, growing 35% over the fourth quarter of 2019. This growth includes strong performance in both our direct and distributor markets. We began an international DTC campaign in several of our markets in the fourth quarter and will continue to drive awareness of the benefits of our technology, knowing that CGM market penetration internationally remains even less than in the U.S.  Our fourth quarter gross profit was $399.1 million or 70.2% of revenue compared to 66.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 70.2% of revenue represents our highest gross margin quarter in the past 5 years. This is another demonstration of the ability of our team to navigate our strategic shift to the pharmacy channel while delivering strong profitability across the organization.  As Kevin noted, our successful scale-up of G6 has been a key driver of this margin expansion while also placing us in our strongest inventory position to date, allowing us to more aggressively target new users as we continue in 2021.  Operating expenses were $294.7 million for Q4 2020 compared to $205.7 million in Q4 2019. The year-over-year expense growth in the fourth quarter consists of several key areas of strategic investment, which includes roughly $15 million of nonrecurring spend related to enhancing our software development efforts and automation of our production capabilities. We also increased spending related to our DTC programs, product sampling and the expansion of our U.S. sales force. Even with significant investments throughout 2020 to prepare DexCom for future growth and efficiency, total operating expense growth for the year totaled 26%, well below our 31% revenue growth for the year.  Operating income was $104.4 million or 18.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $103.6 million or 22.4% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. For the year, we delivered more than 500 basis points of operating margin expansion, with full year 2020 operating margin of 16.6%, exceeding our most recent guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was $159.2 million or 28% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $141.7 million or 30.6% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.3% also exceeded our most recent guidance and came in more than 300 basis points better than our original 2020 guidance.  As our margin progress shows, the significant steps that we have taken over the past few years are having a great impact on our ability to translate revenue growth into profitability. We are confident that the trend will continue over the long term as we move towards the 5-year targets that we laid out for you at our recent Investor Day by simultaneously taking opportunities that arise to invest in the growth ahead of us.  Net income for the fourth quarter was $90.4 million or $0.91 per share. We significantly increased operating cash flow in 2020 and remain in a strong cash position with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as we exit the year. This gives us the flexibility to pursue the strategic investments that we believe will allow us to maintain a leadership position in our field. These include some of the investments we discussed related to our fourth quarter activities.  Turning to 2021 guidance. As we stated early last month, we anticipate full year revenues of $2.21 billion to $2.31 billion, representing growth of 15% to 20%. We expect new patient growth to continue to exceed our revenue growth rate again in 2021, with our team extending their efforts to drive U.S. commercial business into our preferred pharmacy channel. We've also contemplated potential benefits from our efforts to drive category awareness through our expanded sales force, DTC advertising, product sampling and integrated systems as well as general considerations around the competitive environment.  Turning to margins. We have several considerations in 2021 as we position the business for efficient growth and long-term margin expansion, in line with what we outlined at our recent Investor Day. For 2021, we anticipate gross margins of approximately 65%, in line with our long-term expectations. This anticipates a slight shift from our 67% full year 2020 results, which we expect to be driven by the success of our pharmacy channel initiative as well as our 2021 investments in infrastructure related to our G7 scale up and OUS manufacturing facility in Malaysia.  We expect operating margins of approximately 13%, reflecting our gross margin outlook as well as various investments we've contemplated in 2021. As you know, DexCom has advanced its profitability profile at a much faster pace than originally anticipated over the past few years, while at the same time, building the infrastructure to scale the business profitably.  With the diabetes market still underpenetrated, we're going on the offense with these investments. We are continuing to invest in the growth of the business via DTC, sampling, new markets and the launch of new products that we mentioned at our Investor Day, including G7. We are also making a significant investment in the global sales force, including doubling the size of our U.S.-based commercial field team. We will also continue to work on advanced research and development, which is looking into future generations of products and sensing capability. We're making these investments to accelerate our ability to bring CGM to those in need. Additionally, we believe these investments will support the long-term profitability objectives that we set at Investor Day, while at the same time, yielding significant returns for our shareholders.  However, in the near term, we want to be prudent about incurring these upfront costs in our guidance and let the benefits play out. We expect that adjusted EBITDA margins will be approximately 23% for 2021.  Finally, with the release of the valuation allowance on income taxes in 2020, in 2021, we will start to have a tax rate that is applicable to earnings. We expect that rate, absent any changes in tax law, to be in the low to mid-20% range. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update. Sure. Thanks, Robbie. Look, I think the first thing I would mention is we've made incredible progress from a profitability perspective over the last couple of years. If you think back to our original Analyst Day, we set an expectation to be at a 25% EBITDA margin by the year 2023, and we delivered 26% EBITDA margin in the year 2020. So we've made incredible progress. And I would say progress even accelerated or went beyond what our original expectations were. But we've always known there are investments we've got to make in this business to open up some of these incredible market opportunities that sit in front of us. And I think more than anything, the fact that we're making these investments ought to be a testament to the fact that we now believe in, and we're seeing that these are going to be real opportunities for us. So we're excited about making that investment.  On the gross margin side, there's a few things to point out this year that makes 2021 a little bit unique. One, we will continue to drive the normal efficiencies and leverage through the gross margin that we have in the last several years. And I would expect there's a couple of hundred basis points of efficiencies to continue to take out of it over the course of '21. But there's 2 headwinds that we have to navigate through. One continues to be the move to the pharmacy channel. We expect that we'll see a significant move over the course of this year. We've seen that pick up in terms of its momentum in the back part of last year. The other one is we're making significant investment in standing up our first international manufacturing capability in Malaysia. We broke ground there. We have teams there as we speak starting to build out that capability, which is going to take -- it is tens of millions of units of production capacity and turns it into hundreds of millions of units of production capacity for us, which we believe is going to be necessary as we open up these markets and begin to really see results from them. So that's what's going to play out on the gross margin side that results in a couple of hundred basis points of headwind from the 67% back to 65%.  On the OpEx side, I think it's important. G&A is going to continue to lever nicely for us. Where the investment is going is purely in the sales expense and into R&D, and there's really a few drivers that drive it. There's the doubling of the U.S. commercial field force that we've talked about. That's pretty much done as we sit here today. Those resources are going to be in place and able to start to contribute over the course of the year, but they obviously bring with it an expense load. We're also turning up the DTC efforts. We've never been better positioned from an inventory perspective to really turn the dials on DTC and sampling and giving our commercial team the tools they need to be as effective as possible. So we're excited to be able to do that.  And then finally, I'll just remind you, over the course of this year, we've got all the G7 expenses that are going on. We got the trial expenses, we got the filing expenses, and then we got the commercial launch behind that as well. So all those things together drive the incremental investment from an OpEx perspective. But that's all going to show up in R&D and selling expense. You will see leverage in G&A. So I hope that answers the question for you. Yes. Great question. 10%, 10 points of headwind is the right way to think about it, primarily driven by that pharmacy channel mix shift that continues to move towards the direction that is important for us to be able to scale the business over the long term. I'd remind you, profit dollars are higher in that channel. But yes, there is some gross margin pressure that comes with it. But from a top line perspective, that's what's driving it is that pharmacy channel, call it, roughly 10 points. I do think you'll see that evolve a little bit over the course of the year. Keep in mind, in the first part of last year, we weren't into the pharmacy channel to the same degree that we were as we exited the year. So you've got a tougher comp in Q1 and Q2. And you see that in the growth rates as well. You're going to see tougher growth comps in the first half of '21 that will start to subside in the back half of the year.  So I do think that you'll see that evolve a bit as we start to anniversary some of the pharmacy shift that we saw in the back part of '20 into the back part of '21. As we head into '22, look, we'll talk about that as we get out there around that time frame. But I do think there's a couple of years here of stepping through it. Once we're through it, I think you're going to see the unit volume growth of this business is going to be much more reflective of the overall dollar growth. Unit volume growth continues to be incredibly strong. We were up 40% in units in the fourth quarter by the time everything settled out. And our unit volume growth in '21 is right around that 25% to 30% growth. So very strong unit growth continue to drive the business. Yes. Well, I think we're incredibly excited and bullish on the future opportunities. But at the same time, our approach has always been we want to see those start to pan out and contribute. And at that point, we'll start to reflect them into guidance. So as we open up some of these new markets and validate that we're able to generate the revenue from them, then hopefully, we've got some very positive updates for you guys over time. I don't think we could be more excited around where we're making these investments. We know for a fact the type 2 intensive space, for example, is going to come on to CGM therapy. We're seeing it happen in our results right now. We're starting to see some of it with the nonintensive. As a matter of fact, if you look at our new patient figures, it's led by type 2 patients. So we're starting to see some of that be validated. But in order to reach those patients, for example, on the sales force side, we've got to be in the primary care physician offices. That's where those patients are seen and that's where our current commercial force does not really play. And so as we've added those resources, that is going to be their primary focus, their primary target.  Similarly, on the DTC side. I'll continue to reiterate, there's not a better investment that we make inside the 4 walls of DexCom today than our DTC efforts. And the returns that we see with the new patients that come out of it, we're very confident that that's the best investment we can possibly make. Now will that return on investment per individual or per patient start to step down into the future? It may as they get harder to bring on. Basically, for the time being, we've been very encouraged by that return that we've seen, and we'll continue to pour resources in there until we see that change. So I don't think there's a better place for us to be focusing our efforts right now than to really be building out the commercial force to see the right individuals where the patients are at and to continue to create awareness for these patients as well. Yes, David, thanks for the question. Look, I think my takeaway is, I think we all see the market opportunity exactly the same way. There's incredible runway sitting in front of us. There's a lot of adoption yet to be had in the intensive segments of the market and the nonintensive is going to open up as well. Our approach to the guidance is probably a little bit different and unique, which is we're very bullish on some of these new market opportunities and contributions that can come from them, but we're not going to get ahead of ourselves with respect to those expectations as they play out. Over time, if that happens in '21, then fantastic. It's going to be a terrific result. If it comes a bit later in '22, it's still going to be a great result. At the end of the day, we're very confident in what this ultimately has the potential to look at -- look like, and we're going to make the investments to ensure it's a reality for us. But at the same time, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves. So I think more than anything, you've got 2 players in this space who are incredibly bullish on the opportunity, which just validates there's a lot of runway here and a lot of opportunity for all of us to have success together. Yes. Well, I would -- Ravi, it's a great question. I'd remind you, the $4 billion to $4.5 billion revenue figure we put out there out in 2025 or so was more or less our base case. That's how we qualified that to you folks. And it started to open up a bit of the type 2 nonintensive opportunity, but there's a massive market that sits in front of us. And as we open that up in bigger ways, as you start to open up things like hospital or gestational or get further upstream into the diabetes condition and get into prediabetes, those volume numbers are incredible. And so I mentioned earlier, we're talking about going from tens of millions of units to hundreds of millions of units of capability over time, and we're beginning to make those investments as we speak.  In terms of the CapEx investment, I think you're going to see roughly double this year what we've seen in the last couple of years. We've seen about $200 million of CapEx in the last 2 years each year. I think that is going to be north of $400 million, probably as we stand up this building and build out the capability that will then service for years to come into the future. How quickly we're ramping that is really going to be predicated on how quickly we open up some of these markets. What we're not going to do, and we've been very clear about this after having learned from the experience ourselves when we launched G6, we're not going to put ourselves in a position again to where we don't have the inventory to deliver to the patient and create a DexCom experience that is one that we want them to have. And so we are investing ahead of that curve, but we're very confident that the curve is ultimately going to be realized. I think the question is just nailing down that timing and know exactly what that's going to look like. From our perspective, we're going to be ready when it's ready to go. We're not going to be behind it, so... Yes. Well, I think when you look at the overall investment in the areas you identified, the most significant increase is likely going to show up in doubling the size of that commercial field force. And then right behind it is DTC and sampling. Sampling is a bit new to us. We've never sampled historically. We just started to roll that out in the fourth quarter and very early in seeing what that looks like. But that's a pretty easy one for us to measure. We're not going to give you the specific results of what that looks like. Although the fact that we're going to continue to double down on it should tell you that we're incredibly happy with what we're seeing. But that's as easy as knowing exactly where we're dropping the samples in the field and knowing exactly what patients are utilizing those samples, and ultimately, turn into a recurring purchase for us. So those are easy measures. And on the DTC side, with social media and the leads that get created from that, that ultimately turn into patients, that becomes relatively easy to measure as well. One of the things that I think was just really fascinating coming out of the Super Bowl ad is that we had 5x more impressions in the last 4 days than we had it for the entire year of 2020 on the heels of that. I think it's just remarkable the type of reach that we're finding with our DTC efforts. So we're going to continue to monitor those things and measure those and hold ourselves accountable to them. And as long as the return is there, we're going to continue to invest aggressively there. If we see the returns start to drop down, then we'll start to think differently. But we're not going to give specific return measures, those sorts of things. But the fact that we're doubling down in these efforts, I think, ought to convey the confidence we have in these investments and what they're bringing to us. Well, look, Bob, I think it's a good question. But historically, I think we've seen opportunities sit in front of us. And we knew they were available to us, but we couldn't aggressively pursue them because we knew we couldn't get patient to the -- our product to the patient once they became aware of the opportunity. So what you didn't want to do is create all this awareness and then be in a back order situation immediately. And if you go back to 2019, we operated through most all of '19 in a back order situation. We came out of that early in '20 which has now allowed us to build inventories and put ourselves in a position where we can start to get more aggressive with these things. So I think it enables a whole lot of opportunities for us to get a whole lot more strategic than where we could historically just because those opportunities weren't real. We couldn't serve the patient at that point in time. Now we can. Yes. Good question. In 2021, there's about 200 basis points of pressure that we're going to realize from the investments in standing up that Malaysia operating capability. So I think that quantifies for you very clearly what it will be. As we look out into the future, we've said we believe we can get the cost profile to less than $10 per day in a 10-day use case. So think about that as less than $1 per day. Malaysia will certainly be below that, offset by where we're at in the states. So it certainly is a very attractive profile for us. And as we continue to think about ways to innovate there with automation, we're hopeful to take it even further. But that's a big enabler of ultimately getting our cost profile down to those ranges we've discussed both here today and in the past."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Sean Christensen. Sean Christensen, you may begin.\nSean Christensen: Thank you, operator, and welcome to DexCom's third quarter 2020 earnings call. Our agenda begins with Kevin Sayer, Dexcom's Chairman, President and CEO, who will provide a summary of the quarter; followed by a financial review and outlook from Quentin Blackford, our COO and CFO; and then a strategic update from Steve Pacelli, our Executive Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development.

Please refer to the tables in our earnings release and the slides accompanying our third quarter earnings presentation for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Well, we've got a bit different rate over the past 24 hours compared to our usual earnings reports, but I am very glad to be with you today. Most of you probably saw that we pre-announced revenue after market close yesterday, in conjunction with the announcement of the retirement of Rick Doubleday, our Chief Commercial Officer. I'll have more to say about Rick and what is accomplished later in this call. We chose to provide the revenue pre-announcement in order to remove any market uncertainty about the strength of our business in conjunction with our notification of Rick's retirement. Our strong third quarter results reflect the resilience of our business and the importance of DexCom CGM to our growing customer base, even as the world continues to navigate the challenges prevented by the COVID pandemic. Based on this performance, we are pleased to be in a position once again to raise our 2020 revenue guidance in the year-end. Total revenue grew 26% in the third quarter, driven by our strong new patient growth over the past year. This patient growth continued in the third quarter with our pharmacy and Medicare channels, exhibiting the strongest growth in the quarter. We continue to see some impact to new patients relative to our expectations as a result of the pandemic. However, as our updated guidance indicates, the impact was not as significant as we expected and communicated on our second quarter call. We also officially introduced our patient assistance program at the start of the third quarter, extending our support to our customers who have lost coverage during this trying time. We saw a small handful of people utilized the program during the quarter, but it did not have a material impact on our performance. We've made excellent progress on the access front with nearly all people with type 1 diabetes in the U.S., now having access to DexCom CGM as well as a quickly increasing amount of people with type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy. We recently entered into a government wide contract for the sale of DexCom CGM through eligible government buyers, including the VA. This contract will facilitate easier and more convenient access to CGM as it may allow for pharmacy access to DexCom CGM for eligible veterans. Another example of how we're making it easier for patients to take control of their diabetes at an affordable price. In addition, our team is doing great work to expand access outside of the U.S., including the recent publication of our U.K. cost effectiveness study that showed the clear economic benefits associated with use of DexCom CGM. Based on studies like these, we are hopeful that we will be able to drive near-term access wins on behalf of people with diabetes with government payers on a global basis. With customer feedback related to G6 continuing to trend at record levels, we have several initiatives underway to extend the DexCom growth opportunity and bring DexCom CGM to more people who stand to benefit from enhanced knowledge of their glucose levels. For our intensive business, many of you likely saw our press release with Eli Lilly earlier this month, announcing our co-marketing efforts of our G6 CGM with Lilly's new ultra rapid-acting insulin. This collaboration is a great example of our strong partnership with the Lilly team and should provide a nice boost to our efforts to extend awareness of Dexcom CGM among practicing clinicians, including primary care physicians. We are making great progress in our efforts to extend DexCom CGM to nonintensive type 2 customers as well. Intermountain Healthcare recently published the results of their first pilot using DexCom CGM, which demonstrated annual cost savings of approximately $5,000 per member for DexCom users relative to standard of care fingersticks. We are thrilled to say the large expansion of this trial with Intermountain is now well underway. We are excited about our work with UnitedHealth as they extend their rollout of the Level 2 program. Although it is still early in the commercial rollout, our teams are working together very well to ensure the kind of patient experience that we expect for any users of our CGM systems. We continue to support hospitals and help protect patients and frontline workers during the pandemic, with more than 200 hospitals reaching out to us about DexCom CGM during this crisis. We remain focused on generating evidence to potentially expedite approval for the use of CGM for patient monitoring. Along these lines, early feedback on the performance of our CGM has been positive, including several recently published articles documenting use of the product during the pandemic. In September, we also announced the creation of a hospital registry to allow us to collect data on DexCom CGM performance efficiently during this time.  As we press forward these initiatives with a great customer satisfaction with G6, our teams internally are intently focused on the next steps with G7. We commenced approval support trials for G7 in mid-October. This timing remains consistent with our previous discussions around the impact of COVID to our clinical trial timeline. Although all of us are eager for you to experience G7, we are committed to doing this in the right way and ensuring that the trials are run efficiently and that we bring to market a product that delivers a best-in-class customer experience for DexCom users. We expect to launch G7 into several key markets during the second half of 2021. Given the growth of the business and our expanding patient base, the expansion of G7 into all of our core markets will likely extend it in 2022 as we continue to scale manufacturing to support these markets in the right way. There is one change to G7 from our previous discussions. After extensive evaluation in several premarket studies, we have made the decision to launch G7 versus a 10-day product with a clear pathway to extend the wear duration shortly. Our customers' lives are heavily dependent upon DexCom CGM, and we have high standards to ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers. For example, while our 15-day configuration demonstrates survival rates in the 70% plus range, we don't believe this is good enough for our patients. With that, I will turn it over to Quentin for a financial review.\nQuentin Blackford: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2020, we reported worldwide revenue of $529 million, compared to $396.3 million for the third quarter of 2019, representing growth of 26% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Our U.S. business maintained strong performance in the third quarter despite facing the toughest quarterly comparison for all of 2020 as we lap the 53% growth in the third quarter of 2019. The U.S. revenue totaled $398.6 million for the quarter, compared to $308.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, representing growth of 29%. All three of our channels contributed to the year-over-year growth in the U.S. with pharmacy and Medicare standing out as the strongest contributors, in line with our strategic emphasis and our efforts to streamline access for our customers over the last several years. Our Net Promoter Scores approached record levels amongst our users, and in particular, our Medicare customers including those with Type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy, a testament to the simplicity of our DexCom G6 system in the value of real-time CGM knowledge. Our international business grew 17% versus the prior year in the third quarter to $102.3 million and increased 21% on a sequential basis from the second quarter. The impact of the COVID pandemic on new patient starts continue to be felt more acutely in our international markets, especially as some of our core international markets have experienced increased case rates toward the end of summer and into the fall. This is primarily in those markets that have higher administrative requirements to access the technology, which are much more difficult with COVID related restrictions. However, in markets where administrative burdens are limited, we continue to see strong growth and momentum with the U.K. and Canada, especially standing out. In addition, we are continuing to benefit from the increased manufacturing capacity that we've driven over the past year, enabling us to extend the G6 offering to additional international markets, including our most recent launches into Belgium and Turkey at the start of the fourth quarter. Our third quarter gross profit was $340.7 million or 68% of revenue compared to 62.3% of revenue in the third quarter of 2019. Despite the increased pricing pressure that we have been talking about, this represents our highest quarterly gross margin since we launched G6 in 2018. Our teams have done a terrific job designing cost out of our products and manufacturing processes in addition to driving greater manufacturing efficiencies as volume continues to increase. We are more excited than ever about where we believe we can take the cost profile of our products over time, further enabling our ability to successfully navigate the lower pricing environment that accompanies are pushed to enable easier access to our products for our customers through the pharmacy channel. Operating expenses were $245.7 million for Q3 2020 compared to $187.8 million in Q3 2019, in line with our previous commentary. This reflects an increase of approximately 170 basis points as a percent of sales as we invested into some of our key initiatives in the third quarter. The increased spend in research and development is primarily focused on the G7 clinical trials, in addition to finalizing manufacturing readiness in anticipation of our future G7 launch. Within sales and marketing, we are prioritizing our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts, given the continued momentum with CGM awareness and the adoption runway ahead. With the results of our early campaigns delivering an excellent return to DexCom. On a go-forward basis, we continue to anticipate an elevated level of operating expenses in the fourth quarter and into 2021, as we move forward with our G7 pivotal trials, manufacturing scale-up and direct-to-consumer efforts. Importantly, general and administrative expenses continue to lever nicely in the quarter. Operating income was $95 million or 19% of revenue in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $59.1 million or 14.9% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of 410 basis points in operating margin for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $146.9 million or 29.3% of revenue for the third quarter compared to $92.5 million or 23.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2019, an improvement of 600 basis points. Net income for the third quarter was $93.6 million or $0.94 per share. We closed the quarter in a great financial position with more than $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This leaves us with plenty of liquidity to continue our capacity expansion initiatives for G6 and G7 in conjunction with growing CGM demand, while also being opportunistic with our investment strategy as we contemplate the long-term growth potential for our technology. We continue to anticipate some volatility to new patients in the fourth quarter of the year as COVID-case rates rise and fall in certain of our areas of operations and the global economy fluctuates. But with the strong third quarter results, we are in a good position to once again raise our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. We now expect 2020 revenue to be approximately $1.9 billion, representing growth of 29% over 2019. This represents an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance and $150 million from the midpoint of our guidance at the outset of the year, despite the impact from COVID over the past two quarters. As Kevin mentioned, new patient starts came in slightly ahead of the levels that we anticipated for the second half of the year and communicated on our second quarter call, although they were still down relative to our pre-pandemic expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect new patient starts to be approximately 90% of our original expectations before the impact of COVID. Turning to margins. We now anticipate the following non-GAAP results to meet or exceed the following levels. Gross margins to meet or exceed 66%, representing an increase of approximately 300 basis points versus 2019, despite the pricing pressures that we have realized primarily as a result of our emphasis on the pharmacy channel. We expect operating margins to meet or exceed 16%, an increase of approximately 500 basis points from the prior year. Finally, we expect that adjusted EBITDA margins will expand to meet or exceed 26% for the year, also an increase of approximately 500 basis points from the prior year. Our margin profile is clearly reflecting the strong revenue growth over the past several years and our ability to drive strong operating leverage from our key strategic drivers. We have also benefited to a certain degree this year from some near-term operating expense benefits associated with COVID-related impacts to clinical trials, industry conferences and other normal work practices. We anticipate that some of the investments will begin to generate returns in the fourth quarter and in 2021. In addition, we will continue to invest to maximize our growth potential for the long-term and we believe that as COVID-related restrictions free up, there will be a return to spend in certain areas. So, while we expect the organization to continue to progress, the cadence of margin expansion may not continue at the same magnitude or with the same predictability as we've seen this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update.\nSteve Pacelli: Thank you, Quentin. Even with the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic in our communities, our focus at DexCom remains largely business as usual. This means that we are focused on our patients, striving to ensure that they are cared for, and empowered by DexCom CGM in this time where glucose control is as important as ever. This also means that our teams are focused on executing on our core strategic priorities to best position DexCom to capitalize on our growth opportunity. The significant capacity expansion that our teams have worked tirelessly for since the start of 2019, has left us in a great position to aggressively target new patients via different strategic marketing pathways, including enhanced direct-to-consumer marketing and as of very recently, the ability to offer product samples to health care providers so that their patients can experience firsthand the benefits of DexCom CGM. While we are being strategic about these investments in light of the impact of COVID, our inventory position has us well positioned to take advantage of these new opportunities and provide full support to the efforts of our field sales force. In September, we announced a new five-year research collaboration with the University of Virginia, my own mater, of course. This agreement enables additional resources for our Charlottesville team as we look to innovate our artificial pancreas algorithm technology. We look forward to developing additional tools to offer our pump and smart pen partners to simplify the experience of managing diabetes for our collective customers. We'll also use the collaboration to advance our data analytics capabilities and research programs as we demonstrate the clinical value of DexCom CGM for customers for customers outside of our core intensive insulin-using population. This includes our efforts in non-intensive type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, pregnancy, and the hospital market. We are making good progress in our efforts to extend the use of DexCom CGM to the broad type 2 population. This includes continued traction in our type 2 intensive segment, where the recent VA contract adds to our significant reimbursement progress thus far in 2020. With Medicare, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, The VA, and others now covering DexCom for the type 2 intensive population, we are confident that this will be a nice growth driver for the company and a great outcome for those with type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy. But we are equally excited about the work we are conducting demonstrate the value of DexCom CGM for the non-intensive type 2 community. In addition to our work with Level2 and Intermountain Healthcare, which Kevin mentioned, we will kick off commercial pilot programs with several of our key digital health partners in the fourth quarter. Our automated insulin delivery partnership strategy continues to support our growth and position DexCom to lead the shift toward connected devices for people with diabetes on intensive insulin therapy. Tandem's Control-IQ became the first automated insulin delivery system driven by DexCom technology earlier this year and has quickly generated great momentum for both companies and, more importantly, great outcomes for users of the system. As we drop closer to the start of 2021, we are excited for the anticipated launch of Insulet's Omnipod 5 system in the first half of next year. This represents another important step for DexCom as we will have systems commercially available that are arguably best-in-class solutions for both tube and patch pump technologies. And with our integration work with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Ypsomed progressing as well, we believe that DexCom is well-positioned to support our core markets for users of insulin pump and smart pen systems in the years ahead. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks Steve. As we head towards the collation of 2020, I want to take a moment to extend my gratitude to Rick Doubleday, our Chief Commercial Officer, who plans to retire at the end of this year and continue with us in a consulting role through 2021. Rick joined DexCom in 2009, leading our sales organization from approximately $49 million in sales in this first full year to the $1.9 billion that we're closing in on now. I can't think of many examples where a commercial leader has overseen companion growth of greater than 40% over a 10-year period. But that is what Rick has accomplished here at DexCom. He is a great leader and a great friend who has developed a solid plan to execute as we progress into 2021 and the launch of our G7 system. Rick has also worked extensively to develop a very talented commercial team. So we are in a great position as we press forward to execute on our goals in 2021 and beyond. So I hope you will join me in expressing appreciation for Rick's outstanding leadership at DexCom, and best wishes as he embraced his well-deserved time spent with his family. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Thank you and congrats on a nice quarter. Kevin, you know the topic de jure, that I think is the focus to most investors now is the competitive environment and the pricing environment, particularly between you and Abbott. You both have great products. It's a large market. We've got a lot of product updates, both from your competitor and today with G7, moving into trials here and a launch in second half of next year, now with a 10-day product. How should people think about the increasing -- I know I don't want to put the word out there, but similarity of the options from the 2 products and how to think about the ongoing price differential in the pharmacy? I know you've talked about this before, but I just think it's important to reiterate the answer here given the focus for investors? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: No. I appreciate that, Robbie. With respect to pricing, I think our results very clearly demonstrate how well we've managed this process as we moved a great deal of our business. Through the pharmacy channel, and I'm sure Quentin will get into that more later as we get into more questions. As you look at our margins as great as they are with volumes significantly higher than they were before and prices coming down. We've truly proven that we can scale here. So we definitely understand how that works. With respect to products and features and things of that nature, let me start with G6 before we move to G7. This is an incredible product and it has incredible features and has truly been a market leader. It has taken us a while to get up to scale manufacturing G6 and get the capacity that we need, and we have that now. And so we will push G6 very hard and very competitively until G7 gets here. G6 is what we have today. With respect to our future products, I can't speak to what our competitors have. I know what G7 is and what it does. There are many features in there. We have not shared with everybody that will delight the world. We went to the 10-day life for exactly the reasons I said on the call. And it really leads into what's going to be the differentiation. We did this because we want the patient experience to be what we committed to. We have learned in our extensive research, the most important thing for us is to deliver what we say. And as we were getting out to 15 days, particularly with our algorithm with that sensor, we saw too many of them not making it. And while it performed great at the longer time, it wasn't great enough for us. So we shortened the life for now. We're very confident with changes we can make to make it last longer. Where the difference will be over time and where we're investing significant resources is on the experience side. The concept that One CGM experience fits all is just not going to work going forward as you look at the AID systems. As you look at people that are Type 2 intensive insulin users, who have migrated to CGM later in life, they may want different information and different experience. I think as we get the physical features of the product, exactly where patients want them, and we're very comfortable with G7, what's going to be most important is delivering the experience that keeps them engaged and leads to better outcomes, and we're very confident that we can win that battle.\nSteve Pacelli: And Ravi, just to add on to that and hit on Kevin's point of the pharmacy, I think it's important for folks to recognize that in the pharmacy channel, our product is not priced all that differently from Libre with respect to what the patients coming out-of-pocket for. Greater than 70% of our patients are able to get on to our product at less than $60 per month, many of them with no out-of-pocket on a per month basis. So from a patient perspective it\u2019s price vary competitively.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a question on \u2013 I'm sorry to harp on the competitive landscape, but I'll ask more specifically, you saw growth in Europe did \u2013 was lower than, I believe, one of your competitors, and they did launch a competitive product and in Europe. And I guess, if you could give us a little bit of color on what's happening. If anything there is the first part of the question? The second part of the question is, just as a whole, you grew slower than the competitor that's been on top of mind for a lot of investors today. And I'm just curious if how much of that is supply constraint is being a little bit more constrained and not really pushing G6 as much as you could or will be doing in the future versus any real competitive dynamics here? Thanks so much.\nSteve Pacelli: Sure. Danielle, I'll take that. Let me hit OUS first. From an OUS perspective, our performance in the quarter was right in line with our expectations. I think if you go back and look historically at seasonal trends in that international business, Q3 is typically up around that 20% range, and we were up 21% sequentially this year in Q3 coming off of Q2. To b e a bit more clear with it, though, we certainly saw some mixed results at the country level. And in those countries where the patients required to be in the physician office to train on, to go through the administrative process through all the paperwork that's required, we certainly have seen that be a slower uptick in getting back to normal volumes in the midst of this COVID environment. Clearly, COVID has impacted the ability to be in the office. Contra to that, though, in markets where we have our e-commerce platform in place, for example, U.K., Canada, we're seeing record numbers of new patients coming on to our technology and just some tremendous growth there. So I really believe it's more a story of what the model looks like and how COVID is impacting that or not in terms of the patient's ability to get onto the product. And I think if you look across the competitive landscape, and you go back to some of the commentary that's been put out there over the course of the quarter, for those folks who are more focused in the IIT space, which happens to be where we're primarily focused today in our international business, I think you've heard them speak to some softness in the international business as well. So I think what you saw come together for us was right in line with what the market is seeing. We feel good about it. Again, it was in line with our expectations. To your point, in terms of growing overall at a slower rate than one of our competitors, I think you have to keep in mind, we're navigating through a price headwind right now as we start to step price down and move more into the pharmacy channel. And we're making terrific progress on that front, even a bit ahead of our expectations. And if you were to look at the third quarter, in particular, in the 26% revenue dollar growth that we put up, if you were to look at that on a unit volume perspective, I believe we put up market-leading unit growth in the quarter itself, growing nearly 40% from a unit perspective. That's better than anything else out in the marketplace right now. So I think when you adjust for price, which is a bit specific to us and you really look at patients and unit volume, I think we're putting up market leading performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blackman from Stifel. Your line is open.\nMathew Blackman: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. I wanted to touch on the comment on Steve about sampling. And if you indulge, I'll just have two intertwined questions on the topic. The first one is, how should we think about the potential impact of sampling on Type 2s versus Type 1s? Would you expect it to be more impactful for Type 2s than Type 1s? And then the follow-on to that is we actually did talk to a doc last week that I'll say very gruffly told us you had begun sampling his practice for the first time. And he said, you expected something like 50% conversion of his first, call it, 20 patients or so into paying customers. That sounds like that would be a home run if that was broadly true, but help us understand how you're going to measure success or ROI on this new initiative? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Well, this is Kevin. I will take that one. We're thrilled to be able to sample at this point in time. And to be doing it in a manner that we think can be very large scale for years, patients have wanted to try a Dexcom and see what they could do. And given our status with our direct business and all the things we're doing, there were constraints around our ability to do that. We've removed those constraints as we work through the distribution channel. We believe that it's going to affect patients across the board, not only Type 1s, but I think your comment on Type 2 intensive insulin users is a very good one. They might be a bit more resistant to the technology, because they've been dealing with diabetes longer. And gee, do I really want to do that. If you have the experience of wearing a G6 and having -- being able to see what happens, this becomes very easy. And so we're really excited about it. We expect the results to be good, if not fantastic. And if you look at the payback for us, you look at the revenue we get from a patient per year. If we convert 50% of these people to full-time use, that is beyond spectacular program. We don't even have to come close to that number for this to be a spectacular result for us. But I think the recognition and the ability for a physician to say, look, I have an answer for you. Let's try this. It's really important to us, and we think it's going to be a big initiative for us this year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Good afternoon all. I just wanted to weave a couple points into a single question, maybe we've been discussing recently some fairly tangible evidence that we think exist anyway that you guys might be looking to dramatically expand your sales force over the coming months. So what I'm wondering, I guess, more than anything is, one, is that true? Two, does Rick's departure at all signal maybe he wasn't on board with that or anything else in organization? And three, we don't typically think of sales reps in your business being a key driver of sales. So, what might be driving that plant expansion, if it is underway or plan to take place here over the coming months? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: I'll take that one. Let me address the Rick issue first. This has nothing to do with Rick deciding to retire. If anything, this -- all our sales efforts right now are Rick's plans, and he does get to see them through to the end of the year, while he'll be working with us through year-end. So, these events are completely unrelated. We are planning several things on the sales and marketing front over the next year. We won't reveal all of them. But what we do believe is we do need more coverage in the field, particularly as we look at the HCP community and those who are not endocrinologists as you get into primary care physicians who are seeing more and more of these patients. We need some access there, and we need some more feet out speaking to them. We're very cognizant of the return on our sales force has for us. And I would disagree with you, our sales team is great and they do provide a lot of benefit to our company. They are a great voice. And really our face of the company in many of these geographies. So, that I disagree with. We are fully on board with what we're going forward with and look forward to measuring the results of it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Can we pause a little bit on your comments regarding pricing versus unit volume? At one stage, I think we were looking at a little over $100 million headwind in terms of pricing in 2020. Is that sort of the same number that we're thinking about? And then the second part of that is, at what stage do you close the gap in pricing so that unit volume strength really shines through? Thank you.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes, Joanne, this is Quentin. As we spoke about price this year, just coming off of last quarter, for example, we were talking about $150 million in the business, so I think we were north of the $100 million you had referred to. That was something that was probably a year old, to be honest with you, as we were starting to navigate through it last year. So, it was a bit higher than that. As we've made terrific progress on the pharmacy side, we've actually seen price be a little bit more of a headwind than what that $150 million would have represented. I think it's going to be closer to $175 million for the year. We saw stronger price headwinds come through in Q3 that were embedded in that 26%. And obviously, if you do the unit volume at nearly 40%, you can kind of understand what the impact was in the quarter. But the majority of that is being realized as a result of us opening up that pharmacy channel, which we believe in the long-term, is the much better channel to be putting patients onto the product through for various reasons. It increases access, makes it easier for folks to get onto the product. And importantly, from a profitability perspective, over time, will be a much more profitable business model for us. And I think just looking at the quarter itself, seeing gross margin reach record levels of 68%, while the quarter represents the greatest amount of mix in that pharmacy channel just demonstrates our ability to really get after the cost profile of our product and compete in that segment quite aggressively. In terms of how long it takes to ultimately get to the price point or the mix of the pharmacy channel, we're not going to speak to that today. I think you're going to hear more from us as we get to our Analyst Day around just how far we are into that pharmacy channel and where we see that going, but we're making terrific progress. They're very happy with what we're seeing.\nOperator: And the next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDavid Lewis: Hey Quentin, just a follow-up there, just thinking about the fourth quarter guide, it basically kind of 20 points of momentum deceleration. That's probably five points heavier than you guided sort of into the fourth quarter last year. Anything you'd call out U.S. or ex-U.S. we should be thinking about in the fourth quarter and perhaps it just reflects, frankly, that incremental $25 million of price as you exit out the year? Thanks so much.\nQuentin Blackford: Yeah. Thanks, David. Let me talk through a little bit of the assumptions that we've made as we head into Q4. I think we continue to operate in an environment where there's not a great deal of clarity with respect to how COVID is ultimately going to impact the business. And we want to be prudent and thoughtful around how we set those expectations. First and foremost, as we move more and more business into the pharmacy model as well as the Medicare business continues to grow at a strong rate, the seasonal impact in the business is going to shift. You're not going to see nearly as much revenue show up in the fourth quarter as the patients no longer really incentivized to take advantage of a scenario where they might have already met their deductible and they're going to load up on product as they exit the year. So the seasonal trends in the business are going to look a little bit different as the mix in the business shifts. With respect to COVID in particular, our best estimate at this point in time is that we're going to see about a 10% impact to new patient starts in the fourth quarter. If we navigate that more successfully, then terrific, there's going to be some upside to the number, but that's our best estimate at this point in time. And then, I think that the other thing to consider is the fact that we put in place the patient assistance program that really hasn't had an impact on the overall results just yet. We saw it start to take place in Q3, but it didn't impact us in a material way, but if you think about it, that was put in place to help those patients who ended up being unemployed or just couldn't afford the product in general. And most of that started to happen back in the second quarter, as COVID really started to take place. And if you think through that scenario, we've got patients who would go on to COBRA for a period of two or three months, they typically would make their last purchase of a quarter's worth of supply, so another three months of product. And that puts them right into the fourth quarter when they're going to be making their next purchase, which is when they would now be coming on to the Patient Assistance Program. So our belief is that's going to be a bit more impactful in the fourth quarter than what we've seen in other quarters. I think when you take those sorts of things into consideration and when you try to quantify those, if you were to exclude them, you'd see a growth rate right back in line with what you've seen year-to-date.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, the comment that you made about not seeing what you wanted to see from day 10 to day 15, is that because you can't hit the iCGM designation? Was it just the adhesive wasn't working? The algo wasn't quite right? What exactly does that mean? Do you think you're going to have an iCGM designation for this, for G7 when you get out to 15 days? And then on the 10-day sensor, is it going to be a cheaper sensor, because I know cost is a big gating factor for some people. Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: So let me start with pricing. Again, we currently sell a 10-day sensor, and pricing is very much based upon the cost per month, whether you buy two sensors or three sensors as we've done these contracts, CGM is a monthly cost. It really doesn't get down to the unit. Excuse me, particularly, if you look at the way our contracts are negotiated with respect to transmitter and receiver prices and you get into rebates on various component. So the cost per individual sensor really doesn't matter. It's what we can make and what we get reimbursed for in a given month. With respect to getting out from 10 to 15 days, for us, this is a problem that we can solve. In order to meet iCGM standards the way our algorithm works, as we turn the sensors off when the data, we believe, isn't necessarily good enough for iCGM standards. Many of our patients would argue that the data is just fine when we shut them off, but that's how we look at this and how we run it. We saw that we're basically shutting out more sensors than we wanted to right now, and we needed to perform better. As I said earlier, we can get 70% of them to 15 days with that trouble, but 70% in our mind is not good enough for our patients. We'd rather have a better reliability number and go 10 days. It is a cost issue more than anything else on over time when we get to 15 -- the COGs will obviously be less. But as you look at our G6 performance with our 10-day sensor now and the cost profile that our ops team, Quentin and the team have created. We've -- we're very happy with that, and we're very comfortable going forward with G7 with 10, we'd like to make it 15, and we'll work on that as soon as we're done with the 10 filing. We expect everything we do to have an iCGM designation, by the way. So there won't be any backing off on that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Your line is open. \nTravis Steed: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on the G7 timelines, you mentioned key markets in the second half of next year. Is the U.S. falling in the second half? Or is that going to be more 2022? And then on the U.S. pivotal trial, when do you expect that to actually finish enrolling?\nKevin Sayer: We're not going to give all those time line details out for competitive reasons more than anything else, our policy in the past has been more to announce approvals rather than to give a bunch of details on the studies. I did say that we've started our studies with respect to generating data for approvals. By saying multiple geographies, that obviously means there will be international launches. To the extent we launch in other places has yet to be determined. Right now, we're focused on a number of efforts, getting ready for that. And the complexity of G7 for us is actually, it's kind of a blast. It's very exciting to go through a change as big as we're doing. But literally, every single process in building this is different than what we've done before. And so we are getting factories and capacity up and running, the lines will be fully automated. We want to be completely ready to manufacture tens of millions of these things at launch rather than just a few. And in fairness to our commercial team and everybody in the field, we spent all of '19 living on about 3 days of finished goods, and we're not doing that again. That won't be \u2013 I have very \u2013 every comp and that will not be the delay launch, it will be getting all the approvals in. But we'll launch it in the appropriate timeframes and give color as the situation evolves.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mark Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open.\nMark Kaczor: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the G7 launch and just operationally, have you guys been able to start working through some of those payer contracts? Are they asking you to wait and I ask it just because of that lack of the transmitter, whether that's going to then structure that G7 sales cycle on an annual revenue basis where maybe days percent or don't matter as you extend further into the life of that. Or is it going to be sensor only?\nQuentin Blackford: We've contemplated the G7 launch ever since we started negotiating contracts for G6. We don't view this as a big changeover for us. If anything, our team will be more than ready to do this in the field when time happens. And as it gets closer as we go through the next bidding cycle, inevitably, our team will well flow G7, there will be some payers who will go to dual pricing even though G7 is not approved, others will want to wait until the product is approved, the policies vary across the board. But we've contemplated the G7 launch and all the G6 work that we've done. So we have a model going forward that will be easy to repeat.\nOperator: And next question comes from Ray Denhoy from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nRaj Denhoy: Hey, thank you. Maybe Quentin one for you about the gross margin. It's been pretty impressive to see the gross margin expansion even as you guys are absorbing all of this price. And I guess the question is whether -- or really how long you can keep doing that? Is there a level, at which gross margin has to stop going up and actually starts to go to the direction as pricing continues to come down. And I appreciate G7 represents kind of a step change in that, but as we're still on G6, how long does this keep going?\nQuentin Blackford: Yeah, Raj, great question. We couldn't be more excited about where we've been able to take the cost profile of our G6 product. And keep in mind, we're doing that at a time where we've created record inventory levels for the company, which just opened up more and more growth potential and growth avenues for the organization that we can start to pursue. So we're excited about that. We're currently at our lowest cost point to date on G6. And I think there's quite a bit of runway still in front of us with respect to take cost out of that product, particularly as we keep pushing significant volumes through the plant. As you look at the cost profile, I believe we can get to a profile that is less than $1 a day cost for the product, regardless of whether that's G6 or G7. Keep in mind, G7 from the very beginning of time was designed with cost in mind and the ability to get to a lower cost profile than G6. And so while we're making tremendous progress on G6, the ability to replicate that and do even better with G7 is something that we fully believe in our ability to do. Now that being said, G7 will be more expensive in the early stages as we're ramping capacity. But at scale, it will be a lower cost profile for us than G6. So I think there's still quite a bit of good runway in front of us. The teams are focused on driving cost out of the product. We're redesigning manufacturing process where we can take manual efforts and move them to automated efforts. We're moving into lower cost jurisdictions. We've renegotiated cost points with many of our vendors as they've taken advantage of larger volumes as well we've redesigned the logistics and distribution model that we utilize as well, taking cost out. So I don't think we're anywhere close to having realized the full benefit of all of that just yet, but you're starting to see it play through. To the degree that we continue to navigate through price headwinds will somewhat impact how high that gross margin can go. But at the very least, it lets us combat those sorts of things. So we're excited about where we're at on the cost side.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi, guys. I was wondering if you could update us on progress in intensive Type 2. Are you seeing momentum now on the commercial side with the win you talked about with United Animal recently, Aetna about where do you think we are in terms of the market on an intensive Type 2 CGM penetration?\nKevin Sayer: I'll refer to Steve or Quentin on the market penetration, I can just tell you anecdotally, what we're hearing is very much as these patients are getting covered, the technologies getting to them. We've always had Type 2 intensive insulin use coverage in Medicare. In that respect, I think our biggest barrier there. And again, it talks to sales force expansion and messaging was getting to physicians to recommend it to those patients and making everybody aware. So we're happy with that one. On the penetration side, Steve?\nSteve Pacelli: What we said on the last call is that our Type 2 business was exceeding 20% of our patient base. I don't think we're prepared to update that today. But the other \u2013 the point that I would want to make on the \u2013 even just the intensive Type 2 space is the addressable market is simply larger, right? So whether you're looking at the U.S. business or you're even looking at the European or the other foreign markets. In the U.S., we're looking at a patient opportunity of probably pushing like 2 million patients, where we used to use a number maybe like 1.5 million in the U.S., I think we\u2019re \u2013 the data that we have suggested that market opportunity is a lot bigger. So while penetration, certainly I think that we're making great progress on the insurance front, and it's a huge market opportunity as we look to continue to expand the intensive business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Two quick ones for me. One, I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more on the significance of the government contract you mentioned in the U.S., what impact that could have on the business? And then I just want to follow-up on the question about international. I'm curious if the situation is improving in the countries that have lagged due to COVID? Or if you actually think that might be a little bit worse here in 4Q as virus case counts increase in some of those places? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: The government contract is really important to us, particularly on the VA side, there's a much higher instance of diabetes with that group of patients than the regular general population. Being able to get access to G6 through a pharmacy benefit at zero co-pay, we think is a wonderful benefit for that group. I think it's just part of the general blocking and tackling that we do to continue to grow. So I can't quantify it. These are the types of wins that you've seen DexCom generate over the past several years, and we are looking forward to serving this patient base much easier than we have before. I'll let Quentin talk about the international piece.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes. With respect to international, early signs are starting to point to the fact that new patient numbers are starting to step back up, clearly, not back at the levels they used to be at, but we are seeing those start to trend back up the way we would expect them to, over time. So we're seeing some good progress there. And clearly, that's in those markets that have the administrative burdens placed upon that are bit heavier in those markets where you're utilizing something like the e-commerce platform, we've seen terrific results there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Your line is open.\nChris Cooley: Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe this point from me interested, Steve, when you think about the UVA collaboration and you talked about the advanced analytics, DexCom already essentially owns and controls the data through the generation. You have the algorithms in place. How's there on maybe the future revenue streams from whether we want to call this an IT management or some type of other ways that you could further leverage the data that you have in-house now to further enhance the margin profile longer term?\nSteve Pacelli: Yes. No, it's a great question. We've spent time exploring ways to monetize the data to date. And quite frankly, at this point, to the extent we can help our partners be more competitive with the algorithms that we provide to them and/or that we provide to our patients just from a patient capture and patient retention perspective, I think we're pretty happy with that. The UVA collaboration, in particular, you guys all know we bought TypeZero, a few years back. That algorithm, in particular, is commercialized in the tandem Control-IQ product today. Really, when we look at the opportunities at UVA, it's really to expand to next-generation algorithms, whether they would be for automated insulin delivery, which we would probably do in conjunction with our folks at TypeZero. Or even beyond to be intensive insulin patients who don't use an insulin pump and even beyond that, whether it's Type 2 more broadly, health and wellness, pre-diabetes, even in the hospital. So we're looking at kind of ample opportunity over the next five years. To really work closely with UVA, who has been responsible together with our folks at TypeZero for developing these best-in-class algorithms.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Your line is open.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two for me, both on the commercial side. First, on the DTC program. Can you help us understand, I guess, the ongoing effectiveness of the program and where you're at with respect to rolling it out and realizing the value and the return on investment from those DTC investments? And then secondarily, are you seeing changes with respect to your referring physician mix. Obviously, you talked about maybe making some salesforce investments as you move more into the non-endos. Just trying to understand how those different channels to have different sales and marketing needs?\nKevin Sayer: Well, with respect to DTC, we have rolled that out, and we're going very strong here in the fourth quarter. Our return on our DTC investments has been very, very good to date. In fact, compared to other ones we've seen in other companies, our returns are extremely high still. So that program has not capped as far as effectiveness. So, we'll continue to investigate and you will see more from us going forward this quarter and the first of next year. We have a lot of fun things planned for you on the DTC front. With respect to more channels and referring physicians again, as Quentin said earlier, we had tremendous new patient numbers this quarter. So, we're still getting referrals, obviously in the endocrinology community and the communities where we serve. Traditionally, we just feel the need to go deeper and end to visit with more healthcare professionals and help them better treat their patients as well. One of the things we learned from -- we learned from COVID with respect to our clarity system as physicians had to do mobile appointments or tele appointments, if they can pull clarity data up on the screen, those employments become very effective. And there's a large group of physicians who don't have access to clarity or haven't been using it. We need to get out and get our message out there. So, that's our plan. It will go deeper and to help our people focus more on those territories where they work.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon. I hate to get granular here, but I thought I heard Kevin say that new patient growth continued in the third quarter. And yes, there's a couple of ways to interpret that comment. So, my question is, did you add more new patients in 3Q 2020 than you did in 3Q 2019?\nKevin Sayer: Yes, Jayson, just to be Q3 2020 was a record number of nutrition ads for us. So, it was the highest quarterly new patient add of any quarter in our history.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi there, this is Iris [ph] calling for Ravi. So, if you can talk a bit about CGM coverage under Medicaid. So as we think about the macro economy, the unemployment rate is high, and maybe there are more people moving to Medicaid from other insurances. So, can you talk about CGM coverage under Medicaid? And do you think the shift to Medicaid would reduce patients' access to CGM or increased pricing pressure? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, this is Kevin. I will take that. We have Medicaid coverage in approximately 40 of the 50 states as we sit here today. And I would be in full disclosure. It's spotty in some states, it's very easy in some saves, they make it very hard as they're very budget conscious, and they're worried about spending dollars. We believe \u2013 and we have various pricing arrangements throughout all the states. There's a wide range of pricing there. I don't -- if we had coverage in all 50 states and everything were equal in almost every device business, Medicaid pricing ends up being lower than everything else. And we're prepared to do that. We believe these patients is sort of access to our technology as well. But really the challenge for us has been getting it across the finish line in a manner to whereby patients can get the technology. And it's just too hard right now. We are trying hard to be better. And we've had some major wins on that front. But there's a couple of states where we just keep knocking on the door and keep -- I mean, there are some states where we get across the finish line, and then they've attached Medicaid coverage to some other thing and in the state legislature and we get thrown out. It's been a very frustrating thing for me and particularly because so many of those patients are children and really deserve access to DexCom CGM, deserve access the share and fall and all the things that we have to offer. So we continue to fight that battle. I hope we have it in every state, and we'll make sure that we can compete competitively on the pricing side. We're not going to give the Medicaid business up. We want patients to have access to us.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ryan Blicker from Cowen. Your line is open.\nRyan Blicker: Hi, thanks for taking my question. You've always said that at some point, competitors will close the gap versus DexCom and on performance and connectivity assuming this happens at some point over the next 1 to 2 years, do you believe DexCom can differentiate versus its competitors via software around the CGM and accordingly to sustain some degree of premium price long-term? You're clearly making significant investments here as demonstrated with TypeZero and the UVA collaboration. But again, do you believe DexCom can differentiate via software over time instead of the hardware differentiation you've enjoyed since 2012? And if so, when will we start to hear more about your software product pipeline? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: Well, you'll hear more about our software product pipeline as we launch those products over time. And let's be clear on the hardware differentiate side, while we've said that gap is going to close, it still hasn't. And we still lead in connectivity and connectivity and multiple devices and interoperability and data sharing and all of those things. That infrastructure has taken us a long time to build, and it costs a lot to support. I think over the next several years, software will be a key thing, delivering the experience to the patient that will keep them engaged and provide a great outcome. I was at dinner with a long time diabetes patient the other night, and we started talking about experiences, and a guy looked at me goes, so wait a minute, you don't think one size fits all and said, no, I don't. I think at some point in time, you'll see -- I know you'll see from DexCom, different software offerings. So stay tuned on, on that one. I think the other thing that everybody needs to understand also about this market, as we look out over the next several years, is just the challenge of scale. And we've lived through this. As we continue to invest in factories, we've got G6 pretty much built out now. That took us a couple of years, and now we're investing heavily in G7. You're looking at somewhere between $0.5 billion and $1 billion in capital investment on our part to do this to get to where it needs to be to get these products at the cost basis they need to be, but also automated and at scale, so we can deliver the volumes that we need. And that will be a differentiator as well. If companies aren't investing in that scale, that's going to be difficult. So as I look out over time, connectivity and the higher experience that we provide, we still believe we'll be best-in-class over everybody else. But the software experience we can create based on the mentality that we have and as close as we are to our patients really is going to be a differentiator. As far as premium pricing over time, we will continue to work towards that end. We've done very well in the pricing -- in our pricing schemes now that as Quentin alluded to earlier, with our shift to the pharmacy, and many of our patients to Medicare, that's becoming \u2013 our pricing models have moved in the way that we thought they would. I do think there are things, we have CGMs to do, that are worth more than other things. And as I looked at this in the future, I do see an experience. This is just me personally, that it's worth a higher price than some other experience and conversely as some other experiences that may not be worth as much as what we charge today. So stay tuned on that. We \u2013 as I mentioned somebody the other day, we've kind of created this industry from 2012 to now, and it's going to be fun to evolving over the next several years as well.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Quentin, any color or preliminary thoughts on 2020 \u2013 how we should think about 2021 relative to 2020, the 29% top line growth you're guiding to in 2020 and the operating margin of greater than 16%, any high level thoughts? Thanks for taking the question.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes, Larry. We're not going to talk about 2021 on the call today. Clearly, we believe there's tremendous opportunity for growth in front of us, given just the fact that there's so much awareness to continue to be had around our product. I think we've been clear from a profitability side. We're going to be disciplined in this organization, and we're going to make the right investments where we need to, to open up new growth channels into the future. And all of that will be contemplated in the guidance that we ultimately end up providing for 2021, but we're not going to do that today.\nOperator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Kevin Sayer for final remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you. I, again, want to thank everybody for participating on our earnings call today. I really can't emphasize enough how strongly our teams performed during these incredibly unstable times. $0.5 billion in quarterly worldwide sales at the time when our field teams have had very limited access to clinicians, and it had to be very creative to figure out how to get the message out to patients. We've raised our guidance now for three straight quarters. We have gross margins approaching 70% during a period of managed price reduction, combined with unit volumes being more than double what they were two years ago and significantly higher than last year at this time. We have operating and net income levels higher than we've ever had before, during a period when our customer satisfaction scores are also at all-time highs, far in excess of those of our competitors. We are doing our best on our commitment to our patients. Innovation continues to thrive here. I personally learn more about sensor technology in 2020 than any of the other years I\u2019ve been here. All of this is pushing towards tremendous innovation going forward. And as we see the use of CGM and other applications and some of the things, some of our data partners or our payer partners are going to be able to do with this data going forward, never been more bullish about innovation and what's coming in the future. And barriers to our new markets are coming down. As we've navigated our way through the hospital experience and learn there, our Type 2 efforts with the program Steve talked about earlier, we're making progress in multiple markets for the future, so we'll be able to address those. You can\u2019t do all these things without a remarkable team. I want to express my gratitude to everybody on the DexCom family at this time, but I'll remind everybody of one thing, we are still at the very beginning of this journey, and it's only going to get faster or from here. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Well, we've got a bit different rate over the past 24 hours compared to our usual earnings reports, but I am very glad to be with you today. Most of you probably saw that we pre-announced revenue after market close yesterday, in conjunction with the announcement of the retirement of Rick Doubleday, our Chief Commercial Officer. I'll have more to say about Rick and what is accomplished later in this call. We chose to provide the revenue pre-announcement in order to remove any market uncertainty about the strength of our business in conjunction with our notification of Rick's retirement. Our strong third quarter results reflect the resilience of our business and the importance of DexCom CGM to our growing customer base, even as the world continues to navigate the challenges prevented by the COVID pandemic. Based on this performance, we are pleased to be in a position once again to raise our 2020 revenue guidance in the year-end. Total revenue grew 26% in the third quarter, driven by our strong new patient growth over the past year. This patient growth continued in the third quarter with our pharmacy and Medicare channels, exhibiting the strongest growth in the quarter. We continue to see some impact to new patients relative to our expectations as a result of the pandemic. However, as our updated guidance indicates, the impact was not as significant as we expected and communicated on our second quarter call. We also officially introduced our patient assistance program at the start of the third quarter, extending our support to our customers who have lost coverage during this trying time. We saw a small handful of people utilized the program during the quarter, but it did not have a material impact on our performance. We've made excellent progress on the access front with nearly all people with type 1 diabetes in the U.S., now having access to DexCom CGM as well as a quickly increasing amount of people with type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy. We recently entered into a government wide contract for the sale of DexCom CGM through eligible government buyers, including the VA. This contract will facilitate easier and more convenient access to CGM as it may allow for pharmacy access to DexCom CGM for eligible veterans. Another example of how we're making it easier for patients to take control of their diabetes at an affordable price. In addition, our team is doing great work to expand access outside of the U.S., including the recent publication of our U.K. cost effectiveness study that showed the clear economic benefits associated with use of DexCom CGM. Based on studies like these, we are hopeful that we will be able to drive near-term access wins on behalf of people with diabetes with government payers on a global basis. With customer feedback related to G6 continuing to trend at record levels, we have several initiatives underway to extend the DexCom growth opportunity and bring DexCom CGM to more people who stand to benefit from enhanced knowledge of their glucose levels. For our intensive business, many of you likely saw our press release with Eli Lilly earlier this month, announcing our co-marketing efforts of our G6 CGM with Lilly's new ultra rapid-acting insulin. This collaboration is a great example of our strong partnership with the Lilly team and should provide a nice boost to our efforts to extend awareness of Dexcom CGM among practicing clinicians, including primary care physicians. We are making great progress in our efforts to extend DexCom CGM to nonintensive type 2 customers as well. Intermountain Healthcare recently published the results of their first pilot using DexCom CGM, which demonstrated annual cost savings of approximately $5,000 per member for DexCom users relative to standard of care fingersticks. We are thrilled to say the large expansion of this trial with Intermountain is now well underway. We are excited about our work with UnitedHealth as they extend their rollout of the Level 2 program. Although it is still early in the commercial rollout, our teams are working together very well to ensure the kind of patient experience that we expect for any users of our CGM systems. We continue to support hospitals and help protect patients and frontline workers during the pandemic, with more than 200 hospitals reaching out to us about DexCom CGM during this crisis. We remain focused on generating evidence to potentially expedite approval for the use of CGM for patient monitoring. Along these lines, early feedback on the performance of our CGM has been positive, including several recently published articles documenting use of the product during the pandemic. In September, we also announced the creation of a hospital registry to allow us to collect data on DexCom CGM performance efficiently during this time.  As we press forward these initiatives with a great customer satisfaction with G6, our teams internally are intently focused on the next steps with G7. We commenced approval support trials for G7 in mid-October. This timing remains consistent with our previous discussions around the impact of COVID to our clinical trial timeline. Although all of us are eager for you to experience G7, we are committed to doing this in the right way and ensuring that the trials are run efficiently and that we bring to market a product that delivers a best-in-class customer experience for DexCom users. We expect to launch G7 into several key markets during the second half of 2021. Given the growth of the business and our expanding patient base, the expansion of G7 into all of our core markets will likely extend it in 2022 as we continue to scale manufacturing to support these markets in the right way. There is one change to G7 from our previous discussions. After extensive evaluation in several premarket studies, we have made the decision to launch G7 versus a 10-day product with a clear pathway to extend the wear duration shortly. Our customers' lives are heavily dependent upon DexCom CGM, and we have high standards to ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers. For example, while our 15-day configuration demonstrates survival rates in the 70% plus range, we don't believe this is good enough for our patients. With that, I will turn it over to Quentin for a financial review. Thanks Steve. As we head towards the collation of 2020, I want to take a moment to extend my gratitude to Rick Doubleday, our Chief Commercial Officer, who plans to retire at the end of this year and continue with us in a consulting role through 2021. Rick joined DexCom in 2009, leading our sales organization from approximately $49 million in sales in this first full year to the $1.9 billion that we're closing in on now. I can't think of many examples where a commercial leader has overseen companion growth of greater than 40% over a 10-year period. But that is what Rick has accomplished here at DexCom. He is a great leader and a great friend who has developed a solid plan to execute as we progress into 2021 and the launch of our G7 system. Rick has also worked extensively to develop a very talented commercial team. So we are in a great position as we press forward to execute on our goals in 2021 and beyond. So I hope you will join me in expressing appreciation for Rick's outstanding leadership at DexCom, and best wishes as he embraced his well-deserved time spent with his family. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? No. I appreciate that, Robbie. With respect to pricing, I think our results very clearly demonstrate how well we've managed this process as we moved a great deal of our business. Through the pharmacy channel, and I'm sure Quentin will get into that more later as we get into more questions. As you look at our margins as great as they are with volumes significantly higher than they were before and prices coming down. We've truly proven that we can scale here. So we definitely understand how that works. With respect to products and features and things of that nature, let me start with G6 before we move to G7. This is an incredible product and it has incredible features and has truly been a market leader. It has taken us a while to get up to scale manufacturing G6 and get the capacity that we need, and we have that now. And so we will push G6 very hard and very competitively until G7 gets here. G6 is what we have today. With respect to our future products, I can't speak to what our competitors have. I know what G7 is and what it does. There are many features in there. We have not shared with everybody that will delight the world. We went to the 10-day life for exactly the reasons I said on the call. And it really leads into what's going to be the differentiation. We did this because we want the patient experience to be what we committed to. We have learned in our extensive research, the most important thing for us is to deliver what we say. And as we were getting out to 15 days, particularly with our algorithm with that sensor, we saw too many of them not making it. And while it performed great at the longer time, it wasn't great enough for us. So we shortened the life for now. We're very confident with changes we can make to make it last longer. Where the difference will be over time and where we're investing significant resources is on the experience side. The concept that One CGM experience fits all is just not going to work going forward as you look at the AID systems. As you look at people that are Type 2 intensive insulin users, who have migrated to CGM later in life, they may want different information and different experience. I think as we get the physical features of the product, exactly where patients want them, and we're very comfortable with G7, what's going to be most important is delivering the experience that keeps them engaged and leads to better outcomes, and we're very confident that we can win that battle. Well, this is Kevin. I will take that one. We're thrilled to be able to sample at this point in time. And to be doing it in a manner that we think can be very large scale for years, patients have wanted to try a Dexcom and see what they could do. And given our status with our direct business and all the things we're doing, there were constraints around our ability to do that. We've removed those constraints as we work through the distribution channel. We believe that it's going to affect patients across the board, not only Type 1s, but I think your comment on Type 2 intensive insulin users is a very good one. They might be a bit more resistant to the technology, because they've been dealing with diabetes longer. And gee, do I really want to do that. If you have the experience of wearing a G6 and having -- being able to see what happens, this becomes very easy. And so we're really excited about it. We expect the results to be good, if not fantastic. And if you look at the payback for us, you look at the revenue we get from a patient per year. If we convert 50% of these people to full-time use, that is beyond spectacular program. We don't even have to come close to that number for this to be a spectacular result for us. But I think the recognition and the ability for a physician to say, look, I have an answer for you. Let's try this. It's really important to us, and we think it's going to be a big initiative for us this year. I'll take that one. Let me address the Rick issue first. This has nothing to do with Rick deciding to retire. If anything, this -- all our sales efforts right now are Rick's plans, and he does get to see them through to the end of the year, while he'll be working with us through year-end. So, these events are completely unrelated. We are planning several things on the sales and marketing front over the next year. We won't reveal all of them. But what we do believe is we do need more coverage in the field, particularly as we look at the HCP community and those who are not endocrinologists as you get into primary care physicians who are seeing more and more of these patients. We need some access there, and we need some more feet out speaking to them. We're very cognizant of the return on our sales force has for us. And I would disagree with you, our sales team is great and they do provide a lot of benefit to our company. They are a great voice. And really our face of the company in many of these geographies. So, that I disagree with. We are fully on board with what we're going forward with and look forward to measuring the results of it. So let me start with pricing. Again, we currently sell a 10-day sensor, and pricing is very much based upon the cost per month, whether you buy two sensors or three sensors as we've done these contracts, CGM is a monthly cost. It really doesn't get down to the unit. Excuse me, particularly, if you look at the way our contracts are negotiated with respect to transmitter and receiver prices and you get into rebates on various component. So the cost per individual sensor really doesn't matter. It's what we can make and what we get reimbursed for in a given month. With respect to getting out from 10 to 15 days, for us, this is a problem that we can solve. In order to meet iCGM standards the way our algorithm works, as we turn the sensors off when the data, we believe, isn't necessarily good enough for iCGM standards. Many of our patients would argue that the data is just fine when we shut them off, but that's how we look at this and how we run it. We saw that we're basically shutting out more sensors than we wanted to right now, and we needed to perform better. As I said earlier, we can get 70% of them to 15 days with that trouble, but 70% in our mind is not good enough for our patients. We'd rather have a better reliability number and go 10 days. It is a cost issue more than anything else on over time when we get to 15 -- the COGs will obviously be less. But as you look at our G6 performance with our 10-day sensor now and the cost profile that our ops team, Quentin and the team have created. We've -- we're very happy with that, and we're very comfortable going forward with G7 with 10, we'd like to make it 15, and we'll work on that as soon as we're done with the 10 filing. We expect everything we do to have an iCGM designation, by the way. So there won't be any backing off on that. We're not going to give all those time line details out for competitive reasons more than anything else, our policy in the past has been more to announce approvals rather than to give a bunch of details on the studies. I did say that we've started our studies with respect to generating data for approvals. By saying multiple geographies, that obviously means there will be international launches. To the extent we launch in other places has yet to be determined. Right now, we're focused on a number of efforts, getting ready for that. And the complexity of G7 for us is actually, it's kind of a blast. It's very exciting to go through a change as big as we're doing. But literally, every single process in building this is different than what we've done before. And so we are getting factories and capacity up and running, the lines will be fully automated. We want to be completely ready to manufacture tens of millions of these things at launch rather than just a few. And in fairness to our commercial team and everybody in the field, we spent all of '19 living on about 3 days of finished goods, and we're not doing that again. That won't be \u2013 I have very \u2013 every comp and that will not be the delay launch, it will be getting all the approvals in. But we'll launch it in the appropriate timeframes and give color as the situation evolves. I'll refer to Steve or Quentin on the market penetration, I can just tell you anecdotally, what we're hearing is very much as these patients are getting covered, the technologies getting to them. We've always had Type 2 intensive insulin use coverage in Medicare. In that respect, I think our biggest barrier there. And again, it talks to sales force expansion and messaging was getting to physicians to recommend it to those patients and making everybody aware. So we're happy with that one. On the penetration side, Steve? The government contract is really important to us, particularly on the VA side, there's a much higher instance of diabetes with that group of patients than the regular general population. Being able to get access to G6 through a pharmacy benefit at zero co-pay, we think is a wonderful benefit for that group. I think it's just part of the general blocking and tackling that we do to continue to grow. So I can't quantify it. These are the types of wins that you've seen DexCom generate over the past several years, and we are looking forward to serving this patient base much easier than we have before. I'll let Quentin talk about the international piece. Well, with respect to DTC, we have rolled that out, and we're going very strong here in the fourth quarter. Our return on our DTC investments has been very, very good to date. In fact, compared to other ones we've seen in other companies, our returns are extremely high still. So that program has not capped as far as effectiveness. So, we'll continue to investigate and you will see more from us going forward this quarter and the first of next year. We have a lot of fun things planned for you on the DTC front. With respect to more channels and referring physicians again, as Quentin said earlier, we had tremendous new patient numbers this quarter. So, we're still getting referrals, obviously in the endocrinology community and the communities where we serve. Traditionally, we just feel the need to go deeper and end to visit with more healthcare professionals and help them better treat their patients as well. One of the things we learned from -- we learned from COVID with respect to our clarity system as physicians had to do mobile appointments or tele appointments, if they can pull clarity data up on the screen, those employments become very effective. And there's a large group of physicians who don't have access to clarity or haven't been using it. We need to get out and get our message out there. So, that's our plan. It will go deeper and to help our people focus more on those territories where they work. Yes, Jayson, just to be Q3 2020 was a record number of nutrition ads for us. So, it was the highest quarterly new patient add of any quarter in our history. Yes, this is Kevin. I will take that. We have Medicaid coverage in approximately 40 of the 50 states as we sit here today. And I would be in full disclosure. It's spotty in some states, it's very easy in some saves, they make it very hard as they're very budget conscious, and they're worried about spending dollars. We believe \u2013 and we have various pricing arrangements throughout all the states. There's a wide range of pricing there. I don't -- if we had coverage in all 50 states and everything were equal in almost every device business, Medicaid pricing ends up being lower than everything else. And we're prepared to do that. We believe these patients is sort of access to our technology as well. But really the challenge for us has been getting it across the finish line in a manner to whereby patients can get the technology. And it's just too hard right now. We are trying hard to be better. And we've had some major wins on that front. But there's a couple of states where we just keep knocking on the door and keep -- I mean, there are some states where we get across the finish line, and then they've attached Medicaid coverage to some other thing and in the state legislature and we get thrown out. It's been a very frustrating thing for me and particularly because so many of those patients are children and really deserve access to DexCom CGM, deserve access the share and fall and all the things that we have to offer. So we continue to fight that battle. I hope we have it in every state, and we'll make sure that we can compete competitively on the pricing side. We're not going to give the Medicaid business up. We want patients to have access to us. Well, you'll hear more about our software product pipeline as we launch those products over time. And let's be clear on the hardware differentiate side, while we've said that gap is going to close, it still hasn't. And we still lead in connectivity and connectivity and multiple devices and interoperability and data sharing and all of those things. That infrastructure has taken us a long time to build, and it costs a lot to support. I think over the next several years, software will be a key thing, delivering the experience to the patient that will keep them engaged and provide a great outcome. I was at dinner with a long time diabetes patient the other night, and we started talking about experiences, and a guy looked at me goes, so wait a minute, you don't think one size fits all and said, no, I don't. I think at some point in time, you'll see -- I know you'll see from DexCom, different software offerings. So stay tuned on, on that one. I think the other thing that everybody needs to understand also about this market, as we look out over the next several years, is just the challenge of scale. And we've lived through this. As we continue to invest in factories, we've got G6 pretty much built out now. That took us a couple of years, and now we're investing heavily in G7. You're looking at somewhere between $0.5 billion and $1 billion in capital investment on our part to do this to get to where it needs to be to get these products at the cost basis they need to be, but also automated and at scale, so we can deliver the volumes that we need. And that will be a differentiator as well. If companies aren't investing in that scale, that's going to be difficult. So as I look out over time, connectivity and the higher experience that we provide, we still believe we'll be best-in-class over everybody else. But the software experience we can create based on the mentality that we have and as close as we are to our patients really is going to be a differentiator. As far as premium pricing over time, we will continue to work towards that end. We've done very well in the pricing -- in our pricing schemes now that as Quentin alluded to earlier, with our shift to the pharmacy, and many of our patients to Medicare, that's becoming \u2013 our pricing models have moved in the way that we thought they would. I do think there are things, we have CGMs to do, that are worth more than other things. And as I looked at this in the future, I do see an experience. This is just me personally, that it's worth a higher price than some other experience and conversely as some other experiences that may not be worth as much as what we charge today. So stay tuned on that. We \u2013 as I mentioned somebody the other day, we've kind of created this industry from 2012 to now, and it's going to be fun to evolving over the next several years as well. Thank you. I, again, want to thank everybody for participating on our earnings call today. I really can't emphasize enough how strongly our teams performed during these incredibly unstable times. $0.5 billion in quarterly worldwide sales at the time when our field teams have had very limited access to clinicians, and it had to be very creative to figure out how to get the message out to patients. We've raised our guidance now for three straight quarters. We have gross margins approaching 70% during a period of managed price reduction, combined with unit volumes being more than double what they were two years ago and significantly higher than last year at this time. We have operating and net income levels higher than we've ever had before, during a period when our customer satisfaction scores are also at all-time highs, far in excess of those of our competitors. We are doing our best on our commitment to our patients. Innovation continues to thrive here. I personally learn more about sensor technology in 2020 than any of the other years I've been here. All of this is pushing towards tremendous innovation going forward. And as we see the use of CGM and other applications and some of the things, some of our data partners or our payer partners are going to be able to do with this data going forward, never been more bullish about innovation and what's coming in the future. And barriers to our new markets are coming down. As we've navigated our way through the hospital experience and learn there, our Type 2 efforts with the program Steve talked about earlier, we're making progress in multiple markets for the future, so we'll be able to address those. You can't do all these things without a remarkable team. I want to express my gratitude to everybody on the DexCom family at this time, but I'll remind everybody of one thing, we are still at the very beginning of this journey, and it's only going to get faster or from here. Thank you, everybody."

            "content": "Thank you, Quentin. Even with the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic in our communities, our focus at DexCom remains largely business as usual. This means that we are focused on our patients, striving to ensure that they are cared for, and empowered by DexCom CGM in this time where glucose control is as important as ever. This also means that our teams are focused on executing on our core strategic priorities to best position DexCom to capitalize on our growth opportunity. The significant capacity expansion that our teams have worked tirelessly for since the start of 2019, has left us in a great position to aggressively target new patients via different strategic marketing pathways, including enhanced direct-to-consumer marketing and as of very recently, the ability to offer product samples to health care providers so that their patients can experience firsthand the benefits of DexCom CGM. While we are being strategic about these investments in light of the impact of COVID, our inventory position has us well positioned to take advantage of these new opportunities and provide full support to the efforts of our field sales force. In September, we announced a new five-year research collaboration with the University of Virginia, my own mater, of course. This agreement enables additional resources for our Charlottesville team as we look to innovate our artificial pancreas algorithm technology. We look forward to developing additional tools to offer our pump and smart pen partners to simplify the experience of managing diabetes for our collective customers. We'll also use the collaboration to advance our data analytics capabilities and research programs as we demonstrate the clinical value of DexCom CGM for customers for customers outside of our core intensive insulin-using population. This includes our efforts in non-intensive type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, pregnancy, and the hospital market. We are making good progress in our efforts to extend the use of DexCom CGM to the broad type 2 population. This includes continued traction in our type 2 intensive segment, where the recent VA contract adds to our significant reimbursement progress thus far in 2020. With Medicare, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, The VA, and others now covering DexCom for the type 2 intensive population, we are confident that this will be a nice growth driver for the company and a great outcome for those with type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy. But we are equally excited about the work we are conducting demonstrate the value of DexCom CGM for the non-intensive type 2 community. In addition to our work with Level2 and Intermountain Healthcare, which Kevin mentioned, we will kick off commercial pilot programs with several of our key digital health partners in the fourth quarter. Our automated insulin delivery partnership strategy continues to support our growth and position DexCom to lead the shift toward connected devices for people with diabetes on intensive insulin therapy. Tandem's Control-IQ became the first automated insulin delivery system driven by DexCom technology earlier this year and has quickly generated great momentum for both companies and, more importantly, great outcomes for users of the system. As we drop closer to the start of 2021, we are excited for the anticipated launch of Insulet's Omnipod 5 system in the first half of next year. This represents another important step for DexCom as we will have systems commercially available that are arguably best-in-class solutions for both tube and patch pump technologies. And with our integration work with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Ypsomed progressing as well, we believe that DexCom is well-positioned to support our core markets for users of insulin pump and smart pen systems in the years ahead. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. And Ravi, just to add on to that and hit on Kevin's point of the pharmacy, I think it's important for folks to recognize that in the pharmacy channel, our product is not priced all that differently from Libre with respect to what the patients coming out-of-pocket for. Greater than 70% of our patients are able to get on to our product at less than $60 per month, many of them with no out-of-pocket on a per month basis. So from a patient perspective it's price vary competitively. Sure. Danielle, I'll take that. Let me hit OUS first. From an OUS perspective, our performance in the quarter was right in line with our expectations. I think if you go back and look historically at seasonal trends in that international business, Q3 is typically up around that 20% range, and we were up 21% sequentially this year in Q3 coming off of Q2. To b e a bit more clear with it, though, we certainly saw some mixed results at the country level. And in those countries where the patients required to be in the physician office to train on, to go through the administrative process through all the paperwork that's required, we certainly have seen that be a slower uptick in getting back to normal volumes in the midst of this COVID environment. Clearly, COVID has impacted the ability to be in the office. Contra to that, though, in markets where we have our e-commerce platform in place, for example, U.K., Canada, we're seeing record numbers of new patients coming on to our technology and just some tremendous growth there. So I really believe it's more a story of what the model looks like and how COVID is impacting that or not in terms of the patient's ability to get onto the product. And I think if you look across the competitive landscape, and you go back to some of the commentary that's been put out there over the course of the quarter, for those folks who are more focused in the IIT space, which happens to be where we're primarily focused today in our international business, I think you've heard them speak to some softness in the international business as well. So I think what you saw come together for us was right in line with what the market is seeing. We feel good about it. Again, it was in line with our expectations. To your point, in terms of growing overall at a slower rate than one of our competitors, I think you have to keep in mind, we're navigating through a price headwind right now as we start to step price down and move more into the pharmacy channel. And we're making terrific progress on that front, even a bit ahead of our expectations. And if you were to look at the third quarter, in particular, in the 26% revenue dollar growth that we put up, if you were to look at that on a unit volume perspective, I believe we put up market-leading unit growth in the quarter itself, growing nearly 40% from a unit perspective. That's better than anything else out in the marketplace right now. So I think when you adjust for price, which is a bit specific to us and you really look at patients and unit volume, I think we're putting up market leading performance. What we said on the last call is that our Type 2 business was exceeding 20% of our patient base. I don't think we're prepared to update that today. But the other \u2013 the point that I would want to make on the \u2013 even just the intensive Type 2 space is the addressable market is simply larger, right? So whether you're looking at the U.S. business or you're even looking at the European or the other foreign markets. In the U.S., we're looking at a patient opportunity of probably pushing like 2 million patients, where we used to use a number maybe like 1.5 million in the U.S., I think we're \u2013 the data that we have suggested that market opportunity is a lot bigger. So while penetration, certainly I think that we're making great progress on the insurance front, and it's a huge market opportunity as we look to continue to expand the intensive business. Yes. No, it's a great question. We've spent time exploring ways to monetize the data to date. And quite frankly, at this point, to the extent we can help our partners be more competitive with the algorithms that we provide to them and/or that we provide to our patients just from a patient capture and patient retention perspective, I think we're pretty happy with that. The UVA collaboration, in particular, you guys all know we bought TypeZero, a few years back. That algorithm, in particular, is commercialized in the tandem Control-IQ product today. Really, when we look at the opportunities at UVA, it's really to expand to next-generation algorithms, whether they would be for automated insulin delivery, which we would probably do in conjunction with our folks at TypeZero. Or even beyond to be intensive insulin patients who don't use an insulin pump and even beyond that, whether it's Type 2 more broadly, health and wellness, pre-diabetes, even in the hospital. So we're looking at kind of ample opportunity over the next five years. To really work closely with UVA, who has been responsible together with our folks at TypeZero for developing these best-in-class algorithms."

            "name": "Quentin Blackford",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2020, we reported worldwide revenue of $529 million, compared to $396.3 million for the third quarter of 2019, representing growth of 26% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Our U.S. business maintained strong performance in the third quarter despite facing the toughest quarterly comparison for all of 2020 as we lap the 53% growth in the third quarter of 2019. The U.S. revenue totaled $398.6 million for the quarter, compared to $308.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, representing growth of 29%. All three of our channels contributed to the year-over-year growth in the U.S. with pharmacy and Medicare standing out as the strongest contributors, in line with our strategic emphasis and our efforts to streamline access for our customers over the last several years. Our Net Promoter Scores approached record levels amongst our users, and in particular, our Medicare customers including those with Type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy, a testament to the simplicity of our DexCom G6 system in the value of real-time CGM knowledge. Our international business grew 17% versus the prior year in the third quarter to $102.3 million and increased 21% on a sequential basis from the second quarter. The impact of the COVID pandemic on new patient starts continue to be felt more acutely in our international markets, especially as some of our core international markets have experienced increased case rates toward the end of summer and into the fall. This is primarily in those markets that have higher administrative requirements to access the technology, which are much more difficult with COVID related restrictions. However, in markets where administrative burdens are limited, we continue to see strong growth and momentum with the U.K. and Canada, especially standing out. In addition, we are continuing to benefit from the increased manufacturing capacity that we've driven over the past year, enabling us to extend the G6 offering to additional international markets, including our most recent launches into Belgium and Turkey at the start of the fourth quarter. Our third quarter gross profit was $340.7 million or 68% of revenue compared to 62.3% of revenue in the third quarter of 2019. Despite the increased pricing pressure that we have been talking about, this represents our highest quarterly gross margin since we launched G6 in 2018. Our teams have done a terrific job designing cost out of our products and manufacturing processes in addition to driving greater manufacturing efficiencies as volume continues to increase. We are more excited than ever about where we believe we can take the cost profile of our products over time, further enabling our ability to successfully navigate the lower pricing environment that accompanies are pushed to enable easier access to our products for our customers through the pharmacy channel. Operating expenses were $245.7 million for Q3 2020 compared to $187.8 million in Q3 2019, in line with our previous commentary. This reflects an increase of approximately 170 basis points as a percent of sales as we invested into some of our key initiatives in the third quarter. The increased spend in research and development is primarily focused on the G7 clinical trials, in addition to finalizing manufacturing readiness in anticipation of our future G7 launch. Within sales and marketing, we are prioritizing our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts, given the continued momentum with CGM awareness and the adoption runway ahead. With the results of our early campaigns delivering an excellent return to DexCom. On a go-forward basis, we continue to anticipate an elevated level of operating expenses in the fourth quarter and into 2021, as we move forward with our G7 pivotal trials, manufacturing scale-up and direct-to-consumer efforts. Importantly, general and administrative expenses continue to lever nicely in the quarter. Operating income was $95 million or 19% of revenue in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $59.1 million or 14.9% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of 410 basis points in operating margin for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $146.9 million or 29.3% of revenue for the third quarter compared to $92.5 million or 23.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2019, an improvement of 600 basis points. Net income for the third quarter was $93.6 million or $0.94 per share. We closed the quarter in a great financial position with more than $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This leaves us with plenty of liquidity to continue our capacity expansion initiatives for G6 and G7 in conjunction with growing CGM demand, while also being opportunistic with our investment strategy as we contemplate the long-term growth potential for our technology. We continue to anticipate some volatility to new patients in the fourth quarter of the year as COVID-case rates rise and fall in certain of our areas of operations and the global economy fluctuates. But with the strong third quarter results, we are in a good position to once again raise our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. We now expect 2020 revenue to be approximately $1.9 billion, representing growth of 29% over 2019. This represents an increase of $50 million from our previous guidance and $150 million from the midpoint of our guidance at the outset of the year, despite the impact from COVID over the past two quarters. As Kevin mentioned, new patient starts came in slightly ahead of the levels that we anticipated for the second half of the year and communicated on our second quarter call, although they were still down relative to our pre-pandemic expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect new patient starts to be approximately 90% of our original expectations before the impact of COVID. Turning to margins. We now anticipate the following non-GAAP results to meet or exceed the following levels. Gross margins to meet or exceed 66%, representing an increase of approximately 300 basis points versus 2019, despite the pricing pressures that we have realized primarily as a result of our emphasis on the pharmacy channel. We expect operating margins to meet or exceed 16%, an increase of approximately 500 basis points from the prior year. Finally, we expect that adjusted EBITDA margins will expand to meet or exceed 26% for the year, also an increase of approximately 500 basis points from the prior year. Our margin profile is clearly reflecting the strong revenue growth over the past several years and our ability to drive strong operating leverage from our key strategic drivers. We have also benefited to a certain degree this year from some near-term operating expense benefits associated with COVID-related impacts to clinical trials, industry conferences and other normal work practices. We anticipate that some of the investments will begin to generate returns in the fourth quarter and in 2021. In addition, we will continue to invest to maximize our growth potential for the long-term and we believe that as COVID-related restrictions free up, there will be a return to spend in certain areas. So, while we expect the organization to continue to progress, the cadence of margin expansion may not continue at the same magnitude or with the same predictability as we've seen this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update. Yes, Joanne, this is Quentin. As we spoke about price this year, just coming off of last quarter, for example, we were talking about $150 million in the business, so I think we were north of the $100 million you had referred to. That was something that was probably a year old, to be honest with you, as we were starting to navigate through it last year. So, it was a bit higher than that. As we've made terrific progress on the pharmacy side, we've actually seen price be a little bit more of a headwind than what that $150 million would have represented. I think it's going to be closer to $175 million for the year. We saw stronger price headwinds come through in Q3 that were embedded in that 26%. And obviously, if you do the unit volume at nearly 40%, you can kind of understand what the impact was in the quarter. But the majority of that is being realized as a result of us opening up that pharmacy channel, which we believe in the long-term, is the much better channel to be putting patients onto the product through for various reasons. It increases access, makes it easier for folks to get onto the product. And importantly, from a profitability perspective, over time, will be a much more profitable business model for us. And I think just looking at the quarter itself, seeing gross margin reach record levels of 68%, while the quarter represents the greatest amount of mix in that pharmacy channel just demonstrates our ability to really get after the cost profile of our product and compete in that segment quite aggressively. In terms of how long it takes to ultimately get to the price point or the mix of the pharmacy channel, we're not going to speak to that today. I think you're going to hear more from us as we get to our Analyst Day around just how far we are into that pharmacy channel and where we see that going, but we're making terrific progress. They're very happy with what we're seeing. Yeah. Thanks, David. Let me talk through a little bit of the assumptions that we've made as we head into Q4. I think we continue to operate in an environment where there's not a great deal of clarity with respect to how COVID is ultimately going to impact the business. And we want to be prudent and thoughtful around how we set those expectations. First and foremost, as we move more and more business into the pharmacy model as well as the Medicare business continues to grow at a strong rate, the seasonal impact in the business is going to shift. You're not going to see nearly as much revenue show up in the fourth quarter as the patients no longer really incentivized to take advantage of a scenario where they might have already met their deductible and they're going to load up on product as they exit the year. So the seasonal trends in the business are going to look a little bit different as the mix in the business shifts. With respect to COVID in particular, our best estimate at this point in time is that we're going to see about a 10% impact to new patient starts in the fourth quarter. If we navigate that more successfully, then terrific, there's going to be some upside to the number, but that's our best estimate at this point in time. And then, I think that the other thing to consider is the fact that we put in place the patient assistance program that really hasn't had an impact on the overall results just yet. We saw it start to take place in Q3, but it didn't impact us in a material way, but if you think about it, that was put in place to help those patients who ended up being unemployed or just couldn't afford the product in general. And most of that started to happen back in the second quarter, as COVID really started to take place. And if you think through that scenario, we've got patients who would go on to COBRA for a period of two or three months, they typically would make their last purchase of a quarter's worth of supply, so another three months of product. And that puts them right into the fourth quarter when they're going to be making their next purchase, which is when they would now be coming on to the Patient Assistance Program. So our belief is that's going to be a bit more impactful in the fourth quarter than what we've seen in other quarters. I think when you take those sorts of things into consideration and when you try to quantify those, if you were to exclude them, you'd see a growth rate right back in line with what you've seen year-to-date. We've contemplated the G7 launch ever since we started negotiating contracts for G6. We don't view this as a big changeover for us. If anything, our team will be more than ready to do this in the field when time happens. And as it gets closer as we go through the next bidding cycle, inevitably, our team will well flow G7, there will be some payers who will go to dual pricing even though G7 is not approved, others will want to wait until the product is approved, the policies vary across the board. But we've contemplated the G7 launch and all the G6 work that we've done. So we have a model going forward that will be easy to repeat. Yeah, Raj, great question. We couldn't be more excited about where we've been able to take the cost profile of our G6 product. And keep in mind, we're doing that at a time where we've created record inventory levels for the company, which just opened up more and more growth potential and growth avenues for the organization that we can start to pursue. So we're excited about that. We're currently at our lowest cost point to date on G6. And I think there's quite a bit of runway still in front of us with respect to take cost out of that product, particularly as we keep pushing significant volumes through the plant. As you look at the cost profile, I believe we can get to a profile that is less than $1 a day cost for the product, regardless of whether that's G6 or G7. Keep in mind, G7 from the very beginning of time was designed with cost in mind and the ability to get to a lower cost profile than G6. And so while we're making tremendous progress on G6, the ability to replicate that and do even better with G7 is something that we fully believe in our ability to do. Now that being said, G7 will be more expensive in the early stages as we're ramping capacity. But at scale, it will be a lower cost profile for us than G6. So I think there's still quite a bit of good runway in front of us. The teams are focused on driving cost out of the product. We're redesigning manufacturing process where we can take manual efforts and move them to automated efforts. We're moving into lower cost jurisdictions. We've renegotiated cost points with many of our vendors as they've taken advantage of larger volumes as well we've redesigned the logistics and distribution model that we utilize as well, taking cost out. So I don't think we're anywhere close to having realized the full benefit of all of that just yet, but you're starting to see it play through. To the degree that we continue to navigate through price headwinds will somewhat impact how high that gross margin can go. But at the very least, it lets us combat those sorts of things. So we're excited about where we're at on the cost side. Yes. With respect to international, early signs are starting to point to the fact that new patient numbers are starting to step back up, clearly, not back at the levels they used to be at, but we are seeing those start to trend back up the way we would expect them to, over time. So we're seeing some good progress there. And clearly, that's in those markets that have the administrative burdens placed upon that are bit heavier in those markets where you're utilizing something like the e-commerce platform, we've seen terrific results there. Yes, Larry. We're not going to talk about 2021 on the call today. Clearly, we believe there's tremendous opportunity for growth in front of us, given just the fact that there's so much awareness to continue to be had around our product. I think we've been clear from a profitability side. We're going to be disciplined in this organization, and we're going to make the right investments where we need to, to open up new growth channels into the future. And all of that will be contemplated in the guidance that we ultimately end up providing for 2021, but we're not going to do that today."

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We entered the second quarter with several areas of uncertainty as COVID-19 quickly spread, and I\u2019m incredibly proud of how the DexCom teams have responded. We established three pillars for our organization, to ensure the safety of our employees, to maintain service continuity for our customers, who rely on their G6 CGM systems. And third, to do our part to assist our communities as we address this novel virus. We are executing well on all three of these measures. And the results are indicated in our second quarter financial and operational performance. Total revenue grew 35% on a constant currency basis in the second quarter, driven by our significant growth in new patient additions over the past year. This represents more than $115 million of absolute dollar growth over the same period in 2019. This growth includes steady traction in the type 2 market, where we continue to see strong new patient additions as coverage expands. As of the close of the second quarter, the type 2 patient population exceeds 20% of our total US patient base, reflecting our growing traction as market access expands. Even with rising CGM awareness, there remain many people who continue to rely on fingersticks to manage diabetes, and we believe that there remains a significant opportunity for growth ahead in our core type 1 and type 2 intensive markets. As we discussed in April, new patients were slowed at the start of the quarter as clinicians transitioned to support their patients via telemedicine. We did see a nice recovery in new patient additions in late April and over the remainder of the quarter. Especially in the U.S. with our sales and patient care teams, doing a great job to ensure that both customers and clinicians were aware of the full set of DexCom tools to enable virtual care. The strength of our core business also reflects our focus on the service experience that we provide. Whether through our pharmacy channel initiative, the scaling of our customer support organization or the user interface and tools we built to our software solution, we are prioritizing the needs of our customers. We are now two years into the launch of our G6 system and the feedback that we continue to receive from our patients is incredible. In fact, Net Promoter Scores for G6 have now reached all-time highs according to both third-party industry analysis as well as our own internal measurements. This includes the most recent dQ&A industry survey of type 1 and type 2 intensive patients, in which G6 received a Net Promoter Score of 83. Well ahead of our competitors and in line with the initial results that we saw immediately after the launch of G6 in 2018. Our scores have been especially high among new Medicare customers, where the transition to our no fingerstick G6 system has been very well received by both Type 1 and Type 2 intensive users. Our customers are achieving these results while paying an out-of-pocket cost that is comparable more often less than the out-of-pocket cost of our largest competitor. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, G6 has the lowest out-of-pocket cost for Medicare patients and will be at parity with any other CGM classified as a Class II ICGM by the FDA. The pharmacy channel has also proven to be a wonderful option for many of our customers and remains our preferred long-term channel. For customers using pharmacy benefits now, nearly 70% have an out-of-pocket cost less than $60 per month and 30% pay no out-of-pocket cost. Notably, this data is based upon the first five months of 2020, when patients are more likely to have deductibles still outstanding. As you can see, our products continue to demonstrate their ability to perform in real world settings and drive patient outcomes at affordable levels. This includes the use of DexCom CGM in additional populations beyond those with an insulin intensive diabetes. As we mentioned on the first quarter call, on April 1st, we received an allowance from the FDA to provide DexCom CGM to hospitals during the COVID crisis, allowing for remote monitoring on any of their hospitalized patients. Our primary goal in this initiative was and continues to be the assistance of frontline workers during the pandemic, and the team has been working continually with sites to get CGM implemented. We have made great progress to date in training hospitals and the feedback we have received from the care teams has been great. An example, near to us in San Diego Scripps Health, published a case study on their use of DexCom G6 since the start of the COVID pandemic and highlighted several encouraging points. The use of G6 was eagerly embraced by the hospital and nursing teams with high rates of satisfaction among patients as well. Early data indicates a trend toward reduced incidence of low- and high glucose values across all patients who use CGM. And specific to COVID-19 patients, visits into the patient's rooms have been decreased by 30% to 50% during the length of stay, saving valuable equipment and also reducing viral exposure for the hospital staff. As we stated previously, our hospital efforts were not a material driver of revenue in the second quarter, and we do not expect it to be for the current year. But the data that we are generating is invaluable as we assess the regulatory pathway forward for this important market. Whether it is the shift to telemedicine, the hospital initiative or our efforts to expand access for the Type 2 population with our various partnerships, our team continues to press forward in the midst of the challenges brought on by COVID. We've successfully doubled G6 capacity in the first half of the year, putting us in a great position operationally to address the significant market opportunities ahead of us. G6 is a platform technology. During the past 12 months, we have seen the launch of a very successful automated insulin delivery system at Tandem, significant progress at Insulet and other automated insulin delivery partners, introduction of the first daily enabled [ph] MDI systems, utilization in an app developed specifically for the Type 2 diabetes program at UnitedHealthcare and the recent launch of G6 Pro to meet a very important market need. We plan for numerous customer experience and product enhancement, as well as new market opportunities for this platform over the next two years, and many of these initiatives will be incorporated into the G7 platform going forward. And finally, on to G7, where we are pressing forward on several fronts. As we said on the last call, COVID-19 has affected our time lines on this project. Specifically, pivotal studies would be delayed for at least six months due to uncertainty at the clinics. And we are going to be fully ready for G6 conversion when we launch. Some G7 manufacturing scale activities have been delayed, as some of our vendors shut down for meaningful periods of time. And let me remind you, we are going to be fully ready for a G7 conversion when we launch. And a very small amount of G6 equipment can be used for G7. I am not going to provide you a specific clinical trial, filing and launch dates today. In this competitive world, we have no interest in sharing our playbook with the entire industry. There will not be a limited launch of G7 in 2020. Such a launch would not provide a meaningful financial impact and rushing to accommodate such a launch would ultimately delay our long-term plans. Design of the hardware sensor and electronics is locked and the G7 algorithm is complete. We have used our extra time to add some great enhancements to the system. We are back in the clinics. We are in the process of finalizing clinical sites and timing for the US and OUS pivotal studies. Our first fully automated G7 line is up in San Diego. Additional, G7 automation equipment is arriving regularly in San Diego, Mesa and at third-party contract manufacturers. I will now turn the call over to Quentin, for a review of our financials.\nQuentin Blackford: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today\u2019s earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2020, we reported worldwide revenue of $451.8 million compared to $336.4 million for the second quarter of 2019, representing an absolute dollar increase of more than $115 million and growth of 34% on a reported basis and 35% on a constant currency basis. The strong growth continued despite some of the challenges posed early in the quarter by the pandemic with continued new patient growth reflecting the overall momentum behind real-time CGM in both the Type 1 and Type 2 patient populations. As Kevin noted, we are meeting this shift toward real-time CGM with a product in G6 that customers love, leading to our record Net Promoter Score levels. Our US business remained very strong in the second quarter with growth of 38% over the second quarter of 2019. This growth extended across all three of our primary US channels, pharmacy, DME and Medicare. Pharmacy remains the fastest-growing channel among the three, and our teams continue to prioritize this as a key component of our long-term strategy based on the benefits provided to DexCom, clinicians and especially our customers. The majority of national plans and PBMs are now covering DexCom via the pharmacy benefit with many incorporating a dual pharmacy and DME benefit. Our international business grew 22% in the second quarter on a constant currency basis, with consistent growth across our direct and distributor markets. We did see a greater impact to new patients in certain international markets as a result of COVID in the second quarter compared to the US. Unlike the first quarter, the reduced access for in-clinic visits for new patients did not allow us to offset our anticipated second quarter price impact with the same degree of volume gains. However, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, as we saw improvement throughout the quarter with new patient growth recovering and our direct markets returning to strong growth in June, as well as distributor orders beginning to rebound early in the third quarter. We are creating streamlined pathways for new patients to access DexCom CGM through different channels in our international markets. Building from the successful launch of our Canadian e-commerce platform, which drove record new patient growth following its launch in 2019, we recently expanded the e-commerce opportunity to our UK market and are encouraged by the similar early results. Canada and the UK were amongst our highest growth markets in the second quarter. Our second quarter gross profit was $289.7 million or 64.1% of revenue compared to 61.4% of revenue in the second quarter of 2019. The gross margin was sequentially consistent with our Q1 performance and consistent with the expectations that we noted on the Q1 call for a more muted improvement between Q1 and Q4 of 2020 as we continue to ramp costs associated with the introduction of our G7 lines. Importantly, we now have our first G7 line in place in producing product for clinical trials. The 270-basis point year-over-year margin improvement was driven primarily by product design developments, most notably our lower cost transmitter. Operating expenses were $213 million for Q2 2020 compared to $200.3 million in Q2 2019. This reflects an increase of 6% year-over-year and a 1240 basis point reduction as a percent of revenue from the second quarter of 2019. As an organization, we continue to make great strides as we invest in the initiatives that will drive DexCom's long-term growth. While also remaining disciplined as an organization, and this is evident in our second quarter results. Just as COVID did impact our topline, it also had an impact on certain spending activities, which resulted in some of the operating margin improvement during the quarter and was therefore, temporary in nature. As a result, we expect moderation in the year-over-year margin comparisons in the second half of the year as we invest in several key initiatives for the company, including the G7 clinical trials, G7 manufacturing scale up, our new market efforts and direct-to-consumer advertising that we began to accelerate late in the second quarter. Operating income was $76.7 million or 17% of revenue in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $6.2 million or 1.8% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of more than 1,500 basis points in operating margin for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $122.6 million or 27.1% of revenue for the second quarter compared to $45.9 million or 13.6% of revenue for the second quarter of 2019. Net income for the second quarter was $77.1 million or $0.79 per share. Over the past two years, we have made tremendous progress, towards becoming a profitable company. As a result, it is now becoming evident that we're going to be able to utilize the significant historic tax benefits that we have accrued over time. And we are approaching a position where in the near future, we expect to release the valuation allowance that we have been required to place against many of our tax benefits in the past. This is something that we have been in front of and planning for, including the implementation of a global tax structure over the last couple of years that will allow us to continue to expand rapidly and efficiently on a global basis. As we set expectations for 2021, we will look to provide clarity around our annual tax rate expectations and leverage the benefits associated with the tax structure we put in place, in contemplation of such an event. In early May, we took advantage of market conditions to further solidify our balance sheet, with a new convertible note offering. On the strength of the offering, we closed the quarter in a great financial position with more than $2.5 billion of cash, utilizing a combination of the cash generated from the convertible note offering, as well as DexCom's stock, we redeemed the majority of our 2022 convertible notes, in the second quarter and will redeem the remainder later this week. Our cash position leaves us in great shape to pursue the growth opportunities ahead of us, including support of the development of new markets, opportunistic investment and capabilities that complement our growth, and capital allocation into our G7 scale up and Malaysian manufacturing facility. As we look to the second half of the year, there remains several areas of uncertainty as we contemplate the continuation of the COVID pandemic and its global impact, including employment rates, and update of our patient assistance program in the US. Nevertheless, based on our experience in the second quarter, the tools that our teams have developed to support virtual patient care and the growing clinical awareness of the value of CGM, particularly in the current environment, we believe there is enough visibility to reinstate full year guidance. We now expect 2020 revenue to be approximately $1.85 billion, representing growth of 25% over 2019. This represents an increase of $100 million from the midpoint of our initial 2020 guidance, resulting from the strength of the business in the first half of the year. Our teams have responded well and continued to drive new patient adoption and ensure the satisfaction of our existing patients. Given the recent uptick in COVID cases globally and in the US in particular, our guidance assumes approximately 75% to 80% of our original expectations for global new patients in the back half of the year, which was consistent with what we had experienced in late March and into April, at the outset of the COVID outbreak globally. Turning to margins, we now anticipate the following non-GAAP results to meet or exceed the following levels, which are ahead of what we established at the start of the year, including, increasing gross margin, expectations to meet or exceed 65% and representing a steady improvement over 2019. This includes costs associated with the initial development of our Malaysian manufacturing facility, and support of the growth of our international business and is in line with our long-term expectations for gross margins in the mid-60s. We are now increasing operating margin expectations to meet or exceed 14%. This revised guidance contemplates the increased second half spending associated with the initiatives that I previously mentioned, yet still demonstrating annually year-over-year improvement, as we leverage our strong top our strong top line results. Finally, we are increasing our expected adjusted EBITDA margins, to meet or exceed 24% for the year. Our team has done a great job to execute on our goal of doubling G6 capacity in the first half of 2020, despite an extraordinarily difficult and unanticipated operating environment, putting the company in its best position since the launch of G6 to meet the many opportunities in front of us. And we now look forward to replicating that momentum with the scale-up of our G7 lines. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update.\nSteve Pacelli: Thanks, Quentin. We continue to make great strides in executing on our strategic priorities even as we navigate the current environment with the utmost care for the health of our employees, the continued service of our patients and assistance to our communities. The doubling of G6 capacity in the first half of the year has placed us in a great position to creatively target new customers and extend the launch of G6 in several of our existing markets. We are gaining steady traction among type 2 insulin-intensive customers, building from our efforts to drive expanded access beyond Medicare into payers as we've seen with UnitedHealthcare and more recently, Aetna, both of which now provide access to the pharmacy. At the recent virtual ADA conference, we presented encouraging data on a subset of our type 2 intensive patients after their first 12 weeks of usage of G6. The data demonstrated average A1C reduction of 1.5%, significant improvement to quality of life metrics and 95% customer satisfaction with G6. COVID has also brought a clear focus to the long-term potential for CGM and the importance of glycemic control. We've spoken at length about the large market opportunities ahead for DexCom, including our focus on the broader type 2 market, hospital use and use during pregnancy. The fact that all 3 of these populations have now received exemptions to allow for broader access to DexCom CGM during the pandemic provides validation for these new market expansions. In early April, the FDA made a special allowance to permit the use of CGM in the hospital setting. In early May, we saw a special ruling from CMS to allow access to all people with diabetes who are diagnosed with COVID-19. And earlier this month, Health Canada issued an interim order for the use of G6 for all women with diabetes who are pregnant during the pandemic, and more and more data continue to emerge supporting these decisions and the value of CGM beyond the intensive insulin-using population. At ADA, our partners at Onduo presented data comparing the impact of CGM versus non-CGM use in their virtual diabetes clinic. While both cohorts or patients ultimately saw a significant A1C decrease. The group using DexCom G6 are reduction nearly 2x as much as those not using CGM. In addition earlier this month, UnitedHealthcare announced the expansion of their level 2 digital health therapy to more than 230,000 people with type 2 diabetes. This program, which utilizes G6 as a core component, saw great results in United's initial pilot work, including flinty significant A1C reduction for those with a baseline A1C greater than 8 and significant reductions to medication usage with some participants even achieving remission and no longer needing medication. We are pressing forward in support of our various partnerships to reach the whole type 2 population including our work with UnitedHealthcare, Intermountain Healthcare, Livongo, Waldo, Onduo and others. We are also excited about the launch of our G6 professional product, which has several appealing use cases as we explore the full value of our CGM platform. We are also excited about the launch of our G6 professional product, which has several appealing use cases as we explore the full value of our CGM platform. The product provides a natural extension into the type 2 non-intensive market by leveraging the strong existing reimbursement framework for professional CGM with a tool that empowers clinicians. G6 Pro gives doctors the flexibility to assess a patient's glycemic health in real-time for all patients with diabetes. As a single-use product, G6 Pro will also serve as a great introduction for a patient looking to experience the functionality of DexCom CGM. G6 Pro can also be prescribed for use in blinded mode where the patient does not see the real-time data to all people, ages 2 years, not just people with diabetes, providing all people with the opportunity to assess their glycemic health. Our strategy of prioritizing interoperability and patient choice continues to leave us well positioned as the insulin delivery market shifts toward commercial connected devices. In early May, we signed an agreement to collaborate with Ypsomed, adding another key partner to our existing partners in Eli Lilly, Insulet, Novo Nordisk and Tandem Diabetes.\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Steve. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then re-enter the queue if necessary. Adrianne, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay?\nKevin Sayer: We can, perfect.\nJeff Johnson: Great. Thanks for all the information on the call and congratulations on the quarter. So Kevin and Steve, you both touched on hospital and pregnancy, gestational use. I guess what I'd love to hear an update on is maybe the pathway and timelines to maybe extending some of those reimbursements to more of a permanent nature, whether that's Canada, the UK, where we've seen some of the movement on gestational over the last year or even in the US. Just again, pathway and timelines on how we should think about when those can become more permanent contributors to the model? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: You bet. I\u2019ll take that, Jeff. On the hospital side, we are really now just starting to gather data from the centers that use CGM. When we started the whole hospital initiative, it was just let\u2019s get the product out there and help the staff at the hospitals and also make patients healthier. And we navigated through a series of things that we really didn\u2019t anticipate very well, such as the IT systems of the hospital and things of that nature. So we\u2019re now starting to gather data. We also have learned, interestingly enough that a lot of the hospitals, even though they all got the same product, had different protocols in a different way that use CGM. Some of these centers would put it on anybody with diabetes. Somebody would put anybody with elevated glucose levels, and others would take the approach. We're not going to do this until somebody's really sick. So we\u2019re going to learn more about the protocols and how it was used. And to start gathering data about the sensor and how it works, and also, we\u2019re going to try and gather data with respect to how these patients were treated from a drug side as well. Anecdotally, what we\u2019ve heard is our product performed in the hospital the way we thought it would, that its accuracy and performance really wasn\u2019t affected by the compounds used to treat these patients. And we should have a pretty good picture of where it is. We\u2019ve not had any additional discussions with the agency on the hospital data yet, because we really haven\u2019t had anything in a form that we could present that would start us down a path. As far as next steps in the hospital, will take - we still have the ability to use the product in the system and with COVID not going away, I think we\u2019ll be able to gather more data. And now that we\u2019ve been through this initial wave of learning, we'll probably get better data and more data and know what we're looking for going forward and put together data, we\u2019ll present that to the FDA, and at the same time, we'll present them what the plan as to what we think we need to do next. That\u2019s going to be a while. And - but we\u2019ve got some time to gather more data. On the gestational side and the pregnancy side, we have seen some countries open up and say, hey, let\u2019s go do this, the U K and Canada that you pointed out. We\u2019ve had very detailed discussions with the FDA as to what we need to do on the pregnancy side to get that label, and we are working on that. We all know the product works very well in pregnancy. All you\u2019ve got to do is go to social media and see the DexCom\u2019s patients who have had a child that they never thought they would have, who have diabetes of our type 1 patients on gestational side, we think our opportunity is outstanding, not only from a manage those patients who have gestational diabetes as a predictor of those who may in fact, get it. And again, we are running studies. There are studies being run by many others to determine what that model looks like. I think our first step there, Jeff, is we need to get just a pregnancy indication with the FDA rather than specific gestational one. And then head down the line to develop a product and a platform that fits into that market on a cost effective and a positive outcome basis, but we're very optimistic that it will.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Your line is open.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the quarter and maybe just kind of understand any differences you\u2019re seeing in underlying the patient behavior or patient demand in states or geographies that have high levels of COVID currently or any states or geographies that don't. I'm just trying to understand how much of an impact we saw to new patient starts with respect to your COVID in the quarter and how we should think about the potential for the rising case volumes, potentially increase in the second half of the year?\nKevin Sayer: Yeah, we didn\u2019t quantify exactly what we believe the impact to be in the second quarter, but we tried to give some color and it\u2019s the foundation for how we thought about the back half of the year as well. If you look at the end of March and into April, new patient starts when COVID was really starting to ramp at that point in time was roughly 75% of kind of that normal range that we would have expected. So you saw about a 25% impact on the new patient starts at that point in time. Now I will say over the course of the quarter, end of June, we saw that rebound nicely back in line with previous expectations, as things started to come under a bit of control. Now we saw it pick up a little bit in July as the COVID cases have increased a bit more that we\u2019re all aware of, and we were very clear in our guidance that we\u2019re assuming roughly 75% to 80% of new patient starts throughout the back half of the year. That's the best data point we have at this point in time. So I would just take you back to that reference point of 75%, 80% roughly, new patient starts throughout the month of April, is kind of how we saw the impact in the quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ryan Blicker from Cowen. Your line is open.\nRyan Blicker: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the recent launch of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s level 2 program? How significant of a catalyst is this for non-intensive type 2 adoption in the US? And do you believe that this program together with Intermountain data that you've shared suggests that CGM use - will be more frequent and sustained among non-intensive type 2 patients over the long-term than the intermittent use case you\u2019ve historically discussed?\nSteve Pacelli: Yeah. I think - this is Steve. It's certainly evolving, but I think these are all validating points for us, right, that certainly, UnitedHealthcare serves more than 230,000 non-insulin taking type 2 patients and we would hope that over time, that program has expanded pretty dramatically beyond where it is today. We're in the midst of just continuing to capture data and prove out the value of this technology in the non-intensive patient population. We know we have something there. We know it's important. Whether it becomes a real-time all-the-time use case, over time, it very well could be. We're seeing some very positive outcomes for people using it for, frankly, a longer period of time than maybe we would have cited previously. So there is an opportunity. Reimbursement is still in its infancy in the non-insulin-using patient population, so we've not only got to prove the outcomes, we've got to get the product paid for. So it's still not even the balance of this year, not going to be a material piece of the business, but it's going to continue to grow over the coming years, for sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bobby Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBobby Marcus: Thanks. Appreciate the question and congrats on a good quarter. Quen, I want to maybe spend a little bit on the guidance here. You touched on new patient expectations. Usually, at the beginning of the year, at JPMorgan, when you give guidance, you give us a little flavor for how we should think about revenue per patient and the headwind expected there for throughout the year as you shift into pharmacy and restructure some of your negotiations on price and international, so I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more flavors, we're halfway through the year, what's baked into guidance? And also, if you could spend some time walking us through the bottom-line expectations. You put a fantastic adjusted EBITDA this quarter. How much of that really is the new baseline? And if you could quantify how much was just deferred spending that we should expect in the back part of the year. Thanks.\nQuentin Blackford: Great. So with respect to the first part of that question around top line and revenue per patient or maybe the pricing headwinds that we've talked about historically, certainly, we came into the year with an expectation that, that was going to be somewhere around $125 million to $150 million, likely being around $125 million to $150 million, range. I can tell you that based upon where we saw price come in, in Q2, it was right in line with our expectation. We have not changed our pricing assumption, our full year guidance at this point in time, we still expect it to be around that $150 million range. So not anything significant in terms of a change there, the strategy we've put in place, to step this down over time continues to play out exactly as we had expected. So that continues to be consistent. With respect to the bottom line, we\u2019ve made incredible progress from a profitability perspective, really over the last call it, four or five quarters now, with nearly 1,500 basis points of improvement in operating margin profile in Q2 alone. There\u2019s no question that some of the spending was impacted in the quarter, particularly around efforts like DTC as we started to pull back some of that early in the quarter just with the uncertainty around how COVID was going to impact things over the course of the quarter and into the back part of the year. I will tell you, we did start that back up in early Q3. So you're going to see incremental spending in the back half of the year around things like DTC. The other thing to keep in mind that\u2019s going to impact your spending trends that won't allow the same kind of improvement in Q2 to play through in the back half of the year is the fact that we're starting up the G7 trials. We\u2019ve been very open and deliberate about the spend that's going to go into that. We\u2019re putting forward quite a bit of resources around standing up those manufacturing capabilities and ensuring that capacity is going to be there right out of the gate. We do have the first line-up. There's incremental lines coming right behind it as we speak and building out that entire supply chain capability. And then finally, we\u2019ve already spent some time talking about it on the call today, but you look at opportunities like hospital, gestational. Those are significant revenue drivers for us into the future. We\u2019re going to make sure that we're spending in those areas, to ensure that open those up and provide for growth into the future. So we are going to spend in the back part of the year. You\u2019re not going to see the same sort of improvement. But at the same time, we\u2019re committed that over time, we will continue to mature as an organization. We're going to step towards the long-term goals of profitability that we've laid out. And I think we've made great progress towards it, but you're not going to see these sorts of improvement every single quarter. I think you need to look at it over a period of time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on the type 2 mix this quarter. The 20% number seemed pretty strong and it seems like it's increasing. So, can you guys give us any sense around where these patients are coming from? Are they top prescribers for DexCom or other T1s? Or anything on patient profile, new to CGM or early adopters? Long story short, as we look at that T2 growth, even within the intensive population going into the back end of this year and into next. Is it push or pull? Or is it getting easier at all? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: This is Kevin. I\u2019ll take that. It is getting easier. And I think the biggest catalyst in all this was when we got Medicare approval a while ago, and now we\u2019re getting Medicare awareness with these insulin-using patients because a large number of insulin-using patients in this type 2 population are, in fact, Medicare patients. So, that has been a big catalyst for growth, particularly as we\u2019ve gotten better at serving and taking care of those patients. I think the other catalyst is just the approvals we were seeing from some of the large payers. Steve pointed out, UnitedHealthcare covering type 2 patients on intensive insulin recently, again, giving more patients access to it. As these patients are having positive outcomes, access is growing and they\u2019re matching the CMS approvals that we've already received. So, it\u2019s coming across the board and it\u2019s not coming to us from our primary prescribers, they are coming from everywhere. Many of these patients don\u2019t even see endocrinologists. So, they\u2019re finding out about DexCom and coming to us directly because of our marketing efforts and because what they\u2019ve heard word of mouth or what they\u2019ve seen from others. We\u2019ve always felt this would be a great use of our technology, and it's proving to be exactly that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess, just on the international business, it looks like that\u2019s probably the only place you could really pick at here. Quentin, can you just summarize why the growth was a bit slower than historical trend? You seem to infer that trends in the direct market picked up in June and in distributor markets in July. Can we assume that you expect a greater than seasonal impact in international sales in the second half?\nQuentin Blackford: Yeah, it's a fair question. I think it\u2019s a bit premature to speak to that fact in terms of playing out over the course of Q3 with respect to the distributor orders. Certainly, we saw those orders start to come through and in the third quarter. I think the question becomes based upon what was happening with COVID in the broader environment today, do we see that actually rebound and double up in terms of the orders in Q3 or does everything just kind of defer and push a bit. Our guidance would contemplate the fact that it pushes at this point in time. Just based upon the best information that we have. If it were to all come in and terrific, I think we'd be very happy. Just a little bit of color around that OUS result. I think what you're seeing there is very comparable to what the broader marketplace and the industry realized over the course of the quarter as well. I think if you look at the data points that have been put out there by our competitors, thus far, they saw a slowdown in growth in Q2 in their international business, just as we did sequentially, absolute dollars step down from Q1 into Q2, which we certainly saw as well, but the broad market saw the same thing. So, I don\u2019t think you're seeing anything that's unique to DexCom. I think over time, we remain as bullish as ever on the international opportunity. We\u2019ve stated the fact that we\u2019re going to step down price over time in the international space as well. And when you have a quarter like Q2 where the ability for new patients to get into the clinic and come on to the product becomes a bit muted, you see a bit more of a pronounced impact. So, that\u2019s all part of a long-term strategy that we believe in and are very bullish around. So, we\u2019re still very, very optimistic and excited about that international business, but that's a bit of color that played out in Q2. And with respect to Q3, our view is that things probably push. But if we see it rebound, it\u2019s been great, there's upside to the number.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon and nice quarter. ADA seems like a million years ago now \u2013 June, but can you give us an idea of what the key things were that you walked away from that you think we'll be talking about over the next 18 months?\nKevin Sayer: Yeah, I\u2019ll take that one. I think, again, the walk away from ADA is how important CGM has become in all this. Almost every presentation you went to every presentation we saw the performance of drugs, the performance of other systems is based on CGM data. From DexCom's perspective, obviously, the drive of the automated insulin delivery systems was largely driven by DexCom sensors, regardless of who the presenter was up at the pulpit other than Medtronic and we can see our sensor can drive great outcomes there. I think the other takeaway is we\u2019re not stopping innovation in diabetes. Everybody is still pushing forward, and we still think there's better ways to attack this. This is a big cost and healthcare problem in our country and around the world. And I don't think anybody is going to slow down. But - our biggest takeaway, compare that to your first ADA, Joanne, where we had to beg for anybody even listened to us. And now every place we go and just our industry growth, CGM has become the dominant technology here across all of the diabetes treatments. And we're looking forward to just continuing to be better.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Jason on for Matt. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter here. Kevin or Steve, a higher-level question on the non-intensive side. I appreciate some of the comments you made, but I hope you can discuss maybe how you perceive these models or programs evolving over the next few years? Do you expect the revenue model to be similar to what you see with the intensely managed population? Or do you expect it to take different forms with maybe some possible risk-sharing or shared cost saving developments? Just anything you can offer there and how you see the contracts coming together over time, now that you've been engaged with payers and other partners on various models. Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yeah. This is Kevin. I'll add a bit to Steve\u2019s comments earlier. We don\u2019t see one solution yet. We are working with a number of partners on the payer front. We\u2019re working with clinics. We\u2019re working with a lot of these diabetes management systems as well to provide CGM data to that to figure out what the best model for these patients is. We\u2019re not only working with these partners, but we\u2019re doing a lot of market research on our own. And one of Steve\u2019s comments that is becoming very evident in all the work that we do is type 2 patients are more than open to wearing CGM and learning what's going on with their bodies. They want a different experience than we offer today for the Type 1 patients connecting to insulin pumps and Bluetooth pens and sophisticated predictive alerts and alarms and things like that we have today are not as important to that group. But what is important to that group is that they're healthy and that we can reduce their meds, we can reduce their cost, that we can make their physician visits more productive and we can make changes in their help that save them these complications over the years. So I think what you\u2019ll see is we\u2019ll continue to pursue all these models, at the same time, we're going to pursue the proper product configuration. And reimbursement models for us. I\u2019ve been in numerous discussions where we ask, if we get paid X for an intensive patient for a year, what should we - what should be the reimbursement rate for non-intensive type 2 because the fact is we aren\u2019t saving their life on a near term basis. With an alert and alarm, we are not giving them something that determines their drug dosing decision, but we are giving information to better manage their lives. So, we think there may ultimately be a different class of product here and a different form of reimbursement even patients wear them all the time, which is, again, another reason we\u2019re investing so much in scale here, because we like these things everywhere. I think the market is developing nicely and the constant thread coming from all these approaches, if this thing works.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to touch on the hospital channel a bit more, I\u2019d just love to hear how you\u2019re going to approach the commercial aspect longer term, you don\u2019t really have reps in the hospital. Do you need a partner there? Or are you planning to build out a separate sales force? And also, I don't know if you\u2019re willing to say the revenues generated in the half of this quarter that was a few million dollars or more than that.\nQuentin Blackford: The revenues in the hospital wouldn't have a significant impact on the financials. The costs are exceeded the revenue. So, we\u2019ll leave it at that. With respect to the channel, we\u2019ve not made a decision there as far as how we\u2019d pursue that. We are early enough in this process that we're not ready to adopt a commercial model. We want to leave our options open. We would explore partners. We would explore doing it ourselves. But we\u2019ll figure out where to best use our dollars. And then we haven't made a decision there yet.\nOperator: And the next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDavid Lewis: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Quentin, just a quick follow-up here for you on guidance. So, in the second half, you're effectively assuming that new patient start rates are similar to sort of the trough of COVID, even though there probably has been some improvement and you're not assuming any distributors sort of recoup in ex-US markets. And just kind of related to that, can you just give us a sense ex-US whether this was country-specific or just broadly ex-US? Because our sense is maybe Germany performed differently than Canada, performed differently than France. So, those two quick ones? Thank you.\nQuentin Blackford: Yeah. I think in the prepared remarks, we were pretty clear with the fact that we saw COVID did impact certain countries a little bit differently than others. UK and Canada performed incredibly well, particularly on the e-commerce platform that we had put in place. Germany certainly was impacted in our distributor markets were certainly impacted. On the distributor point, again, I think it's just too early to tell if that's going to double up in Q3 or if that's just going to be simply something that pushes out over the course of the remainder of the year. I think at some point in time, it will catch up to itself, and we'll be back on that same trajectory. It's just too hard to predict if that happens in the next six months or not. And our guidance would be based off the fact that it does not, that it's been pushed. That's kind of how we thought about it. So - and then your point on just the new patient starts in the back half of the year. Like I said, we're trying to create some clarity for you guys in the back half of the year around what we're confident that we can deliver on. We're using the best data points that we have from our experience. And that 75% to 80% new patients start as what we realized early in the second quarter as COVID was kind of starting to really gain some traction. We've seen COVID numbers increasing here recently in the third quarter as well. And so that's the best data point that we have. So, that's how we went about putting the numbers together. Obviously, if we can navigate through that more effectively or to a better degree, then there's going to be opportunity in the guidance number, but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves at this point.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, as you mentioned upfront, Medicare is not enforcing the clinical criteria for CGM during the pandemic. It's unclear if this applies to all type 1 and type 2 patients are just those affected by COVID. How broadly physicians interpreted this rule? And what impact have you seen in the market? And do you expect CMS to continue to allow this exception through next year. Thanks for taking the question.\nKevin Sayer: You bet. We do not believe it's had an exceptional impact on our business, as far as bringing more Medicare patients to the table. And \u2013 but they are coming. On a broad scale basis, as we look at the Medicare ruling, we would be very pleased if we could get the criteria for Medicare patients much more condensed and much more realistic. We actually met on that this morning. And one of the things pointed out yet again to me is, Medicare requires our patients to document that they do four fingersticks a day before they go to CGM and our patients only reimbursed for three fingersticks a day by CMS. So there are large inconsistencies there. And this is a product that has tremendous impact with these patients. It would certainly be our goal to have these coverage criteria and the steps that patients have to go through to get CGM simplified and more broadly applied across all of diabetes. But that's something we're working on now, and I can't anticipate where CMS is going to go. But it certainly makes sense that we do that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on another very strong quarter. Just a quick question on the type 2s. I think you mentioned it's now 20%. I think you said of your installed base, correct me if I'm wrong, maybe you said new patient adds. But how has that changed versus the year ago period? Just trying to get a sense of how that might be growing?\nKevin Sayer: Yeah. No, it's certainly increasing nicely, particularly as we continue to focus in that particular area. The 20% is of the installed base. So we didn't give a sense in terms of the overall growth in that particular area. But we've talked about our focus there in opening up those channels. And I think the fact that we're now talking about it just indicates the progress that we're making there. So that's the extent of the detail we've given around it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew Blackman from Stifel. Your line is open.\nMathew Blackman: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. And Quentin, thanks for the color on new patient start headwinds. I was hoping you could extend those comments, the installed base. Was any notable change in attrition or utilization rates during the quarter or the first half of 2020? And are you making any changes to how you're thinking about those same attrition utilization risks in this new guidance? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yeah. Great question. We didn't really see anything over the course of Q2. But to be fair, I think, it's probably a bit early to really understand whether or not we will see an impact. And therefore, we have contemplated something in our guidance in the back part of the year around our patient assistance program or attrition. And keep in mind, we announced during the second quarter that we would be putting in place a patient assistance program, but that wasn't going to be effective until the third quarter. Our view is that, if a patient were going to a trip, they would likely fall into that program. So when we talk about guidance in the back half of the year, you've got a couple of things playing out there. You've got the new patient starts that we've been very clear. 75% to 80% is how we\u2019ve modeled it. But then we also are assuming that we're going to see some impact on attrition, and they're going to fall into this Patient Assistance Program, which is going to mean quite a bit less revenue to us, obviously, than what we might have normally received from them. So that's playing out in the back part as well.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Quentin, two quick model questions. First, just any numbers you could put around the expense shift from 2Q in the back half of the year. The leverage was really impressive. It would be great to have a better sense for how much of that was one time. And then can you give us any broad strokes on what you're thinking in terms of the tax rate once you start reporting one from an income statement perspective? Thanks.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes. We're not going to talk to the tax rate just yet. I think we need to get to the point where we flip that valuation allowance. We don't know exactly when that's going to be just yet, but we know that it's coming here in the near future. And the last thing I want to do is like I said, put a couple of $100 million gain through the financial statements that surprises everybody in the particular period. I think it's important to know we're out in front of this. We anticipate it. We've put a tax structure in place that's going to allow us to have a very efficient global tax structure and grow globally in a very efficient way with a very attractive tax rate. So we've been well in front of this for quite some time, and the point is just to start to put it on your radar. With respect to the other question, sorry, remind me what the other question was. OpEx in the back part of the year.\nChris Pasquale: Yes.\nQuentin Blackford: So there wasn't a significant impact that moved the needle meaningfully in the second quarter. I mean, call it, roughly $10 million or so of spend that likely would have showed up in the quarter had we not been impacted. But I think importantly, the back half of the year is where you're going to see a significant ramp in the overall spend profile, particularly with G7 clinical trials getting go and G7 scale really taking off. And then turning on the DTC spigot for the first time in a significant way. I think one of the things that maybe is not as appreciated by folks is that historically, we've always been constrained from an inventory position. We exited Q2 in the strongest inventory position that we've been in with respect to G6 in our company's history. That allows us to start to open up opportunities like DTC in a significant way that we believe can drive growth into the future. So you're going to see that play out. Spending is going to be significantly higher in the back half. When you do your modeling, it's going to be almost $100 million of spend higher in the back half. We recognize that and realize it. But those things that I just indicated are going to be the areas that we primarily focus on in our spending.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And Ravi Misra, your line is open from Berenberg Capital.\nRavi Misra: Hi. How are you doing? It's Misra. I hope everyone is okay. I just want to pick your brains a little bit more around the reimbursement for some of this less intensive insulin management patients, Steve or Kevin, can you help out to think about what's the index comps control in terms of what you think you need to do to establish that use case? In a kind of payment? Thanks.\nSteve Pacelli: Obviously, first and foremost, it's to build, as Kevin mentioned, to build the right products for this patient population. We think the products are going to be different. They're not going to have all the \u2013 there won't be nearly as \u2013 I don't want to say nearly as robust because the performance of the underlying sensor will be the same. But having some of the bells and whistles that we need for the intensive insulin population just don't apply the type 2. The software experience needs to be different. So those types of things are within our control or even, frankly, within the control of some of our partners that we've talked about, right? Livongo offers a patient experience to their patients. United, the Level 2 program is an experience that we've developed together with United, but it's really a UnitedHealthcare patient experience. So we're not going to \u2013 there's not going to be a one size fits all here. We're going to offer our own tools. We do offer our own tools today, and we're going to enable multiple players in this business to offer the appropriate tools to this patient population, because we know it's such a massive opportunity that it [inaudible] just make our sensors available to anybody who's a viable company.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi, guys. Wondering if you could provide some more color on the e-commerce initiatives that you mentioned are expanding internationally. In what ways has it helped in Canada and now U.K. during COVID in terms of driving new patients and getting them started on CGM.\nKevin Sayer: Well, certainly, I think from an access perspective, it just makes it very easy for the patient to be able to find our product available right on the web in their particular country. And in many ways, it becomes something we can scale relatively easily. And we choose new countries to take it into. And I think that when folks are searching or trying to learn about the product and then they have the ability to purchase it, right there at their fingertips in a web platform, it just makes it naturally easier to come on to the technology. And I think you see what played out in Canada in terms of record number of new patients shortly after we launched it. The early success in the UK clearly speaks to the benefit of the e-commerce platform as well. So I think it's something that we can scale over time as we take into new countries and it clearly has the benefits with it. I think you heard in the prepared remarks, nearly 70% of all of our patients come on to our product for their first time through some sort of either virtual training or online training capability or in-app capability. So the e-commerce platform kind of lends itself very naturally into that ability to come on to the product.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. This is actually Young [ph] in for Matt. Maybe a question on the DTC ads. Can you talk a little bit about the impact that might have on second half growth? What's the focus in terms of the patient segment or geographically, are you able to take advantage of lower ad rates to go a little bit more aggressive on that? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that. With respect to the ad rates and the spending, I don't get too involved in that one anymore. I leave that to the other guys. But our team is very targeted with respect to the ads that we develop, where we run them, when we run them, and we have tremendous systems in place to monitor the leads that come in from those ads. We have, again, a team in place that if you watch our ad and e-mail us a want a information. We get back to those patients very quickly. They don't wait for several days. It's a matter of hours, and we give back those patients and let them know we are here, and we will help them and educate them and want to get their insurance information, their doctor information, everything that patient might need. We do track that spending and where we spend it, we track the results from it, and then we invest in those places where we think it will be better. But we are seeing -- working from home now, we see DexCom ads wherever we watch television, a lot more than we used to. And I think they've been very successful, and our team is really good at this.\nQuentin Blackford: And I would just say, from a return on investment perspective, there's not a better investment that we can make inside of these four walls today than direct-to-consumer spending. It's amazing the capability that the team has put together in the targeted effort there to drive results.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Sayer for final remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you very much, operator, and thanks everybody again for being on our call today. We saw a headline come across our phones while we're sitting here what pandemic DexCom rocks here. I just want to tell everybody that we did have a great quarter, but we were affected by this like everybody else. Our commercial teams had to completely change the way they worked. And I had a town hall meeting with our team in the Philippines last week in the stories of some people who literally kept themselves locked up in the city for two months, away from their families to help patients are incredibly inspiring. We've all been affected by this and working from homes. And it's safe to say like everybody else, we've never experienced anything or planned for anything like this. But what an amazing six-month this company has had in this environment? I just want to list a few accomplishments over the last six months and closing today. And we completed a financing that gives us the balance sheet strength necessary to accomplish all of our long-term goals. We achieved an absolute -- worldwide absolute dollar sales growth increase of US$240 million during this chaotic time. Our type 2 business on the intensive insulin side is demonstrating strength and the outcomes we always said we'd have with these patients. We've waited a long time to execute on this plan, and we finally got into the hospital. And we think that will be a great market for us. Our financial performance is exceeding all of our plans on the bottom line, providing us with operating cash to reinvest in our business, as we talked about money that we need to spend over the next six months of the year. Our G6 satisfaction scores are at all-time highs again during this period of chaos. We have a great product supported by a very dedicated team. Let\u2019s not forget our pipeline. G7 progress is excellent. As I said earlier in the call, the groups working on this project are hitting on all cylinders. And there is nothing more exciting at DexCom than the sense of urgency related to a platform change like this that's such a monumental effort. We are redoing everything that we do now to bring this incredible product to market. G7 is not the only thing in our pipeline. We're spending numerous hours talking about G8, 9 and 10 and whatever else comes in the future, but we're also making sure we don't ignore G6. We have numerous product improvements and patient experience improvements with G6 that will be out over the next couple of years. We don't ever sit still. I just completed a series of virtual presentations for various groups here at DexCom. And one of the questions I was asked to answer is, why has the company been so successful? And I narrowed my answer down to a very simple statement. We provide a solution to a very serious problem and we do it better than anybody else ever has. As we look to the future, we can continue to do that only, we can do it much better than we do it today, and we believe we can solve many more problems in the same manner. It's going to thrill the health care community. And more importantly, we're going to save patients, caregivers, health care professional and payers' time, money and we're going to continue to save lives. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We entered the second quarter with several areas of uncertainty as COVID-19 quickly spread, and I'm incredibly proud of how the DexCom teams have responded. We established three pillars for our organization, to ensure the safety of our employees, to maintain service continuity for our customers, who rely on their G6 CGM systems. And third, to do our part to assist our communities as we address this novel virus. We are executing well on all three of these measures. And the results are indicated in our second quarter financial and operational performance. Total revenue grew 35% on a constant currency basis in the second quarter, driven by our significant growth in new patient additions over the past year. This represents more than $115 million of absolute dollar growth over the same period in 2019. This growth includes steady traction in the type 2 market, where we continue to see strong new patient additions as coverage expands. As of the close of the second quarter, the type 2 patient population exceeds 20% of our total US patient base, reflecting our growing traction as market access expands. Even with rising CGM awareness, there remain many people who continue to rely on fingersticks to manage diabetes, and we believe that there remains a significant opportunity for growth ahead in our core type 1 and type 2 intensive markets. As we discussed in April, new patients were slowed at the start of the quarter as clinicians transitioned to support their patients via telemedicine. We did see a nice recovery in new patient additions in late April and over the remainder of the quarter. Especially in the U.S. with our sales and patient care teams, doing a great job to ensure that both customers and clinicians were aware of the full set of DexCom tools to enable virtual care. The strength of our core business also reflects our focus on the service experience that we provide. Whether through our pharmacy channel initiative, the scaling of our customer support organization or the user interface and tools we built to our software solution, we are prioritizing the needs of our customers. We are now two years into the launch of our G6 system and the feedback that we continue to receive from our patients is incredible. In fact, Net Promoter Scores for G6 have now reached all-time highs according to both third-party industry analysis as well as our own internal measurements. This includes the most recent dQ&A industry survey of type 1 and type 2 intensive patients, in which G6 received a Net Promoter Score of 83. Well ahead of our competitors and in line with the initial results that we saw immediately after the launch of G6 in 2018. Our scores have been especially high among new Medicare customers, where the transition to our no fingerstick G6 system has been very well received by both Type 1 and Type 2 intensive users. Our customers are achieving these results while paying an out-of-pocket cost that is comparable more often less than the out-of-pocket cost of our largest competitor. As we've mentioned before, G6 has the lowest out-of-pocket cost for Medicare patients and will be at parity with any other CGM classified as a Class II ICGM by the FDA. The pharmacy channel has also proven to be a wonderful option for many of our customers and remains our preferred long-term channel. For customers using pharmacy benefits now, nearly 70% have an out-of-pocket cost less than $60 per month and 30% pay no out-of-pocket cost. Notably, this data is based upon the first five months of 2020, when patients are more likely to have deductibles still outstanding. As you can see, our products continue to demonstrate their ability to perform in real world settings and drive patient outcomes at affordable levels. This includes the use of DexCom CGM in additional populations beyond those with an insulin intensive diabetes. As we mentioned on the first quarter call, on April 1st, we received an allowance from the FDA to provide DexCom CGM to hospitals during the COVID crisis, allowing for remote monitoring on any of their hospitalized patients. Our primary goal in this initiative was and continues to be the assistance of frontline workers during the pandemic, and the team has been working continually with sites to get CGM implemented. We have made great progress to date in training hospitals and the feedback we have received from the care teams has been great. An example, near to us in San Diego Scripps Health, published a case study on their use of DexCom G6 since the start of the COVID pandemic and highlighted several encouraging points. The use of G6 was eagerly embraced by the hospital and nursing teams with high rates of satisfaction among patients as well. Early data indicates a trend toward reduced incidence of low- and high glucose values across all patients who use CGM. And specific to COVID-19 patients, visits into the patient's rooms have been decreased by 30% to 50% during the length of stay, saving valuable equipment and also reducing viral exposure for the hospital staff. As we stated previously, our hospital efforts were not a material driver of revenue in the second quarter, and we do not expect it to be for the current year. But the data that we are generating is invaluable as we assess the regulatory pathway forward for this important market. Whether it is the shift to telemedicine, the hospital initiative or our efforts to expand access for the Type 2 population with our various partnerships, our team continues to press forward in the midst of the challenges brought on by COVID. We've successfully doubled G6 capacity in the first half of the year, putting us in a great position operationally to address the significant market opportunities ahead of us. G6 is a platform technology. During the past 12 months, we have seen the launch of a very successful automated insulin delivery system at Tandem, significant progress at Insulet and other automated insulin delivery partners, introduction of the first daily enabled [ph] MDI systems, utilization in an app developed specifically for the Type 2 diabetes program at UnitedHealthcare and the recent launch of G6 Pro to meet a very important market need. We plan for numerous customer experience and product enhancement, as well as new market opportunities for this platform over the next two years, and many of these initiatives will be incorporated into the G7 platform going forward. And finally, on to G7, where we are pressing forward on several fronts. As we said on the last call, COVID-19 has affected our time lines on this project. Specifically, pivotal studies would be delayed for at least six months due to uncertainty at the clinics. And we are going to be fully ready for G6 conversion when we launch. Some G7 manufacturing scale activities have been delayed, as some of our vendors shut down for meaningful periods of time. And let me remind you, we are going to be fully ready for a G7 conversion when we launch. And a very small amount of G6 equipment can be used for G7. I am not going to provide you a specific clinical trial, filing and launch dates today. In this competitive world, we have no interest in sharing our playbook with the entire industry. There will not be a limited launch of G7 in 2020. Such a launch would not provide a meaningful financial impact and rushing to accommodate such a launch would ultimately delay our long-term plans. Design of the hardware sensor and electronics is locked and the G7 algorithm is complete. We have used our extra time to add some great enhancements to the system. We are back in the clinics. We are in the process of finalizing clinical sites and timing for the US and OUS pivotal studies. Our first fully automated G7 line is up in San Diego. Additional, G7 automation equipment is arriving regularly in San Diego, Mesa and at third-party contract manufacturers. I will now turn the call over to Quentin, for a review of our financials. We can, perfect. You bet. I'll take that, Jeff. On the hospital side, we are really now just starting to gather data from the centers that use CGM. When we started the whole hospital initiative, it was just let's get the product out there and help the staff at the hospitals and also make patients healthier. And we navigated through a series of things that we really didn't anticipate very well, such as the IT systems of the hospital and things of that nature. So we're now starting to gather data. We also have learned, interestingly enough that a lot of the hospitals, even though they all got the same product, had different protocols in a different way that use CGM. Some of these centers would put it on anybody with diabetes. Somebody would put anybody with elevated glucose levels, and others would take the approach. We're not going to do this until somebody's really sick. So we're going to learn more about the protocols and how it was used. And to start gathering data about the sensor and how it works, and also, we're going to try and gather data with respect to how these patients were treated from a drug side as well. Anecdotally, what we've heard is our product performed in the hospital the way we thought it would, that its accuracy and performance really wasn't affected by the compounds used to treat these patients. And we should have a pretty good picture of where it is. We've not had any additional discussions with the agency on the hospital data yet, because we really haven't had anything in a form that we could present that would start us down a path. As far as next steps in the hospital, will take - we still have the ability to use the product in the system and with COVID not going away, I think we'll be able to gather more data. And now that we've been through this initial wave of learning, we'll probably get better data and more data and know what we're looking for going forward and put together data, we'll present that to the FDA, and at the same time, we'll present them what the plan as to what we think we need to do next. That's going to be a while. And - but we've got some time to gather more data. On the gestational side and the pregnancy side, we have seen some countries open up and say, hey, let's go do this, the U K and Canada that you pointed out. We've had very detailed discussions with the FDA as to what we need to do on the pregnancy side to get that label, and we are working on that. We all know the product works very well in pregnancy. All you've got to do is go to social media and see the DexCom's patients who have had a child that they never thought they would have, who have diabetes of our type 1 patients on gestational side, we think our opportunity is outstanding, not only from a manage those patients who have gestational diabetes as a predictor of those who may in fact, get it. And again, we are running studies. There are studies being run by many others to determine what that model looks like. I think our first step there, Jeff, is we need to get just a pregnancy indication with the FDA rather than specific gestational one. And then head down the line to develop a product and a platform that fits into that market on a cost effective and a positive outcome basis, but we're very optimistic that it will. Yeah, we didn't quantify exactly what we believe the impact to be in the second quarter, but we tried to give some color and it's the foundation for how we thought about the back half of the year as well. If you look at the end of March and into April, new patient starts when COVID was really starting to ramp at that point in time was roughly 75% of kind of that normal range that we would have expected. So you saw about a 25% impact on the new patient starts at that point in time. Now I will say over the course of the quarter, end of June, we saw that rebound nicely back in line with previous expectations, as things started to come under a bit of control. Now we saw it pick up a little bit in July as the COVID cases have increased a bit more that we're all aware of, and we were very clear in our guidance that we're assuming roughly 75% to 80% of new patient starts throughout the back half of the year. That's the best data point we have at this point in time. So I would just take you back to that reference point of 75%, 80% roughly, new patient starts throughout the month of April, is kind of how we saw the impact in the quarter. This is Kevin. I'll take that. It is getting easier. And I think the biggest catalyst in all this was when we got Medicare approval a while ago, and now we're getting Medicare awareness with these insulin-using patients because a large number of insulin-using patients in this type 2 population are, in fact, Medicare patients. So, that has been a big catalyst for growth, particularly as we've gotten better at serving and taking care of those patients. I think the other catalyst is just the approvals we were seeing from some of the large payers. Steve pointed out, UnitedHealthcare covering type 2 patients on intensive insulin recently, again, giving more patients access to it. As these patients are having positive outcomes, access is growing and they're matching the CMS approvals that we've already received. So, it's coming across the board and it's not coming to us from our primary prescribers, they are coming from everywhere. Many of these patients don't even see endocrinologists. So, they're finding out about DexCom and coming to us directly because of our marketing efforts and because what they've heard word of mouth or what they've seen from others. We've always felt this would be a great use of our technology, and it's proving to be exactly that. Yeah, I'll take that one. I think, again, the walk away from ADA is how important CGM has become in all this. Almost every presentation you went to every presentation we saw the performance of drugs, the performance of other systems is based on CGM data. From DexCom's perspective, obviously, the drive of the automated insulin delivery systems was largely driven by DexCom sensors, regardless of who the presenter was up at the pulpit other than Medtronic and we can see our sensor can drive great outcomes there. I think the other takeaway is we're not stopping innovation in diabetes. Everybody is still pushing forward, and we still think there's better ways to attack this. This is a big cost and healthcare problem in our country and around the world. And I don't think anybody is going to slow down. But - our biggest takeaway, compare that to your first ADA, Joanne, where we had to beg for anybody even listened to us. And now every place we go and just our industry growth, CGM has become the dominant technology here across all of the diabetes treatments. And we're looking forward to just continuing to be better. Yeah. This is Kevin. I'll add a bit to Steve's comments earlier. We don't see one solution yet. We are working with a number of partners on the payer front. We're working with clinics. We're working with a lot of these diabetes management systems as well to provide CGM data to that to figure out what the best model for these patients is. We're not only working with these partners, but we're doing a lot of market research on our own. And one of Steve's comments that is becoming very evident in all the work that we do is type 2 patients are more than open to wearing CGM and learning what's going on with their bodies. They want a different experience than we offer today for the Type 1 patients connecting to insulin pumps and Bluetooth pens and sophisticated predictive alerts and alarms and things like that we have today are not as important to that group. But what is important to that group is that they're healthy and that we can reduce their meds, we can reduce their cost, that we can make their physician visits more productive and we can make changes in their help that save them these complications over the years. So I think what you'll see is we'll continue to pursue all these models, at the same time, we're going to pursue the proper product configuration. And reimbursement models for us. I've been in numerous discussions where we ask, if we get paid X for an intensive patient for a year, what should we - what should be the reimbursement rate for non-intensive type 2 because the fact is we aren't saving their life on a near term basis. With an alert and alarm, we are not giving them something that determines their drug dosing decision, but we are giving information to better manage their lives. So, we think there may ultimately be a different class of product here and a different form of reimbursement even patients wear them all the time, which is, again, another reason we're investing so much in scale here, because we like these things everywhere. I think the market is developing nicely and the constant thread coming from all these approaches, if this thing works. You bet. We do not believe it's had an exceptional impact on our business, as far as bringing more Medicare patients to the table. And \u2013 but they are coming. On a broad scale basis, as we look at the Medicare ruling, we would be very pleased if we could get the criteria for Medicare patients much more condensed and much more realistic. We actually met on that this morning. And one of the things pointed out yet again to me is, Medicare requires our patients to document that they do four fingersticks a day before they go to CGM and our patients only reimbursed for three fingersticks a day by CMS. So there are large inconsistencies there. And this is a product that has tremendous impact with these patients. It would certainly be our goal to have these coverage criteria and the steps that patients have to go through to get CGM simplified and more broadly applied across all of diabetes. But that's something we're working on now, and I can't anticipate where CMS is going to go. But it certainly makes sense that we do that. Yeah. No, it's certainly increasing nicely, particularly as we continue to focus in that particular area. The 20% is of the installed base. So we didn't give a sense in terms of the overall growth in that particular area. But we've talked about our focus there in opening up those channels. And I think the fact that we're now talking about it just indicates the progress that we're making there. So that's the extent of the detail we've given around it. Yeah. Great question. We didn't really see anything over the course of Q2. But to be fair, I think, it's probably a bit early to really understand whether or not we will see an impact. And therefore, we have contemplated something in our guidance in the back part of the year around our patient assistance program or attrition. And keep in mind, we announced during the second quarter that we would be putting in place a patient assistance program, but that wasn't going to be effective until the third quarter. Our view is that, if a patient were going to a trip, they would likely fall into that program. So when we talk about guidance in the back half of the year, you've got a couple of things playing out there. You've got the new patient starts that we've been very clear. 75% to 80% is how we've modeled it. But then we also are assuming that we're going to see some impact on attrition, and they're going to fall into this Patient Assistance Program, which is going to mean quite a bit less revenue to us, obviously, than what we might have normally received from them. So that's playing out in the back part as well. Well, certainly, I think from an access perspective, it just makes it very easy for the patient to be able to find our product available right on the web in their particular country. And in many ways, it becomes something we can scale relatively easily. And we choose new countries to take it into. And I think that when folks are searching or trying to learn about the product and then they have the ability to purchase it, right there at their fingertips in a web platform, it just makes it naturally easier to come on to the technology. And I think you see what played out in Canada in terms of record number of new patients shortly after we launched it. The early success in the UK clearly speaks to the benefit of the e-commerce platform as well. So I think it's something that we can scale over time as we take into new countries and it clearly has the benefits with it. I think you heard in the prepared remarks, nearly 70% of all of our patients come on to our product for their first time through some sort of either virtual training or online training capability or in-app capability. So the e-commerce platform kind of lends itself very naturally into that ability to come on to the product. Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that. With respect to the ad rates and the spending, I don't get too involved in that one anymore. I leave that to the other guys. But our team is very targeted with respect to the ads that we develop, where we run them, when we run them, and we have tremendous systems in place to monitor the leads that come in from those ads. We have, again, a team in place that if you watch our ad and e-mail us a want a information. We get back to those patients very quickly. They don't wait for several days. It's a matter of hours, and we give back those patients and let them know we are here, and we will help them and educate them and want to get their insurance information, their doctor information, everything that patient might need. We do track that spending and where we spend it, we track the results from it, and then we invest in those places where we think it will be better. But we are seeing -- working from home now, we see DexCom ads wherever we watch television, a lot more than we used to. And I think they've been very successful, and our team is really good at this. Thank you very much, operator, and thanks everybody again for being on our call today. We saw a headline come across our phones while we're sitting here what pandemic DexCom rocks here. I just want to tell everybody that we did have a great quarter, but we were affected by this like everybody else. Our commercial teams had to completely change the way they worked. And I had a town hall meeting with our team in the Philippines last week in the stories of some people who literally kept themselves locked up in the city for two months, away from their families to help patients are incredibly inspiring. We've all been affected by this and working from homes. And it's safe to say like everybody else, we've never experienced anything or planned for anything like this. But what an amazing six-month this company has had in this environment? I just want to list a few accomplishments over the last six months and closing today. And we completed a financing that gives us the balance sheet strength necessary to accomplish all of our long-term goals. We achieved an absolute -- worldwide absolute dollar sales growth increase of US$240 million during this chaotic time. Our type 2 business on the intensive insulin side is demonstrating strength and the outcomes we always said we'd have with these patients. We've waited a long time to execute on this plan, and we finally got into the hospital. And we think that will be a great market for us. Our financial performance is exceeding all of our plans on the bottom line, providing us with operating cash to reinvest in our business, as we talked about money that we need to spend over the next six months of the year. Our G6 satisfaction scores are at all-time highs again during this period of chaos. We have a great product supported by a very dedicated team. Let's not forget our pipeline. G7 progress is excellent. As I said earlier in the call, the groups working on this project are hitting on all cylinders. And there is nothing more exciting at DexCom than the sense of urgency related to a platform change like this that's such a monumental effort. We are redoing everything that we do now to bring this incredible product to market. G7 is not the only thing in our pipeline. We're spending numerous hours talking about G8, 9 and 10 and whatever else comes in the future, but we're also making sure we don't ignore G6. We have numerous product improvements and patient experience improvements with G6 that will be out over the next couple of years. We don't ever sit still. I just completed a series of virtual presentations for various groups here at DexCom. And one of the questions I was asked to answer is, why has the company been so successful? And I narrowed my answer down to a very simple statement. We provide a solution to a very serious problem and we do it better than anybody else ever has. As we look to the future, we can continue to do that only, we can do it much better than we do it today, and we believe we can solve many more problems in the same manner. It's going to thrill the health care community. And more importantly, we're going to save patients, caregivers, health care professional and payers' time, money and we're going to continue to save lives. Thank you, everybody."

            "content": "Thanks, Quentin. We continue to make great strides in executing on our strategic priorities even as we navigate the current environment with the utmost care for the health of our employees, the continued service of our patients and assistance to our communities. The doubling of G6 capacity in the first half of the year has placed us in a great position to creatively target new customers and extend the launch of G6 in several of our existing markets. We are gaining steady traction among type 2 insulin-intensive customers, building from our efforts to drive expanded access beyond Medicare into payers as we've seen with UnitedHealthcare and more recently, Aetna, both of which now provide access to the pharmacy. At the recent virtual ADA conference, we presented encouraging data on a subset of our type 2 intensive patients after their first 12 weeks of usage of G6. The data demonstrated average A1C reduction of 1.5%, significant improvement to quality of life metrics and 95% customer satisfaction with G6. COVID has also brought a clear focus to the long-term potential for CGM and the importance of glycemic control. We've spoken at length about the large market opportunities ahead for DexCom, including our focus on the broader type 2 market, hospital use and use during pregnancy. The fact that all 3 of these populations have now received exemptions to allow for broader access to DexCom CGM during the pandemic provides validation for these new market expansions. In early April, the FDA made a special allowance to permit the use of CGM in the hospital setting. In early May, we saw a special ruling from CMS to allow access to all people with diabetes who are diagnosed with COVID-19. And earlier this month, Health Canada issued an interim order for the use of G6 for all women with diabetes who are pregnant during the pandemic, and more and more data continue to emerge supporting these decisions and the value of CGM beyond the intensive insulin-using population. At ADA, our partners at Onduo presented data comparing the impact of CGM versus non-CGM use in their virtual diabetes clinic. While both cohorts or patients ultimately saw a significant A1C decrease. The group using DexCom G6 are reduction nearly 2x as much as those not using CGM. In addition earlier this month, UnitedHealthcare announced the expansion of their level 2 digital health therapy to more than 230,000 people with type 2 diabetes. This program, which utilizes G6 as a core component, saw great results in United's initial pilot work, including flinty significant A1C reduction for those with a baseline A1C greater than 8 and significant reductions to medication usage with some participants even achieving remission and no longer needing medication. We are pressing forward in support of our various partnerships to reach the whole type 2 population including our work with UnitedHealthcare, Intermountain Healthcare, Livongo, Waldo, Onduo and others. We are also excited about the launch of our G6 professional product, which has several appealing use cases as we explore the full value of our CGM platform. We are also excited about the launch of our G6 professional product, which has several appealing use cases as we explore the full value of our CGM platform. The product provides a natural extension into the type 2 non-intensive market by leveraging the strong existing reimbursement framework for professional CGM with a tool that empowers clinicians. G6 Pro gives doctors the flexibility to assess a patient's glycemic health in real-time for all patients with diabetes. As a single-use product, G6 Pro will also serve as a great introduction for a patient looking to experience the functionality of DexCom CGM. G6 Pro can also be prescribed for use in blinded mode where the patient does not see the real-time data to all people, ages 2 years, not just people with diabetes, providing all people with the opportunity to assess their glycemic health. Our strategy of prioritizing interoperability and patient choice continues to leave us well positioned as the insulin delivery market shifts toward commercial connected devices. In early May, we signed an agreement to collaborate with Ypsomed, adding another key partner to our existing partners in Eli Lilly, Insulet, Novo Nordisk and Tandem Diabetes. Yeah. I think - this is Steve. It's certainly evolving, but I think these are all validating points for us, right, that certainly, UnitedHealthcare serves more than 230,000 non-insulin taking type 2 patients and we would hope that over time, that program has expanded pretty dramatically beyond where it is today. We're in the midst of just continuing to capture data and prove out the value of this technology in the non-intensive patient population. We know we have something there. We know it's important. Whether it becomes a real-time all-the-time use case, over time, it very well could be. We're seeing some very positive outcomes for people using it for, frankly, a longer period of time than maybe we would have cited previously. So there is an opportunity. Reimbursement is still in its infancy in the non-insulin-using patient population, so we've not only got to prove the outcomes, we've got to get the product paid for. So it's still not even the balance of this year, not going to be a material piece of the business, but it's going to continue to grow over the coming years, for sure. Obviously, first and foremost, it's to build, as Kevin mentioned, to build the right products for this patient population. We think the products are going to be different. They're not going to have all the \u2013 there won't be nearly as \u2013 I don't want to say nearly as robust because the performance of the underlying sensor will be the same. But having some of the bells and whistles that we need for the intensive insulin population just don't apply the type 2. The software experience needs to be different. So those types of things are within our control or even, frankly, within the control of some of our partners that we've talked about, right? Livongo offers a patient experience to their patients. United, the Level 2 program is an experience that we've developed together with United, but it's really a UnitedHealthcare patient experience. So we're not going to \u2013 there's not going to be a one size fits all here. We're going to offer our own tools. We do offer our own tools today, and we're going to enable multiple players in this business to offer the appropriate tools to this patient population, because we know it's such a massive opportunity that it [inaudible] just make our sensors available to anybody who's a viable company."

            "name": "Quentin Blackford",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2020, we reported worldwide revenue of $451.8 million compared to $336.4 million for the second quarter of 2019, representing an absolute dollar increase of more than $115 million and growth of 34% on a reported basis and 35% on a constant currency basis. The strong growth continued despite some of the challenges posed early in the quarter by the pandemic with continued new patient growth reflecting the overall momentum behind real-time CGM in both the Type 1 and Type 2 patient populations. As Kevin noted, we are meeting this shift toward real-time CGM with a product in G6 that customers love, leading to our record Net Promoter Score levels. Our US business remained very strong in the second quarter with growth of 38% over the second quarter of 2019. This growth extended across all three of our primary US channels, pharmacy, DME and Medicare. Pharmacy remains the fastest-growing channel among the three, and our teams continue to prioritize this as a key component of our long-term strategy based on the benefits provided to DexCom, clinicians and especially our customers. The majority of national plans and PBMs are now covering DexCom via the pharmacy benefit with many incorporating a dual pharmacy and DME benefit. Our international business grew 22% in the second quarter on a constant currency basis, with consistent growth across our direct and distributor markets. We did see a greater impact to new patients in certain international markets as a result of COVID in the second quarter compared to the US. Unlike the first quarter, the reduced access for in-clinic visits for new patients did not allow us to offset our anticipated second quarter price impact with the same degree of volume gains. However, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, as we saw improvement throughout the quarter with new patient growth recovering and our direct markets returning to strong growth in June, as well as distributor orders beginning to rebound early in the third quarter. We are creating streamlined pathways for new patients to access DexCom CGM through different channels in our international markets. Building from the successful launch of our Canadian e-commerce platform, which drove record new patient growth following its launch in 2019, we recently expanded the e-commerce opportunity to our UK market and are encouraged by the similar early results. Canada and the UK were amongst our highest growth markets in the second quarter. Our second quarter gross profit was $289.7 million or 64.1% of revenue compared to 61.4% of revenue in the second quarter of 2019. The gross margin was sequentially consistent with our Q1 performance and consistent with the expectations that we noted on the Q1 call for a more muted improvement between Q1 and Q4 of 2020 as we continue to ramp costs associated with the introduction of our G7 lines. Importantly, we now have our first G7 line in place in producing product for clinical trials. The 270-basis point year-over-year margin improvement was driven primarily by product design developments, most notably our lower cost transmitter. Operating expenses were $213 million for Q2 2020 compared to $200.3 million in Q2 2019. This reflects an increase of 6% year-over-year and a 1240 basis point reduction as a percent of revenue from the second quarter of 2019. As an organization, we continue to make great strides as we invest in the initiatives that will drive DexCom's long-term growth. While also remaining disciplined as an organization, and this is evident in our second quarter results. Just as COVID did impact our topline, it also had an impact on certain spending activities, which resulted in some of the operating margin improvement during the quarter and was therefore, temporary in nature. As a result, we expect moderation in the year-over-year margin comparisons in the second half of the year as we invest in several key initiatives for the company, including the G7 clinical trials, G7 manufacturing scale up, our new market efforts and direct-to-consumer advertising that we began to accelerate late in the second quarter. Operating income was $76.7 million or 17% of revenue in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $6.2 million or 1.8% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of more than 1,500 basis points in operating margin for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $122.6 million or 27.1% of revenue for the second quarter compared to $45.9 million or 13.6% of revenue for the second quarter of 2019. Net income for the second quarter was $77.1 million or $0.79 per share. Over the past two years, we have made tremendous progress, towards becoming a profitable company. As a result, it is now becoming evident that we're going to be able to utilize the significant historic tax benefits that we have accrued over time. And we are approaching a position where in the near future, we expect to release the valuation allowance that we have been required to place against many of our tax benefits in the past. This is something that we have been in front of and planning for, including the implementation of a global tax structure over the last couple of years that will allow us to continue to expand rapidly and efficiently on a global basis. As we set expectations for 2021, we will look to provide clarity around our annual tax rate expectations and leverage the benefits associated with the tax structure we put in place, in contemplation of such an event. In early May, we took advantage of market conditions to further solidify our balance sheet, with a new convertible note offering. On the strength of the offering, we closed the quarter in a great financial position with more than $2.5 billion of cash, utilizing a combination of the cash generated from the convertible note offering, as well as DexCom's stock, we redeemed the majority of our 2022 convertible notes, in the second quarter and will redeem the remainder later this week. Our cash position leaves us in great shape to pursue the growth opportunities ahead of us, including support of the development of new markets, opportunistic investment and capabilities that complement our growth, and capital allocation into our G7 scale up and Malaysian manufacturing facility. As we look to the second half of the year, there remains several areas of uncertainty as we contemplate the continuation of the COVID pandemic and its global impact, including employment rates, and update of our patient assistance program in the US. Nevertheless, based on our experience in the second quarter, the tools that our teams have developed to support virtual patient care and the growing clinical awareness of the value of CGM, particularly in the current environment, we believe there is enough visibility to reinstate full year guidance. We now expect 2020 revenue to be approximately $1.85 billion, representing growth of 25% over 2019. This represents an increase of $100 million from the midpoint of our initial 2020 guidance, resulting from the strength of the business in the first half of the year. Our teams have responded well and continued to drive new patient adoption and ensure the satisfaction of our existing patients. Given the recent uptick in COVID cases globally and in the US in particular, our guidance assumes approximately 75% to 80% of our original expectations for global new patients in the back half of the year, which was consistent with what we had experienced in late March and into April, at the outset of the COVID outbreak globally. Turning to margins, we now anticipate the following non-GAAP results to meet or exceed the following levels, which are ahead of what we established at the start of the year, including, increasing gross margin, expectations to meet or exceed 65% and representing a steady improvement over 2019. This includes costs associated with the initial development of our Malaysian manufacturing facility, and support of the growth of our international business and is in line with our long-term expectations for gross margins in the mid-60s. We are now increasing operating margin expectations to meet or exceed 14%. This revised guidance contemplates the increased second half spending associated with the initiatives that I previously mentioned, yet still demonstrating annually year-over-year improvement, as we leverage our strong top our strong top line results. Finally, we are increasing our expected adjusted EBITDA margins, to meet or exceed 24% for the year. Our team has done a great job to execute on our goal of doubling G6 capacity in the first half of 2020, despite an extraordinarily difficult and unanticipated operating environment, putting the company in its best position since the launch of G6 to meet the many opportunities in front of us. And we now look forward to replicating that momentum with the scale-up of our G7 lines. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update. Great. So with respect to the first part of that question around top line and revenue per patient or maybe the pricing headwinds that we've talked about historically, certainly, we came into the year with an expectation that, that was going to be somewhere around $125 million to $150 million, likely being around $125 million to $150 million, range. I can tell you that based upon where we saw price come in, in Q2, it was right in line with our expectation. We have not changed our pricing assumption, our full year guidance at this point in time, we still expect it to be around that $150 million range. So not anything significant in terms of a change there, the strategy we've put in place, to step this down over time continues to play out exactly as we had expected. So that continues to be consistent. With respect to the bottom line, we've made incredible progress from a profitability perspective, really over the last call it, four or five quarters now, with nearly 1,500 basis points of improvement in operating margin profile in Q2 alone. There's no question that some of the spending was impacted in the quarter, particularly around efforts like DTC as we started to pull back some of that early in the quarter just with the uncertainty around how COVID was going to impact things over the course of the quarter and into the back part of the year. I will tell you, we did start that back up in early Q3. So you're going to see incremental spending in the back half of the year around things like DTC. The other thing to keep in mind that's going to impact your spending trends that won't allow the same kind of improvement in Q2 to play through in the back half of the year is the fact that we're starting up the G7 trials. We've been very open and deliberate about the spend that's going to go into that. We're putting forward quite a bit of resources around standing up those manufacturing capabilities and ensuring that capacity is going to be there right out of the gate. We do have the first line-up. There's incremental lines coming right behind it as we speak and building out that entire supply chain capability. And then finally, we've already spent some time talking about it on the call today, but you look at opportunities like hospital, gestational. Those are significant revenue drivers for us into the future. We're going to make sure that we're spending in those areas, to ensure that open those up and provide for growth into the future. So we are going to spend in the back part of the year. You're not going to see the same sort of improvement. But at the same time, we're committed that over time, we will continue to mature as an organization. We're going to step towards the long-term goals of profitability that we've laid out. And I think we've made great progress towards it, but you're not going to see these sorts of improvement every single quarter. I think you need to look at it over a period of time. Yeah, it's a fair question. I think it's a bit premature to speak to that fact in terms of playing out over the course of Q3 with respect to the distributor orders. Certainly, we saw those orders start to come through and in the third quarter. I think the question becomes based upon what was happening with COVID in the broader environment today, do we see that actually rebound and double up in terms of the orders in Q3 or does everything just kind of defer and push a bit. Our guidance would contemplate the fact that it pushes at this point in time. Just based upon the best information that we have. If it were to all come in and terrific, I think we'd be very happy. Just a little bit of color around that OUS result. I think what you're seeing there is very comparable to what the broader marketplace and the industry realized over the course of the quarter as well. I think if you look at the data points that have been put out there by our competitors, thus far, they saw a slowdown in growth in Q2 in their international business, just as we did sequentially, absolute dollars step down from Q1 into Q2, which we certainly saw as well, but the broad market saw the same thing. So, I don't think you're seeing anything that's unique to DexCom. I think over time, we remain as bullish as ever on the international opportunity. We've stated the fact that we're going to step down price over time in the international space as well. And when you have a quarter like Q2 where the ability for new patients to get into the clinic and come on to the product becomes a bit muted, you see a bit more of a pronounced impact. So, that's all part of a long-term strategy that we believe in and are very bullish around. So, we're still very, very optimistic and excited about that international business, but that's a bit of color that played out in Q2. And with respect to Q3, our view is that things probably push. But if we see it rebound, it's been great, there's upside to the number. The revenues in the hospital wouldn't have a significant impact on the financials. The costs are exceeded the revenue. So, we'll leave it at that. With respect to the channel, we've not made a decision there as far as how we'd pursue that. We are early enough in this process that we're not ready to adopt a commercial model. We want to leave our options open. We would explore partners. We would explore doing it ourselves. But we'll figure out where to best use our dollars. And then we haven't made a decision there yet. Yeah. I think in the prepared remarks, we were pretty clear with the fact that we saw COVID did impact certain countries a little bit differently than others. UK and Canada performed incredibly well, particularly on the e-commerce platform that we had put in place. Germany certainly was impacted in our distributor markets were certainly impacted. On the distributor point, again, I think it's just too early to tell if that's going to double up in Q3 or if that's just going to be simply something that pushes out over the course of the remainder of the year. I think at some point in time, it will catch up to itself, and we'll be back on that same trajectory. It's just too hard to predict if that happens in the next six months or not. And our guidance would be based off the fact that it does not, that it's been pushed. That's kind of how we thought about it. So - and then your point on just the new patient starts in the back half of the year. Like I said, we're trying to create some clarity for you guys in the back half of the year around what we're confident that we can deliver on. We're using the best data points that we have from our experience. And that 75% to 80% new patients start as what we realized early in the second quarter as COVID was kind of starting to really gain some traction. We've seen COVID numbers increasing here recently in the third quarter as well. And so that's the best data point that we have. So, that's how we went about putting the numbers together. Obviously, if we can navigate through that more effectively or to a better degree, then there's going to be opportunity in the guidance number, but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves at this point. Yes. We're not going to talk to the tax rate just yet. I think we need to get to the point where we flip that valuation allowance. We don't know exactly when that's going to be just yet, but we know that it's coming here in the near future. And the last thing I want to do is like I said, put a couple of $100 million gain through the financial statements that surprises everybody in the particular period. I think it's important to know we're out in front of this. We anticipate it. We've put a tax structure in place that's going to allow us to have a very efficient global tax structure and grow globally in a very efficient way with a very attractive tax rate. So we've been well in front of this for quite some time, and the point is just to start to put it on your radar. With respect to the other question, sorry, remind me what the other question was. OpEx in the back part of the year. So there wasn't a significant impact that moved the needle meaningfully in the second quarter. I mean, call it, roughly $10 million or so of spend that likely would have showed up in the quarter had we not been impacted. But I think importantly, the back half of the year is where you're going to see a significant ramp in the overall spend profile, particularly with G7 clinical trials getting go and G7 scale really taking off. And then turning on the DTC spigot for the first time in a significant way. I think one of the things that maybe is not as appreciated by folks is that historically, we've always been constrained from an inventory position. We exited Q2 in the strongest inventory position that we've been in with respect to G6 in our company's history. That allows us to start to open up opportunities like DTC in a significant way that we believe can drive growth into the future. So you're going to see that play out. Spending is going to be significantly higher in the back half. When you do your modeling, it's going to be almost $100 million of spend higher in the back half. We recognize that and realize it. But those things that I just indicated are going to be the areas that we primarily focus on in our spending. And I would just say, from a return on investment perspective, there's not a better investment that we can make inside of these four walls today than direct-to-consumer spending. It's amazing the capability that the team has put together in the targeted effort there to drive results."

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you Sean and thank you everyone for joining us. Let me start by expressing my gratitude for the many healthcare workers and first responders that are supporting all of us at this time. We certainly stand with you in this effort and our thoughts are with you and those who have been impacted by COVID-19. As a quick summary, the first quarter was another very strong quarter for DexCom, continuing the growth momentum that we've delivered for much of the past two years. First quarter revenue grew to $405 million, representing 44% growth over the first quarter of 2019 or greater than $120 million of absolute dollar growth. This performance was driven by strength in new patient additions in both the U.S. and international businesses. Even as we saw some impact in new patient opportunities related to COVID-19 beginning in mid-March. We will address first quarter performance in a moment, but first and foremost we wanted to discuss the impact of COVID-19 and DexCom's response. The past few months have brought and likely will continue to bring unprecedented challenges to global health and economic systems as a result of the virus. While this has been an incredibly difficult humanitarian crisis, we have also seen many encouraging examples of collaboration around the world from public and private entities. We have seen people working to bring care to those in need, protect the health of the vulnerable and support the wellbeing of workers and families. From the outset, we recognize that DexCom has an important role to play. Our customers rely on our CGM technology to safely manage blood glucose and deliver insulin. In many cases, these are people with diabetes who have relied on DexCom CGM since diagnosis, meaning they haven't known a world without the peace of mind and real time continuous glucose monitoring.  People with diabetes are also at heightened risk for complications with COVID-19. Highlighting the importance of good glycaemic control during these challenging times, we set out with three core priorities, keep our employees safe, continue to serve our patients and work to help our communities. To meet this challenge and support these core priorities, we set in motion several initiatives. We quickly moved the majority of our global employees to home-based work arrangements, this transition enhance the safety of all of our employees, including our teams who remain onsite and benefit from a less stance work environment. Our IT and emergency response teams have done an excellent job to enable this shift and provide necessary resources for our teams to continue to function effectively and care for our patients. I could share numerous examples of DexCom teams going above and beyond to ensure that our customers receive product and the support that they need, but I'll share one that stands out to me. In order to ensure that our products were supplied in a timely manner, we had members of our IT teams who were willing to sleep onsite to meet the needs of our employees and our patients. As this story demonstrates our employees care deeply for our patients and we continue to work on new ways to enhance customer support in these unique times. This includes our announcement yesterday of a program to provide financial assistance to our existing patients who have lost or may lose access to insurance coverage for their DexCom\u2019s supplies as a result of COVID-19. This program which we plan to launch in the next several weeks will provide up to two 90 day supply shipments for only $45 each and provide relief to our patients and what is clearly a very challenging time. As it pertains to our customers both the patient and the clinician, we are working on ways to ensure we have the appropriate infrastructure to support their evolving needs. Our extensive virtual resources for patient and clinician training and customer support are proving to be especially important as the world embraces the increasing use of telemedicine platforms. As a reminder, more than 70% of our historical new patient additions have self-trained using the resources that we provide, demonstrating the value of these resources and ease of use of our CGM systems. Even prior to the global spread of the virus, our procurement and operations teams work to access and mitigate any potential risk to the supply chain for existing products. Because of their effort, we have seen very little disruption with our manufacturing sites as both San Diego and Mesa remain fully operational. Our manufacturing teams have worked seamlessly to make sure that our customers get the CGM systems they rely on. We've implemented additional safety measures to reduce the number of people on site at any given time. We have implemented shift separations and added additional sanitation and safety measures on top of our existing procedures including thermal scanning. With the supply chain and manufacturing operations currently in good shape, we continue to be in a strong inventory position to meet the current demand for both the existing patients and new patients. We have seen some customer interest in stocking up on the product, but have worked to keep customers supplied in line with the provisions of their insurance providers. This also applies to our DME suppliers and wholesalers. We did not see a material positive impact from customer stocking on our first quarter sales performance. We have also looked at ways that DexCom could play its part in providing solutions that benefit our communities during the COVID outbreak. When avenues already played out, as hospital systems came under increasing pressure and had limited personal protective equipment, we began to feel the number of requests for our G6 sensors.  In the ICU, hospital personnel often need to monitor patients with finger sticks as much as every half an hour. In response to the request, we worked with the FDA to temporarily allow for the use of G6 in the hospital setting and we quickly set out to supply product to key regions battling the COVID crisis. Because of our real time connectivity, our CGM systems allow healthcare providers to remotely monitor a patient's glucose levels in real time reducing the need for finger sticks. As a result, there are fewer physical interactions between healthcare providers and patients, which limits viral exposure for hospital staff and preserves personal protective equipment. We are already seeing promising evidence of these benefits from the initial sites. Recently the FDA removed the three hour delay requirement for CGM data into our CLARITY software, allowing for faster data integration. As we roll this out in the coming weeks, our remote monitoring solutions will be further enhanced in both the hospital setting and for telehealth consultations for people with diabetes. We expect to continue supporting hospitals in areas of the country most impacted by the COVID-19 emergency, although our top priority remains serving our existing patients without interruption.  The drastic but necessary steps to mitigate the spread of the virus have also created some areas of unpredictability for us as we continue in our second quarter and the remainder of 2020. As I briefly noted above, we have seen some impact in new patient opportunities since the broader social distancing measures were put in place in mid-March. We are hopeful that this impact may be mitigated as conditions enhance their telemedicine capabilities and our team is certainly working hard to ensure patient access for those in need of DexCom CGM. Quentin will provide more detail around how we have contemplated this uncertainty relative to our 2020 guidance. Another area of unpredictability right now is around the timing of large clinical trials like we need to run for G7. We remain confident in our ability to deliver G7, but acknowledge that the timing of the pivotal trial will be delayed due to the pausing of new trials at most clinical sites. We currently expect a minimum delay of approximately six months for the pivotal trial. This is obviously a challenging time across the globe, but I'm very proud of the way the DexCom teams have responded.  I will now turn the call over to Quentin for review of our financials.\nQuentin Blackford : Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted. The financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis, reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  For the first quarter of 2020 we reported worldwide revenue of $405.1 million compared to $280.5 million for the first quarter of 2019, representing growth of 44% on a reported basis and 45% on a constant currency basis. The growth performance reflects the strength of our new patient additions throughout 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. As we continue to see growing awareness of the value of DexCom CGM for both Type 1 and Type 2 patients. The U.S. business grew 39% in the first quarter of 2020 over the first quarter of 2019 with strong growth from each channel: durable medical equipment, pharmacy and Medicare. Pharmacy continues to be the fastest growing channel for us and realize the strongest sequential uptake in utilization to date as a result of the significant access improvements that our team has driven over the past year. Our international business also put up a great first quarter growing 63% on a constant currency basis relative to the same quarter in 2019. The $112.8 million in revenues for our international business represents an increase of more than $25 million from our previous quarterly high watermark. Strength was across the board including both direct and distributor markets. Our first quarter gross profit was $258.7 million or 63.9% of revenue compared to 60.2% in the first quarter of 2019. The 370 basis point improvement to year-over-year gross margin reflects the focused work of our teams to take costs out of our product design and manufacturing processes. As Kevin mentioned, our procurement team has done a great job of keeping our supply chain functioning well with little impact to our ability to produce product as well as our product cost thus far. We will continue to monitor this closely as the situation evolves globally. Operating expenses were $215.4 million for Q1 2020 compared to $176.4 million in Q1 2019. This reflects an increase at 22% year-over-year and a nearly 1,000 basis point reduction as a percentage of revenue from the first quarter of 2019. We continue to prioritize key areas of investment including our efforts to scale G6 manufacturing, progressing toward our goal of doubling capacity again in the first half of this year. We are also continuing our preparation for the scale-up of our G7 manufacturing lines and looking to support our sales growth with increasing direct-to-consumer advertising, as greater clarity evolves from the current global situation. Our non-GAAP results exclude some incremental costs that we experienced toward the end of the quarter in both cost of goods sold and operating expenses as a result of COVID-19. As Kevin noted, the safety of our employees remains our Number 1 priority. However, as an essential provider of medical devices, there are certain functions that must be performed onsite despite shelter and place orders to ensure continuity of supply. As a result, we are incurring incremental cost to assist our employees and ensure their safety to the greatest extent possible and expect to continue to do so in the near term as we support our people through this crisis. We expect to continue to incur costs related to our COVID-19 response until macro business conditions returned to normal. Operating income was $43.3 million or 10.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of $7.6 million or negative 2.7% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. This reflects a year-over-year improvements of nearly 1,300 basis points in operating margin for the quarter. Similarly adjusted EBITDA margin improved by nearly 1,000 basis points to 19.2% of revenue or $77.8 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 9.3% of revenue or $26.1 million for the first quarter of 2019. As our operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin performance indicate, we are doing a good job managing our expenses and gaining leverage from our strong top line results. Net income for the first quarter was $41.4 million or $0.44 per share. Our balance sheet remains very strong with more than $1.5 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter leading us in a strong net cash position. The capital structure that we have put in place along with our improved profitability profile that demonstrates the cash earnings potential of this business provides us the flexibility to not only navigate the current environment, but also be opportunistic when needed. Our convertible notes are not due until 2022 and 2023, respectively, and are convertible in either cash or stock at our discretion. We have worked hard and are fortunate to be in this position recognizing that there are many companies that are less fortunate and struggling to support their employees. Therefore, although we are potentially entitled to stimulus funds as a healthcare provider, we have chosen not to accept these funds and hope that they could be allocated to other American businesses and employees who are in greater need. Turning to 2020 guidance, given the unpredictable current economic and global health environment, we have chosen to temporarily suspend 2020 guidance until we have greater visibility on the outlook. To be clear, this decision does not necessarily imply upside or downside to our prior guidance. Our first quarter performance was above our expectations and apart from the uncertainty created by COVID-19; we would be in a position to raise our guidance today. Ultimately, we believe the underlying demand for CGM has not changed despite the situation with COVID-19. In these early days, we have seen the benefits in the shift to telemedicine because DexCom\u2019s real time CGM is connected. It has become one of the primary methods for physicians to monitor their patients and get newly diagnosed patients up and running. Further to this, as Kevin noted, the FDA has recently removed the three hour delay requirement for our clarity system, which will further differentiate DexCom CGM in its remote monitoring capability. In addition, as noted earlier, we've seen the FDA move quickly to enable the use of DexCom CGM in the hospital setting further increasing demand for our product. On the other hand, as we've seen office visits decline across healthcare, new patient starts could be impacted in Q2 and into the back-half of the year depending on how COVID-19 situation plays out. We will also monitor the macroeconomic environment to gauge employment levels and the ultimate impact of our financial assistance program. Further, while our global supply chain has remained stable, it is less predictable in the current environment and could experience interruption. Predicting all of these future variables has been difficult and we found it prudent to temporarily suspend our guidance until visibility improves. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and keep you updated as things evolve and we can provide greater clarity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update.\nSteve Pacelli: Thanks Quentin. Given our strong financial position and the growth opportunity ahead of us, we continue to press forward with the strategic initiatives that we outlined at the start of the year. As the COVID-19 pandemic has played out, we looked at how DexCom could play a role in delivering an impactful solution. Kevin already walked you through the incredible work being done in the hospital setting. Recent data published in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology shows the clear need for glucose control in the hospital and cements the reason we are so committed to assisting in this crisis. The study found that the COVID-19 mortality rate for people with diabetes or hyperglycemia even in non-diabetics during their stay was more than four times greater than patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia. Even more alarming for those who had no evidence of diabetes prior to hospitalization who developed hyperglycemia during their stay, 42% died in the hospital. These are sobering statistics and it served as a constant reminder to our team as we work around the clock to assist frontline workers. As we look forward, our commercial team has begun leveraging our extensive data platforms, which should prove especially valuable for patients and clinicians in an environment where telemedicine business are quickly becoming the norm. As an example, an article published last week in Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics showed great results for two newly diagnosed Type 1 patients, one a 20-year-old male and another a 12-month old female who were given a G6 and treated with telemedicine during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Using G6 and our software tools, clinicians at the Barbara Davis Center in Colorado were able to significantly improve the glucose levels of these patients through virtual care. Stepping back, the fundamentals of our business remained sound and there were several encouraging developments during the first quarter as our sales growth indicates the momentum behind our no fingerstick G6 technology continued in the first quarter, and as we have said multiple times before, we continue to believe that there are significantly more people on intensive insulin therapy to standard benefit from a transition to our real time CGM. At the end of the first quarter we have now transitioned the majority of our Medicare base over to G6 as the only Class II ICGM on the market and the lowest cost CGM for the Medicare channel. We look forward to bringing G6 to people both with Type 1 and intensively manage Type 2 diabetes who are eligible for Medicare. We are also pleased that UnitedHealthcare recently began coverage for their intensive insulin Type 2 patient population. Combined with Medicare, this demonstrates the increasing traction that we are gaining in the Type 2 intensive market. In January, we introduced additional data demonstrating the value of DexCom CGM in the Type 2 non-intensive market. This includes our direct work with UnitedHealthcare, digital health programs like WellDoc, Onduo, Livongo and integrated health systems like Intermountain where our preliminary pilot should significant savings with the fulltime use of DexCom G6 relative to standard of care self monitored blood glucose. We are excited to be expanding access to DexCom CGM throughout all of these channels and look forward to sharing additional results as we progress in our Type 2 efforts. The opportunity for growth is also extensive when we look outside the U.S. where use of CGM remains far less than that of fingerstick. In February, we obtained regulatory approvals for G6 in Australia, South Korea and Japan and are progressing toward extending the G6 launch to each of these markets later this year. In support of our continuing growth, in particular the service of our international markets. We recently finalized a decision to develop a third manufacturing site in Malaysia. This will be another significant investment for DexCom and demonstrates our belief in the long-term opportunity ahead of us. We continue to advance the regulatory pathway for use of CGM in pregnancy, attaining CE Mark for wear on the back of the arm and we removed the pregnancy warning for G6 for use in Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. Following this approval, we launched G6 in the UK for pregnant women with diabetes and are currently working to broaden the clinical evidence to support the use of DexCom CGM for the management of gestational diabetes. Finally, our efforts as a forerunner in interoperability and our support of patient choice and their method of insulin delivery has us well positioned to benefit from multiple commercial systems over the next couple of years, whether through automated insulin delivery or connected smart pens. As you can see, there are many exciting things that the DexCom teams are driving forward even as we navigate the unprecedented time that we are now experiencing. With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks Steve. This has certainly been a challenging season for all of us. I know that there are many that I've met and people on this call that have been personally impacted by COVID-19 and as I mentioned earlier, our thoughts are certainly with you. I've been grateful to see the unified response of so many companies to work towards innovative solutions including some of the companies that we traditionally compete with. I'm also proud of the response to the DexCom team who worked selflessly to bring continuity to our business and assurance to our customer base in a time of heightened anxiety. We are pressing forward in 2020 with resilience in the current environment and continue to hope for the opportunity that lies ahead for DexCom. I would now like to open the call up for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then reenter the queue if necessary. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Thanks and congrats on a great quarter. I have a lot of questions I could ask you about the first quarter performance, but unfortunately I'm going to address the elephant in the room with COVID-19. You pulled guidance, but you do have a month of performance here, what's happened in April, was wondering if you could just walk us through, I don't know if it's Quentin, if you want to take it or how you split it up, but maybe walk us through how we should think about the expectations for 2Q and had to think about the impact to prescribing in a recovery? How remote telehealth can help or hurt prescriptions of new patients? And how to think about the impact down the P&L as new sales might be a disrupted offset by some of the new venues that you've been able to secure here with testing? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: You know, Robbie, this is Kevin. I'll start. If I gave you a whole bunch of April color, then I'd be giving you guidance and that's what we just said that that we weren't going to do. That being said, we remain very bullish on our business, as you can see by the first quarter results and we have learned very much that the impact of the connectivity of our device with telemedicine is becoming very, very well-known by within the physician community. We hosted a webinar last week and had 900 participants sign-up. We don\u2019t get 900 people to anything here. That was a huge win for us as we talk and learn more about that. So I think particularly with our system where it goes directly to a phone and a directly of clarity and positions can pull up clarity wherever they are working, that is a big win for patients. We know that diabetes, I'll talk about this a little more later but it's not going to go away and these patients need to be cared for. We think we \u2013 we solve a very serious problem by getting data to patients and their caregivers in a very timely basis. You heard us also talk about getting clarity more towards a real time platform that could literally give a patient the opportunity to call their doctor and say, hey, what's going on with me. And caregivers aren't on share follow all the time. A more real-time clarity is going to give that caregiver a good answer. So we see a situation where you have a very good answer. We're bullish on the business going forward. Things are just a little different now. Quentin, if you want to add a little more to it.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes. No, I think you describe it well. I think Robbie, the thing is coming out of the quarter or over the course of the first quarter, the strength in the core business \u2013 the underlying business was incredibly strong. And I think from our perspective we\u2019re as bullish as we've ever been on where we're at in this opportunity, the runway that exist in front of us and, and probably even more so now when you think about the long-term just with the hospital opportunity opening up probably sooner than what we anticipated. The whole play in telehealth, telemedicine, we know we have a device that works better there than anything else in the marketplace. And folks seem to be \u2013 seem to be understanding that to Kevin's point, the 900 folks that joined the webinar, it was a webinar specifically directed towards telehealth, telemedicine. So there's a real interest out there. So I think long-term we feel incredibly bullish about where we're at. In April, yes, the new patient starts, we're down a bit. We noted that coming out of Q1. We have seen it start to rebound a bit in April. I think it continues to build over time, but we need to see that play out and have some certainty there before we can get back to where we feel comfortable providing guidance. There's just too many \u2013 too many things that are uncertain at this point in time that we need that greater clarity on. But I would just reiterate the underlying strength that the fact that folks are recognizing the value of this product and what it means in the marketplace. From a long-term perspective, we're as bullish as we've ever been.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from Leerink. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong quarter. And I guess just to follow-up. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, so appreciate the commentary. Quentin, thank you on new patient as in April and that coming down, so uptake a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about how new patient adds, patient training, things like that could look post COVID if we are in a world where telehealth is a more prominent part of patient management specifically for diabetes, I would think that that ultimately would favor CGM, but just curious about how you think if that could change your long-term expectations around penetration in these markets and maybe a little bit of color of postcodes, what things might look like based on what you're seeing today? And that's my question. Thanks so much\nKevin Sayer: Danielle, I think we'll tag team this one too and I'll start. First of all, as we talked about in our call, 70% of our patients train themselves with the material that we provide and we've also had remote coaching services through DexCom care to help these patients as well. We've anticipated a day like this with respect to training for a long, long time, which is why we moved away from the model we previously had whereby we could make this easier and get patients on the system. So we don't see that changing much at all. As far as new patient opportunities and new patients coming in, whereas in the past, many times that was a result of an office visit. Now it's coming in possibly through a telemedicine conference with a healthcare provider. They can also be coming in through our direct consumer marketing. Our online efforts are \u2013 all the things that we have and then we have to turn around and figure out a way to get the proper paperwork from the healthcare provider. One of the other things that's key to remember in Quentin's remarks, he talked about how our move to the pharmacies accelerating. As we go to the pharmacy, the paper work requirements for healthcare providers come down significantly, so again making the whole process easier. And that's been our goal from the beginning to get this process easy enough to whereby. We can get the penetration that we thought we could get. And I've said for years that 80% penetration and intensive insulin users with CGM should be our long-term goal and it still is. And the easier we make it, the faster penetration will go and those efforts have not changed and won't change as a result of COVID. As far as post COVID world and what I see is demand. I think if anything, people are going to be more concerned about controlling their diabetes to make sure they're healthy. So if something like this happens again, that will not become a complicating factor because their diabetes is in control, not running rampant. So again, we see this as an opportunity to almost increased retention and increase usage within our current patient base as much as it is to grab new ones. So I don't want to sound opportunistic \u2013 too opportunistic about this, but we have an answer to a serious problem here and we think people will come to it. Well Steve, Quentin, if you have anything more to add...\nQuentin Blackford: You covered it, okay.\nKevin Sayer: Okay.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Maybe moving over to the hospital setting. Kevin, a nice win getting the CGM or G6 into the hospital setting. Wondering what this means maybe longer term, any discussions with the FDA on whether data you'll collect in these COVID patients could be used to maybe accelerate a broader approval down the road for hospital use? Do you think you'd still have to go through the lengthy pivotal that seemed like it might have pushed hospital approval out two to three years from now or one to two years out anyway? Is there a way to accelerate that with some of this data that you'll be collecting here over the next X months with the COVID pandemic? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: No, thank you. We actually have had discussions with the FDA about this very subject and it is our hope to gather as much data as we can from these patients as they are in this hospital with various compounds being injected and to take care of their help to see how our sensor performs in this environment, how well connectivity is and what we can learn. Our commitment to the agency is with this opportunity will gather as much data as we can and we're going to share what we learn and see if we can in fact accelerate that path and get this device approved for use as a glucose monitoring technology in the hospital environment rather than, than what they're doing with fingersticks. And as we gather data, we'll take advantage of this opportunity. I think Jeff, the learning\u2019s we've had so far are astounding to us, as we're into a different channel with a different physician group, with different caregivers who haven't seen CGM before with rules and regulations around hospital IT departments and connecting a phone within their security system. We've had learning\u2019s that we would have never anticipated. We will be so much more ready to go to this market when it's time. The commitment we've made here from a dollar perspective is large. We put a lot of time and effort and the hospital team has literally worked around the clock to get this going and so we'll gather the data, will file what we see or at least share what we see and then determine a course of action after that. If we see highly positive results, it's not unthinkable that they would give us an accelerated timeframe or cutback on the work that we have to do are possibly change a label to allow us to get there sooner. We're open to all that and we will look at every one of those opportunities once we're done. But we\u2019re really taking this opportunity very seriously.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Brien: Afternoon, thanks for taking the questions. Can we just talk about G7 for a second? I think most people had expected a bit of a delay here, but it's a 14-day trial. So the six month delay I think is a little bit longer than some had expected. So I guess the question would be what would have to happen for it to be pushed out that entire six months or what could happen to where that delay is not necessarily that long?\nKevin Sayer: I'll start; again, well all of you guys chime in. It\u2019s not just a 14-day study. If we could run a 14-day study and put several hundred people on it for 14 days that would be relatively simple. These trials are not that simplistic. There's going to be at least four in clinic days where blood is drawn for 12 hours and we can only handle two to three patients at a time, at a clinic per day. So these trials are very well orchestrated and scheduled from a logistics perspective. We do not know when clinics who run these trials are going to open back-up and allow patients in to run these kinds of studies. Nor do we know when patients are going to run and allow themselves to this kind of study. So we're putting that time in there knowing there's going to be a while before things get back to normal in these large clinics and many large clinics where we do these studies aren't even letting patients come in the door now, let alone patients come in for clinical trials. So we've put this timeframe on it. How could it in fact accelerate, because accelerate if we found data on the system that would enable us to statistically reduce the size of the trial. But let us again remind you, we're not shooting for just anything. We're shooting for high ICGM standards and that is a high bar that is not an arbitrary bar set by the FDA. That's a high bar. We've met with G6 and we executed a perfect study to get that done. We've got to execute perfection again. So we've given ourselves this timeframe to make sure all our plans are locked down, that we can get the centers open, they can go and do this and we'll be methodical and thoughtful about it. If there's some way we can accelerate that we would, but we gave you this because we typically are prudent in our guidance and what we speak and what we think and that's what we see right now. That's it.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Hi, congratulations on a strong Q1. Did want to get a little more color on the impact of the patient support program and also the mix headwind that I'm assuming would happen as patients move from commercial to Medicaid coverage? So any color there of how to think about the headwind for those two programs?\nQuentin Blackford: Yes. Travis, this is Quentin. I think what you're asking is exactly what we struggle with in terms of defining any certainty around what it \u2013 what it's going to be. As we continue to see the fallout from an unemployment perspective in the States and even globally how that ultimately shows up or translates into our numbers, it's hard for us to predict. You\u2019ve take an existing patient who has been paying, in line with their program or their plan they've been on for some period of time and all of a suddenly fall into the patient assistance program. You're right? There is going to be a mixed impact on the business. I think that's part of the challenge with trying to draw the line on exactly where that's going to be. And until we have greater color on where those rates \u2013 unemployment rates ultimately fall out and the impacts ultimately fall out to our patient base, it's hard to predict. So that's what leads to putting us in a position where we ultimately feel best at this point just to pull guidance. Again, we couldn't be more bullish around what's going on inside the business, but we know there's going to be mixed impacts and shifts over the next several months. So right now the visibility is limited.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Malgorzata Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open.\nMalgorzata Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon guys. Just wanted to follow-up with some more specific question about the hospital? And, so when we look at the sensors that are going out there, can you give us some sort of information in terms of the data sharing agreements that you guys have with the hospitals trialing? So what data are you targeting again? What endpoints are the hospitals and yourself interested in? And our patient's consent it to you or the hospital using the data at least on a de-identified basis, so that you can get kind of a larger national registry at least?\nSteve Pacelli: Yes. Malgorzata, this is Steve. Don't read too much in net at this early stage. This is something that literally the hospital team work 24/7 to get products into the hospital to reduce the risk to caregivers, right. They weren\u2019t able to take fingersticks because they have to \u2013 really, they have to actually change out their PP every time they would have to go pick a finger and they were just \u2013 they couldn\u2019t do it. So right now we are capturing data. This is all about being able to remotely monitor these patients to help the caregivers in the hospital provide better care. To the extent we have data down the road that we're obviously retaining, we'll look to see what we do with it. But right now we\u2019ve not made any plans to do anything specifically with the data, either with a hospital or on an automized basis or otherwise.\nKevin Sayer: We have a couple that are under IRB, but it's not...\nSteve Pacelli: Most of them are\u2026\nKevin Sayer: Most of them are getting this thing up and running to take care of people right now. But, Steve is right. We\u2019re continuing to work on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMorgan Stanley: Good afternoon. Just want to come back to the first quarter a little bit here. Kevin, you touched on this briefly in your preamble. We think about the effect of stocking and the effect of inpatient use. I'm assuming inpatient use was pretty minimal in the first quarter, but both these, these positive offsets potentially was stocking several million or tens of millions, and was the inpatient opportunity here recently several million or bigger than that, just trying to get some sense of the framework of some of those positive drivers here? Thanks so much.\nQuentin Blackford: Hey David, this is Quentin. Yes. With respect to the inpatient, that was minimal, I mean it didn't move the needle at all. On the stocking side, you're talking several millions, not tens of millions by any stretch at all. It was on the lower end. I think that the point that we were making in our prepared remarks was there's several questions out there around whether or not stocking is driving results in the first quarter. And that the point is, there are several distributors who would have liked to have had the opportunity to stock up ahead of some of the uncertainty that they saw. But frankly we weren't in the position or we weren't enabling that to take place. We monitor this very closely. We have provisions in our agreements with those distributors; now limit the amount of days of inventory on hand that they can carry and so we monitor that. And so while there was an expressed interest to stock to a greater degree, we did not enable that and therefore it was not a driver of the results. And that was the point we were trying to get across.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening or afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious what you have seen either in the month of April or in previous recessions when it comes to attrition. And do patients start going back to traditional fingersticks? And anything you could say, because many of us on this call did not cover the stock back in 2008 or 2009 or 2001 or 2002 would be helpful if it's relevant? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: Steve, you're the only one here.\nSteve Pacelli: What I would say is no, I mean we've obviously had a very strong quarter driven by both existing patient base and new patients back. If you remember back in the 2008-2009 timeframe, we were still on the 2007 and the 2007 plus, which those technologies just weren't really ready for prime time. It really wasn't, if you remember it wasn't until we launched the Gen 4 PLATINUM and I think it was Q4 of 2012 that you really saw the inflection in this business. We really moved to a must have versus a nice to have in terms of our technology. So I don't know that you could possibly make a comparison to back that. I mean, back in those days it was Terry and I just trying to raise money, every opportunity we could to keep the lights on. So it's just a different, it's not even a comparable business at this time.\nKevin Sayer: About the only thing I could add to that is, we have done everything we can to make it easier for our patients to get CGM even during these tough times. In 2008 or 2009, we had zero Medicaid coverage. We had no Medicare coverage. We had no pharmacy benefit where the co-pays typically significantly lower than it is through DME. And pricing has been somewhat lower. So I think we've done everything we can to position our business to be more successful during a time like this and to help our patients continue on the therapy. But again, now you have what may be a recession tied to health care event, we may see exactly the opposite. The patients absolutely have to have this to it healthier, believe that they do. Again, part of the unknowns that we're trying to work through and trying to manage.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kyle Rose of Canaccord. Your line is open.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. So, I appreciate the additional commentary with respect to the G7 clinical trial, but maybe help us understand what you can do over the course of the next six months from a manufacturing perspective to help accelerate maybe the launch timing. Because if I remember correctly, you're going to get approval before year-end, but the launch wasn't really going to take place until you had capacity and that was a 2021 event. Can you help us understand what happens behind the scenes, while the trial might not be going and how that might help the eventual commercial pace when it does launch?\nKevin Sayer: Let's be clear. We never said we'd have approval by year-end, and we said we expected a 2021 launch with a limited launch by the end of 2020 was our goal without meaningful financial impact in 2020, if we had a limited launch. There are things we can do to accelerate those studies possibly. On the manufacturing side we have similar circumstances to what Quen described earlier about the core business. We have suppliers that we're not in control of or rapidly putting equipment together and building things for us. We have orders for this equipment all over the world, waiting for it to come in, to get those lines up and running. We will remain committed to the fact, that we will not do a full scale launch of this product until we're ready to go completely. And on top of that while we wait and sometimes we forget, we have a fantastic product of what we have in G6 and so we will continue to refine and make that better. I don\u2019t know Quen, if you have any other things, we can do on manufacturing\u2026\nQuentin Blackford: No, I think the teams are doing a great job of pushing forward as well as we can, as fast as we can on G7 and just the automation capability from a production perspective, clearly having folks out of the office creates some challenging disruptions in the pace at which you move, but I think overall we're navigating it quite well. At the same time, our supply chain is one where it's global in nature. We rely on folks from all over the world to help us produce our product. And we've done a great job of managing G6 to- date G7, we've managed through it as well, but there have been situations where you have a temporary impact here or there, and you've got to quickly navigate through it to make sure everything stays on track and on time. And to-date we've done that well, but that's some of the uncertainty that starts to get introduced in the environment that we find ourselves navigating through. So to-date we're handling it well but there's a lot of balls in the air and we're doing the best that we possibly can and if we can pull it forward to Kevin's point, we certainly will look at those sorts of things.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew Blackman from Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatthew Blackman: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the question. You did mention accelerating pharmacy channel mix. So I'm curious, if you had any feedback from payers talking particularly about holdout payers that may now be more willing to accommodate pharmacy access for DexCom and similarly, has there been an impact in the last six weeks or so on the insurance verification process? Is that moving along smoothly? Is it similar to the pace you've seen in the past, faster or slower? Any help there would be appreciated, thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Quen, you want to go ahead.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes, so I think from a pharmacy perspective, the comments that we made were clear that we've seen the uptick in that pharmacy channel progress at a very rapid pace and its one channel that we always thought just has tremendous potential for us and we've proved that out over the course of the first quarter. As a matter of fact, we talk about new patients being a driver of growth, for the first time we saw record new patients in the first quarter, despite the fact that we saw slow down in the very back end of the quarter. And so I attribute a good part of that to the pharmacy channel. We haven't seen payers or at least I couldn't speak to any particular payers here in the last several weeks who have opened up more incremental pharmacy access, but we have seen payers who are willing to think differently around the requirements that they might have on patients ordering product such as clinical site visits or coming in to see the clinician, they're allowing that through telehealth, now telemedicine, we see more and more payers who are moving that direction each and every week. So we are seeing a changing dynamic from a payer perspective, haven't seen it so much in terms of opening incremental pharmacy access in the last several weeks, but there is an appetite for change here.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies, your line is open.\nRaj Denhoy: Hi. Good afternoon. What if I could maybe ask about international a little bit, so the 41 million increase to 60% plus was notably strong. And so I'm curious if there was particular markets in which you saw that growth. And as a related question, as we think about Germany, the UK being some of the more impacted markets with COVID, what are your thoughts around how those will trend over the next several quarters?\nKevin Sayer: Yes, Raj, great question. International was clearly a bright spot in the quarter and really it was across the entire international region, whether it was Europe, Asia both regions performed incredibly well. Canada was a driver of the overall growth with the e-Commerce platform we put in place there we couldn't be more happy with the results that we see. I think one of the interesting data points coming out of the quarter, while Germany is a large market for us, continues to have great success. The UK also growing quite aggressively, very significantly outpaced most other major markets, which was nice to see. So a lot of runway continues to exist in all of these markets, but really strength across the board, even through Asia and Australia. So there's not one country to really pull out and attribute all this success to, it was performance across the entire slate that led to the overall outcome that we communicated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. I hope everyone's healthy. I hate to blow my one question on a yes or no question, but Quentin, I think I just heard you say that you generated record new patients in 1Q is that correct?\nQuentin Blackford: Yes.\nJayson Bedford: So meaning you generated more new patients in 1Q 2020 than in any other quarter?\nQuentin Blackford: Yes, correct.\nKevin Sayer: The first quarter of 2020 was a record number of new patients to the company versus any other quarter in history, that's right.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ryan Blicker from Cowen. Your line is open.\nRyan Blicker: Thanks for taking my questions. Two, reimburse them one. So subsequent to UNH coverage, is there any quantification you can provide on where commercial payer coverage for intensely managed Type 2 patients is in the U.S. today? And then can you also give us an update on the reimbursement environment in Japan and South Korea as you plan to launch later this year? Thank you.\nQuentin Blackford: The reimbursement with intensive Type 2 is obviously most of their Medicare patients we have that covered. After that it is really been payer-by-payer, we announced a healthcare Type 2 coverage today, we also have had another large payer expand their Type 2 intensive use policy, just hit us today, that'll be another win for us. I think a lot of the payers as we go to the pharmacy have actually included Type 2 as we've gone there as well. But it's a gradual thing. It's not going to happen overnight. We keep having wins and our payer team is doing a job staying on top of that and we're kind of getting the message out that insulin users and insulin user and they all need access to this. So our Type 2 intensive use patient base is growing significantly and becoming a much larger part of our business.\nKevin Sayer: I don't have a great update for you on \u2013 new update for you anyway on Korea, but with respect to Japan, we did get our G6 approval. So that's an approval for consumer use, the professional use clinician product. We don't currently have reimbursement. So when we launch that product in the consumer channel before the end of this year, it'll be a cash pay product, what we've elected not to do is follow a competitor and accept really subpar reimbursement based on kind of fingerstick level pricing. We're just not going to go there with that, we're going to do our work, provide the Japanese government with the appropriate data, outcomes data and establish real reimbursement for real time CGM. So that won't be this year, but we'll give you an update when we have more.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Can you quantify all the impact on new patient starts in April? Just looking for a rough sense for how significant the disruption has been. And then Quen, I just want to make sure I heard you right, that you've already seen those numbers begin to rebound, that seems a little fast. Wondering whether you have any sense for why that is, are physicians getting better at telemedicine, because it seems like most areas are still pretty locked down. Thanks.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes, we're not going to comment specifically on where it's at. I think, there's been a lot of research, a lot of surveys that have been done that we've seen that would indicate, new patients starts might be 40 or 50% of what they previously were, we haven't seen it to that extent, but they certainly have been impacted. And to the point I made earlier, we have seen it start to come back a bit. I think folks are just getting comfortable understanding, that there's other means of being able to interact with their physician, learn about the product and ultimately get the product on to them and that's the telehealth, telemedicine capability that continues to develop. I'll point you back to the webinar that we had just two weeks ago. Over 900 physicians dialed into that webinar to learn of the value and ways to introduce CGM through telehealth. I think that speaks to the interest level that's out there. So I think it will continue to build over time, how quickly it goes, it's hard to say and that's part of why the uncertainty exists and gives us pause on the guidance that's out there and leaving it there. But, overall I think, down the road telehealth, telemedicine is going to play a much bigger part than what we've seen historically.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Lichtman of Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi guys. You talked about the strong cash position you're in, which is particularly important during this time. You also mentioned being opportunistic with the cash. Can you provide any color on where that cash can be put to use for growth initiatives beyond the manufacturing expansion, any other broader thoughts on potential use of cash that you can provide? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Quen, you take first stab, and I will walk on what I can you tell you. Go ahead.\nQuentin Blackford: Well, I think certainly the new market opportunities that we've been after for a while now with Dolan and team leading that effort, we've been very clear around hospital, is there a way to accelerate that? There certainly seems to be an interest level beyond hours now sitting on the other side, but there's the hospital or the FDA, we want to make sure we're opportunistic and think about that in a way that can accelerate it. I think that there's, potentially in that space, even more than just the device itself, but how do you improve efficiency in the hospital setting? So even from an IT capability perspective, thinking about those sorts of things, we think about gestational diabetes, pregnancy, the whole Type 2 non-intensive space, I think that market remains significant. And I think, we're seeing each and every day that there's a validated opportunity in that space and we want to go fast. So we're keeping our eyes open out there in those spaces, around the opportunities that exist and if there's opportunities to kind of really put the foot on the gas pedal, we're going to look at those sorts of things. So that's what we mean by being opportunistic.\nSteve Pacelli: Yes. I just add one more thing, as far as cash because I'm the one driving Quen and his team on this. We talk about doubling manufacturing capacity before the first half of the year is over. We're pushing to get that, but that's a lot of capital equipment, as we go to a lot of G6 automated lines and get those up and running and get more lines up at our contract manufacturers, we then have a significant capital investment in G7 equipment that will be coming. And we talked about investing in a third manufacturing site in Malaysia. So there's going to be a lot of capital equipment. So we purchased the other place that we will definitely be using cash as we invest in our businesses, just in our infrastructure and in our systems. We will \u2013 if we've learned anything through this, we need to make some more investments on that side too. Our team has been fantastic with the tool they had when you give them some more tools. So we have a lot of capital use for that money for organic growth as well.\nOperator: And the next question. Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital. Your line is open.\nRavi Misra: Hi, good evening. I hope everyone over there and their families are okay. Just a question about the financial assistance program, you're providing about six months worth of supply to patients. Can you just help us understand kind of, would that be something that would be shipped out, immediately if someone signs up and also how do we think about it if the economy continues to kind of show these unemployment numbers, how willing is the company to kind of extend these programs for beyond that six month period? Is there anything that would be gating you to that? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: Well, we'll start with our six month period. As we got to that conclusion, as we've modeled that out, we're certainly comfortable with that. We're very comfortable with again, helping our patient base out. These are the people that built our company, made it what it is. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the more I traveled before this pandemic, the more I learned. There are a lot of people who have no idea how to manage their diabetes without a CGM. So we will continue to try and get product to patients. We'll evaluate the economic consequences of what we do as we roll this out over time. You know, three years ago if we had to do this, it would have been even much more difficult because we had very little Medicaid and we didn't even have Medicare up and running. Now with Medicare approval and Medicaid, there are some states where these patients have been employed can go to Medicaid programs, but it's very inconsistent and sporadic, even though we have. I want to say 60% of Medicaid programs cover \u2013 some only covers for kids and some make it very difficult. So we will continue to push for more Medicaid coverage during this time to try and Medicaid that and we'll see how it goes and we'll keep track. But, it's important that we make sure these people can stay on the system and we think this is a really good opportunity for us. So we will continue to do that.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Your line is open.\nChris Cooley: Thank you. I appreciate you taking the promotions for this evening. Congrats on the record new patient starts. Just at this point from my perspective maybe, Quentin could you help us out a little bit with, as we looked at the operating expenses trending forward, you alluded to better managing the supply chain would assume you'd keep higher levels of safety stock, have higher costs in the shorter run and appropriately so on the labor side. Just maybe help us, when we look at the first quarter, was that reflected in the 1Q results or just any way you can maybe help us better understand how we should think about maybe the margin structure as we start to go through the year, ex the capacity build out and maybe similarly from the DTC effort, what you're looking for there to kick that up just from a change in the COVID-19 situation. Thanks so much.\nQuentin Blackford: Yes, I think if you go back to the guidance that we set coming into the year, we spoke about some of the different levers that were in there. And certainly some of the things that were going to weigh on the organization being specific to G7 trials, development of the automation lines, ramping G6 as quickly as we can and doubling it, and DTC being a significant investment. I think, while we've walked away from guidance on the full year, those sorts of drivers are still going to be in the spend profile and they're going to be more heavily weighted in the back half of the year. So while you're seeing a 1,300 basis point improvement in operating margin in Q1 it's not likely that you're going to see that same sort of improvement in the back half of the year, because there's going to be all these incremental investments that we know that we need to make and that will set the company up for growth far into the future and we're going to commit ourselves to invest in those ways. So I think you're going to continue to see some good leverage in the first half of the year. I think in the back half of the year, you're going to see the P&L start to look a little bit differently as we make some of these key investments into what I think all of us understand to be critical growth drivers of the future. So I'll leave it at that, the P&L profile will shift a little bit, but overall we still remain committed to the longer term goals that we put out there at Analyst Day just year and a half ago or so.\nOperator: And this concludes your question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to the speakers for final remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Hi, this is Kevin. I'll finish up today. We want to thank all of you for participating on our call. I surely under circumstances far different from what you envisioned during our 2019 Q4 earnings call last February, when I watched the night \u2013 the news night in and out, I've seen the toll that this virus has taken on communities all over the world and recognize, when this pandemic ends, our world human interaction and the administration of healthcare will be forever changed. DexCom is very fortunate to be in a strong position during this pandemic and I personally feel sense of obligation to operate from that strength to serve the needs of others in this time of heightened anxiety. We'll stay at home orders and school closures. We realize our employees day-to-day lives have been upended causing significant stress. We've attempted to reduce that stress by offering increased pay to essential onsite workers and promoting increased safety measures to best protect all DexCom employees. We recognize that diabetes doesn't take a break even for pandemics, economic slowdowns or high unemployment. Now more than ever, we have a responsibility to patients that have supported DexCom over the years and made us the company that we are today. We're therefore working quickly on a roll out of our patient assistance program to provide access to DexCom CGM for the many individuals who have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19. In addition, we realized that helping a patient staying control their blood glucose, also his family members and clinicians providing needed relief to our healthcare system. Our core belief remains unchanged. If we do our best to take care of our patients, the business will always move in the right direction. Every intensive insulin using patients have access to real time CGM. We'll work tirelessly to make that happen. COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on the diabetes community. This awful virus is also attacking the pancreas of people without diabetes. As a result, brave frontline responders are having to repeatedly gown up and [indiscernible] administer finger sticks to test patient's blood glucose levels. We've worked hard with the FDA to provide these heroes with better tools to treat patients and reduce healthcare workers overall risk of infection. However employees have rallied to this cause has been nothing short of amazing. In short order, we've created new training materials, stood up a specialized technical support group, procured to configure thousands of cell phones for use in this environment at a cost in excess of $1 million and developed a separate commercial structure to launch G6 in this market at significantly reduced prices. We are making a significant investment here. Our commitment to connectivity, enable multiple platforms to consume our data and cloud based tools for healthcare providers has become even more important than we envisioned when we blazed this trail many, many years ago. As the work from the team in the Barbara Davis center in Colorado indicates, the unique features of our CGM and connected software solutions are playing an important role in driving care for newly diagnosed people with diabetes during this crisis. We are hopeful that the expanded use of telemedicine during the crisis can ultimately provide avenues for greater access to health care over the long-term and DexCom CGM providing an essential tool in the process. In addition, our efforts to assist hospitals worldwide is a big investment as I said earlier, we intend to take all of the data that we can gather, generated during this time to accelerate the development and launch of a hospital-based system that better meets the needs of healthcare providers in our current ambulatory product. It's often during difficult times that the two character of an individual or company is revealed. Our hope is that our efforts during this time will provide comfort to the many stakeholders that we serve and that our character of DexCom will stand out brightly. On behalf of our employees, I'm proud to lead these efforts. Thanks. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you Sean and thank you everyone for joining us. Let me start by expressing my gratitude for the many healthcare workers and first responders that are supporting all of us at this time. We certainly stand with you in this effort and our thoughts are with you and those who have been impacted by COVID-19. As a quick summary, the first quarter was another very strong quarter for DexCom, continuing the growth momentum that we've delivered for much of the past two years. First quarter revenue grew to $405 million, representing 44% growth over the first quarter of 2019 or greater than $120 million of absolute dollar growth. This performance was driven by strength in new patient additions in both the U.S. and international businesses. Even as we saw some impact in new patient opportunities related to COVID-19 beginning in mid-March. We will address first quarter performance in a moment, but first and foremost we wanted to discuss the impact of COVID-19 and DexCom's response. The past few months have brought and likely will continue to bring unprecedented challenges to global health and economic systems as a result of the virus. While this has been an incredibly difficult humanitarian crisis, we have also seen many encouraging examples of collaboration around the world from public and private entities. We have seen people working to bring care to those in need, protect the health of the vulnerable and support the wellbeing of workers and families. From the outset, we recognize that DexCom has an important role to play. Our customers rely on our CGM technology to safely manage blood glucose and deliver insulin. In many cases, these are people with diabetes who have relied on DexCom CGM since diagnosis, meaning they haven't known a world without the peace of mind and real time continuous glucose monitoring.  People with diabetes are also at heightened risk for complications with COVID-19. Highlighting the importance of good glycaemic control during these challenging times, we set out with three core priorities, keep our employees safe, continue to serve our patients and work to help our communities. To meet this challenge and support these core priorities, we set in motion several initiatives. We quickly moved the majority of our global employees to home-based work arrangements, this transition enhance the safety of all of our employees, including our teams who remain onsite and benefit from a less stance work environment. Our IT and emergency response teams have done an excellent job to enable this shift and provide necessary resources for our teams to continue to function effectively and care for our patients. I could share numerous examples of DexCom teams going above and beyond to ensure that our customers receive product and the support that they need, but I'll share one that stands out to me. In order to ensure that our products were supplied in a timely manner, we had members of our IT teams who were willing to sleep onsite to meet the needs of our employees and our patients. As this story demonstrates our employees care deeply for our patients and we continue to work on new ways to enhance customer support in these unique times. This includes our announcement yesterday of a program to provide financial assistance to our existing patients who have lost or may lose access to insurance coverage for their DexCom's supplies as a result of COVID-19. This program which we plan to launch in the next several weeks will provide up to two 90 day supply shipments for only $45 each and provide relief to our patients and what is clearly a very challenging time. As it pertains to our customers both the patient and the clinician, we are working on ways to ensure we have the appropriate infrastructure to support their evolving needs. Our extensive virtual resources for patient and clinician training and customer support are proving to be especially important as the world embraces the increasing use of telemedicine platforms. As a reminder, more than 70% of our historical new patient additions have self-trained using the resources that we provide, demonstrating the value of these resources and ease of use of our CGM systems. Even prior to the global spread of the virus, our procurement and operations teams work to access and mitigate any potential risk to the supply chain for existing products. Because of their effort, we have seen very little disruption with our manufacturing sites as both San Diego and Mesa remain fully operational. Our manufacturing teams have worked seamlessly to make sure that our customers get the CGM systems they rely on. We've implemented additional safety measures to reduce the number of people on site at any given time. We have implemented shift separations and added additional sanitation and safety measures on top of our existing procedures including thermal scanning. With the supply chain and manufacturing operations currently in good shape, we continue to be in a strong inventory position to meet the current demand for both the existing patients and new patients. We have seen some customer interest in stocking up on the product, but have worked to keep customers supplied in line with the provisions of their insurance providers. This also applies to our DME suppliers and wholesalers. We did not see a material positive impact from customer stocking on our first quarter sales performance. We have also looked at ways that DexCom could play its part in providing solutions that benefit our communities during the COVID outbreak. When avenues already played out, as hospital systems came under increasing pressure and had limited personal protective equipment, we began to feel the number of requests for our G6 sensors.  In the ICU, hospital personnel often need to monitor patients with finger sticks as much as every half an hour. In response to the request, we worked with the FDA to temporarily allow for the use of G6 in the hospital setting and we quickly set out to supply product to key regions battling the COVID crisis. Because of our real time connectivity, our CGM systems allow healthcare providers to remotely monitor a patient's glucose levels in real time reducing the need for finger sticks. As a result, there are fewer physical interactions between healthcare providers and patients, which limits viral exposure for hospital staff and preserves personal protective equipment. We are already seeing promising evidence of these benefits from the initial sites. Recently the FDA removed the three hour delay requirement for CGM data into our CLARITY software, allowing for faster data integration. As we roll this out in the coming weeks, our remote monitoring solutions will be further enhanced in both the hospital setting and for telehealth consultations for people with diabetes. We expect to continue supporting hospitals in areas of the country most impacted by the COVID-19 emergency, although our top priority remains serving our existing patients without interruption.  The drastic but necessary steps to mitigate the spread of the virus have also created some areas of unpredictability for us as we continue in our second quarter and the remainder of 2020. As I briefly noted above, we have seen some impact in new patient opportunities since the broader social distancing measures were put in place in mid-March. We are hopeful that this impact may be mitigated as conditions enhance their telemedicine capabilities and our team is certainly working hard to ensure patient access for those in need of DexCom CGM. Quentin will provide more detail around how we have contemplated this uncertainty relative to our 2020 guidance. Another area of unpredictability right now is around the timing of large clinical trials like we need to run for G7. We remain confident in our ability to deliver G7, but acknowledge that the timing of the pivotal trial will be delayed due to the pausing of new trials at most clinical sites. We currently expect a minimum delay of approximately six months for the pivotal trial. This is obviously a challenging time across the globe, but I'm very proud of the way the DexCom teams have responded.  I will now turn the call over to Quentin for review of our financials. Thanks Steve. This has certainly been a challenging season for all of us. I know that there are many that I've met and people on this call that have been personally impacted by COVID-19 and as I mentioned earlier, our thoughts are certainly with you. I've been grateful to see the unified response of so many companies to work towards innovative solutions including some of the companies that we traditionally compete with. I'm also proud of the response to the DexCom team who worked selflessly to bring continuity to our business and assurance to our customer base in a time of heightened anxiety. We are pressing forward in 2020 with resilience in the current environment and continue to hope for the opportunity that lies ahead for DexCom. I would now like to open the call up for Q&A. Sean? You know, Robbie, this is Kevin. I'll start. If I gave you a whole bunch of April color, then I'd be giving you guidance and that's what we just said that that we weren't going to do. That being said, we remain very bullish on our business, as you can see by the first quarter results and we have learned very much that the impact of the connectivity of our device with telemedicine is becoming very, very well-known by within the physician community. We hosted a webinar last week and had 900 participants sign-up. We don't get 900 people to anything here. That was a huge win for us as we talk and learn more about that. So I think particularly with our system where it goes directly to a phone and a directly of clarity and positions can pull up clarity wherever they are working, that is a big win for patients. We know that diabetes, I'll talk about this a little more later but it's not going to go away and these patients need to be cared for. We think we \u2013 we solve a very serious problem by getting data to patients and their caregivers in a very timely basis. You heard us also talk about getting clarity more towards a real time platform that could literally give a patient the opportunity to call their doctor and say, hey, what's going on with me. And caregivers aren't on share follow all the time. A more real-time clarity is going to give that caregiver a good answer. So we see a situation where you have a very good answer. We're bullish on the business going forward. Things are just a little different now. Quentin, if you want to add a little more to it. Danielle, I think we'll tag team this one too and I'll start. First of all, as we talked about in our call, 70% of our patients train themselves with the material that we provide and we've also had remote coaching services through DexCom care to help these patients as well. We've anticipated a day like this with respect to training for a long, long time, which is why we moved away from the model we previously had whereby we could make this easier and get patients on the system. So we don't see that changing much at all. As far as new patient opportunities and new patients coming in, whereas in the past, many times that was a result of an office visit. Now it's coming in possibly through a telemedicine conference with a healthcare provider. They can also be coming in through our direct consumer marketing. Our online efforts are \u2013 all the things that we have and then we have to turn around and figure out a way to get the proper paperwork from the healthcare provider. One of the other things that's key to remember in Quentin's remarks, he talked about how our move to the pharmacies accelerating. As we go to the pharmacy, the paper work requirements for healthcare providers come down significantly, so again making the whole process easier. And that's been our goal from the beginning to get this process easy enough to whereby. We can get the penetration that we thought we could get. And I've said for years that 80% penetration and intensive insulin users with CGM should be our long-term goal and it still is. And the easier we make it, the faster penetration will go and those efforts have not changed and won't change as a result of COVID. As far as post COVID world and what I see is demand. I think if anything, people are going to be more concerned about controlling their diabetes to make sure they're healthy. So if something like this happens again, that will not become a complicating factor because their diabetes is in control, not running rampant. So again, we see this as an opportunity to almost increased retention and increase usage within our current patient base as much as it is to grab new ones. So I don't want to sound opportunistic \u2013 too opportunistic about this, but we have an answer to a serious problem here and we think people will come to it. Well Steve, Quentin, if you have anything more to add... Okay. No, thank you. We actually have had discussions with the FDA about this very subject and it is our hope to gather as much data as we can from these patients as they are in this hospital with various compounds being injected and to take care of their help to see how our sensor performs in this environment, how well connectivity is and what we can learn. Our commitment to the agency is with this opportunity will gather as much data as we can and we're going to share what we learn and see if we can in fact accelerate that path and get this device approved for use as a glucose monitoring technology in the hospital environment rather than, than what they're doing with fingersticks. And as we gather data, we'll take advantage of this opportunity. I think Jeff, the learning's we've had so far are astounding to us, as we're into a different channel with a different physician group, with different caregivers who haven't seen CGM before with rules and regulations around hospital IT departments and connecting a phone within their security system. We've had learning's that we would have never anticipated. We will be so much more ready to go to this market when it's time. The commitment we've made here from a dollar perspective is large. We put a lot of time and effort and the hospital team has literally worked around the clock to get this going and so we'll gather the data, will file what we see or at least share what we see and then determine a course of action after that. If we see highly positive results, it's not unthinkable that they would give us an accelerated timeframe or cutback on the work that we have to do are possibly change a label to allow us to get there sooner. We're open to all that and we will look at every one of those opportunities once we're done. But we're really taking this opportunity very seriously. I'll start; again, well all of you guys chime in. It's not just a 14-day study. If we could run a 14-day study and put several hundred people on it for 14 days that would be relatively simple. These trials are not that simplistic. There's going to be at least four in clinic days where blood is drawn for 12 hours and we can only handle two to three patients at a time, at a clinic per day. So these trials are very well orchestrated and scheduled from a logistics perspective. We do not know when clinics who run these trials are going to open back-up and allow patients in to run these kinds of studies. Nor do we know when patients are going to run and allow themselves to this kind of study. So we're putting that time in there knowing there's going to be a while before things get back to normal in these large clinics and many large clinics where we do these studies aren't even letting patients come in the door now, let alone patients come in for clinical trials. So we've put this timeframe on it. How could it in fact accelerate, because accelerate if we found data on the system that would enable us to statistically reduce the size of the trial. But let us again remind you, we're not shooting for just anything. We're shooting for high ICGM standards and that is a high bar that is not an arbitrary bar set by the FDA. That's a high bar. We've met with G6 and we executed a perfect study to get that done. We've got to execute perfection again. So we've given ourselves this timeframe to make sure all our plans are locked down, that we can get the centers open, they can go and do this and we'll be methodical and thoughtful about it. If there's some way we can accelerate that we would, but we gave you this because we typically are prudent in our guidance and what we speak and what we think and that's what we see right now. That's it. We have a couple that are under IRB, but it's not... Most of them are getting this thing up and running to take care of people right now. But, Steve is right. We're continuing to work on that. Steve, you're the only one here. About the only thing I could add to that is, we have done everything we can to make it easier for our patients to get CGM even during these tough times. In 2008 or 2009, we had zero Medicaid coverage. We had no Medicare coverage. We had no pharmacy benefit where the co-pays typically significantly lower than it is through DME. And pricing has been somewhat lower. So I think we've done everything we can to position our business to be more successful during a time like this and to help our patients continue on the therapy. But again, now you have what may be a recession tied to health care event, we may see exactly the opposite. The patients absolutely have to have this to it healthier, believe that they do. Again, part of the unknowns that we're trying to work through and trying to manage. Let's be clear. We never said we'd have approval by year-end, and we said we expected a 2021 launch with a limited launch by the end of 2020 was our goal without meaningful financial impact in 2020, if we had a limited launch. There are things we can do to accelerate those studies possibly. On the manufacturing side we have similar circumstances to what Quen described earlier about the core business. We have suppliers that we're not in control of or rapidly putting equipment together and building things for us. We have orders for this equipment all over the world, waiting for it to come in, to get those lines up and running. We will remain committed to the fact, that we will not do a full scale launch of this product until we're ready to go completely. And on top of that while we wait and sometimes we forget, we have a fantastic product of what we have in G6 and so we will continue to refine and make that better. I don't know Quen, if you have any other things, we can do on manufacturing... Quen, you want to go ahead. Yes, Raj, great question. International was clearly a bright spot in the quarter and really it was across the entire international region, whether it was Europe, Asia both regions performed incredibly well. Canada was a driver of the overall growth with the e-Commerce platform we put in place there we couldn't be more happy with the results that we see. I think one of the interesting data points coming out of the quarter, while Germany is a large market for us, continues to have great success. The UK also growing quite aggressively, very significantly outpaced most other major markets, which was nice to see. So a lot of runway continues to exist in all of these markets, but really strength across the board, even through Asia and Australia. So there's not one country to really pull out and attribute all this success to, it was performance across the entire slate that led to the overall outcome that we communicated. The first quarter of 2020 was a record number of new patients to the company versus any other quarter in history, that's right. I don't have a great update for you on \u2013 new update for you anyway on Korea, but with respect to Japan, we did get our G6 approval. So that's an approval for consumer use, the professional use clinician product. We don't currently have reimbursement. So when we launch that product in the consumer channel before the end of this year, it'll be a cash pay product, what we've elected not to do is follow a competitor and accept really subpar reimbursement based on kind of fingerstick level pricing. We're just not going to go there with that, we're going to do our work, provide the Japanese government with the appropriate data, outcomes data and establish real reimbursement for real time CGM. So that won't be this year, but we'll give you an update when we have more. Quen, you take first stab, and I will walk on what I can you tell you. Go ahead. Well, we'll start with our six month period. As we got to that conclusion, as we've modeled that out, we're certainly comfortable with that. We're very comfortable with again, helping our patient base out. These are the people that built our company, made it what it is. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the more I traveled before this pandemic, the more I learned. There are a lot of people who have no idea how to manage their diabetes without a CGM. So we will continue to try and get product to patients. We'll evaluate the economic consequences of what we do as we roll this out over time. You know, three years ago if we had to do this, it would have been even much more difficult because we had very little Medicaid and we didn't even have Medicare up and running. Now with Medicare approval and Medicaid, there are some states where these patients have been employed can go to Medicaid programs, but it's very inconsistent and sporadic, even though we have. I want to say 60% of Medicaid programs cover \u2013 some only covers for kids and some make it very difficult. So we will continue to push for more Medicaid coverage during this time to try and Medicaid that and we'll see how it goes and we'll keep track. But, it's important that we make sure these people can stay on the system and we think this is a really good opportunity for us. So we will continue to do that. Hi, this is Kevin. I'll finish up today. We want to thank all of you for participating on our call. I surely under circumstances far different from what you envisioned during our 2019 Q4 earnings call last February, when I watched the night \u2013 the news night in and out, I've seen the toll that this virus has taken on communities all over the world and recognize, when this pandemic ends, our world human interaction and the administration of healthcare will be forever changed. DexCom is very fortunate to be in a strong position during this pandemic and I personally feel sense of obligation to operate from that strength to serve the needs of others in this time of heightened anxiety. We'll stay at home orders and school closures. We realize our employees day-to-day lives have been upended causing significant stress. We've attempted to reduce that stress by offering increased pay to essential onsite workers and promoting increased safety measures to best protect all DexCom employees. We recognize that diabetes doesn't take a break even for pandemics, economic slowdowns or high unemployment. Now more than ever, we have a responsibility to patients that have supported DexCom over the years and made us the company that we are today. We're therefore working quickly on a roll out of our patient assistance program to provide access to DexCom CGM for the many individuals who have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19. In addition, we realized that helping a patient staying control their blood glucose, also his family members and clinicians providing needed relief to our healthcare system. Our core belief remains unchanged. If we do our best to take care of our patients, the business will always move in the right direction. Every intensive insulin using patients have access to real time CGM. We'll work tirelessly to make that happen. COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on the diabetes community. This awful virus is also attacking the pancreas of people without diabetes. As a result, brave frontline responders are having to repeatedly gown up and [indiscernible] administer finger sticks to test patient's blood glucose levels. We've worked hard with the FDA to provide these heroes with better tools to treat patients and reduce healthcare workers overall risk of infection. However employees have rallied to this cause has been nothing short of amazing. In short order, we've created new training materials, stood up a specialized technical support group, procured to configure thousands of cell phones for use in this environment at a cost in excess of $1 million and developed a separate commercial structure to launch G6 in this market at significantly reduced prices. We are making a significant investment here. Our commitment to connectivity, enable multiple platforms to consume our data and cloud based tools for healthcare providers has become even more important than we envisioned when we blazed this trail many, many years ago. As the work from the team in the Barbara Davis center in Colorado indicates, the unique features of our CGM and connected software solutions are playing an important role in driving care for newly diagnosed people with diabetes during this crisis. We are hopeful that the expanded use of telemedicine during the crisis can ultimately provide avenues for greater access to health care over the long-term and DexCom CGM providing an essential tool in the process.

It's often during difficult times that the two character of an individual or company is revealed. Our hope is that our efforts during this time will provide comfort to the many stakeholders that we serve and that our character of DexCom will stand out brightly. On behalf of our employees, I'm proud to lead these efforts. Thanks. Goodbye."

            "name": "Steve Pacelli",
            "content": "Thanks Quentin. Given our strong financial position and the growth opportunity ahead of us, we continue to press forward with the strategic initiatives that we outlined at the start of the year. As the COVID-19 pandemic has played out, we looked at how DexCom could play a role in delivering an impactful solution. Kevin already walked you through the incredible work being done in the hospital setting. Recent data published in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology shows the clear need for glucose control in the hospital and cements the reason we are so committed to assisting in this crisis. The study found that the COVID-19 mortality rate for people with diabetes or hyperglycemia even in non-diabetics during their stay was more than four times greater than patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia. Even more alarming for those who had no evidence of diabetes prior to hospitalization who developed hyperglycemia during their stay, 42% died in the hospital. These are sobering statistics and it served as a constant reminder to our team as we work around the clock to assist frontline workers. As we look forward, our commercial team has begun leveraging our extensive data platforms, which should prove especially valuable for patients and clinicians in an environment where telemedicine business are quickly becoming the norm. As an example, an article published last week in Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics showed great results for two newly diagnosed Type 1 patients, one a 20-year-old male and another a 12-month old female who were given a G6 and treated with telemedicine during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Using G6 and our software tools, clinicians at the Barbara Davis Center in Colorado were able to significantly improve the glucose levels of these patients through virtual care. Stepping back, the fundamentals of our business remained sound and there were several encouraging developments during the first quarter as our sales growth indicates the momentum behind our no fingerstick G6 technology continued in the first quarter, and as we have said multiple times before, we continue to believe that there are significantly more people on intensive insulin therapy to standard benefit from a transition to our real time CGM. At the end of the first quarter we have now transitioned the majority of our Medicare base over to G6 as the only Class II ICGM on the market and the lowest cost CGM for the Medicare channel. We look forward to bringing G6 to people both with Type 1 and intensively manage Type 2 diabetes who are eligible for Medicare. We are also pleased that UnitedHealthcare recently began coverage for their intensive insulin Type 2 patient population. Combined with Medicare, this demonstrates the increasing traction that we are gaining in the Type 2 intensive market. In January, we introduced additional data demonstrating the value of DexCom CGM in the Type 2 non-intensive market. This includes our direct work with UnitedHealthcare, digital health programs like WellDoc, Onduo, Livongo and integrated health systems like Intermountain where our preliminary pilot should significant savings with the fulltime use of DexCom G6 relative to standard of care self monitored blood glucose. We are excited to be expanding access to DexCom CGM throughout all of these channels and look forward to sharing additional results as we progress in our Type 2 efforts. The opportunity for growth is also extensive when we look outside the U.S. where use of CGM remains far less than that of fingerstick. In February, we obtained regulatory approvals for G6 in Australia, South Korea and Japan and are progressing toward extending the G6 launch to each of these markets later this year. In support of our continuing growth, in particular the service of our international markets. We recently finalized a decision to develop a third manufacturing site in Malaysia. This will be another significant investment for DexCom and demonstrates our belief in the long-term opportunity ahead of us. We continue to advance the regulatory pathway for use of CGM in pregnancy, attaining CE Mark for wear on the back of the arm and we removed the pregnancy warning for G6 for use in Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. Following this approval, we launched G6 in the UK for pregnant women with diabetes and are currently working to broaden the clinical evidence to support the use of DexCom CGM for the management of gestational diabetes. Finally, our efforts as a forerunner in interoperability and our support of patient choice and their method of insulin delivery has us well positioned to benefit from multiple commercial systems over the next couple of years, whether through automated insulin delivery or connected smart pens. As you can see, there are many exciting things that the DexCom teams are driving forward even as we navigate the unprecedented time that we are now experiencing. With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin. Yes. Malgorzata, this is Steve. Don't read too much in net at this early stage. This is something that literally the hospital team work 24/7 to get products into the hospital to reduce the risk to caregivers, right. They weren't able to take fingersticks because they have to \u2013 really, they have to actually change out their PP every time they would have to go pick a finger and they were just \u2013 they couldn't do it. So right now we are capturing data. This is all about being able to remotely monitor these patients to help the caregivers in the hospital provide better care. To the extent we have data down the road that we're obviously retaining, we'll look to see what we do with it. But right now we've not made any plans to do anything specifically with the data, either with a hospital or on an automized basis or otherwise. Most of them are... What I would say is no, I mean we've obviously had a very strong quarter driven by both existing patient base and new patients back. If you remember back in the 2008-2009 timeframe, we were still on the 2007 and the 2007 plus, which those technologies just weren't really ready for prime time. It really wasn't, if you remember it wasn't until we launched the Gen 4 PLATINUM and I think it was Q4 of 2012 that you really saw the inflection in this business. We really moved to a must have versus a nice to have in terms of our technology. So I don't know that you could possibly make a comparison to back that. I mean, back in those days it was Terry and I just trying to raise money, every opportunity we could to keep the lights on. So it's just a different, it's not even a comparable business at this time. Yes. I just add one more thing, as far as cash because I'm the one driving Quen and his team on this. We talk about doubling manufacturing capacity before the first half of the year is over. We're pushing to get that, but that's a lot of capital equipment, as we go to a lot of G6 automated lines and get those up and running and get more lines up at our contract manufacturers, we then have a significant capital investment in G7 equipment that will be coming. And we talked about investing in a third manufacturing site in Malaysia. So there's going to be a lot of capital equipment. So we purchased the other place that we will definitely be using cash as we invest in our businesses, just in our infrastructure and in our systems. We will \u2013 if we've learned anything through this, we need to make some more investments on that side too. Our team has been fantastic with the tool they had when you give them some more tools. So we have a lot of capital use for that money for organic growth as well."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted. The financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis, reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  For the first quarter of 2020 we reported worldwide revenue of $405.1 million compared to $280.5 million for the first quarter of 2019, representing growth of 44% on a reported basis and 45% on a constant currency basis. The growth performance reflects the strength of our new patient additions throughout 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. As we continue to see growing awareness of the value of DexCom CGM for both Type 1 and Type 2 patients. The U.S. business grew 39% in the first quarter of 2020 over the first quarter of 2019 with strong growth from each channel: durable medical equipment, pharmacy and Medicare. Pharmacy continues to be the fastest growing channel for us and realize the strongest sequential uptake in utilization to date as a result of the significant access improvements that our team has driven over the past year. Our international business also put up a great first quarter growing 63% on a constant currency basis relative to the same quarter in 2019. The $112.8 million in revenues for our international business represents an increase of more than $25 million from our previous quarterly high watermark. Strength was across the board including both direct and distributor markets. Our first quarter gross profit was $258.7 million or 63.9% of revenue compared to 60.2% in the first quarter of 2019. The 370 basis point improvement to year-over-year gross margin reflects the focused work of our teams to take costs out of our product design and manufacturing processes. As Kevin mentioned, our procurement team has done a great job of keeping our supply chain functioning well with little impact to our ability to produce product as well as our product cost thus far. We will continue to monitor this closely as the situation evolves globally. Operating expenses were $215.4 million for Q1 2020 compared to $176.4 million in Q1 2019. This reflects an increase at 22% year-over-year and a nearly 1,000 basis point reduction as a percentage of revenue from the first quarter of 2019. We continue to prioritize key areas of investment including our efforts to scale G6 manufacturing, progressing toward our goal of doubling capacity again in the first half of this year. We are also continuing our preparation for the scale-up of our G7 manufacturing lines and looking to support our sales growth with increasing direct-to-consumer advertising, as greater clarity evolves from the current global situation. Our non-GAAP results exclude some incremental costs that we experienced toward the end of the quarter in both cost of goods sold and operating expenses as a result of COVID-19. As Kevin noted, the safety of our employees remains our Number 1 priority. However, as an essential provider of medical devices, there are certain functions that must be performed onsite despite shelter and place orders to ensure continuity of supply. As a result, we are incurring incremental cost to assist our employees and ensure their safety to the greatest extent possible and expect to continue to do so in the near term as we support our people through this crisis. We expect to continue to incur costs related to our COVID-19 response until macro business conditions returned to normal. Operating income was $43.3 million or 10.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of $7.6 million or negative 2.7% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. This reflects a year-over-year improvements of nearly 1,300 basis points in operating margin for the quarter. Similarly adjusted EBITDA margin improved by nearly 1,000 basis points to 19.2% of revenue or $77.8 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 9.3% of revenue or $26.1 million for the first quarter of 2019. As our operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin performance indicate, we are doing a good job managing our expenses and gaining leverage from our strong top line results. Net income for the first quarter was $41.4 million or $0.44 per share. Our balance sheet remains very strong with more than $1.5 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter leading us in a strong net cash position. The capital structure that we have put in place along with our improved profitability profile that demonstrates the cash earnings potential of this business provides us the flexibility to not only navigate the current environment, but also be opportunistic when needed. Our convertible notes are not due until 2022 and 2023, respectively, and are convertible in either cash or stock at our discretion. We have worked hard and are fortunate to be in this position recognizing that there are many companies that are less fortunate and struggling to support their employees. Therefore, although we are potentially entitled to stimulus funds as a healthcare provider, we have chosen not to accept these funds and hope that they could be allocated to other American businesses and employees who are in greater need. Turning to 2020 guidance, given the unpredictable current economic and global health environment, we have chosen to temporarily suspend 2020 guidance until we have greater visibility on the outlook. To be clear, this decision does not necessarily imply upside or downside to our prior guidance. Our first quarter performance was above our expectations and apart from the uncertainty created by COVID-19; we would be in a position to raise our guidance today. Ultimately, we believe the underlying demand for CGM has not changed despite the situation with COVID-19. In these early days, we have seen the benefits in the shift to telemedicine because DexCom's real time CGM is connected. It has become one of the primary methods for physicians to monitor their patients and get newly diagnosed patients up and running. Further to this, as Kevin noted, the FDA has recently removed the three hour delay requirement for our clarity system, which will further differentiate DexCom CGM in its remote monitoring capability. In addition, as noted earlier, we've seen the FDA move quickly to enable the use of DexCom CGM in the hospital setting further increasing demand for our product. On the other hand, as we've seen office visits decline across healthcare, new patient starts could be impacted in Q2 and into the back-half of the year depending on how COVID-19 situation plays out. We will also monitor the macroeconomic environment to gauge employment levels and the ultimate impact of our financial assistance program. Further, while our global supply chain has remained stable, it is less predictable in the current environment and could experience interruption. Predicting all of these future variables has been difficult and we found it prudent to temporarily suspend our guidance until visibility improves. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and keep you updated as things evolve and we can provide greater clarity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update. Yes. No, I think you describe it well. I think Robbie, the thing is coming out of the quarter or over the course of the first quarter, the strength in the core business \u2013 the underlying business was incredibly strong. And I think from our perspective we're as bullish as we've ever been on where we're at in this opportunity, the runway that exist in front of us and, and probably even more so now when you think about the long-term just with the hospital opportunity opening up probably sooner than what we anticipated. The whole play in telehealth, telemedicine, we know we have a device that works better there than anything else in the marketplace. And folks seem to be \u2013 seem to be understanding that to Kevin's point, the 900 folks that joined the webinar, it was a webinar specifically directed towards telehealth, telemedicine. So there's a real interest out there. So I think long-term we feel incredibly bullish about where we're at. In April, yes, the new patient starts, we're down a bit. We noted that coming out of Q1. We have seen it start to rebound a bit in April. I think it continues to build over time, but we need to see that play out and have some certainty there before we can get back to where we feel comfortable providing guidance. There's just too many \u2013 too many things that are uncertain at this point in time that we need that greater clarity on. But I would just reiterate the underlying strength that the fact that folks are recognizing the value of this product and what it means in the marketplace. From a long-term perspective, we're as bullish as we've ever been. You covered it, okay. Yes. Travis, this is Quentin. I think what you're asking is exactly what we struggle with in terms of defining any certainty around what it \u2013 what it's going to be. As we continue to see the fallout from an unemployment perspective in the States and even globally how that ultimately shows up or translates into our numbers, it's hard for us to predict. You've take an existing patient who has been paying, in line with their program or their plan they've been on for some period of time and all of a suddenly fall into the patient assistance program. You're right? There is going to be a mixed impact on the business. I think that's part of the challenge with trying to draw the line on exactly where that's going to be. And until we have greater color on where those rates \u2013 unemployment rates ultimately fall out and the impacts ultimately fall out to our patient base, it's hard to predict. So that's what leads to putting us in a position where we ultimately feel best at this point just to pull guidance. Again, we couldn't be more bullish around what's going on inside the business, but we know there's going to be mixed impacts and shifts over the next several months. So right now the visibility is limited. Hey David, this is Quentin. Yes. With respect to the inpatient, that was minimal, I mean it didn't move the needle at all. On the stocking side, you're talking several millions, not tens of millions by any stretch at all. It was on the lower end. I think that the point that we were making in our prepared remarks was there's several questions out there around whether or not stocking is driving results in the first quarter. And that the point is, there are several distributors who would have liked to have had the opportunity to stock up ahead of some of the uncertainty that they saw. But frankly we weren't in the position or we weren't enabling that to take place. We monitor this very closely. We have provisions in our agreements with those distributors; now limit the amount of days of inventory on hand that they can carry and so we monitor that. And so while there was an expressed interest to stock to a greater degree, we did not enable that and therefore it was not a driver of the results. And that was the point we were trying to get across. No, I think the teams are doing a great job of pushing forward as well as we can, as fast as we can on G7 and just the automation capability from a production perspective, clearly having folks out of the office creates some challenging disruptions in the pace at which you move, but I think overall we're navigating it quite well. At the same time, our supply chain is one where it's global in nature. We rely on folks from all over the world to help us produce our product. And we've done a great job of managing G6 to- date G7, we've managed through it as well, but there have been situations where you have a temporary impact here or there, and you've got to quickly navigate through it to make sure everything stays on track and on time. And to-date we've done that well, but that's some of the uncertainty that starts to get introduced in the environment that we find ourselves navigating through. So to-date we're handling it well but there's a lot of balls in the air and we're doing the best that we possibly can and if we can pull it forward to Kevin's point, we certainly will look at those sorts of things. Yes, so I think from a pharmacy perspective, the comments that we made were clear that we've seen the uptick in that pharmacy channel progress at a very rapid pace and its one channel that we always thought just has tremendous potential for us and we've proved that out over the course of the first quarter. As a matter of fact, we talk about new patients being a driver of growth, for the first time we saw record new patients in the first quarter, despite the fact that we saw slow down in the very back end of the quarter. And so I attribute a good part of that to the pharmacy channel. We haven't seen payers or at least I couldn't speak to any particular payers here in the last several weeks who have opened up more incremental pharmacy access, but we have seen payers who are willing to think differently around the requirements that they might have on patients ordering product such as clinical site visits or coming in to see the clinician, they're allowing that through telehealth, now telemedicine, we see more and more payers who are moving that direction each and every week. So we are seeing a changing dynamic from a payer perspective, haven't seen it so much in terms of opening incremental pharmacy access in the last several weeks, but there is an appetite for change here. Yes. Yes, correct. The reimbursement with intensive Type 2 is obviously most of their Medicare patients we have that covered. After that it is really been payer-by-payer, we announced a healthcare Type 2 coverage today, we also have had another large payer expand their Type 2 intensive use policy, just hit us today, that'll be another win for us. I think a lot of the payers as we go to the pharmacy have actually included Type 2 as we've gone there as well. But it's a gradual thing. It's not going to happen overnight. We keep having wins and our payer team is doing a job staying on top of that and we're kind of getting the message out that insulin users and insulin user and they all need access to this. So our Type 2 intensive use patient base is growing significantly and becoming a much larger part of our business. Yes, we're not going to comment specifically on where it's at. I think, there's been a lot of research, a lot of surveys that have been done that we've seen that would indicate, new patients starts might be 40 or 50% of what they previously were, we haven't seen it to that extent, but they certainly have been impacted. And to the point I made earlier, we have seen it start to come back a bit. I think folks are just getting comfortable understanding, that there's other means of being able to interact with their physician, learn about the product and ultimately get the product on to them and that's the telehealth, telemedicine capability that continues to develop. I'll point you back to the webinar that we had just two weeks ago. Over 900 physicians dialed into that webinar to learn of the value and ways to introduce CGM through telehealth. I think that speaks to the interest level that's out there. So I think it will continue to build over time, how quickly it goes, it's hard to say and that's part of why the uncertainty exists and gives us pause on the guidance that's out there and leaving it there. But, overall I think, down the road telehealth, telemedicine is going to play a much bigger part than what we've seen historically. Well, I think certainly the new market opportunities that we've been after for a while now with Dolan and team leading that effort, we've been very clear around hospital, is there a way to accelerate that? There certainly seems to be an interest level beyond hours now sitting on the other side, but there's the hospital or the FDA, we want to make sure we're opportunistic and think about that in a way that can accelerate it. I think that there's, potentially in that space, even more than just the device itself, but how do you improve efficiency in the hospital setting? So even from an IT capability perspective, thinking about those sorts of things, we think about gestational diabetes, pregnancy, the whole Type 2 non-intensive space, I think that market remains significant. And I think, we're seeing each and every day that there's a validated opportunity in that space and we want to go fast. So we're keeping our eyes open out there in those spaces, around the opportunities that exist and if there's opportunities to kind of really put the foot on the gas pedal, we're going to look at those sorts of things. So that's what we mean by being opportunistic. Yes, I think if you go back to the guidance that we set coming into the year, we spoke about some of the different levers that were in there. And certainly some of the things that were going to weigh on the organization being specific to G7 trials, development of the automation lines, ramping G6 as quickly as we can and doubling it, and DTC being a significant investment. I think, while we've walked away from guidance on the full year, those sorts of drivers are still going to be in the spend profile and they're going to be more heavily weighted in the back half of the year. So while you're seeing a 1,300 basis point improvement in operating margin in Q1 it's not likely that you're going to see that same sort of improvement in the back half of the year, because there's going to be all these incremental investments that we know that we need to make and that will set the company up for growth far into the future and we're going to commit ourselves to invest in those ways. So I think you're going to continue to see some good leverage in the first half of the year. I think in the back half of the year, you're going to see the P&L start to look a little bit differently as we make some of these key investments into what I think all of us understand to be critical growth drivers of the future. So I'll leave it at that, the P&L profile will shift a little bit, but overall we still remain committed to the longer term goals that we put out there at Analyst Day just year and a half ago or so."

Please note, this conference call is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Sean Christensen. Sean, you may begin.\nSean Christensen: Thank you, operator, and welcome to DexCom's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. Our agenda begins with Kevin Sayer, DexCom's Chairman, President and CEO, who will provide a summary of our fourth quarter and full year highlights and ongoing strategic initiatives, followed by a financial review and outlook from Jereme Sylvain, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions.

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I want to take time at the start to highlight some of DexCom's key accomplishments in 2021 that reflect our progress relative to the priorities that we established at the start of the year and our long-term goals.  Total revenue grew 26% on an organic basis over the prior year, with rising CGM awareness and DexCom brand loyalty, leading to another year of record new patient additions. This translates to nearly $500 million of organic growth for the year, leading us to exceed the midpoint of our original guidance for the year by more than $160 million. We laid the foundation for significant expansion of our addressable markets in the future with differentiated product solutions and clinical evidence.  In June, we presented results from the MOBILE randomized controlled trial for people with type 2 diabetes being managed with basal insulin. The results were clear. DexCom CGM can do significantly more to help these people manage diabetes. And with this conclusion being validated in the Journal of the American Medical Association as well as in the recently updated ADA standards of care, we are hopeful that we can bring access to our technology for the estimated 3 million people on basal insulin therapy in the U.S. and many more outside the U.S.  Alongside the MOBILE clinical evidence, we drove several updates to our product portfolio to broaden the ways that customers can engage with our technology. We've consistently spoken about our investments in software and data infrastructure as a significant competitive advantage. In the third quarter, we received 2 key FDA clearances for DexCom software tools that reflect this commitment and strength.  Our real-time API allows us to directly integrate Dexcom CGM data in real time to the displays of approved third-party apps. And our app in-app solution creates an FDA-cleared DexCom app experience that can be integrated directly with the app of a DexCom partner. Both of these creative solutions have already been rolled out with DexCom Partners, and we believe they position us well to provide extensive options for our customers, partners and potential partners as CGM use continues to expand into new populations.  We again strengthened our product portfolio through differentiated software with the CE Mark and launch of our DexCom 1 product in the fourth quarter of 2021. In a relatively short period since launch, we've already seen strong adoption in both type 1 and type 2 customers, and the health systems in 2 of our 4 launch countries established reimbursement. With the focus on ease of use and affordable price point, we believe DexCom 1 will be a significant part of our story as we look to extend CGM access globally.  Perhaps most importantly, in 2021, we completed the pivotal trials in support of our next-generation G7 system and submitted the results for both CE Mark and FDA clearance. As many of you recently saw in our January presentation and will soon see in a publication, the performance of the G7 system is outstanding, achieving performance levels relative to the FDA's iCGM special controls.  Even with customers on our G6 system expressing record Net Promoter Scores at the end of 2021, we are incredibly excited for them to experience G7. We believe that we are very close to receiving CE Mark and navigating the final stages of that review. In the meantime, our teams continue to work to prepare the manufacturing scale-up and commercial efforts in anticipation of G7 launches throughout the year as well as launches with some of our partners on their upcoming connected insulin delivery devices.  On that front, we were excited to see the news of the FDA's recent clearance of Insulet's Omnipod 5, the first tubeless automated insulin delivery pump. With this clearance for Insulet and the ongoing success of Control-IQ for tandem Diabetes, we believe that we are enabling automated insulin delivery for the best tubeless pump on the market and the best tethered pump. The outcomes that customers are seeing with these DexCom integrated systems are outstanding, and we are proud that our commitment to connectivity is helping advance the market and enhance the quality of life for our customers.  These accomplishments align with the strategic priorities that we established at the start of last year, showing the resilience and execution of the DexCom teams in a challenging environment. And these accomplishments are not merely 2021 events, but they are the foundation that we will continue to build on as we press forward in 2022 and beyond. Many of you likely saw the recent update to the IDF estimates for global diabetes prevalence and cost. There are now greater than 500 million adults with diabetes globally, and cost to treat the disease alone are estimated to be approximately $1 trillion per year.  In addition, the CDC now estimate that 38% of adults in America or 96 million people have prediabetes. There is a real opportunity here for DexCom to do something great to address this epidemic and power diabetes management and down the road even workboards diabetes prevention and better health outcomes broadly. The future for DexCom is bright.  With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the fourth quarter financials and discussion of the 2022 outlook. Jereme?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  In line with our January pre-announcement, we reported worldwide revenue of $698 million for the fourth quarter compared to $569 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing growth of 23% on both a reported and constant currency basis and 20% on an organic basis.  The organic revenue excludes non-CGM revenue that we generated in the fourth quarter following our acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand. U.S. revenue totaled $517 million in the fourth quarter compared to $451 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing growth of 15%.  Unit volume growth, which is a general representation for the growth of our user base, remained in the high 30% range compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, and we continue to see the strength in our strategic shift to the pharmacy channel. Our teams continue to work very hard to broaden our prescriber base and take advantage of the significant reimbursement access that we have driven in the past 2 years in both the U.S. and international markets.  The uptick in COVID cases has created some challenges for us in the fourth quarter and into the early first quarter, but it is a credit to the resilience of our field team and the strength of the category that global new customers remain near record levels in the fourth quarter.  Our international business executed very well in the fourth quarter, with revenue growing 54%, totaling $181 million. Excluding non-CGM revenue that resulted from our 2021 distributor acquisition, international growth was 41% in the fourth quarter. The international result reflected broad-based strength, including record results in all of our direct markets.  This growth continues to validate the strategic moves that we made over the course of 2021, most notably the progress that we made to broaden access to our technology through advocacy, flexibility gained from operating efficiencies and a differentiated product portfolio. We look forward to extending this momentum now as we progress into 2022.  Our fourth quarter gross profit was $472.6 million or 67.7% of revenue compared to 70.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter gross margin was slightly above our expectations as certain costs related to the G7 scale-up and commercial preparation remain in our R&D costs until we receive CE Mark. We made excellent progress to drive efficiencies across our product design, procurement, manufacturing and logistics functions leading to a full year 2021 gross margin that finished 360 basis points above our original 2021 guidance.  Operating expenses were $373.6 million for Q4 2021 compared to $294.7 million in Q4 2020. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue relative to the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily a result of development and operational costs incurred in preparation for the launch of G7 as well as investments to support our global commercialization efforts.  Operating income was $99 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $104.4 million in the same quarter of 2020. As a reminder, when we provided the outlook for 2021, we determined it was in the best interest to make investments in the business continue to fuel CGM growth and awareness.  As we wrap the year, we are proud to report that we outpaced our initial 2021 operating margin guidance by more than 200 basis points, all of which came despite significant investments to solidify our software advantages, advance the G7 clinical, regulatory and manufacturing programs, significantly expand our global sales force presence and significant efforts to build brand awareness. And we are committed to driving further leverage in the years to come as we strike the right balance between investing to maximize our growth opportunity and turning that opportunity into cash flow generation for the business and our stakeholders.  Adjusted EBITDA was $154.5 million or 22.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $159.2 million or 28% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020. Net income for the fourth quarter was $69 million or $0.68 per share. As many of you also saw in our press release and our GAAP reconciliations, we also recognized an $87 million expense associated with contingent milestone under the 2018 collaboration and license agreement with Verily Life Sciences. Terms of our amended contract with Verily are available in the SEC filings that were originally published in November 2018 and updated in November 2021.  We closed the quarter with greater than $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We have demonstrated the ability to generate positive cash flow. And going forward, we remain in a very flexible position to continue to advance strategic initiatives and opportunities. Most notably, we will continue our development of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia as we expect to have that facility validated for production by the end of 2022.  Turning to 2022 guidance. As we stated last month, we anticipate full year total revenues of $2.82 billion to $2.94 billion, representing growth of 15% to 20%. Given the success of our strategic transition to the pharmacy channel over the past 3 years, we anticipate that 2022 will be the final year where we see a significant shift of our existing base from the durable medical equipment channel to pharmacy.  With this ongoing shift as well as the majority of our new customers now coming through the pharmacy channel in the U.S., our expectations for customer growth in 2022 are again higher than our revenue growth rate, continuing to reflect the large end markets we serve and the growing demand for DexCom CGM worldwide. We have several scenarios built in conjunction with our plan G7 launches. And factoring in the respective regulatory approvals and competitive environment, we will provide updates as the year progresses.  Turning to margins. We are establishing the following guidance for 2022. We expect gross profit margins of approximately 65% for the year, in line with the expectation that we established for our 2025 long-range plan. The slight step back relative to our 2021 results is primarily related to the launch of our G7 system during the year as we begin production at lower volumes and gradually scale in conjunction with our launches.  Despite that step back in gross margin, we expect to offset that impact completely with approximately 400 basis points of operating expense leverage. We anticipate our operating margins of 2022 of approximately 16%. This factors in the ongoing investments that are driving significant returns for DexCom and setting us up for sustainable growth, including our DTC marketing efforts and investments in our product portfolio pipeline. We are making these investments with the discipline throughout the organization, driving towards the margin expansion that we've established in our long-range plan.  Finally, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25% in 2022.  With that, I will turn the call back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Jereme. To summarize, we set out in 2021 with a few key goals in mind: to complete the clinical and regulatory process for G7 and prepare for significant launches, to validate health and economic outcomes for DexCom CGM beyond the intent of insulin using population, to broaden access to DexCom CGM globally through evidence, advocacy and leveraging our growing scale and efficiency and to strengthen our product portfolio for future growth through differentiated software capabilities. Our progress on all these initiatives contributed to a great 2021 and have us looking forward to a big year ahead in 2022.  I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Question-and-Answer Session\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: I do have -- it's a G7 question has 2 parts, but they're kind of interwoven. So for starters, Kevin, just talk about the data and the importance of the data when you commercialize G7 versus just like a -- and how much is the price of it? And then the second part of it is on the gross margin side, it's a big step back that we're seeing, it looks like it's entirely because of G7. So what are you anticipating as far as the impact from the G7 rollout? Like what does that say for the timing in Europe, specifically for a month or 2 months, and then the time of approval here at the state?\nKevin Sayer: There's many parts to your 2-part question. I'll deal with some of them, and then I'll give them to Jereme, Matt, but thanks. Let me talk about the data first. DexCom has long built its legacy on having the best product in the market with respect to performance and a product that everybody can rely on. And time and time again, we've launched products where we published great clinical performance and real life experience always ends up better than what we published.  I've been looking at glucose sensors since the mid-'90s. This data is better than anything I've ever seen. And I think from a marketing perspective and from a customer experience perspective, it's absolutely critical that we remain top of the industry. And this data puts us in there and it demonstrates really the thought and effort that's gone into this product.  Let's not forget, we've changed pretty much everything. There's a new algorithm, new hardware, new electronics, new app you name it, new receiver, everything in here is different than what we've had before. So this has been a monumental effort that's taken a lot of time and to be able to produce this type of clinical results we think just show the diligence of the effort.  And with respect to approvals, we think it's also very important that we not leave room for error or room for doubt with the data that we submitted, which is exactly what we've done when you look at the size of that study. And of 39,000-some matched pairs, there's really no room for doubt that this product is ready for prime time from a performance perspective.  On the approval time lines, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're down to the last steps for CE Mark literally procedural type discussions with documentation that will take place in the near term. We're very confident that we'll get CE Mark very soon, and then we will start our wanted launch in Europe and then roll out to the full launch after that. We've had initial dialogue with the FDA and our submission. And so far, those discussions go well. We currently are not anticipating a delay, but we don't control that any more than we controlled the CE Mark delays either that we've just experienced. By providing great clinical data, though, that certainly takes a large element out of the process. I couldn't be more excited about G7 though, Matt. I'll kick it over to Jereme for the financial ramifications.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. So it's a good question on the margins. We exited 2021 north of 68% with our G6, right? So we are certainly seeing G6 firing on all cylinders from an efficiency perspective. And so your question is, well, how does the sequencing and timing of G7 work? How does that impact the margin in relation to the timing throughout the course of the year? And it's a little bit of an insulation.  So if it rolls out a little bit slower, certainly, the cost to produce G7 are higher, but that means we're ultimately selling more G6. And so you have this little bit of this transition, where as you think about it from a multitude of different scenarios, it really zones back in on the 65% margin, and that's the reason why we feel comfortable with the guidance there.  I'll give you the opposite scenario of G7 is able to come out a little bit faster. The regulatory approval happens quicker. Certainly, we'll be selling more of it, and we'll be able to leverage the fixed cost infrastructure and certainly improve yields. And so you ultimately get to that end goal a little bit quicker. So I think under both scenarios, whether regulatory approval and launches sooner or later, I think that 65% gross margin really speaks to the entirety of the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink.\nDanielle Antalffy: Kevin and Jereme, my question is around how to think about Q1 and potential COVID impact that you're seeing thus far? And also kind of if you could opine on what you have factored in?\nKevin Sayer: Jereme, go ahead.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes, I'll take that one. Yes. Sorry about that. We cut a little bit in and out there, but I think I got the question, which is how we thought about it. And I'd say for the full year guidance, we have factored in the impact of COVID and how that would impact us. Now we did talk a little bit about it on the call. And I think you saw this really across, especially in the United States, really where Omicron was pretty strong throughout the course of January, and we see it starting to dissipate here in February.  So we will see that as car ability to get in front of primary care physicians and access new patients, but it's not a question of if, it's more a question of when. And so that was all contemplated in the guidance. And as we think about the full year, there's a lot of other things that we think are certainly interesting but it's as we think about certainly Dexcom 1 and the launch, as Kevin referred to of G7 with the incredible data.  So we've really contemplated all of those in the guidance. But certainly, we know that as we exited January, certainly, there were some primary care physicians that were closed outside participants, but we are starting to see some of that though as we move to February.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, I'd even add to that. I actually got out in the field here earlier this week, and I heard from the rep and the teams out there that they've not had the access they wanted here in the first quarter, but it is starting to open up a little bit. Time will tell.\nOperator: And your next question comes to Jeff Johnson from Baird.\nJeffrey Johnson: Kevin, now that you've got the MOBILE data published and the ADA standards has been published and updated, how should we think about maybe the pathway to U.S. coverage for non-intensive basal only just at the CMS level and maybe expanding commercial encouraging? Could you just remind us ballpark how many commercial payers right now or in some form or another reimburse basal-only or non-intensive T2?\nKevin Sayer: There is some limited reimbursement for basal only and some nonintensive type 2s, but it's not a very big number, Jeff, it's kind of on a half-hazard basis. And it's not something that -- actually, we sell to or market to because they're just not that much of it out there. The pathway for approval will be similar to what we've done in the past. Given this mobile data, we're certainly presenting this on the commercial side and working to get couch at various payers. And hopefully, some of those will drop over the course of the year.  On the CMS side, now that we have really good data, we have a good CMS plan to work with and go with them, make them more aware. Unless we forget, we did lead the charge for Medicare approval for CGM in general as a company here. So we have experience on this front, and we'll continue to push it. But it takes time, and there's always variables. In all fairness, I was completely wrong on Medicare approval before. It was approved 18 months earlier than I said I was going to come. So when I made a commitment there. So I'm rather having to make any commitments on that front. We're just going to keep pushing.  The most important thing, though, is the outcomes are there. I got a note from a patient not long ago, who is a type 2 patient in this category. And while the patient got put on a new drug, she attribute her 4 month A1C drop in 6 months to being out of DexCom, not to new drug because he knew what her glucose values were, and we've seen this time and time again. And we're very confident this is how this plays out over time.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Great. I wanted to see if you could speak to the commercial launch strategy here. It sounds like you're spending a lot in fourth quarter and 2022 ahead of G7. You have Omnipod 5 launching. You also have Medtronic in a tight spot with the warning letter with a lot of patients potentially moving over to partner therapies here. So maybe just talk to us about the strategy, how you're going to be spending your DTC dollars, how we should think about those ramping up? And what the competitive message from your reps will be this year?\nKevin Sayer: Well, our competitive message from our reps is going to be the same it's always been, we're the best. And you're right, Robbie, we have a tremendous opportunity on the integrated system front with our partners to go grab as many of these users as we possibly can, and we are in talks with both Tandem and Insulet to let's go Sunshine can get as many as we possibly can as those individuals rotate off warranty and have an opportunity to get into a new system.  I think it speaks to our connectivity strategy and partnering with others now we have 2 options. And we know a big driving factor for both those partners, the fact that they pair with the best product on the marketplace. So we will aggressively work with our partners on that front and make sure we have a joint message together.  With respect to our own DC undrawn direct-to-consumer marketing, we have specific messages literally down to the geography standpoint, where in some states, we target Medicare patients more than others. In other states, we target pediatrics and others. And then we analyze the effectiveness of those adds, the return on those investments and then adjust from there. I think 2022, we're in an interesting year because we're going through a product launch. That really isn't going to affect our behavior.  We have to get more users on the 6 systems as we go. And then some of those ads will ultimately shift over to G7. But we're not going to slow down, and we're not going to create anticipation. We'll market what we have and sell what we have. And then as time comes, we'll pull the switch and go over.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS.\nMatthew Taylor: So I just wanted to ask you more about the dynamics of DexCom 1, and we're hearing about Libre 3 being rolled out more broadly. Are you seeing anything different on the competitive front? And maybe talk about how you're going more head-to-head with Dexcom? I'd love you to just flush out those dynamics and the opportunities it's creating for you now that you didn't have before?\nKevin Sayer: Well, again, let's remind everybody our original DexCom 1 launch is for relatively small countries. The results have been very good. We've launched it as only an e-commerce platform, and 2 of the 4 countries have now put the standards in place to reimburse for it because of these and the acceptance of that product and the price point.  So Dexcom 1 does give us an opportunity, first of all, to expand in new geographies where there may not be reimbursement, where the path to reimbursement would be difficult, and there's a lot of integrated systems. We look forward to that as a geographical expander, where we don't have infrastructure.  The other opportunity we have with Dexcom 1 in all honesty is looking at a possible 2-product strategy in some geographies where we believe we can support our G-Series for those in tens of insulin users, particularly those who are on partner systems and integrated systems and those who need all the share and follow function, pediatrics in particular, and there's another population that may not need all those features. And in those geographies, we believe DexCom 1 is an excellent product offering that could round out our portfolio very nicely.  As far as Libre 3 rolling out, we haven't seen that much of it so far. I know there's been a lot of announcements, that was approved several years ago. So we'll see how that rollout goes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Just one for me on G7 and the OUS launch. Kevin, I heard you say initially, it will be a limited launch. What does that look like? How many markets? How long is the limited launch? And how should we think about the ramp of G7 once it is approved?\nKevin Sayer: Our limited launch will be a relatively short period of time and really focus on one geography primarily. And after that, we'll then roll it out to really the larger markets, the larger, more reimbursed markets and the larger markets where we can get reimbursement very quickly and then go down to the smaller ones. So we, again, have the geographies divided up in tiers. Tier 1 countries, Tier 2 and Tier 3 and along those lines. And that will roll out over the course of 2022, certainly to the larger markets then the other geographies will come after that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: I just want to double check 2 things. I want to make sure I saw either at the earlier presentation in January today. Your patient volumes in the United States were up 30%. Is there a similar number you can share outside the United States?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So what we had mentioned is in the U.S., they were in the high 30s and globally, they were also in the high 30s. And so that's the 2 numbers. So we gave you the global one, certainly in early January. And then today, we mentioned the U.S. was also in the high 30s as well.\nJoanne Wuensch: Okay. And could you remind us what your view is on pricing headwinds for this year and if and/or they roll into next year?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. So this year, our pricing headwinds, we had talked about is really what we call channel mix was really around $250 million, $200 million in the U.S. and about $50 million outside the U.S. We came in a little bit light of that this year, but generally in line with that. And we expect similar type mix headwinds into 2022 and then dissipating significantly as we move into 2023.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: I wanted to ask about the U.S. business in the fourth quarter. It's been about a month since you last updated investors. You mentioned COVID a couple of times on the call. But is there anything else you could share with us with respect to kind of U.S. growth, which was obviously a bit slower than the prior 3 quarters?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Jason. Appreciate the call. So what we saw from a growth perspective is about 15%. It was a little bit slower from a growth revenue dollars perspective. Now we did see unit volumes in the high 30%, which indicates that the underlying patient base continues to be strong.  I think the one thing that we did see, and I think you referenced it earlier in your question, was didn't hit our new patient targets. It was still -- we still had near a record new patient add. And so it was still a solid addition, and we're still very happy -- but we did have some challenges getting into the primary care physician offices. And Kevin alluded to it earlier. He was out in the field. And when Omicron was really running at a tight, a lot of those offices were really not seeing outside visitors. And so that creates a little bit of a challenge as you're ultimately getting to know these physicians and getting them to ultimately understand how to use the product. That was the predominant driver of what you saw in the Q4.  And in our early calls when we kind of released early numbers, we have mentioned that, and we've confirmed that over the next -- over the past few weeks is that was predominantly the driver. And As we -- as Omicron dissipates and we're able to get back in front of these primary care physicians, we remain bullish that folks will ultimately adopt the technology similar to what you've seen prior to that. But that was really the predominant driver, nothing really beyond that.\nKevin Sayer: And the only thing I'd add to that, Jason, again, these volume numbers still remain very high. So again, as channel mix shifts, the growth rate is lower than the volume numbers. Add to that the fact that our NPS scores are higher than they've ever been. So patients are very happy and satisfied with the DexCom experience, which leads to them staying on the system and also being on the system more time. So as you look at revenue factors going forward, 2 of the biggest ones are patient retention, utilization, and we're doing very well on that front. And so that pretty much sums it up.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Matthew Blackman from Stifel.\nMathew Blackman: I've got one for Jereme on the operating leverage you're guiding to in '22. How should we think about where that leverage manifests in the P&L? Is it disproportionate to the SG&A side because you're scaling into those large sales force addition? Or is it skewed to R&D because G7 costs are rolling off? Just any help on how to think about the moving parts there?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. No, it's a fair question. And it's split about 50-50. I think what you're going to see is you're going to see us leveraging mostly the G&A line and the SG&A line. We'll continue to make sure that we're allocating funds to sales and marketing, but you're going to see us leveraging the G&A line and continuing to do so. And then you will see some of the falloff on some of the R&D side as we leverage R&D. And as we post G7 launch, we don't have to incur as many costs associated with a launch establishment. So think about it 50-50 across both of those and G&A, not S&M and R&D.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG.\nMarie Thibault: I wanted to ask a question about the sales force progress. I think it was about a year ago that you doubled the sales force. And obviously, outside of the Omicron challenges here more recently, I would like to hear how their progress has been and what else might be needed at this point?\nKevin Sayer: We're really happy with the efforts of the sales team. And again, I got out in the field for the first time this week and just had a couple of meetings with some regional teams. I'm very impressed with the quality of the people we were able to bring on. DexCom is a name here in the U.S. has 1 that attracted great candidates. And literally, there were thousands of people that applied for these jobs. We very much had our pick of the cream of the crop.  They're all getting very much up to speed. I'm very also impressed with the diversity of the group with respect to experiences. And what we've learned is they brought from their companies. You have some from pharma, some from devices, some from diabetes, some of who used to be clinicians. So you have a very different team with very good ideas to go about this. We're confident the team is making very good progress. We missed the opportunity in all fairness to have them all together, and I am in particular, to get to know more of them.  The growth in new patient starts has not been linear with the expansion of the sales force. But as we get down into these other markets, we can't expect it to be the same because they don't see as many of the people with diabetes is in our traditional endocrinology market. But we're happy with the growth that they've achieved. We have very ambitious targets for next year. What might be needed in the future is something we debate a great deal internally. We're happy with what we have now, and let's let this play out for a while longer before we make any changes. I don't see anything changing right now. If anything, again, this is all about awareness on our side.  And if what we need to generate more awareness has more feet on the street, that's the direction we would go. For right now, we don't feel that way, but we may in the future. So we'll see. We're never adverse to trying pilot programs in specific geographies to see if another option come work and we will do that all throughout 2022. And if something sticks, we'll move in that direction.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim.\nChristopher Pasquale: I wanted to follow up on the factors impacting 4Q and what lessons we should take from that as we look at 1Q? So you said COVID was the main headwind, but your channel mix has also changed a lot over the past couple of years. Do you think that's resulting in less seasonality than you used to see in the year-end? And then the corollary to that would be, should we expect the typical step down in 1Q could it be more muted because of that reduced seasonality? Or did was COVID more of a factor in January than it was in December? Can you just help us sort of balance those different factors?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. No, I'm happy to walk through it. So you are correct. As time moves on, the move of the commercial business certainly more and more to pharmacy then DME should give us more of a situation where Q1 and Q4 are less pronounced. And so you are 100% correct there. And over the longer haul, that's where we expect to go.  In terms of seasonality for this quarter, we do expect it to be relatively similar to last year. And again, that's just more of us trying to navigate through, one, that migration; two, the Omicron variant this year was certainly more than we saw in January of last year. And so we're really comparing year-over-year. And so I think it's fair to say that. So we would expect that those 2 things really offset each other. So you see a little bit of a seasonality in this of 2022 similar to that you've seen in the past.  Longer term, you are correct, and we will expect absent all macro factors that ultimately impact people's ability for movement and seeing physicians, et cetera, it will migrate to more of that situation. But we'll keep you posted as years get forward about that seasonality. For now, that's our expectation.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.\nBrandon Vazquez: This is Brandon on for Margaret. I just wanted to ask you a question on the type 2 basal population and maybe some of the nonintensive patients. I can appreciate you guys are still early there, but you're pretty far in with the MOBILE data. So maybe you've talked to some -- gone out in the field and talk to some endos or some other physician. And maybe you have a few patients already on DexCom that are using. And so I'm curious what early feedback you're getting from those less intensive type 2 patients in terms of either utilization, pricing or demand? Anything that kind of early there that we can read through that what the commercialization might look like going forward?\nKevin Sayer: Well, I'll start with basal insulin because the ADA and their recent guidelines came out and recommended CGM continuous use for people on basal insulin, which is a far departure from where we were in the past. This is very encouraging for us because the -- the fact that this group has now recommended that is a for us going forward. And as far as that population utilization in our MOBILE study and even in the other things that we've heard, they have no problem here in CGM all the time.  For nonintensive patients, we've had our program with Level 2 at United Healthcare. We've had other programs with Intermountain Health, Onduo, Welldoc a number of them. and the results remain the same over and over again. Patients on CGM do better than those who are not. And the information provided by CGM enables them to make the proper changes to have better overall health very much like I said in my prepared remarks earlier. We see A1Cs go down because people know what the consequences of their meds, of their exercise, of their diets, of sleep of all these factors has on their overall health.  With respect to the pricing and the business model, we've often said we are solving a different problem when we're going after type 2 less intensive diabetes. And we, therefore, think the pricing model will be different than the current product that we have. And we are working on what that optimal solution is right now, and you'll hear more from us on that front over the course of 2022.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley.\nCecilia Furlong: I wanted to ask on DexCom 1 again. Just how you're thinking about further geographic expansion in 2022 as well as expectations for relative contributions to the patient volumes, OUS in 2022? And where you think this can go over the longer term?\nKevin Sayer: I'll start, and Jereme can maybe have some more specific numbers after I'm done if he's got any. Again, as I said earlier, there are 2 great uses for DexCom 1. The first one is those geographies where we're not and where we don't have infrastructure or a distribution arrangement with a distributor or another distribution partner lined up. We can drop an e-commerce platform in there and have cash pay payments patients, and we can get them on the system and we can go.  Our results in our 4 initial countries have been outstanding. And so we'll have other new geographies up over the course of the year like that. They will not have major contributions to our revenue, but they do expand our footprint and do position us ultimately to get reimbursement in those countries. Again, as we've seen in the first 4 where we launched it, we now have reimbursement and process for 2 of those.  The other opportunity for DexCom 1 is in many of the major established markets, particularly OUS. We have an opportunity with DexCom 1 to implement a dual-product strategy. Our G-Series does a lot more than our DexCom 1 product with connectivity, Sharon follow, the predictive alerts and all the other things that we have in that system, we believe it merits a different price point. Again, it solves a different problem. It's a different use case.  We will very opportunistically pick geographies where we could launch DexCom 1 and augment our business in those geographies, again, adding more patient volume and more revenue to the process. As far as giving you numbers or plans, I'm not going to give you all of that. That's on the strategy side and something for us not to unwind to the world. But suffice it to say, those plans are in progress. I don't know, Jereme, if you have anything to add?\nJereme Sylvain: I think the safe bet is just to assume multiple country entries with DexCom 1. And we'll get you a little bit more color once we're into those countries, hold those back for a strategic purpose.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: So a lot has been asked, but I think I'd like to just touch on the longer-term product pipeline. And I mean, look, I realize you haven't launched G7 yet. So it's you're probably not going to be thrilled with me asking about what's next. But with G7 launching over the course of the next 12 to 18 months globally, you've got DexCom 1 scaling as well, what should investors expect from a product development and a product launch perspective? Is it -- is it combination products? Is there different analytes that you're going to be testing for? Just trying to really understand what the medium- to longer-term your hardware type of product pipeline looks like here?\nKevin Sayer: I love what's next question, but these guys are cut me off after 15 minutes, so I'd have to stop. First of all, let's look at G7 and everything that's changed. We have plans in place to modify and make everything with G7 better already. We have, for example, a major cost initiative to reduce our manufacturing costs even where they are. You can expect us to be very diligent in efforts to get that up to a 15-day life from a product perspective because that certainly has a big impact on our P&L.  We have, for example, alternative electronic structures, all those types of things going on. We've never stopped improving our sensor technology. So all of these things, we continue to work on our core business. At some point in time, there may be some diminishing returns, particularly given the accuracy of the data on the current system. So we balance that. But a lot of these efforts, again, we focus on our product development, performance, patient experience, our customer satisfaction and cost. And we look at all those buckets, I can tell you there will be a lot of software initiatives here going forward with the G7 platform.  We believe with DexCom 1, we've merely scratched the surface of our ability to differentiate products through different software experiences, again, creating different business models and expanding our reach.  With respect to their analytes, we continue to study that. We've studied that for quite some time. What we have to determine is what are real commercial markets for us? And in all fairness, we haven't found anything that compares to glucose yet. And we have a lot of things then we need to conquer on the glucose side. But we do have studies going on for some of the other analytes that you certainly be familiar with that you've heard others talk about. It just becomes a question I've asked for when and do we have the right platform and what changes we need to make it to it to get there. So there are numerous things in the pipeline. Don't ever think we've stopped here. It's going.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Litchman from Oppenheimer.\nSteven Lichtman: Kevin, maybe building on that, you talked today about the steps you're taking now on basal only with the MOBILE data and ADA recommendations in hand. Last ATD, we saw some positive data on non-insulin type 2. What are the next steps here in 2022 in terms of going after that opportunity and even prediabetes?\nKevin Sayer: It is part of our strategy, and we build our pillar around 4 -- we call it the 4 piece here. You've got the physicians, you've got programs, you've got all the clinics who do this, and you got the patients themselves. And we're attacking on all 4 fronts with these programs. We've had positive data from Level 2. We have other companies. We know we'll be reporting positive data in the near term and using this product on type 2 patients who are not on insulin and the outcomes remain strong. We're going to attack it on all 4 fronts.  We believe the experience for these customers. Again, there's going to be a different experience than those who are intensively using insulin. And it's an opportunity for us to use our software capabilities to design a different experience for them that will keep them engaged. The key to any technology as far as providing a good outcome is engagement. And one of the things we've been very successful at, if you look at all of our studies, where we have these incredible outcomes, the users of our systems remain tremendously engaged, and we are trying to build a type 2 solution around that level of engagement, and that's why we're taking some time as we look at this product opportunity. So you'll see us attack on all fronts. I don't know, Jereme, if you have anything to add to that, you're welcome to?\nJereme Sylvain: No, I think one of the things that if you think about this opportunity that we really prepared ourselves for, even beyond our product and our engagement there is some of the software with connectivity that we've built. And so the real-time API, for example, is our way of trying to move into this market and think about, well, if you're building an app and your app is built around whatever that happens to be, whether it is, to your point, health and wellness, we want to be able to be the partner of choice.  Now we have to work on labels and things around those lines, which we'll absolutely do over the long haul. But we've really set ourselves up to be what we believe is the partner of choice, and we'll continue to do so. So that's another way we're going about it, which I think you'll continue to see us push down that path as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen\nJoshua Jennings: I just wanted to ask about gross margins and just the outperformance in 2021? And if you could just run through maybe Jeremy, just some of the drivers of the outperformance relative to your initial guidance? And why we -- some of those drivers couldn't repeat in 2022? And I'm assuming that it's part of it is the G7 launch timing in 2022. But I also wanted to just -- was curious about how the acquisition of the international distributors contributed to the margin performance in 2022 and then really just thinking about a bit there's upside to this initial guidance range for 2022?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, absolutely. So let's think about 2021. And just as you think about that overperformance, really, there's a couple of real drivers of it. It's one, we've built a lot of automated machinery. And as a result of that, yields have gone up over time. And so you've seen the team has done an incredible job of building those yields, really driving those through. And that -- the reduction of waste and the increase efficiency and the increase of the absorption of those fixed costs really was an incredible step forward.  Also through the through our experience with G6, we've reduced our warranty exposure. And as you have warranties, you're sending out replacements, you're sending those out, we're starting to maximize our logistics departments and reducing those freight costs ultimately in fulfilling it. So all of those things were all hitting on and maximizing those for G6.  Now when you launch G7, you've got brand-new machinery. You've got -- so you've got to go through the yields process again. It's a new product. And so you actually -- you have to work through the warranty and how you ultimately navigate that. And so when you get to the question, well, what happened in 2021? That's exactly what happened. The team is doing an incredible job. And in 2022, as we launch G7, we're going to go through that journey. And as you saw with the step back that you saw when we launched G6, there was a step back and then we were able to navigate our way through it. We expect to be able to do the same with G7. However, in the year of launch, we know we're going to have to navigate through them.  And so what could be potential upside to that could be effectively if we're able to navigate through either yields or warranties quicker than expected, which again dovetails into how quick regulatory approvals happen, et cetera. So that's the primary driver. Over the long haul, there's no reason to believe that we can't continue to be more efficient over time. G7 was designed with efficiency in mind. And we have tons of different work streams that are going on around how to maximize -- and Kevin referred to it earlier on how to maximize the cost potential within that line. And so we'll continue to do that over time. We'll get to 2023 when we get there. But over the course of 2022, we're very excited about launching G7 and then going through the improvements.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Frank Pinel from Jefferies.\nFrank Pinal: I guess just looking at your user base, it looks like you've grown that by 3 to 4x over the last several years. I'm wondering to what degree that's sustainable given G7, DexCom 1, prediabetes, type 2, obviously, a lot of things on slate. And is there a point that you see where OUS revenues eclipse U.S. revenues?\nKevin Sayer: In our long-term plans, we certainly show OUS revenues becoming a larger portion of our overall revenue picture than they are today. We don't have them eclipsing U.S. revenues in our current 5-year plan because we have so much opportunity in the U.S. market. I think the user base is a great question. Because over time, the characteristics of that user base changes as we are into more, for example, DexCom 1 type products where it's an e-commerce platform. We don't know how sticky those patients are going to be right now.  We have developed a great model for stickiness with respect to our current user base. And we are designing our products and our software experiences to maintain that type of engagement in a model where people can afford to pay for the product. For many years, the #1 reason an individual could using DexCom was cost. And we are trying to knock that barrier down more and more as we speak. We need to make sure we address those issues going forward.  Our customer experience team has been fabulous identifying things we can do to make our product better and increase that base and have them stay. It's not just getting them. Getting the users is one task, but maintaining them is another one. And our record is unlike anybody else is in this industry, we're really good at this.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. And I think just to your question in terms of how is it repeatable over time in terms of the patient base. Look, I mean, the majority of DexCom's existence has been really focused on the intensive insulin user. But we know that there's an unmet need as you move into a basal user, and that's with the MOBILE study. And that's a large increase in addressable population. We also know that the type 2 space, there's a huge demand for that product there, but it's a question, as Kevin referred to, ultimately, how do we go to market in there? And we have some great ideas about how it should look, and we're working through those.  So I think we're in a pretty good spot. But we're navigating through that. And then to your point, the prediabetes population and health and wellness population is huge. And so it's really a matter of us getting the right product into those folks' hands. And I think that's what you see us doing over time. All the investment in software and platforms is really designed around how do we engage not only our existing population and engage them better but also engage these new population, which means the TAM for this potential product is incredibly large.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Kevin Sayer for final remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks a lot, operator. As we spend today, looking back at 2021, I just want to spend a minute and acknowledge our teams today. We have a commercial team who generated 26% revenue growth and volumes that far exceeded that in a time when we're putting through rapid expansion efforts as we doubled the U.S. sales force, acquired distributors and did a number of things to make it more difficult. We have an operations and quality group who're doing all this time when the world has talked about component shortages and not being able to produce product has delivered every single month.  In addition to delivering, we've opened a large regional distribution center in Arizona, and we're building our factory in Malaysia, and we're hitting our schedules and time frames there. You look at the innovation at this company from R&D, clinical and quality groups with respect to the work and efforts on G7 as we got those filings in and those filings are person with respect to the data that we presented. And we're getting up and ready to scale on the upside. And then just from a day-to-day basis, our HR group has walked us through thousands of hires literally in the past year. And the finance guys haven't missed a beat. And IT as we move to home, we've not had any trouble. This has been a great year for DexCom. And a lot of people have contributed. It's never just one group or one thing. So I just wanted to thank everybody, acknowledge everybody's accomplishments, and we look forward to a great year next year. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I want to take time at the start to highlight some of DexCom's key accomplishments in 2021 that reflect our progress relative to the priorities that we established at the start of the year and our long-term goals.  Total revenue grew 26% on an organic basis over the prior year, with rising CGM awareness and DexCom brand loyalty, leading to another year of record new patient additions. This translates to nearly $500 million of organic growth for the year, leading us to exceed the midpoint of our original guidance for the year by more than $160 million. We laid the foundation for significant expansion of our addressable markets in the future with differentiated product solutions and clinical evidence.  In June, we presented results from the MOBILE randomized controlled trial for people with type 2 diabetes being managed with basal insulin. The results were clear. DexCom CGM can do significantly more to help these people manage diabetes. And with this conclusion being validated in the Journal of the American Medical Association as well as in the recently updated ADA standards of care, we are hopeful that we can bring access to our technology for the estimated 3 million people on basal insulin therapy in the U.S. and many more outside the U.S.  Alongside the MOBILE clinical evidence, we drove several updates to our product portfolio to broaden the ways that customers can engage with our technology. We've consistently spoken about our investments in software and data infrastructure as a significant competitive advantage. In the third quarter, we received 2 key FDA clearances for DexCom software tools that reflect this commitment and strength.  Our real-time API allows us to directly integrate Dexcom CGM data in real time to the displays of approved third-party apps. And our app in-app solution creates an FDA-cleared DexCom app experience that can be integrated directly with the app of a DexCom partner. Both of these creative solutions have already been rolled out with DexCom Partners, and we believe they position us well to provide extensive options for our customers, partners and potential partners as CGM use continues to expand into new populations.  We again strengthened our product portfolio through differentiated software with the CE Mark and launch of our DexCom 1 product in the fourth quarter of 2021. In a relatively short period since launch, we've already seen strong adoption in both type 1 and type 2 customers, and the health systems in 2 of our 4 launch countries established reimbursement. With the focus on ease of use and affordable price point, we believe DexCom 1 will be a significant part of our story as we look to extend CGM access globally.  Perhaps most importantly, in 2021, we completed the pivotal trials in support of our next-generation G7 system and submitted the results for both CE Mark and FDA clearance. As many of you recently saw in our January presentation and will soon see in a publication, the performance of the G7 system is outstanding, achieving performance levels relative to the FDA's iCGM special controls.  Even with customers on our G6 system expressing record Net Promoter Scores at the end of 2021, we are incredibly excited for them to experience G7. We believe that we are very close to receiving CE Mark and navigating the final stages of that review. In the meantime, our teams continue to work to prepare the manufacturing scale-up and commercial efforts in anticipation of G7 launches throughout the year as well as launches with some of our partners on their upcoming connected insulin delivery devices.  On that front, we were excited to see the news of the FDA's recent clearance of Insulet's Omnipod 5, the first tubeless automated insulin delivery pump. With this clearance for Insulet and the ongoing success of Control-IQ for tandem Diabetes, we believe that we are enabling automated insulin delivery for the best tubeless pump on the market and the best tethered pump. The outcomes that customers are seeing with these DexCom integrated systems are outstanding, and we are proud that our commitment to connectivity is helping advance the market and enhance the quality of life for our customers.  These accomplishments align with the strategic priorities that we established at the start of last year, showing the resilience and execution of the DexCom teams in a challenging environment. And these accomplishments are not merely 2021 events, but they are the foundation that we will continue to build on as we press forward in 2022 and beyond. Many of you likely saw the recent update to the IDF estimates for global diabetes prevalence and cost. There are now greater than 500 million adults with diabetes globally, and cost to treat the disease alone are estimated to be approximately $1 trillion per year.  In addition, the CDC now estimate that 38% of adults in America or 96 million people have prediabetes. There is a real opportunity here for DexCom to do something great to address this epidemic and power diabetes management and down the road even workboards diabetes prevention and better health outcomes broadly. The future for DexCom is bright.  With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the fourth quarter financials and discussion of the 2022 outlook. Jereme? Thanks, Jereme. To summarize, we set out in 2021 with a few key goals in mind: to complete the clinical and regulatory process for G7 and prepare for significant launches, to validate health and economic outcomes for DexCom CGM beyond the intent of insulin using population, to broaden access to DexCom CGM globally through evidence, advocacy and leveraging our growing scale and efficiency and to strengthen our product portfolio for future growth through differentiated software capabilities. Our progress on all these initiatives contributed to a great 2021 and have us looking forward to a big year ahead in 2022.  I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? There's many parts to your 2-part question. I'll deal with some of them, and then I'll give them to Jereme, Matt, but thanks. Let me talk about the data first. DexCom has long built its legacy on having the best product in the market with respect to performance and a product that everybody can rely on. And time and time again, we've launched products where we published great clinical performance and real life experience always ends up better than what we published.  I've been looking at glucose sensors since the mid-'90s. This data is better than anything I've ever seen. And I think from a marketing perspective and from a customer experience perspective, it's absolutely critical that we remain top of the industry. And this data puts us in there and it demonstrates really the thought and effort that's gone into this product.  Let's not forget, we've changed pretty much everything. There's a new algorithm, new hardware, new electronics, new app you name it, new receiver, everything in here is different than what we've had before. So this has been a monumental effort that's taken a lot of time and to be able to produce this type of clinical results we think just show the diligence of the effort.  And with respect to approvals, we think it's also very important that we not leave room for error or room for doubt with the data that we submitted, which is exactly what we've done when you look at the size of that study. And of 39,000-some matched pairs, there's really no room for doubt that this product is ready for prime time from a performance perspective.  On the approval time lines, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're down to the last steps for CE Mark literally procedural type discussions with documentation that will take place in the near term. We're very confident that we'll get CE Mark very soon, and then we will start our wanted launch in Europe and then roll out to the full launch after that. We've had initial dialogue with the FDA and our submission. And so far, those discussions go well. We currently are not anticipating a delay, but we don't control that any more than we controlled the CE Mark delays either that we've just experienced. By providing great clinical data, though, that certainly takes a large element out of the process. I couldn't be more excited about G7 though, Matt. I'll kick it over to Jereme for the financial ramifications. Jereme, go ahead. Yes, I'd even add to that. I actually got out in the field here earlier this week, and I heard from the rep and the teams out there that they've not had the access they wanted here in the first quarter, but it is starting to open up a little bit. Time will tell. There is some limited reimbursement for basal only and some nonintensive type 2s, but it's not a very big number, Jeff, it's kind of on a half-hazard basis. And it's not something that -- actually, we sell to or market to because they're just not that much of it out there. The pathway for approval will be similar to what we've done in the past. Given this mobile data, we're certainly presenting this on the commercial side and working to get couch at various payers. And hopefully, some of those will drop over the course of the year.  On the CMS side, now that we have really good data, we have a good CMS plan to work with and go with them, make them more aware. Unless we forget, we did lead the charge for Medicare approval for CGM in general as a company here. So we have experience on this front, and we'll continue to push it. But it takes time, and there's always variables. In all fairness, I was completely wrong on Medicare approval before. It was approved 18 months earlier than I said I was going to come. So when I made a commitment there. So I'm rather having to make any commitments on that front. We're just going to keep pushing.  The most important thing, though, is the outcomes are there. I got a note from a patient not long ago, who is a type 2 patient in this category. And while the patient got put on a new drug, she attribute her 4 month A1C drop in 6 months to being out of DexCom, not to new drug because he knew what her glucose values were, and we've seen this time and time again. And we're very confident this is how this plays out over time. Well, our competitive message from our reps is going to be the same it's always been, we're the best. And you're right, Robbie, we have a tremendous opportunity on the integrated system front with our partners to go grab as many of these users as we possibly can, and we are in talks with both Tandem and Insulet to let's go Sunshine can get as many as we possibly can as those individuals rotate off warranty and have an opportunity to get into a new system.  I think it speaks to our connectivity strategy and partnering with others now we have 2 options. And we know a big driving factor for both those partners, the fact that they pair with the best product on the marketplace. So we will aggressively work with our partners on that front and make sure we have a joint message together.  With respect to our own DC undrawn direct-to-consumer marketing, we have specific messages literally down to the geography standpoint, where in some states, we target Medicare patients more than others. In other states, we target pediatrics and others. And then we analyze the effectiveness of those adds, the return on those investments and then adjust from there. I think 2022, we're in an interesting year because we're going through a product launch. That really isn't going to affect our behavior.  We have to get more users on the 6 systems as we go. And then some of those ads will ultimately shift over to G7. But we're not going to slow down, and we're not going to create anticipation. We'll market what we have and sell what we have. And then as time comes, we'll pull the switch and go over. Well, again, let's remind everybody our original DexCom 1 launch is for relatively small countries. The results have been very good. We've launched it as only an e-commerce platform, and 2 of the 4 countries have now put the standards in place to reimburse for it because of these and the acceptance of that product and the price point.  So Dexcom 1 does give us an opportunity, first of all, to expand in new geographies where there may not be reimbursement, where the path to reimbursement would be difficult, and there's a lot of integrated systems. We look forward to that as a geographical expander, where we don't have infrastructure.  The other opportunity we have with Dexcom 1 in all honesty is looking at a possible 2-product strategy in some geographies where we believe we can support our G-Series for those in tens of insulin users, particularly those who are on partner systems and integrated systems and those who need all the share and follow function, pediatrics in particular, and there's another population that may not need all those features. And in those geographies, we believe DexCom 1 is an excellent product offering that could round out our portfolio very nicely.  As far as Libre 3 rolling out, we haven't seen that much of it so far. I know there's been a lot of announcements, that was approved several years ago. So we'll see how that rollout goes. Our limited launch will be a relatively short period of time and really focus on one geography primarily. And after that, we'll then roll it out to really the larger markets, the larger, more reimbursed markets and the larger markets where we can get reimbursement very quickly and then go down to the smaller ones. So we, again, have the geographies divided up in tiers. Tier 1 countries, Tier 2 and Tier 3 and along those lines. And that will roll out over the course of 2022, certainly to the larger markets then the other geographies will come after that. And the only thing I'd add to that, Jason, again, these volume numbers still remain very high. So again, as channel mix shifts, the growth rate is lower than the volume numbers. Add to that the fact that our NPS scores are higher than they've ever been. So patients are very happy and satisfied with the DexCom experience, which leads to them staying on the system and also being on the system more time. So as you look at revenue factors going forward, 2 of the biggest ones are patient retention, utilization, and we're doing very well on that front. And so that pretty much sums it up. We're really happy with the efforts of the sales team. And again, I got out in the field for the first time this week and just had a couple of meetings with some regional teams. I'm very impressed with the quality of the people we were able to bring on. DexCom is a name here in the U.S. has 1 that attracted great candidates. And literally, there were thousands of people that applied for these jobs. We very much had our pick of the cream of the crop.  They're all getting very much up to speed. I'm very also impressed with the diversity of the group with respect to experiences. And what we've learned is they brought from their companies. You have some from pharma, some from devices, some from diabetes, some of who used to be clinicians. So you have a very different team with very good ideas to go about this. We're confident the team is making very good progress. We missed the opportunity in all fairness to have them all together, and I am in particular, to get to know more of them.  The growth in new patient starts has not been linear with the expansion of the sales force. But as we get down into these other markets, we can't expect it to be the same because they don't see as many of the people with diabetes is in our traditional endocrinology market. But we're happy with the growth that they've achieved. We have very ambitious targets for next year. What might be needed in the future is something we debate a great deal internally. We're happy with what we have now, and let's let this play out for a while longer before we make any changes. I don't see anything changing right now. If anything, again, this is all about awareness on our side.  And if what we need to generate more awareness has more feet on the street, that's the direction we would go. For right now, we don't feel that way, but we may in the future. So we'll see. We're never adverse to trying pilot programs in specific geographies to see if another option come work and we will do that all throughout 2022. And if something sticks, we'll move in that direction. Well, I'll start with basal insulin because the ADA and their recent guidelines came out and recommended CGM continuous use for people on basal insulin, which is a far departure from where we were in the past. This is very encouraging for us because the -- the fact that this group has now recommended that is a for us going forward. And as far as that population utilization in our MOBILE study and even in the other things that we've heard, they have no problem here in CGM all the time.  For nonintensive patients, we've had our program with Level 2 at United Healthcare. We've had other programs with Intermountain Health, Onduo, Welldoc a number of them. and the results remain the same over and over again. Patients on CGM do better than those who are not. And the information provided by CGM enables them to make the proper changes to have better overall health very much like I said in my prepared remarks earlier. We see A1Cs go down because people know what the consequences of their meds, of their exercise, of their diets, of sleep of all these factors has on their overall health.  With respect to the pricing and the business model, we've often said we are solving a different problem when we're going after type 2 less intensive diabetes. And we, therefore, think the pricing model will be different than the current product that we have. And we are working on what that optimal solution is right now, and you'll hear more from us on that front over the course of 2022. I'll start, and Jereme can maybe have some more specific numbers after I'm done if he's got any. Again, as I said earlier, there are 2 great uses for DexCom 1. The first one is those geographies where we're not and where we don't have infrastructure or a distribution arrangement with a distributor or another distribution partner lined up. We can drop an e-commerce platform in there and have cash pay payments patients, and we can get them on the system and we can go.  Our results in our 4 initial countries have been outstanding. And so we'll have other new geographies up over the course of the year like that. They will not have major contributions to our revenue, but they do expand our footprint and do position us ultimately to get reimbursement in those countries. Again, as we've seen in the first 4 where we launched it, we now have reimbursement and process for 2 of those.  The other opportunity for DexCom 1 is in many of the major established markets, particularly OUS. We have an opportunity with DexCom 1 to implement a dual-product strategy. Our G-Series does a lot more than our DexCom 1 product with connectivity, Sharon follow, the predictive alerts and all the other things that we have in that system, we believe it merits a different price point. Again, it solves a different problem. It's a different use case.  We will very opportunistically pick geographies where we could launch DexCom 1 and augment our business in those geographies, again, adding more patient volume and more revenue to the process. As far as giving you numbers or plans, I'm not going to give you all of that. That's on the strategy side and something for us not to unwind to the world. But suffice it to say, those plans are in progress. I don't know, Jereme, if you have anything to add? I love what's next question, but these guys are cut me off after 15 minutes, so I'd have to stop. First of all, let's look at G7 and everything that's changed. We have plans in place to modify and make everything with G7 better already. We have, for example, a major cost initiative to reduce our manufacturing costs even where they are. You can expect us to be very diligent in efforts to get that up to a 15-day life from a product perspective because that certainly has a big impact on our P&L.  We have, for example, alternative electronic structures, all those types of things going on. We've never stopped improving our sensor technology. So all of these things, we continue to work on our core business. At some point in time, there may be some diminishing returns, particularly given the accuracy of the data on the current system. So we balance that. But a lot of these efforts, again, we focus on our product development, performance, patient experience, our customer satisfaction and cost. And we look at all those buckets, I can tell you there will be a lot of software initiatives here going forward with the G7 platform.  We believe with DexCom 1, we've merely scratched the surface of our ability to differentiate products through different software experiences, again, creating different business models and expanding our reach.  With respect to their analytes, we continue to study that. We've studied that for quite some time. What we have to determine is what are real commercial markets for us? And in all fairness, we haven't found anything that compares to glucose yet. And we have a lot of things then we need to conquer on the glucose side. But we do have studies going on for some of the other analytes that you certainly be familiar with that you've heard others talk about. It just becomes a question I've asked for when and do we have the right platform and what changes we need to make it to it to get there. So there are numerous things in the pipeline. Don't ever think we've stopped here. It's going. It is part of our strategy, and we build our pillar around 4 -- we call it the 4 piece here. You've got the physicians, you've got programs, you've got all the clinics who do this, and you got the patients themselves. And we're attacking on all 4 fronts with these programs. We've had positive data from Level 2. We have other companies. We know we'll be reporting positive data in the near term and using this product on type 2 patients who are not on insulin and the outcomes remain strong. We're going to attack it on all 4 fronts.  We believe the experience for these customers. Again, there's going to be a different experience than those who are intensively using insulin. And it's an opportunity for us to use our software capabilities to design a different experience for them that will keep them engaged. The key to any technology as far as providing a good outcome is engagement. And one of the things we've been very successful at, if you look at all of our studies, where we have these incredible outcomes, the users of our systems remain tremendously engaged, and we are trying to build a type 2 solution around that level of engagement, and that's why we're taking some time as we look at this product opportunity. So you'll see us attack on all fronts. I don't know, Jereme, if you have anything to add to that, you're welcome to? In our long-term plans, we certainly show OUS revenues becoming a larger portion of our overall revenue picture than they are today. We don't have them eclipsing U.S. revenues in our current 5-year plan because we have so much opportunity in the U.S. market. I think the user base is a great question. Because over time, the characteristics of that user base changes as we are into more, for example, DexCom 1 type products where it's an e-commerce platform. We don't know how sticky those patients are going to be right now.  We have developed a great model for stickiness with respect to our current user base. And we are designing our products and our software experiences to maintain that type of engagement in a model where people can afford to pay for the product. For many years, the #1 reason an individual could using DexCom was cost. And we are trying to knock that barrier down more and more as we speak. We need to make sure we address those issues going forward.  Our customer experience team has been fabulous identifying things we can do to make our product better and increase that base and have them stay. It's not just getting them. Getting the users is one task, but maintaining them is another one. And our record is unlike anybody else is in this industry, we're really good at this. Thanks a lot, operator. As we spend today, looking back at 2021, I just want to spend a minute and acknowledge our teams today. We have a commercial team who generated 26% revenue growth and volumes that far exceeded that in a time when we're putting through rapid expansion efforts as we doubled the U.S. sales force, acquired distributors and did a number of things to make it more difficult. We have an operations and quality group who're doing all this time when the world has talked about component shortages and not being able to produce product has delivered every single month.  In addition to delivering, we've opened a large regional distribution center in Arizona, and we're building our factory in Malaysia, and we're hitting our schedules and time frames there. You look at the innovation at this company from R&D, clinical and quality groups with respect to the work and efforts on G7 as we got those filings in and those filings are person with respect to the data that we presented. And we're getting up and ready to scale on the upside. And then just from a day-to-day basis, our HR group has walked us through thousands of hires literally in the past year. And the finance guys haven't missed a beat. And IT as we move to home, we've not had any trouble. This has been a great year for DexCom. And a lot of people have contributed. It's never just one group or one thing. So I just wanted to thank everybody, acknowledge everybody's accomplishments, and we look forward to a great year next year. Thanks."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  In line with our January pre-announcement, we reported worldwide revenue of $698 million for the fourth quarter compared to $569 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing growth of 23% on both a reported and constant currency basis and 20% on an organic basis.  The organic revenue excludes non-CGM revenue that we generated in the fourth quarter following our acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand. U.S. revenue totaled $517 million in the fourth quarter compared to $451 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, representing growth of 15%.  Unit volume growth, which is a general representation for the growth of our user base, remained in the high 30% range compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, and we continue to see the strength in our strategic shift to the pharmacy channel. Our teams continue to work very hard to broaden our prescriber base and take advantage of the significant reimbursement access that we have driven in the past 2 years in both the U.S. and international markets.  The uptick in COVID cases has created some challenges for us in the fourth quarter and into the early first quarter, but it is a credit to the resilience of our field team and the strength of the category that global new customers remain near record levels in the fourth quarter.  Our international business executed very well in the fourth quarter, with revenue growing 54%, totaling $181 million. Excluding non-CGM revenue that resulted from our 2021 distributor acquisition, international growth was 41% in the fourth quarter. The international result reflected broad-based strength, including record results in all of our direct markets.  This growth continues to validate the strategic moves that we made over the course of 2021, most notably the progress that we made to broaden access to our technology through advocacy, flexibility gained from operating efficiencies and a differentiated product portfolio. We look forward to extending this momentum now as we progress into 2022.  Our fourth quarter gross profit was $472.6 million or 67.7% of revenue compared to 70.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter gross margin was slightly above our expectations as certain costs related to the G7 scale-up and commercial preparation remain in our R&D costs until we receive CE Mark. We made excellent progress to drive efficiencies across our product design, procurement, manufacturing and logistics functions leading to a full year 2021 gross margin that finished 360 basis points above our original 2021 guidance.  Operating expenses were $373.6 million for Q4 2021 compared to $294.7 million in Q4 2020. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue relative to the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily a result of development and operational costs incurred in preparation for the launch of G7 as well as investments to support our global commercialization efforts.  Operating income was $99 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $104.4 million in the same quarter of 2020. As a reminder, when we provided the outlook for 2021, we determined it was in the best interest to make investments in the business continue to fuel CGM growth and awareness.  As we wrap the year, we are proud to report that we outpaced our initial 2021 operating margin guidance by more than 200 basis points, all of which came despite significant investments to solidify our software advantages, advance the G7 clinical, regulatory and manufacturing programs, significantly expand our global sales force presence and significant efforts to build brand awareness. And we are committed to driving further leverage in the years to come as we strike the right balance between investing to maximize our growth opportunity and turning that opportunity into cash flow generation for the business and our stakeholders.  Adjusted EBITDA was $154.5 million or 22.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $159.2 million or 28% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020. Net income for the fourth quarter was $69 million or $0.68 per share. As many of you also saw in our press release and our GAAP reconciliations, we also recognized an $87 million expense associated with contingent milestone under the 2018 collaboration and license agreement with Verily Life Sciences. Terms of our amended contract with Verily are available in the SEC filings that were originally published in November 2018 and updated in November 2021.  We closed the quarter with greater than $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We have demonstrated the ability to generate positive cash flow. And going forward, we remain in a very flexible position to continue to advance strategic initiatives and opportunities. Most notably, we will continue our development of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia as we expect to have that facility validated for production by the end of 2022.  Turning to 2022 guidance. As we stated last month, we anticipate full year total revenues of $2.82 billion to $2.94 billion, representing growth of 15% to 20%. Given the success of our strategic transition to the pharmacy channel over the past 3 years, we anticipate that 2022 will be the final year where we see a significant shift of our existing base from the durable medical equipment channel to pharmacy.  With this ongoing shift as well as the majority of our new customers now coming through the pharmacy channel in the U.S., our expectations for customer growth in 2022 are again higher than our revenue growth rate, continuing to reflect the large end markets we serve and the growing demand for DexCom CGM worldwide. We have several scenarios built in conjunction with our plan G7 launches. And factoring in the respective regulatory approvals and competitive environment, we will provide updates as the year progresses.  Turning to margins. We are establishing the following guidance for 2022. We expect gross profit margins of approximately 65% for the year, in line with the expectation that we established for our 2025 long-range plan. The slight step back relative to our 2021 results is primarily related to the launch of our G7 system during the year as we begin production at lower volumes and gradually scale in conjunction with our launches.  Despite that step back in gross margin, we expect to offset that impact completely with approximately 400 basis points of operating expense leverage. We anticipate our operating margins of 2022 of approximately 16%. This factors in the ongoing investments that are driving significant returns for DexCom and setting us up for sustainable growth, including our DTC marketing efforts and investments in our product portfolio pipeline. We are making these investments with the discipline throughout the organization, driving towards the margin expansion that we've established in our long-range plan.  Finally, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25% in 2022.  With that, I will turn the call back to Kevin. Sure. Yes. So it's a good question on the margins. We exited 2021 north of 68% with our G6, right? So we are certainly seeing G6 firing on all cylinders from an efficiency perspective. And so your question is, well, how does the sequencing and timing of G7 work? How does that impact the margin in relation to the timing throughout the course of the year? And it's a little bit of an insulation.  So if it rolls out a little bit slower, certainly, the cost to produce G7 are higher, but that means we're ultimately selling more G6. And so you have this little bit of this transition, where as you think about it from a multitude of different scenarios, it really zones back in on the 65% margin, and that's the reason why we feel comfortable with the guidance there.  I'll give you the opposite scenario of G7 is able to come out a little bit faster. The regulatory approval happens quicker. Certainly, we'll be selling more of it, and we'll be able to leverage the fixed cost infrastructure and certainly improve yields. And so you ultimately get to that end goal a little bit quicker. So I think under both scenarios, whether regulatory approval and launches sooner or later, I think that 65% gross margin really speaks to the entirety of the year. Sure. Yes, I'll take that one. Yes. Sorry about that. We cut a little bit in and out there, but I think I got the question, which is how we thought about it. And I'd say for the full year guidance, we have factored in the impact of COVID and how that would impact us. Now we did talk a little bit about it on the call. And I think you saw this really across, especially in the United States, really where Omicron was pretty strong throughout the course of January, and we see it starting to dissipate here in February.  So we will see that as car ability to get in front of primary care physicians and access new patients, but it's not a question of if, it's more a question of when. And so that was all contemplated in the guidance. And as we think about the full year, there's a lot of other things that we think are certainly interesting but it's as we think about certainly Dexcom 1 and the launch, as Kevin referred to of G7 with the incredible data.  So we've really contemplated all of those in the guidance. But certainly, we know that as we exited January, certainly, there were some primary care physicians that were closed outside participants, but we are starting to see some of that though as we move to February. Yes. So what we had mentioned is in the U.S., they were in the high 30s and globally, they were also in the high 30s. And so that's the 2 numbers. So we gave you the global one, certainly in early January. And then today, we mentioned the U.S. was also in the high 30s as well. Sure. Yes. So this year, our pricing headwinds, we had talked about is really what we call channel mix was really around $250 million, $200 million in the U.S. and about $50 million outside the U.S. We came in a little bit light of that this year, but generally in line with that. And we expect similar type mix headwinds into 2022 and then dissipating significantly as we move into 2023. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Jason. Appreciate the call. So what we saw from a growth perspective is about 15%. It was a little bit slower from a growth revenue dollars perspective. Now we did see unit volumes in the high 30%, which indicates that the underlying patient base continues to be strong.  I think the one thing that we did see, and I think you referenced it earlier in your question, was didn't hit our new patient targets. It was still -- we still had near a record new patient add. And so it was still a solid addition, and we're still very happy -- but we did have some challenges getting into the primary care physician offices. And Kevin alluded to it earlier. He was out in the field. And when Omicron was really running at a tight, a lot of those offices were really not seeing outside visitors. And so that creates a little bit of a challenge as you're ultimately getting to know these physicians and getting them to ultimately understand how to use the product. That was the predominant driver of what you saw in the Q4.  And in our early calls when we kind of released early numbers, we have mentioned that, and we've confirmed that over the next -- over the past few weeks is that was predominantly the driver. And As we -- as Omicron dissipates and we're able to get back in front of these primary care physicians, we remain bullish that folks will ultimately adopt the technology similar to what you've seen prior to that. But that was really the predominant driver, nothing really beyond that. Sure. Yes. No, it's a fair question. And it's split about 50-50. I think what you're going to see is you're going to see us leveraging mostly the G&A line and the SG&A line. We'll continue to make sure that we're allocating funds to sales and marketing, but you're going to see us leveraging the G&A line and continuing to do so. And then you will see some of the falloff on some of the R&D side as we leverage R&D. And as we post G7 launch, we don't have to incur as many costs associated with a launch establishment. So think about it 50-50 across both of those and G&A, not S&M and R&D. Sure. Yes. No, I'm happy to walk through it. So you are correct. As time moves on, the move of the commercial business certainly more and more to pharmacy then DME should give us more of a situation where Q1 and Q4 are less pronounced. And so you are 100% correct there. And over the longer haul, that's where we expect to go.  In terms of seasonality for this quarter, we do expect it to be relatively similar to last year. And again, that's just more of us trying to navigate through, one, that migration; two, the Omicron variant this year was certainly more than we saw in January of last year. And so we're really comparing year-over-year. And so I think it's fair to say that. So we would expect that those 2 things really offset each other. So you see a little bit of a seasonality in this of 2022 similar to that you've seen in the past.  Longer term, you are correct, and we will expect absent all macro factors that ultimately impact people's ability for movement and seeing physicians, et cetera, it will migrate to more of that situation. But we'll keep you posted as years get forward about that seasonality. For now, that's our expectation. I think the safe bet is just to assume multiple country entries with DexCom 1. And we'll get you a little bit more color once we're into those countries, hold those back for a strategic purpose. No, I think one of the things that if you think about this opportunity that we really prepared ourselves for, even beyond our product and our engagement there is some of the software with connectivity that we've built. And so the real-time API, for example, is our way of trying to move into this market and think about, well, if you're building an app and your app is built around whatever that happens to be, whether it is, to your point, health and wellness, we want to be able to be the partner of choice.  Now we have to work on labels and things around those lines, which we'll absolutely do over the long haul. But we've really set ourselves up to be what we believe is the partner of choice, and we'll continue to do so. So that's another way we're going about it, which I think you'll continue to see us push down that path as well. Yes, absolutely. So let's think about 2021. And just as you think about that overperformance, really, there's a couple of real drivers of it. It's one, we've built a lot of automated machinery. And as a result of that, yields have gone up over time. And so you've seen the team has done an incredible job of building those yields, really driving those through. And that -- the reduction of waste and the increase efficiency and the increase of the absorption of those fixed costs really was an incredible step forward.  Also through the through our experience with G6, we've reduced our warranty exposure. And as you have warranties, you're sending out replacements, you're sending those out, we're starting to maximize our logistics departments and reducing those freight costs ultimately in fulfilling it. So all of those things were all hitting on and maximizing those for G6.  Now when you launch G7, you've got brand-new machinery. You've got -- so you've got to go through the yields process again. It's a new product. And so you actually -- you have to work through the warranty and how you ultimately navigate that. And so when you get to the question, well, what happened in 2021? That's exactly what happened. The team is doing an incredible job. And in 2022, as we launch G7, we're going to go through that journey. And as you saw with the step back that you saw when we launched G6, there was a step back and then we were able to navigate our way through it. We expect to be able to do the same with G7. However, in the year of launch, we know we're going to have to navigate through them.  And so what could be potential upside to that could be effectively if we're able to navigate through either yields or warranties quicker than expected, which again dovetails into how quick regulatory approvals happen, et cetera. So that's the primary driver. Over the long haul, there's no reason to believe that we can't continue to be more efficient over time. G7 was designed with efficiency in mind. And we have tons of different work streams that are going on around how to maximize -- and Kevin referred to it earlier on how to maximize the cost potential within that line. And so we'll continue to do that over time. We'll get to 2023 when we get there. But over the course of 2022, we're very excited about launching G7 and then going through the improvements. Yes. And I think just to your question in terms of how is it repeatable over time in terms of the patient base. Look, I mean, the majority of DexCom's existence has been really focused on the intensive insulin user. But we know that there's an unmet need as you move into a basal user, and that's with the MOBILE study. And that's a large increase in addressable population. We also know that the type 2 space, there's a huge demand for that product there, but it's a question, as Kevin referred to, ultimately, how do we go to market in there? And we have some great ideas about how it should look, and we're working through those.  So I think we're in a pretty good spot. But we're navigating through that. And then to your point, the prediabetes population and health and wellness population is huge. And so it's really a matter of us getting the right product into those folks' hands. And I think that's what you see us doing over time. All the investment in software and platforms is really designed around how do we engage not only our existing population and engage them better but also engage these new population, which means the TAM for this potential product is incredibly large."

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer : Thank you, Sean. And thank you, everyone for joining us. Today we reported another strong quarter for DexCom with third-quarter revenue growth of 30% compared to the third quarter of 2020, and 28% growth on an organic basis. This revenue growth rate represents continued momentum per DexCom CGM adoption around the world as we once again achieved a record quarter of new customer growth.  The third quarter also saw several strategic accomplishments across our teams that laid the foundation for our future growth opportunities. In the U.S., we received FDA clearance for 2 key software solutions that continue to differentiate our connected products from those of our competitors and position us as a partner of choice across our healthcare and wearable\u2019s ecosystem.  First in July, we received FDA clearance for our real-time API. For those of you who are not aware an API is the tool that allows one app to connect with another app. prior to this clearance, our customers and clinicians could only utilize our retrospective API, which integrated DexCom data into third-party apps on a three-hour delayed basis.  We believe that by putting the power of choice at our user\u2019s fingertips with Reopine data, we can help ease the daily burden of diabetes management and significantly improved quality of life for our customers. This tool will be available to partners invited by DexCom. And we already have several that will began the development process to enable real-time displays for their communities.  This includes Garmin. Which became the first partner to launch apps connected to our real-time API 2 weeks ago, bringing DexCom ratings into their portfolio of wearable\u2019s and cycling computers? Second, on the heels of the real-time API clearance, we received FDA clearance in August for the DexCom app and app module.  This module was specifically designed for people with non-intensive type 2 diabetes and can directly integrate into another third-party healthcare app. With the integrated DexCom app, it is now even easier for our partners to access and display our CGM data, enabling single app solutions that simplify the experiences for DexCom users.  United Health Group became our first partner to launch the integrated DexCom App and app module in late September, bringing the embedded app into their level 2 diabetes care program. Our connectivity software and data infrastructure solutions are a core strength of DexCom. These two recent FDA clearances reflect the increase investment that we put into software development, and we believe increase our competitive advantages moving forward.  In late September, we also announced the launch of DexCom ONE in four international markets, where we previously had no presence, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. DexCom ONE leverages the G6 hardware platform and a completely redesigned software experience that focuses on simplicity and ease-of-use for our customers.  This is the first product launch in our history that started exclusively through the DexCom e-commerce platform. A platform that has been embraced by our customers in Canada and the UK over the past two years. With the proven performance of our CGM systems, the new software experience and efficient e-commerce solution, and affordable pricing plans.  We believe that DexCom ONE will be an important product for us as we drive the business to where our long term targets. Most importantly, this differentiated product as a key step for us to bring DexCom CGM to significantly more people with diabetes who previously did not have access to our products.  Early feedback around the product has been very favorable and we look forward to seeing the full results from these launches as we leverage for the full breadth of our expanding product portfolio to achieve our 2020 Investor Day Goal of tripling our international addressable market by the end of 2023.  Building from the strength of our mobile trial that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in June, investigators published the results from the extension phase of the trial in diabetes care during the third quarter. In this extension phase, we re-randomized the population who are initially on CGM to see if the benefits would be retained for those who stayed on CGM compared to those who returned to Finger-Stick monitoring.  Once again, the results were clear. Those who stayed on our G6 systems, maintained greater time and range improvements over the 6 month extension phase compared to those who did not. The results confirmed that further significant population of people with type II diabetes on basal insulin, there is significant benefit in continuous CGM use to optimize therapy and support behavior modifications. Our teams are working hard to leverage the conclusions from mobile into greater access to our technology for people with type two diabetes. And this is just one area in which we are building the foundation for our long-term growth. We are advancing our pilot efforts with United Health's level 2.  Teladoc's Lavango per diabetes,  on dual and others. We are generating strong clinical evidence for expanded indications for CGM use in inpatient settings, and for women who are pregnant, we continue to leverage our advantages in connectivity by gaining new customers and progressing our pipeline of solutions with our leading insulin delivery partners.  Finally, we continue to advance our G7 scale up and regulatory efforts during the quarter. We have had excellent communication with our notified body in Europe and believe that we remain on track to begin the launch of our G7 system in the fourth quarter upon receiving CE mark clearance.  In the U.S. we've made great progress in preparation prior regulatory submission, and believe that we are now in the final stages of that effort. We look forward to the comprehensive G7-510K submission, including G7 hardware and full Android and IOS software to the FDA in the next few weeks. As you can see, our teams are working very hard and making great progress to advance our core strategic efforts.  Whether it is in expanding our product portfolio, creating differentiated user experiences, are laying the foundation for new market opportunities that will drive our future growth. So with that said, let me turn it over now to Jeremy for a review of our third quarter financial performance. Jeremy.\nJereme Sylvain : Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $650 million compared to 501 million for the third quarter of 2020, representing growth of 30% on a reported basis and 28% on an organic basis.  In late July, we were proud to complete the acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand. With this acquisition, we began generating revenue for certain non-CGM healthcare product which we have categorizes inorganic growth for the quarter. This non-CGM distribution revenue contributed approximately 2% to our reported growth for the third quarter.  The transition from distributor markets to direct sales is one of several important strategic initiatives that we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day as we seek to significantly grow our international presence, We believe a larger direct international footprint will give us greater control to leverage our marketing strength, invest in accelerating our growth, and ensure that the direction of these core markets is aligned to our strategic interests.  In terms of financial impact of the third quarter acquisition, we expect the transaction to be approximately neutral to our operating margin for the full year as it was in the third quarter. U.S. revenue totaled 490 million in the third quarter compared to 399 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing growth of 23%.  We continue to see good momentum in the U.S. where we are benefiting from the increased market access and field presence that we have enabled over the past year. New customer growth remains strong across all segments of the population, including people with type 1 diabetes, intensively managed people with type 2 diabetes, where we have significantly expanded market access in the past year, and even early adopters in the type 2 non-intensive population.  Our international business grew 57% in the third quarter, totaling $161 million. Excluding the impact of non-CGM distribution revenue generated by our acquisition of our distributor in Australia, and New Zealand, growth for international business was 46% in the third quarter. We continue to see very encouraging growth across the board in our International Markets, with a majority of our markets delivering record sales in the Third Quarter.  Although it is still early, we believe that our strategic groups to broaden access in several markets have been very successful thus far and have left us well positioned to expand our growth profile internationally. And you see that reflected current quarter results. Along those lines are global volume growth in the third quarter remained strong, exceeding 40% for the Quarter.  This is well above our 28% organic revenue growth rate can supports the momentum behind DexCom CGM globally. As we aggressively seek to advance access to our technology and drive better health outcomes and quality of life for people with diabetes. As Kevin mentioned, the launch of DexCom one adds to our product portfolio and provides another key element of our strategy to expand access to CGM globally.  As we continue to scale our business in conjunction with our ambitious plans for customer growth, we are creating tools that allow us to serve our growing base in an efficient manner. And the use of our e-commerce platform for the initial DexCom ONE launch is a good example of that focus.  Our third quarter gross profit was $446.9 million or 68.7% of revenue compared to 68% of revenue in the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year gross margin expansion is an impressive result, especially when you factor in our strategic efforts this year to drive greater mix through the pharmacy channel and expanded international access.  This is a credit to our teams who have innovated and embraced change where necessary to drive efficiencies and position us to maximize our strategic opportunities. We continue to demonstrate the ability to leverage both our manufacturing operations and R&D teams to be ever more efficient in the delivery of our products. Operating expenses were 323.1 million for Q3 2021 compared to 245.7 million in Q3 2020. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat year-over-year as we offset investments in software development G7 scale-up, and our expanded global commercial sales force with strong leverage of our general and administrative functions. Operating income was 123.8 million in the Third Quarter of 2021 compared to 95 million in the same quarter of 2020, holding flat 19% of revenue.  As this result indicates, we've been able to retain much of our operating margin this year, even as we have significantly reinvested in our business. Adjusted EBITDA was 173.5 million or 26.7% of revenue for the third quarter, compared to 146.9 million or 29.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2020. Net income for the third quarter was 89.5 million or $0.89 per share.  We closed the quarter with approximately 2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents giving us great financial flexibility to drive our strategic initiatives. This includes the continued build-out of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia, and G7 scale up in Mesa, Arizona, as well as opportunities that are aligned our business objectives, such as our recent stricter acquisition.  Turning to guidance, our third quarter performance has placed us in a position to once again raise our full-year 2021 outlook for revenue and margins as we look to wrap up another excellent year. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between 2.4 - 5 and 2.45 billion, representing growth of 26% to 27% over 2020.  This guidance includes approximately 100 basis points of non-CGM in organic growth, related to our recent distributor acquisition. Turning to margins, we are increasing our full-year 2021 targets. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels, which include a neutral impact from our distributor acquisition.  Gross profit margins of approximately 68%, operating margins of approximately 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25%. With that, I will now turn the call back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer : There are a number of things that we could celebrate and I'd like to take the time now to thank all of the teams at DexCom and specifically highlight a few things that we're proud of. First, to our new DexCom team members in Australia and New Zealand, we are absolutely thrilled to have you with us on our journey to empower people to take control of diabetes.  We look forward to working together and learning from you as we bring our technology to those in need in these key markets. Our operations team has provided another highlight in the third quarter as our G6 manufacturing yields reached all-time highs, and our warranty rates reached all-time lows.  Those are the metrics that lead to the margin improvements that we've seen and reflect countless hours of work from our talented employees. And finally, our R&D team continues to innovate with several updates to our sensor pipeline, as well as our leadership in data and software solutions.  The two FDA clearances this quarter are a testament to those efforts, and a nice validation of the strategy that we've discussed to leverage software as a competitive advantage and a key area of investment.  As Sean mentioned at the start of the call, we've invited Jake Leach, our Chief Technology Officer, to join us for the Q&A portion of the call in order to address any questions around these clearances, and our product innovation. I would now like to open the call up for Q&A. Sean.\nSean Christensen : Thank you, Kevin, as a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only 1 question at this time, and then reenter the queue if necessary. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nQuen Blackford :   And our first question comes from Jeff Johnson, from Baird, go ahead Jeff.\nJeff Johnson : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. I know we focus so much on T1 and attempt to T2 most of the time, but I wanted to ask this time maybe on the non-intensive in the pre -diabetes market. I guess I'm wondering more than anything, your latest thoughts on how big those 2 markets could be over the next year or 2.  Especially with so many, we see all these behavioral services popping up with levels and super sapiens and others in prediabetes, and obviously level too, and some of the others on the commercial side.  It feels like you're real-time API and your app and app approvals would be helpful for some of those programs. So just how do you see those 2 markets developing in the short run, 1 to 2 years in your market share in those 2 areas, maybe over the next couple of years as well? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer : Thank you Jeff. This is Kevin. I'll take that one. We think those markets can develop nicely. We have some work to do on the product labeling side and some work to do with the FDA as we migrate down that path and we've had some of those discussions. But the results are spectacular as we've seen people use this product.  In fact, we recently got an email from a position, again, this isn't the type 2 world non-intensive but was telling us about a recent experience with a patient who had gone from an A1C in the 12s down to no medication to an A1C of 5.5 or something like that. It works there or it's also very much on the metabolic front-end general.  Anybody who wears a CGM and watches that data, and particularly if you set those lines narrow between like 7120, if you go above the 120 Mark, you ask yourself what you aid. You can usually figure out and go back to something that that you could do different. The effects of exercise, the effects of poor sleep, the effect of stress of an earnings call, can all be demonstrated in CGM graphs. I think it's a wonderful market opportunity.  The data has to be presented properly. That's where the live API and the approvals we talked about today come in. The API is a quick way to get there and Jake knows the technical stuff better than me, but the API also requires a person to run a DexCom app and the other app. With the other, the app and app module that we talked about today, some of these larger programs that again like Level two with United Health Group, you have one app experience.  With like a DexCom button or a DexCom experience right in the middle of it. So if you are branding a wellness situation and really want that to be your focal point, we can reside in that app and you can have that experience. We think both solutions, they offer speed, but they also offer different experiences and then we'll pick the partners we want to work with on both sides, those that have the best need for one versus the other.  So we're excited , we're very excited for these markets and it's why we getting part of our long-term strategy. But we need the technology to get there and our product pipeline truly supports going there over time.\nQuen Blackford : Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Go ahead, Robbie.\nRobbie Marcus : Hi, this is actually Lillian on for Robbie. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk briefly about dynamics that you're seeing in Europe right now. You guys had a great quarter there. So any tangible stories of success from the increased page in access efforts that you've implemented over the last few months. Any call on that you could share would be helpful. Thanks.\nKevin Sayer : Sure. Yes, and thanks for the question. What you see in Europe, and certainly it's really in all the markets we've gone in with our access strategy as we moved into various countries and obviously exchange price for access to populations that we historically haven't been able to get to.  What you see in the quarter, I think we talked a little bit about on the call is; it was a record revenue quarter in most of our international markets, so I think you see it playing through on the revenue front. Think you saw a 46% organic growth rate outside the U.S., which again another incredibly strong quarter, fueled by a lot of the access that we've been able to create, and then you look at the new patient growth.  It's another record quarter for new patient adds in this quarter. Again, all pointing to some of the access that we've created outside the U.S.. I think some of the examples I think we talked a little bit about them publicly last quarter with Canada, for example, in multiple different provinces, allowing us access through those publicly reimburse channels. And I think in those channels you are seeing just that, a lot of people had now have the access to DexCom CGM technology\nJereme Sylvain : And they're taking advantage of that. So we'll continue to expect that to play through it. It's why we ultimately made the decision to do it. And I think you've seen it play through in the financial results and our expectation as you continue to see a play through over the long haul.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Go ahead, Danielle.\nDanielle Antalffy : Good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Congrats on a really strong quarter. Jeremy, just a question for you. You guys have been investing pretty significantly in direct consumer. Marketing, and ramping up the sales force initiatives around primary care physician.  I'm wondering if you can talk now we're three quarters into this -- sort of more concerted effort in the U.S., and whether we can really talk about how you are seeing a return on that investment as far as incremental new patient adds and maybe just where we are from a primary care physician coverage perspective. Thanks so much.\nKevin Sayer : Sure. Absolutely. So where we sit today and we talked a little bit about it last Quarter, but I want to reiterate it is, you know, in the U.S., we've doubled our covering prescriber coverage over the past 18 months. And so what I mean by that is the amount of physicians that are writing DexCom scripts has doubled in 18 months.  That's an a testament to the work that's being done by the U.S. commercial team, which has been fueled by multiple things, certainly direct-to-consumer advertising, doubling the size of the sales force. Those all really play into folks adopting the technology.\nJereme Sylvain : Just a couple of tangible things which I think are helpful to see again, another record quarter for new patient adds, I think you can see that playing through and in many ways that's driven by the sales force. So you see that continued momentum, I would say the one thing that we have noticed that hasn't prevented us from being at completely full effectiveness is some of the impacts of the Delta variant.  I think that's probably the only thing that we've seen that's been a challenge, and that's just getting access to some of these offices when you're no longer seeing folks in person. And so you've seen a lot of positions opening up and those locations we're doing incredibly well. So there's more to work through and that's a function of just navigating through these COVID landscapes more than anything else.\nJereme Sylvain : So I think in short, you're seeing the performance, you're seeing the growth, seeing the new patient adds and we've ramped up very nicely. It's been an incredible year for us thus far. I'm very bullish on what it means for next year. So I think that's really the feedback thus far and again, as we get more and more data, we'll continue to share it as it becomes available.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Matthew Blackman from Stifel. Go ahead, Matthew.\nMatthew Blackman : Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about the G6 rollout in Japan, Is there any commentary on early trends there? Could you also just remind us the sizing of the incremental opportunity in Japan and how meaningful or contribute do you think it could be to either worldwide growth OUS growth, however you want to frame it as we move into 2022? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer : This is Kevin. You were early on in that launch with our partner Terumo. We've got some good traction, but literally with launch happening in earlier this summer, we're in a position of educating physicians, getting examples out there, really teaching people about our product. We think overtime that Japan market could be a very good one for us.  While there's not a tremendous amount of type 1 diabetes, there's also -- there is a large amount of type 2 diabetes. If we can get across that broad spectrum, with our product offerings, we can see this being one of our -- certainly one of our top 8 markets, possibly even a top 4 or 5 in the world as time goes on.  We also know from a technological perspective that physicians we've spoken with are very bullish on the performance of our product. And tremendously value the accuracy and precision of what we do, and the connectivity and all of those things.  So we believe we have the right system for the market, but we are in early phases right now. And just to give you, I know you asked for the size of the market, that's a market of around three to 400 thousand intensively managed patients across type one and type two. So at the large market with a lot of folks, a smaller prevalence of T1, but obviously a market that can be an incredible Landing spot for us and that space.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Margaret Cansol(ph), from William Blair. Go ahead, Margaret.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. The question is a little bit more of a theme and an expansion maybe on some of the partnerships that you referenced in just getting a better sense around how many of your patients out today, for example, may come from these partnerships.  And when you talk about expanding them, is that enough form of covered lives or is it something else? And that is just as a follow-on, since shakes on the call, I guess, the products and subscription services that you guys may offer these partnerships.  How do those evolve, I guess over time and could that potentially accelerate some of the capabilities that deck Tom offers are the new products that they offer away from pure technology that you've been in the past towards some of these other software or other potential offerings you have. Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain : Sure. Yes. So let me start with maybe the financials side and how that migrates over time. And then Jake's obviously who will take you through the technical aspect of it. And why we're so excited about it. So today these partnerships are a combination of expanding TAM and expanding people that would want to access CGM technology over time.  And today it's in the form of sensors. But over time, and as we've demonstrated the couple other software features, we've obviously added over the past, 6 months or so. Software can be a part of that package.  And so we're really -- the monetization of that will come over time. Today is about how we get as many folks as possible on sensors to realize the value of CGM. So that's how we expand it, Jake, maybe you could take it through just kind of the general theme of, of where we're going in that space.\nJake Leach: Yeah, sure. Jeremy. Thanks for the question. So really the way we think about it is that the technology that we're bringing in the market through this software features is really about providing unique experiences for customer segments. And so if you think about the type 1 segment or the type 2 segment non-intensive.  You really -- you're solving different types of problems in those and so what these Software tools such as our lives API provide is a way for our partners to serve those needs with seed DexCom, CGM, and a connection to our product, the real-time API is a real advancement in our cloud strategy. And we're really excited about the list of partners that are working to integrate that into their systems to provide their customers with unique experiences.\nQuen Blackford : Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Go ahead Matthew.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien : Thanks and thanks for taking my question. So a lot of moving parts here and I'm not sure if I'm doing the math right, but I'm getting like $60 to $70 million of a pricing headwind this quarter. And I'm not sure what the distributor conversion if that's right or not. I guess I'm just asking, is -- is that about right? Are we seeing a little bit more of the pricing headwind this quarter than we've seen over the last couple.  So we'll see maybe a little less next year getting pulled forward with the 21. And then the -- and the reason I'm asking is that, the increase sequentially from Q3 to Q4 is a little bit below trend line, is that because you're expecting more on the pricing headwinds to be seen here in '21 versus '22? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain : Yes. So there's a couple of pieces, so I'll first and foremost reiterate the total pricing expectation for the year, the 250 million is still the expectation if anything, we might come a little bit light on that, but that still is the expectation. So then the pricing in Q3 was generally in line with prior quarters. A little bit elevated, but it's not a material step change, and that's a function of some of those OUS contracts kicking in.  So really, that's where we come from a pricing perspective. So it's not necessarily pulling anything in. We've often talked about 2022 being relatively similar to 2021. And we're still on that trajectory. So I wouldn't necessarily expect any of that. To your question on how Q4 plays out in the guide and doing the math there.  And you're doing the math, right. One of the things we're mindful of, and there's really two pieces to it as you think about it, there's the piece we talked about a little bit earlier, which is the delta variant and getting into new primary care offices and making sure that we're seeing that over time before we count on it.  So that's the first piece of it and we're mindful of that. And then the second piece of it is as more and more of our product is fulfilled through the pharmacy, the historical trends over time you're going to see start to migrate just a little bit. You saw it start this year in Q1.  If you look back to Q1, our sequential pullback from prior year Q4 into Q1 was a bit muted, and you're going to see the same thing in this Q4, which it means as more and more goes to the pharmacy, you no longer have folks in the DME space than all of them have the high-deductible health plans were folks are maximizing benefits at the end of the year.  So we expect a little bit less seasonality as we progress. And in turn, we expect a little seasonality in Q1 of next year. So that's what you're reading into. That's ultimately what comes through in the guidance. So you're doing the math, right. But those are some of the expectations that went into it.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Travis Steve from Barclays. Go ahead Travis.\nTravis Hayes: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, just a follow-up on the distributor. It sounds like the revenue impact this quarter it was 13 million all in the offline and just curious how to model that going forward is at about 13 million a quarter for three more quarters. And then it gets into the base and how to think about like is there a pricing benefit here without the distributor margin. Just a little more color on the distributor acquisition If you all.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. So we'll -- so of pricing. We don't necessarily break down the pricing USO, U.S. and the overall number. And so at the end of the day, we're on the trajectory of the total Company we talked about. And so obviously guys will do the math, but at the end of the day, we're on that same trajectory.  In terms of your question on the distributor. With the impact of the distributor acquisition on growth in the quarter in our CGM business, it rounds to 0%. It's because there was 2 months in the quarter, and that markup on the margin in the distributor market is relatively small. The question is, well, why do you and what do you it, and what -- it's our ability to control, penetrating deeper into these markets.  And that's ultimately why we do it. It's not try to get a margin uplift. It's actually to try to control investment. We're a Company that has cash on the Balance Sheet. We're willing to invest in these markets. And we want to continue to invest in these markets. So as we take them direct, the goal has been to reinvest in make sure that we're driving adoption.  So the impact of the distributor really nominal on our organic growth rate like I said, it rounds to 0. So the 28% is the organic growth rate even including that. So hopefully, that helps you around the acquisition. There isn't much there that changes the results this quarter.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Go ahead, Matt.\nMatt Taylor : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping you could give me more color on how things are going in the primary care channel. Could you give us any sense for how the sales force is maturing, how productive they are and if there's more to go there?\nKevin Sayer : Yeah, this is Kevin. I'll take that. There's still more to go, but it is going very well. Our targets are going very well as far as those we've call on, we've also learned there are some we have not had on the target list and we're expanding that coverage as well. We've had numerous situations where it's taken our person several attempts to get into an office, but once they get in and once we get a person on a DexCom, their responses so good based on the quality of the product that we get more.  But it is a progressive effort, and it doesn't -- we don't walk in and all of sudden get, hey, here's 50 new patients this month. It takes a little time and we have to bet a lot of credibility. But the primary carrier audience, particularly with those on insulin, it's gone very well so far, but it is a process and it does take some time.\nQuen Blackford : Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch, from Citi. Go head Joanne.\nJoanne Wuensch : Thank you very much for taking my questions. It seems to me like the increasing clinical evidence that you are building is going to really help the Type-2 population. But could you give us sort of an update on where you think or what you think you'll need to get into the non-intensive type juice.\nKevin Sayer : Yeah. This Kevin, I'll take that. We've taken several pronged approach to get in there and we're not going to deviate from that approach. We're working with healthcare professionals who are prescribing product for a non-intensive type  right now and getting great outcomes.  We work with the payer network, for example, the level 2 program at UnitedHealth, that produce some very good results for them and very visible in their marketing materials, in their efforts. The programs and with the technologies Jake outlined that we got approved today, the app in the App and the API interfaces that will be great for partners because they do wanna control that experience for patients and ultimately getting to people directly.  We've been very successful on our DTC campaigns for the intensive insulin users, there will come a time when we will be able to go direct to those consumers in the type 2 NIIT as we call it.  Non-Intensive insulin therapy or non-insulin therapy, get to these guys as well, and we have a high level of confidence in the products we're designing and the things we're planning combined with the ability of our team to reach these markets once we turn them loose, once we have the opportunity to do so. So we'll go through all the steps, will continue on all four fronts. We're not going to back off on one of them.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley, go the Cecilia.\nCecilia Furlong: Thank you for taking our question. I wanted to ask just on Gross Margin as you think about 4Q, what is implied with your updated guidance step-down, but just what you're factoring in from the International access component versus G7 initial launch, not quite being at scale and how we should think about the trajectory heading into 2022. Thank you.\nKevin Sayer : Sure. So the gross margin in Q4, we do expect to take a bit of a step back. Some of it is the international access as that ramps up. And the other piece to your point is the launch of G7 and turning on all of the machine, the depreciation and therefore the yields. A majority of that is going to be the G7 launch. And the reason why is we're not at full capacity at that point.  Now, once we get to full capacity, there's no reason why we don't get back to our long-term gross margin guides, and we'll get into 2022 when we get there. But there's nothing strong actually in those lines that would prevent us from meeting what we had talked about from our long-term gross margin guide. There may be ebbs and flows quarter-by-quarter as we ramp up.  But I don't expect there to be any issues there. So if you're asking the question well, how I would weigh the two most of the impact is upon the launch of G7. And in turning on those machines and the depreciation associated with it. As we get into 2022 and volumes start to build on those machines and you're able to absorb those fixed costs. There's nothing structurally that can't get us back to the gross margin profiles that we've set for an organization.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Jason Bedford, from Raymond James, go head Jason.\nJayson Bedford: Hi, this Povin (ph) for Jason and I have 2 quick questions here. First, will we see G7 clinical data before U.S. approval? And the second one is how close are you guys to get into the 75% of commercial payers into the pharmacy channel?\nJake Leach: So thanks for the question Jake, so the -- we presented actually earlier this year, we presented at ATTD G7 data. Joining a MARD of sub 9% and very strong  accuracy, better than G6, in fact, so we're very excited and happy with the result of the U.S. pivotal. And we'll be releasing that in the future. Yeah. So now that you've seen that data, I think you have a feel for it. And obviously, that data -- as these -- as more products launch over time, you'll get access to it. But I think some folks ask, well, how do I know what it's going to look like before, there is public -- data available at ATD that should set North Star.  In terms of the transition, the migration in the pharmacy, we talked about this glide path from approximately 50% turning into 2021 or at the end of 2020 into really 75% by the end of 2022, we're on that glide path right now. And so we're making headway, we haven't given a specific update as a percentage but as your charting that course, we're right where we'd be expected and right where you'd expect from a linear transition over time. So hopefully that helps.\nQuen Blackford : Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Go ahead, Larry.\nNathan Travis: Hi, this is Nathan Travis call for Larry. Thank you for taking the question. Can you just provide us an update on how you're thinking about CGM for hospitals and gestational diabetes? Thanks.\nJake Leach: Yes, this is Jake, so let's start on the hospital first. So the way we are thinking about that is that, you really with the accuracy and reliability that we have built into the G6 and G7 systems. That it's a great CGM platform to then build a purpose built hospital products. So we're in the early stages of understanding what is the exact CGM that meets the needs in a hospital. We've seen good success with G6 under the times COVID used in the hospital.  It is really serving a need, but it's not exactly the right workflow for the our hospitals. And so what we want to do is better understand how rebuild a CGM that really meets the needs of that segment, On the pregnancy side, we're very excited about the building in pregnancy functionality and providing information that's important for expecting mothers into the G7 product. And so that's part of our roadmap and we're actively working on building that into the G7.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Go ahead Steven.\nSteven Lichtman : Thank you. Hi, guys. Kevin, you mentioned earlier all the work you continue to do on non-intensive with partners, payers, and collecting data. Wondering what your latest thoughts are on potential revenue per patient in that population or utilization overall for the non-intensive. Thanks.\nKevin Sayer : At this point in time, the total revenue amount per year is still something we model out in a number of cases. What we've learned and what the data that we've seen most recently supports and we'll continue to talk about is continuous use of the system provides much better healthcare outcomes than intermittent or  that the things had patients learn with this technology, having that feedback full time provides a much better outcome with respect to the long-term revenue model.  And again, I'm speculating a bit here, but I'll just repeat what I said to the team internally, we're solving a much different problem for somebody's not on insulin, it is not a life and death decision for them, so I can see them revenue per patient being lower for this group over time, even in continuous use. But I don't know how much yet.  There will certainly be intermittent use models that might be available and lead to good outcomes. But one of the mistakes that a lot of these programs make in the beginning, is they try and minimize the number of sensors because they're worried about the costs there trying to control when in reality the benefits that these patients and these customers use the system to get are derived from CGM data.  So we have to balance those things and balance that against our current business model as well but we do believe it's going to be a very good population and there's -- there was long a belief that all these patients will want to wear it all the time. Now, they do. They very much enjoy the data and really like knowing where they are. That has not been a problem at all.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Ravi Misra from Berenberg. Go ahead, Ravi.\nRavi Misra: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So I guess I'll use my one question on New Zealand, Australia distributor. Just curious, how quickly can you basically get through this I guess, inorganic revenue in terms of the impact of guidance like is there still kind of be non-CGM revenue that we assume and Quarter 4 and maybe help us think about, I guess what the market size that you think you're able to kind of go after with this acquisition or do you need to do more in this arena, this country or continent space to really get access to the population? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer : Sure, I can take that. So when we acquired the distributor, the distributor had multiple different product lines. They have sales reps that cover these multiple different product lines. And ultimately a distributor is about people and it's an incredible group of people. And so the key here is making sure we keep everybody together. So we'll stay in that line.  What we tried to identify for you, is the contributions to the overall guide in basis points. And so in our guide, we talked about a 100 basis points on the full year. You'll do the math and figure out what the approximate impact is in Q4, and I think you'll have a pretty good feel for it. We'll make sure that we isolate it out over the long haul so that you're able to identify what is and what isn't out there. So I think you can feel comfortable there,\nJake Leach: Provided material in terms of the actual acquisition itself, and being able to get into the market. This was -- this is a group of folks who have done an incredible job with CGM adoption in that, in that country. And so when we when we get into these countries, we want to make sure one, we have the team, we make sure that they're eight.  There's nothing in their way from continuing to develop CGM awareness and developed CGM adoption. So there's nothing that prevents us under the structure. The only thing we mentioned in terms of investment is very similar to the way you've thought about our organization in the U.S. We know that investment in DTC and in sales reps where it makes sense and then sampling, and all of the things that we've put in place make great sense in other markets.  You've seen us do some of that in Europe, and certainly we've done some in Canada and we expect to do more of that and we take it direct, we can do a little bit more of that. And so that's really what we're talking about. So there's nothing structurally that prevents us from taking the acquisition and continuing to proliferate CGM adoption in those countries.\nKevin Sayer : Yeah, this is Kevin, I would just add to that. One of the reasons we do things of this nature, take a look at our direct business in Canada. The wins we've just had with the provinces and reimbursement there. With our financial muscle at the corporate level, we can take much more risk than a distributor could on their own.  We view this investment in Australia and New Zealand as one where we're going to be able to go after broader market increased access reimbursement and really make an impact. Those -- this team needed our muscle to do that financially, and we needed their talent to do it as well so it works for both of us.\nQuen Blackford : Our next question comes from Maury Kibo. Go ahead, Maury from BTIG.\nMaury Kibo: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Spending a little bit of time on the DexCom one site, it strikes me as a very consumer-friendly website. And I'm just curious whether this is sort of a glimpse for the future. I know it's been launched into some Eastern European countries, but is this a model that you would look at in terms of flexible pricing and subscription plans and bulk order discounts? Is this something that's a preview of the broader appeal of CGM, maybe into pre -diabetes and consumer markets?\nKevin Sayer : Yes, it's Kevin, this is a very important launch for us, is the first time we've launched their product on a new software platform and had a new product launch. We're in a position now volume and manufacturing wise that we want to get this product to as many people as we can.  And what DexCom one represents is really an opportunity where we can get DexCom technology into a geography, easier than we could if we went through our traditional means with our G Series products. So we're offering this and -- yeah as you talked about, flexible pricing plans, subscription models, and things of that nature, to get this product to this patient group.  It definitely can be a precursor of things we can do in the future, to take advantage of the scale that we've created within the business with our ability to manufacture more. And again, while the website is very easy to use, I assure you the App that Jake 's team and our marketing team has developed is every bit as easy to use as the website.  This truly is a step up for us from our product experience. And that we'll evaluate those opportunities over time where we have a market, where we can increase our volumes and gain more traction with this type of product offering rather than our traditional G-series, we will explore that.\nQuen Blackford : Our next question comes from Josh  from Cowen. Go ahead, Josh.\nNeal: Hi, this is actually Neal (ph) on for Josh. Thanks for taking the question. And we've had some consultants recently talk about the potential for monitoring other analytes. I was just wondering if you can or maybe share any updates there in terms of any development plans or program for extending monitoring to  outside of glucose, like Ketones?\nJake Leach: Sure. Yes. The wearable platform that we've developed with the electro -chemical sensors that can be extended to other analytes. And we do have active research programs within DexCom and also with some of our university colleagues that are researching other analytes that we could use on our platform. Today, we're not talking about exactly which ones, but we do feel that this platform can be extended to multiple analytes and provide more value around the CGM component.\nQuen Blackford : Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone, from Jefferies. Go ahead, Anthony.\nAnthony Petrone: Great. Thanks and hope everyone is doing well. Two quick questions. One would be on supply chain constraints. I'm just wondering how that is expected to play out into 2022, hearing a lot about inflationary upward pressure on cost of goods sold. So wondering how that's playing out for DexCom, what the offsets are. And then as we look into the 05 launch, just maybe an update on what percent of existing Omnipod users are currently not users of DexCom solutions? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer : Sure. So all go ahead and take the inflationary and supply chain. So I think everybody's, --nobody is immune to certain products and certain areas that do have pressure based on supply chain, supply and demand. One of the things I think our team has done, there's two pieces of it. One, do you have enough product and two, can you manage the cost? And I think our team has done an incredible job in lining up the product.  Now, that doesn't mean everybody's out of the woods that everybody has got supply chains and actually running through. But this team got ahead of it very early and has been working collaboratively, with all of our suppliers well in advance to make sure that we're properly communicating the value of our product and making sure that we're working with them to secure supply.  And that's ongoing, but that's work that's been done well in advance of everybody else jumping on us, we're very proud of that team. In terms of the inflationary measures, we're in a bit of a unique environment. There have been absolutely inflationary measures, but we're also making a lot more product.  And so you get economies of scale and purchasing power which offset some of the challenges associated with inflation. So our expectation is we're able to navigate both of those, and it will not impact our longer-term gross margins because of that nature. So hopefully I answered your question. Maybe I could turn it over to -- well actually, I can answer the Omnipod question. With Pod 5, there are a decent amount of folks using it.  There are some studies out there. I don't want to quote them just because I don't know how accurate they are. We generally have a good feel for it, although we haven't put it out there publicly, we can let Omnipod do that if they want to. But we do know once Omnipod 5 is launched and the integration associated with DexCom it could provide a catalyst certainly for us.  The one thing we will say is, we continue to say it all the time, is CGM first. We do believe that a lot of folks do come to CGM and then ultimately could choose to go onto an integrated system, and most folks that do get onto our product today now are MDI, and so a lot of those are out there. That all being said, another AID system\nSean Christensen : With one is novel as, as Omnipod I think is certainly something that's interesting and for patients that like patch pump, I think this is an incredible opportunity for folks to get on that platform.\nQuen Blackford : Our next question comes from Kyle Rose, from Canaccord. Go ahead, Kyle.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to maybe ask another question on DexCom you've talked a couple of times about the patient experience being different and having a different app.  But I understand that the software\u2019s obviously completely different on the e-commerce side, but maybe help us understand just what specifically is different from a patient facing perspective, with DexCom ONE versus what we've seen historically with the G6 and the previous generation products. Thank you.\nJake Leach: Jake, I will take that one. DexCom ONE from the beginning, our intent around the design of that product was to make it simple. And so that kind of flows through, as you mentioned, the e-commerce experience, but into the App, the mobile App itself. It's a new, --completely new App architecture for us, so it's a new piece of software.  And the first part that users will see that's quite different is the on-boarding module. We basically spent a lot of time studying human factors and how users use the products, particularly in those -- when they're first learning how to use it. So what onboard module does is really walks them through a simple process on how to get up and running quickly on their CGM.  The other thing about it, that's different than G6 is that has a simplified alert scheme. So it doesn't have some of the more sophisticated predictive alerts, the G6 does it, it has a very simple easy-to-use, approachable alerts scheme.  The other thing that we added is with our current G6 system, a lot of the data over time statistic are built into our clarity software with Dexcom ONE we've actually incorporated that into the Dexcom ONE absolute typical statistics like average glucose time and range estimated A1C, that's all built into the single Dexcom ONE up.  And then finally in that vein of simplicity, there's no AID connectivity for Dexcom ONE, it also doesn't have the share remote monitoring features, so it's really about bringing a simple CGM product to people who have never had access to Dexcom ONE CGM and haven't experienced life without fingersticks.\nQuen Blackford : And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Go ahead, Chris.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. I want to take you back on that last question. I think that that answer was constructive in terms of some of the differences here in, and so it leads me to wonder who you're targeting specifically with this platform. It sounds like with the loss of sharing, and predictive alerts this is probably not going to be a type 1 or pediatric product.  Do you see this as a way to get more into the type 2 population specifically, is it a way to approach some emerging market territories where reimbursement may not be in place. We just love some thoughts on, where you see this going over time, which this product's really for? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer : It's all of those things. Certainly, you look at the 4 countries that you launched in, they're not huge countries but they're markets where we've never been before. So with the e-commerce platform and the creative pricing structures we have for subscription plans and things of that nature, it gives a group of people access to our technology they've never had it before.  And as far as the not sharing and not connecting today, ID systems you're exactly right. It -- is a lower level of technology with respect to connectivity, than what we offer and so it is targeted different people.  Certainly will have access to more type 2 patients, and access to insulin users. But again, some of these geographic play in countries where there isn't anything. We felt this simpler solution is a better product offer out of the gate, than the other one. And then we'll evaluate over time what products we offer where. So you are right on point with pretty much all your observation.\nQuen Blackford : And we have no more questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to Kevin Sayer for final comments.\nKevin Sayer : Thank you. And thank you, everyone for your questions and continued interest and support at DexCom. We've once again reported a number of important developments to position DexCom for the future on top of outstanding financial performance and continued growth. Going to wax a bit philosophical today, but my father passed away in late 2020, but he never missed an earnings call. Our routine after the calls was very simple.  He'd call me up and he'd say, this is what you guys were trying to say. And he was pretty much always right on point. So preparing my closing remarks today, let me reiterate what we're trying to tell you. Leveraging growth continue, our 28% revenue growth achieved through sensor volume growth in excess of 40% demonstrates a continued commitment and talent of our commercial organization.  Profitability continues to improve as well, yet we remain mindful of the investments we need to make in the future. Our global access strategy is working. We continue to achieve the numbers we've achieved while we've expanded access to our product globally through strategically shifting our customers to channels which result in reduced revenue per customer annually and yet margins have increased.  Next, G7 is on schedule and it's coming. All of the efforts related G7 are moving at a frenetic pace around here. I've never seen our people so engaged in a single-minded purpose. And finally, our software development and data platform commitments are going to be critical in the future and you saw a big steps this quarter. We spent a great deal of time talking about software\u2019s in differentiator today and we haven't over the past several months.  You're beginning to see -- you're seeing the beginning of a great change with Dexcom ONE and the data sharing. And experience enhancing technologies recently approved by the FDA also demonstrate this. It's only the beginning. Our long term focus has always been for the data generated from our devices to be consumed in a way that really makes an impact on people's lives on their healthcare in general. Thanks and everybody have a great day.\nQuen Blackford : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean. And thank you, everyone for joining us. Today we reported another strong quarter for DexCom with third-quarter revenue growth of 30% compared to the third quarter of 2020, and 28% growth on an organic basis. This revenue growth rate represents continued momentum per DexCom CGM adoption around the world as we once again achieved a record quarter of new customer growth.  The third quarter also saw several strategic accomplishments across our teams that laid the foundation for our future growth opportunities. In the U.S., we received FDA clearance for 2 key software solutions that continue to differentiate our connected products from those of our competitors and position us as a partner of choice across our healthcare and wearable's ecosystem.  First in July, we received FDA clearance for our real-time API. For those of you who are not aware an API is the tool that allows one app to connect with another app. prior to this clearance, our customers and clinicians could only utilize our retrospective API, which integrated DexCom data into third-party apps on a three-hour delayed basis.  We believe that by putting the power of choice at our user's fingertips with Reopine data, we can help ease the daily burden of diabetes management and significantly improved quality of life for our customers. This tool will be available to partners invited by DexCom. And we already have several that will began the development process to enable real-time displays for their communities.  This includes Garmin. Which became the first partner to launch apps connected to our real-time API 2 weeks ago, bringing DexCom ratings into their portfolio of wearable's and cycling computers? Second, on the heels of the real-time API clearance, we received FDA clearance in August for the DexCom app and app module.  This module was specifically designed for people with non-intensive type 2 diabetes and can directly integrate into another third-party healthcare app. With the integrated DexCom app, it is now even easier for our partners to access and display our CGM data, enabling single app solutions that simplify the experiences for DexCom users.  United Health Group became our first partner to launch the integrated DexCom App and app module in late September, bringing the embedded app into their level 2 diabetes care program. Our connectivity software and data infrastructure solutions are a core strength of DexCom. These two recent FDA clearances reflect the increase investment that we put into software development, and we believe increase our competitive advantages moving forward.  In late September, we also announced the launch of DexCom ONE in four international markets, where we previously had no presence, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. DexCom ONE leverages the G6 hardware platform and a completely redesigned software experience that focuses on simplicity and ease-of-use for our customers.  This is the first product launch in our history that started exclusively through the DexCom e-commerce platform. A platform that has been embraced by our customers in Canada and the UK over the past two years. With the proven performance of our CGM systems, the new software experience and efficient e-commerce solution, and affordable pricing plans.  We believe that DexCom ONE will be an important product for us as we drive the business to where our long term targets. Most importantly, this differentiated product as a key step for us to bring DexCom CGM to significantly more people with diabetes who previously did not have access to our products.  Early feedback around the product has been very favorable and we look forward to seeing the full results from these launches as we leverage for the full breadth of our expanding product portfolio to achieve our 2020 Investor Day Goal of tripling our international addressable market by the end of 2023.  Building from the strength of our mobile trial that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in June, investigators published the results from the extension phase of the trial in diabetes care during the third quarter. In this extension phase, we re-randomized the population who are initially on CGM to see if the benefits would be retained for those who stayed on CGM compared to those who returned to Finger-Stick monitoring.  Once again, the results were clear. Those who stayed on our G6 systems, maintained greater time and range improvements over the 6 month extension phase compared to those who did not. The results confirmed that further significant population of people with type II diabetes on basal insulin, there is significant benefit in continuous CGM use to optimize therapy and support behavior modifications. Our teams are working hard to leverage the conclusions from mobile into greater access to our technology for people with type two diabetes. And this is just one area in which we are building the foundation for our long-term growth. We are advancing our pilot efforts with United Health's level 2.  Teladoc's Lavango per diabetes,  on dual and others. We are generating strong clinical evidence for expanded indications for CGM use in inpatient settings, and for women who are pregnant, we continue to leverage our advantages in connectivity by gaining new customers and progressing our pipeline of solutions with our leading insulin delivery partners.  Finally, we continue to advance our G7 scale up and regulatory efforts during the quarter. We have had excellent communication with our notified body in Europe and believe that we remain on track to begin the launch of our G7 system in the fourth quarter upon receiving CE mark clearance.  In the U.S. we've made great progress in preparation prior regulatory submission, and believe that we are now in the final stages of that effort. We look forward to the comprehensive G7-510K submission, including G7 hardware and full Android and IOS software to the FDA in the next few weeks. As you can see, our teams are working very hard and making great progress to advance our core strategic efforts.  Whether it is in expanding our product portfolio, creating differentiated user experiences, are laying the foundation for new market opportunities that will drive our future growth. So with that said, let me turn it over now to Jeremy for a review of our third quarter financial performance. Jeremy. There are a number of things that we could celebrate and I'd like to take the time now to thank all of the teams at DexCom and specifically highlight a few things that we're proud of. First, to our new DexCom team members in Australia and New Zealand, we are absolutely thrilled to have you with us on our journey to empower people to take control of diabetes.  We look forward to working together and learning from you as we bring our technology to those in need in these key markets. Our operations team has provided another highlight in the third quarter as our G6 manufacturing yields reached all-time highs, and our warranty rates reached all-time lows.  Those are the metrics that lead to the margin improvements that we've seen and reflect countless hours of work from our talented employees. And finally, our R&D team continues to innovate with several updates to our sensor pipeline, as well as our leadership in data and software solutions.  The two FDA clearances this quarter are a testament to those efforts, and a nice validation of the strategy that we've discussed to leverage software as a competitive advantage and a key area of investment.  As Sean mentioned at the start of the call, we've invited Jake Leach, our Chief Technology Officer, to join us for the Q&A portion of the call in order to address any questions around these clearances, and our product innovation. I would now like to open the call up for Q&A. Sean. Thank you Jeff. This is Kevin. I'll take that one. We think those markets can develop nicely. We have some work to do on the product labeling side and some work to do with the FDA as we migrate down that path and we've had some of those discussions. But the results are spectacular as we've seen people use this product.  In fact, we recently got an email from a position, again, this isn't the type 2 world non-intensive but was telling us about a recent experience with a patient who had gone from an A1C in the 12s down to no medication to an A1C of 5.5 or something like that. It works there or it's also very much on the metabolic front-end general.  Anybody who wears a CGM and watches that data, and particularly if you set those lines narrow between like 7120, if you go above the 120 Mark, you ask yourself what you aid. You can usually figure out and go back to something that that you could do different. The effects of exercise, the effects of poor sleep, the effect of stress of an earnings call, can all be demonstrated in CGM graphs. I think it's a wonderful market opportunity.  The data has to be presented properly. That's where the live API and the approvals we talked about today come in. The API is a quick way to get there and Jake knows the technical stuff better than me, but the API also requires a person to run a DexCom app and the other app. With the other, the app and app module that we talked about today, some of these larger programs that again like Level two with United Health Group, you have one app experience.  With like a DexCom button or a DexCom experience right in the middle of it. So if you are branding a wellness situation and really want that to be your focal point, we can reside in that app and you can have that experience. We think both solutions, they offer speed, but they also offer different experiences and then we'll pick the partners we want to work with on both sides, those that have the best need for one versus the other.  So we're excited , we're very excited for these markets and it's why we getting part of our long-term strategy. But we need the technology to get there and our product pipeline truly supports going there over time. Sure. Yes, and thanks for the question. What you see in Europe, and certainly it's really in all the markets we've gone in with our access strategy as we moved into various countries and obviously exchange price for access to populations that we historically haven't been able to get to.  What you see in the quarter, I think we talked a little bit about on the call is; it was a record revenue quarter in most of our international markets, so I think you see it playing through on the revenue front. Think you saw a 46% organic growth rate outside the U.S., which again another incredibly strong quarter, fueled by a lot of the access that we've been able to create, and then you look at the new patient growth.  It's another record quarter for new patient adds in this quarter. Again, all pointing to some of the access that we've created outside the U.S.. I think some of the examples I think we talked a little bit about them publicly last quarter with Canada, for example, in multiple different provinces, allowing us access through those publicly reimburse channels. And I think in those channels you are seeing just that, a lot of people had now have the access to DexCom CGM technology Sure. Absolutely. So where we sit today and we talked a little bit about it last Quarter, but I want to reiterate it is, you know, in the U.S., we've doubled our covering prescriber coverage over the past 18 months. And so what I mean by that is the amount of physicians that are writing DexCom scripts has doubled in 18 months.  That's an a testament to the work that's being done by the U.S. commercial team, which has been fueled by multiple things, certainly direct-to-consumer advertising, doubling the size of the sales force. Those all really play into folks adopting the technology. This is Kevin. You were early on in that launch with our partner Terumo. We've got some good traction, but literally with launch happening in earlier this summer, we're in a position of educating physicians, getting examples out there, really teaching people about our product. We think overtime that Japan market could be a very good one for us.  While there's not a tremendous amount of type 1 diabetes, there's also -- there is a large amount of type 2 diabetes. If we can get across that broad spectrum, with our product offerings, we can see this being one of our -- certainly one of our top 8 markets, possibly even a top 4 or 5 in the world as time goes on.  We also know from a technological perspective that physicians we've spoken with are very bullish on the performance of our product. And tremendously value the accuracy and precision of what we do, and the connectivity and all of those things.  So we believe we have the right system for the market, but we are in early phases right now. And just to give you, I know you asked for the size of the market, that's a market of around three to 400 thousand intensively managed patients across type one and type two. So at the large market with a lot of folks, a smaller prevalence of T1, but obviously a market that can be an incredible Landing spot for us and that space. Yeah, this is Kevin. I'll take that. There's still more to go, but it is going very well. Our targets are going very well as far as those we've call on, we've also learned there are some we have not had on the target list and we're expanding that coverage as well. We've had numerous situations where it's taken our person several attempts to get into an office, but once they get in and once we get a person on a DexCom, their responses so good based on the quality of the product that we get more.  But it is a progressive effort, and it doesn't -- we don't walk in and all of sudden get, hey, here's 50 new patients this month. It takes a little time and we have to bet a lot of credibility. But the primary carrier audience, particularly with those on insulin, it's gone very well so far, but it is a process and it does take some time. Yeah. This Kevin, I'll take that. We've taken several pronged approach to get in there and we're not going to deviate from that approach. We're working with healthcare professionals who are prescribing product for a non-intensive type  right now and getting great outcomes.  We work with the payer network, for example, the level 2 program at UnitedHealth, that produce some very good results for them and very visible in their marketing materials, in their efforts. The programs and with the technologies Jake outlined that we got approved today, the app in the App and the API interfaces that will be great for partners because they do wanna control that experience for patients and ultimately getting to people directly.  We've been very successful on our DTC campaigns for the intensive insulin users, there will come a time when we will be able to go direct to those consumers in the type 2 NIIT as we call it.  Non-Intensive insulin therapy or non-insulin therapy, get to these guys as well, and we have a high level of confidence in the products we're designing and the things we're planning combined with the ability of our team to reach these markets once we turn them loose, once we have the opportunity to do so. So we'll go through all the steps, will continue on all four fronts. We're not going to back off on one of them. Sure. So the gross margin in Q4, we do expect to take a bit of a step back. Some of it is the international access as that ramps up. And the other piece to your point is the launch of G7 and turning on all of the machine, the depreciation and therefore the yields. A majority of that is going to be the G7 launch. And the reason why is we're not at full capacity at that point.  Now, once we get to full capacity, there's no reason why we don't get back to our long-term gross margin guides, and we'll get into 2022 when we get there. But there's nothing strong actually in those lines that would prevent us from meeting what we had talked about from our long-term gross margin guide. There may be ebbs and flows quarter-by-quarter as we ramp up.  But I don't expect there to be any issues there. So if you're asking the question well, how I would weigh the two most of the impact is upon the launch of G7. And in turning on those machines and the depreciation associated with it. As we get into 2022 and volumes start to build on those machines and you're able to absorb those fixed costs. There's nothing structurally that can't get us back to the gross margin profiles that we've set for an organization. At this point in time, the total revenue amount per year is still something we model out in a number of cases. What we've learned and what the data that we've seen most recently supports and we'll continue to talk about is continuous use of the system provides much better healthcare outcomes than intermittent or  that the things had patients learn with this technology, having that feedback full time provides a much better outcome with respect to the long-term revenue model.  And again, I'm speculating a bit here, but I'll just repeat what I said to the team internally, we're solving a much different problem for somebody's not on insulin, it is not a life and death decision for them, so I can see them revenue per patient being lower for this group over time, even in continuous use. But I don't know how much yet.  There will certainly be intermittent use models that might be available and lead to good outcomes. But one of the mistakes that a lot of these programs make in the beginning, is they try and minimize the number of sensors because they're worried about the costs there trying to control when in reality the benefits that these patients and these customers use the system to get are derived from CGM data.  So we have to balance those things and balance that against our current business model as well but we do believe it's going to be a very good population and there's -- there was long a belief that all these patients will want to wear it all the time. Now, they do. They very much enjoy the data and really like knowing where they are. That has not been a problem at all. Sure, I can take that. So when we acquired the distributor, the distributor had multiple different product lines. They have sales reps that cover these multiple different product lines. And ultimately a distributor is about people and it's an incredible group of people. And so the key here is making sure we keep everybody together. So we'll stay in that line.  What we tried to identify for you, is the contributions to the overall guide in basis points. And so in our guide, we talked about a 100 basis points on the full year. You'll do the math and figure out what the approximate impact is in Q4, and I think you'll have a pretty good feel for it. We'll make sure that we isolate it out over the long haul so that you're able to identify what is and what isn't out there. So I think you can feel comfortable there, Yeah, this is Kevin, I would just add to that. One of the reasons we do things of this nature, take a look at our direct business in Canada. The wins we've just had with the provinces and reimbursement there. With our financial muscle at the corporate level, we can take much more risk than a distributor could on their own.  We view this investment in Australia and New Zealand as one where we're going to be able to go after broader market increased access reimbursement and really make an impact. Those -- this team needed our muscle to do that financially, and we needed their talent to do it as well so it works for both of us. Yes, it's Kevin, this is a very important launch for us, is the first time we've launched their product on a new software platform and had a new product launch. We're in a position now volume and manufacturing wise that we want to get this product to as many people as we can.  And what DexCom one represents is really an opportunity where we can get DexCom technology into a geography, easier than we could if we went through our traditional means with our G Series products. So we're offering this and -- yeah as you talked about, flexible pricing plans, subscription models, and things of that nature, to get this product to this patient group.  It definitely can be a precursor of things we can do in the future, to take advantage of the scale that we've created within the business with our ability to manufacture more. And again, while the website is very easy to use, I assure you the App that Jake 's team and our marketing team has developed is every bit as easy to use as the website.  This truly is a step up for us from our product experience. And that we'll evaluate those opportunities over time where we have a market, where we can increase our volumes and gain more traction with this type of product offering rather than our traditional G-series, we will explore that. Sure. So all go ahead and take the inflationary and supply chain. So I think everybody's, --nobody is immune to certain products and certain areas that do have pressure based on supply chain, supply and demand. One of the things I think our team has done, there's two pieces of it. One, do you have enough product and two, can you manage the cost? And I think our team has done an incredible job in lining up the product.  Now, that doesn't mean everybody's out of the woods that everybody has got supply chains and actually running through. But this team got ahead of it very early and has been working collaboratively, with all of our suppliers well in advance to make sure that we're properly communicating the value of our product and making sure that we're working with them to secure supply.  And that's ongoing, but that's work that's been done well in advance of everybody else jumping on us, we're very proud of that team. In terms of the inflationary measures, we're in a bit of a unique environment. There have been absolutely inflationary measures, but we're also making a lot more product.  And so you get economies of scale and purchasing power which offset some of the challenges associated with inflation. So our expectation is we're able to navigate both of those, and it will not impact our longer-term gross margins because of that nature. So hopefully I answered your question. Maybe I could turn it over to -- well actually, I can answer the Omnipod question. With Pod 5, there are a decent amount of folks using it.  There are some studies out there. I don't want to quote them just because I don't know how accurate they are. We generally have a good feel for it, although we haven't put it out there publicly, we can let Omnipod do that if they want to. But we do know once Omnipod 5 is launched and the integration associated with DexCom it could provide a catalyst certainly for us.  The one thing we will say is, we continue to say it all the time, is CGM first. We do believe that a lot of folks do come to CGM and then ultimately could choose to go onto an integrated system, and most folks that do get onto our product today now are MDI, and so a lot of those are out there. That all being said, another AID system It's all of those things. Certainly, you look at the 4 countries that you launched in, they're not huge countries but they're markets where we've never been before. So with the e-commerce platform and the creative pricing structures we have for subscription plans and things of that nature, it gives a group of people access to our technology they've never had it before.  And as far as the not sharing and not connecting today, ID systems you're exactly right. It -- is a lower level of technology with respect to connectivity, than what we offer and so it is targeted different people.  Certainly will have access to more type 2 patients, and access to insulin users. But again, some of these geographic play in countries where there isn't anything. We felt this simpler solution is a better product offer out of the gate, than the other one. And then we'll evaluate over time what products we offer where. So you are right on point with pretty much all your observation. Thank you. And thank you, everyone for your questions and continued interest and support at DexCom. We've once again reported a number of important developments to position DexCom for the future on top of outstanding financial performance and continued growth. Going to wax a bit philosophical today, but my father passed away in late 2020, but he never missed an earnings call. Our routine after the calls was very simple.

Profitability continues to improve as well, yet we remain mindful of the investments we need to make in the future. Our global access strategy is working.

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $650 million compared to 501 million for the third quarter of 2020, representing growth of 30% on a reported basis and 28% on an organic basis.  In late July, we were proud to complete the acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand. With this acquisition, we began generating revenue for certain non-CGM healthcare product which we have categorizes inorganic growth for the quarter. This non-CGM distribution revenue contributed approximately 2% to our reported growth for the third quarter.  The transition from distributor markets to direct sales is one of several important strategic initiatives that we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day as we seek to significantly grow our international presence, We believe a larger direct international footprint will give us greater control to leverage our marketing strength, invest in accelerating our growth, and ensure that the direction of these core markets is aligned to our strategic interests.  In terms of financial impact of the third quarter acquisition, we expect the transaction to be approximately neutral to our operating margin for the full year as it was in the third quarter. U.S. revenue totaled 490 million in the third quarter compared to 399 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing growth of 23%.  We continue to see good momentum in the U.S. where we are benefiting from the increased market access and field presence that we have enabled over the past year. New customer growth remains strong across all segments of the population, including people with type 1 diabetes, intensively managed people with type 2 diabetes, where we have significantly expanded market access in the past year, and even early adopters in the type 2 non-intensive population.  Our international business grew 57% in the third quarter, totaling $161 million. Excluding the impact of non-CGM distribution revenue generated by our acquisition of our distributor in Australia, and New Zealand, growth for international business was 46% in the third quarter. We continue to see very encouraging growth across the board in our International Markets, with a majority of our markets delivering record sales in the Third Quarter.  Although it is still early, we believe that our strategic groups to broaden access in several markets have been very successful thus far and have left us well positioned to expand our growth profile internationally. And you see that reflected current quarter results. Along those lines are global volume growth in the third quarter remained strong, exceeding 40% for the Quarter.  This is well above our 28% organic revenue growth rate can supports the momentum behind DexCom CGM globally. As we aggressively seek to advance access to our technology and drive better health outcomes and quality of life for people with diabetes. As Kevin mentioned, the launch of DexCom one adds to our product portfolio and provides another key element of our strategy to expand access to CGM globally.  As we continue to scale our business in conjunction with our ambitious plans for customer growth, we are creating tools that allow us to serve our growing base in an efficient manner. And the use of our e-commerce platform for the initial DexCom ONE launch is a good example of that focus.  Our third quarter gross profit was $446.9 million or 68.7% of revenue compared to 68% of revenue in the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year gross margin expansion is an impressive result, especially when you factor in our strategic efforts this year to drive greater mix through the pharmacy channel and expanded international access.  This is a credit to our teams who have innovated and embraced change where necessary to drive efficiencies and position us to maximize our strategic opportunities. We continue to demonstrate the ability to leverage both our manufacturing operations and R&D teams to be ever more efficient in the delivery of our products. Operating expenses were 323.1 million for Q3 2021 compared to 245.7 million in Q3 2020. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat year-over-year as we offset investments in software development G7 scale-up, and our expanded global commercial sales force with strong leverage of our general and administrative functions. Operating income was 123.8 million in the Third Quarter of 2021 compared to 95 million in the same quarter of 2020, holding flat 19% of revenue.  As this result indicates, we've been able to retain much of our operating margin this year, even as we have significantly reinvested in our business. Adjusted EBITDA was 173.5 million or 26.7% of revenue for the third quarter, compared to 146.9 million or 29.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2020. Net income for the third quarter was 89.5 million or $0.89 per share.  We closed the quarter with approximately 2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents giving us great financial flexibility to drive our strategic initiatives. This includes the continued build-out of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia, and G7 scale up in Mesa, Arizona, as well as opportunities that are aligned our business objectives, such as our recent stricter acquisition.  Turning to guidance, our third quarter performance has placed us in a position to once again raise our full-year 2021 outlook for revenue and margins as we look to wrap up another excellent year. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between 2.4 - 5 and 2.45 billion, representing growth of 26% to 27% over 2020.  This guidance includes approximately 100 basis points of non-CGM in organic growth, related to our recent distributor acquisition. Turning to margins, we are increasing our full-year 2021 targets. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels, which include a neutral impact from our distributor acquisition.  Gross profit margins of approximately 68%, operating margins of approximately 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25%. With that, I will now turn the call back to Kevin. And they're taking advantage of that. So we'll continue to expect that to play through it. It's why we ultimately made the decision to do it. And I think you've seen it play through in the financial results and our expectation as you continue to see a play through over the long haul. Just a couple of tangible things which I think are helpful to see again, another record quarter for new patient adds, I think you can see that playing through and in many ways that's driven by the sales force. So you see that continued momentum, I would say the one thing that we have noticed that hasn't prevented us from being at completely full effectiveness is some of the impacts of the Delta variant.  I think that's probably the only thing that we've seen that's been a challenge, and that's just getting access to some of these offices when you're no longer seeing folks in person. And so you've seen a lot of positions opening up and those locations we're doing incredibly well. So there's more to work through and that's a function of just navigating through these COVID landscapes more than anything else. So I think in short, you're seeing the performance, you're seeing the growth, seeing the new patient adds and we've ramped up very nicely. It's been an incredible year for us thus far. I'm very bullish on what it means for next year. So I think that's really the feedback thus far and again, as we get more and more data, we'll continue to share it as it becomes available. Sure. Yes. So let me start with maybe the financials side and how that migrates over time. And then Jake's obviously who will take you through the technical aspect of it. And why we're so excited about it. So today these partnerships are a combination of expanding TAM and expanding people that would want to access CGM technology over time.  And today it's in the form of sensors. But over time, and as we've demonstrated the couple other software features, we've obviously added over the past, 6 months or so. Software can be a part of that package.  And so we're really -- the monetization of that will come over time. Today is about how we get as many folks as possible on sensors to realize the value of CGM. So that's how we expand it, Jake, maybe you could take it through just kind of the general theme of, of where we're going in that space. Yes. So there's a couple of pieces, so I'll first and foremost reiterate the total pricing expectation for the year, the 250 million is still the expectation if anything, we might come a little bit light on that, but that still is the expectation. So then the pricing in Q3 was generally in line with prior quarters. A little bit elevated, but it's not a material step change, and that's a function of some of those OUS contracts kicking in.  So really, that's where we come from a pricing perspective. So it's not necessarily pulling anything in. We've often talked about 2022 being relatively similar to 2021. And we're still on that trajectory. So I wouldn't necessarily expect any of that. To your question on how Q4 plays out in the guide and doing the math there.  And you're doing the math, right. One of the things we're mindful of, and there's really two pieces to it as you think about it, there's the piece we talked about a little bit earlier, which is the delta variant and getting into new primary care offices and making sure that we're seeing that over time before we count on it.  So that's the first piece of it and we're mindful of that. And then the second piece of it is as more and more of our product is fulfilled through the pharmacy, the historical trends over time you're going to see start to migrate just a little bit. You saw it start this year in Q1.  If you look back to Q1, our sequential pullback from prior year Q4 into Q1 was a bit muted, and you're going to see the same thing in this Q4, which it means as more and more goes to the pharmacy, you no longer have folks in the DME space than all of them have the high-deductible health plans were folks are maximizing benefits at the end of the year.  So we expect a little bit less seasonality as we progress. And in turn, we expect a little seasonality in Q1 of next year. So that's what you're reading into. That's ultimately what comes through in the guidance. So you're doing the math, right. But those are some of the expectations that went into it. Sure. So we'll -- so of pricing. We don't necessarily break down the pricing USO, U.S. and the overall number. And so at the end of the day, we're on the trajectory of the total Company we talked about. And so obviously guys will do the math, but at the end of the day, we're on that same trajectory.  In terms of your question on the distributor. With the impact of the distributor acquisition on growth in the quarter in our CGM business, it rounds to 0%. It's because there was 2 months in the quarter, and that markup on the margin in the distributor market is relatively small. The question is, well, why do you and what do you it, and what -- it's our ability to control, penetrating deeper into these markets.  And that's ultimately why we do it. It's not try to get a margin uplift. It's actually to try to control investment. We're a Company that has cash on the Balance Sheet. We're willing to invest in these markets. And we want to continue to invest in these markets. So as we take them direct, the goal has been to reinvest in make sure that we're driving adoption.  So the impact of the distributor really nominal on our organic growth rate like I said, it rounds to 0. So the 28% is the organic growth rate even including that. So hopefully, that helps you around the acquisition. There isn't much there that changes the results this quarter."

            "name": "Jake Leach",
            "content": "Yeah, sure. Jeremy. Thanks for the question. So really the way we think about it is that the technology that we're bringing in the market through this software features is really about providing unique experiences for customer segments. And so if you think about the type 1 segment or the type 2 segment non-intensive.  You really -- you're solving different types of problems in those and so what these Software tools such as our lives API provide is a way for our partners to serve those needs with seed DexCom, CGM, and a connection to our product, the real-time API is a real advancement in our cloud strategy. And we're really excited about the list of partners that are working to integrate that into their systems to provide their customers with unique experiences. So thanks for the question Jake, so the -- we presented actually earlier this year, we presented at ATTD G7 data. Joining a MARD of sub 9% and very strong  accuracy, better than G6, in fact, so we're very excited and happy with the result of the U.S. pivotal. And we'll be releasing that in the future. Yeah. So now that you've seen that data, I think you have a feel for it. And obviously, that data -- as these -- as more products launch over time, you'll get access to it. But I think some folks ask, well, how do I know what it's going to look like before, there is public -- data available at ATD that should set North Star.  In terms of the transition, the migration in the pharmacy, we talked about this glide path from approximately 50% turning into 2021 or at the end of 2020 into really 75% by the end of 2022, we're on that glide path right now. And so we're making headway, we haven't given a specific update as a percentage but as your charting that course, we're right where we'd be expected and right where you'd expect from a linear transition over time. So hopefully that helps. Yes, this is Jake, so let's start on the hospital first. So the way we are thinking about that is that, you really with the accuracy and reliability that we have built into the G6 and G7 systems. That it's a great CGM platform to then build a purpose built hospital products. So we're in the early stages of understanding what is the exact CGM that meets the needs in a hospital. We've seen good success with G6 under the times COVID used in the hospital.  It is really serving a need, but it's not exactly the right workflow for the our hospitals. And so what we want to do is better understand how rebuild a CGM that really meets the needs of that segment, On the pregnancy side, we're very excited about the building in pregnancy functionality and providing information that's important for expecting mothers into the G7 product. And so that's part of our roadmap and we're actively working on building that into the G7. Provided material in terms of the actual acquisition itself, and being able to get into the market. This was -- this is a group of folks who have done an incredible job with CGM adoption in that, in that country. And so when we when we get into these countries, we want to make sure one, we have the team, we make sure that they're eight.  There's nothing in their way from continuing to develop CGM awareness and developed CGM adoption. So there's nothing that prevents us under the structure. The only thing we mentioned in terms of investment is very similar to the way you've thought about our organization in the U.S. We know that investment in DTC and in sales reps where it makes sense and then sampling, and all of the things that we've put in place make great sense in other markets.  You've seen us do some of that in Europe, and certainly we've done some in Canada and we expect to do more of that and we take it direct, we can do a little bit more of that. And so that's really what we're talking about. So there's nothing structurally that prevents us from taking the acquisition and continuing to proliferate CGM adoption in those countries. Sure. Yes. The wearable platform that we've developed with the electro -chemical sensors that can be extended to other analytes. And we do have active research programs within DexCom and also with some of our university colleagues that are researching other analytes that we could use on our platform. Today, we're not talking about exactly which ones, but we do feel that this platform can be extended to multiple analytes and provide more value around the CGM component. Jake, I will take that one. DexCom ONE from the beginning, our intent around the design of that product was to make it simple. And so that kind of flows through, as you mentioned, the e-commerce experience, but into the App, the mobile App itself. It's a new, --completely new App architecture for us, so it's a new piece of software.  And the first part that users will see that's quite different is the on-boarding module. We basically spent a lot of time studying human factors and how users use the products, particularly in those -- when they're first learning how to use it. So what onboard module does is really walks them through a simple process on how to get up and running quickly on their CGM.  The other thing about it, that's different than G6 is that has a simplified alert scheme. So it doesn't have some of the more sophisticated predictive alerts, the G6 does it, it has a very simple easy-to-use, approachable alerts scheme.  The other thing that we added is with our current G6 system, a lot of the data over time statistic are built into our clarity software with Dexcom ONE we've actually incorporated that into the Dexcom ONE absolute typical statistics like average glucose time and range estimated A1C, that's all built into the single Dexcom ONE up.  And then finally in that vein of simplicity, there's no AID connectivity for Dexcom ONE, it also doesn't have the share remote monitoring features, so it's really about bringing a simple CGM product to people who have never had access to Dexcom ONE CGM and haven't experienced life without fingersticks."

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone for joining us. Today we reported great results for our second quarter with 32% revenue growth for the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2020, as well as solid execution on our key strategic initiatives that we will discuss throughout the call today. The $143 million in absolute dollar revenue growth compared to the second quarter in 2020 represents the highest quarterly increase in DexCom's history. We continue to believe that we are early in our story with the potential to drive a far greater impact on global health. Our growth performance is closely related to the progress we\u2019ve made to advance access on our CGM systems for people with diabetes. And because there is often so much misinformation spread about access to DexCom's CGM in the field, or the cost of our products for people with diabetes. Let me point out several key points that our investors, clinicians and current and potential customer should know. We\u2019ve advanced pharmacy access in the U.S where more than 70% of our commercial customers have a monthly out of pocket cost of less than $60 per month and nearly one-third of our customers have zero out of pocket costs for the G6 Sensors. According to IQVIA, this is less than a comparable out of pocket cost for our nearest competitor. The latest research from diabetes market research firm [indiscernible] Partners confirms our conclusion. With DexCom having the lowest customer copays of the three largest CGM suppliers in the U.S for customers on intensive insulin therapy. We've significantly expanded coverage for people with intensively managed type 2 diabetes, with the overwhelming majority of these patients now having coverage for DexCom CGM in the U.S. We also continue to advocate for equitable access to our CGM supplies for populations that are often underserved. As of July 2021, there are now 43 state Medicaid programs providing coverage for DexCom CGM, including a growing number of states providing access to the pharmacy channel for both type 1 and type 2 intensive users. We are building even more on those advocacy efforts in collaboration with several key nonprofit organizations that support the diabetes community. In June, we launched the global movement for time and range to broaden awareness of time and range and its benefits for people with diabetes and their health care providers. And we hope that this collaboration effort will lead to future solutions for improved CGM access. Our teams have taken a leading role to drive the removal of administrative barriers that prevent people with diabetes from accessing the benefits of real-time CGM. Along these lines, we are pleased to see the update from CMS in the second quarter to remove the requirement of at least four daily fingersticks for Medicare customers. This will simplify the CGM onboarding process for both customers and clinicians. We've also made solid progress internationally, building from our position of operational strength to advocate for broader reimbursement for G6. This initiative is moving forward according to plan with several geographies publicly announcing enhancements to their coverage of DexCom CGM in the second quarter. Despite these developments, a majority of people on mealtime insulin continue to manage their diabetes with fingersticks. Even in U.S., a leader in CGM adoption, we continue to believe that the type 1 market remains less than 50% penetrated and the type 2 intensive market is less than 25% penetrated. So there remains a great opportunity ahead of us even in the markets that we currently serve. At the same time, we are generating a growing evidence base for the use of DexCom CGM. At the ATTD and ADA industry conferences in June, we presented exciting research affirming the benefits of our product platform, including the ALERTT1 trial. This randomized controlled trial was simultaneously published in The Lancet showing superior health outcomes associated with the use of DexCom CGM relative to our nearest competitors/glucose monitor. These conferences also featured several presentations on the use of CGM for people with type 2 diabetes, including those not using mealtime insulin as well as use in women who are pregnant, use in the hospital setting and even conclusions applicable to health and wellness using CGM data. Perhaps the most significant of these presentations was the long awaited readout of our MOBILE trial, which was also published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. MOBILE was another rigorous randomized controlled trial assessing the value of DexCom CGM compared to the current standard of care Fingersticks. For people with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin. Importantly, the study looked at a diverse user base representative of the U.S population, and it assess these people in the primary care clinical environments where they're traditionally served. So what did we see? We saw a clinically significant A1c reductions for uses of our DexCom CGM systems. And perhaps even more telling, we saw a 16% time and range increase for the CGM cohort, which is four additional hours per day spend in the target glucose range. These were results produced with DexCom CGM and DexCom Software. We design the trial with the goal of changing the standard of care for these basal insulin users, a group that we believe includes between 3 million and 4 million people in the U.S alone. With these results, we feel that mobile index com have the potential to do just that. And our team's look forward to driving better awareness and access based on the study outcomes and the JAMA publication. We also made great progress in the second quarter to advance the clinical and regulatory pathway for our next generation G7 CGM system. At ATDD in June, we provided an update on the performance of G7 drawn from our recent clinical trials. Based on the data shown we expect the G7 will continue the excellent clinical and real world performance and reliability that we have established with our G6 brand. And we will do so with several factors that we believe will enhance our customer experience, including a fully disposable sensor and transmitter a redesigned app experience and a market leading 30 minute warm-up period. Our G7 continues to progress according to our plans. During the second quarter, we concluded our U.S clinical trial that will support our ICJM filing, our teams have now shifted to processing the data and working toward preparing the regulatory filing. In addition, we've recently submitted G7 for CE Mark approval. As we previously discussed, we believe that this timing places still on track to begin the G7 launch by the end of 2021. These are incredible achievements and advances from the quarter and I step forward to fulfill the promise presented by our CGM technology. And this is just the beginning. There are several additional areas of progress that Jereme and Queen will discuss based on the great work of our teams in the past several months. So with that said, let me turn it over to Jereme for a review of our second quarter financial performance. Jereme?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $595 million, compared to $452 million for the second quarter of 2020, representing growth of 32% on a reported basis, and 30% on a constant currency basis. As Kevin noted, this represents a record for absolute dollar growth in a quarter year-over-year. U.S revenue totaled $462 million in the second quarter, compared to $367 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing growth of 26%. Our momentum and market leadership position in the U.S remains strong. And we have been very encouraged with the continued interest in CGM in the marketplace. With the combination of greater depth in our sales force, solid results from our direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns and expanded ability to allow for patients and clinicians to trial the G6 experience, we are beginning to see preliminary results in our effort to further expand our presence into primary care offices and position the company to extend our customer base. International business grew about 58% in the second quarter, totaling $134 million. While the second quarter comp benefited from the impact of COVID on our second quarter 2020 results, we saw good sequential growth momentum as the business once again achieved a new high watermark. The international growth was broad based across all markets, including core markets like Germany, the U.K., Canada, Australia and the Nordic Region. Our shift to the pharmacy channel and sales initiatives in the U.S and our market expansion initiatives internationally, are all progressing according to plan, driving high volume growth in both regions. Volume growth for the second quarter came in around the mid 40% range on a global basis. Perhaps the greatest examples of the international effort during the quarter came from Canada, where we saw public announcements of provincial coverage for G6 from two of the largest Canadian provinces. Quebec, where coverage of G6 was established for people with type 1 diabetes, and British Columbia, which became the first Canadian province to cover G6 for people with type 1 diabetes and intentionally manage type 2 diabetes. These public announcements are representative of our broader strategy to advance access to our technology for people with diabetes. We are leveraging the increasing strength of our operations in driving a meaningful expansion to the total number of patients that we can address via reimbursed pathways. Our second quarter gross profit was $417.1 million or 70.1% of revenue compared to 64.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2020. We're very proud of the effort that's gone into these results. The 600 basis points of gross margin expansion is another great validation of the growing efficiencies that we've achieved through product design and efficient manufacturing operations. It is these types of efforts that drive the strategic flexibility to expand our addressable market that I just referenced. Operating expenses were $315.6 for Q2 2021, compared to $213 million for Q2 2020. These results reflect what we previously noted in our discussion of our 2021 plans. We have several areas of investment that we are pursuing, which account for the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales relative to the second quarter of 2020. These include the costs associated with our expanded field sales force, the pivotal trial in support of our U.S G7 regulatory submission, the G7 manufacturing scale up and global direct-to-consumer marketing. Our strategic investments have also included our efforts to efficiently scale and lower the cost to serve our customers. As we envision a future in which we serve meaningfully more people than we do today. Our global business services operations in Lithuania and the Philippines are key examples of those initiatives that are driving great customer service while leveraging our G&A spend. Operating income was $101.5 million or 17.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $76.7 million or 17% of revenue in the same quarter of 2020. The 10 basis point year-over-year improvement was driven by strong improvements to our gross margin resulting from the design of our products in the manufacturing efficiencies that come there through. These improvements more than offset the strategic investment that we've made during the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $156.6 million or 26.3% of revenue for the second quarter, compared to $122.6 million or 27.1% of revenue for the second quarter of 2020. Net income for the second quarter was $75.4 million or $0.76 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the second quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and great financial flexibility to drive our strategic initiatives. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect solid volume growth across all of our regions in the back half of the year with momentum driven by growing CGM awareness globally. Based on our second quarter performance, we are pleased to be in a position to once again raise our full year 2021 revenue guidance. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.35 billion to $2.4 billion, representing growth of 22% to 25% over 2020. This increase comes on top of our expectations for approximately $10 million of unfavorable currency impact in the back half relative to prior guidance. This revenue increase is primarily a reflection of our continued growth momentum as well as the ongoing impact of our channel mix and international access expansion strategies. We will see a greater revenue per patient impact to our existing base from our international access initiatives in the second half of the year. But we continue to expect the incremental volume driven by these efforts to offset those pressures in our base this year alone. More importantly, this will leave us in much better position in the years to come. Turning to margins. We're increasing our full year 2021 targets. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels. Gross profit margins of approximately 67%; operating margins of approximately 14% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 24%. With that, I will now turn the call over to Quen for a scale and strategy update. \nQuen Blackford: Thank you, Jereme. As Kevin and Jereme indicated, we made great progress on our key strategic initiatives during the second quarter. It is hard not to be excited about the market potential for CGM after seeing the depth of research using DexCom technology at the recent ATDD and ADA industry conferences. We saw well over a dozen presentations from DexCom's insulin delivery partners, highlighting the clinical utility of DexCom integrated systems and DexCom's leadership in the field of interoperable solutions. Outside of the mobile and alert publications that Kevin mentioned. We also saw several presentations from our DexCom team members, as well as independent investigators with outcomes that are very promising for the continued growth of DexCom CGM. In one study presented by our health economics team, we looked at real world evidence documenting the cost savings for a significant number of patients with type two diabetes using G6, including both the intensive insulin therapy and those who are not treated with mealtime insulin. The results were compelling what the magnitude of cost savings generated for the G6 users being nearly identical to the cost savings we've seen in several of our other pilots. This is yet another data point supporting economic benefits associated with the better glucose control for our customers. And we are excited to leverage this growing evidence base into broader access for people with diabetes around the world. We also continue to innovate our software solutions to enable differentiated user experiences that meet the needs of the diverse customer bases that we serve. Most recently, in mid July, we received FDA clearance on a real-time API software solution. This is to our knowledge, one of the first if not the first, real time API clearance in the medical device sector that enables integration with third-party apps. As many of you likely know prior to the clearance of our real-time API, our various digital health partners were limited to the display of CGM data on a three hour delayed basis through our retrospective API. With this new API partners who are now invited by DexCom have the ability to integrate real time DexCom CGM data into the respective apps and devices. This is another great win for our customers, who will now benefit from the ability to see real time glucose levels in a variety of new displays, according to their needs. At the time of the approval, we announced Garmin and Teladoc [indiscernible] Livongo for diabetes program as early users of the new API solution. In addition, Welldoc and UnitedHealthcare's Level 2, are utilizing our real time connectivity solutions in their integrated offerings. This is an exciting innovation for us, and an example of how we are leveraging our leadership and software connectivity to advance our market position in the growing digital health landscape. On the commercial front, we remain well-positioned to drive growth and broader DexCom market penetration in several locations. In addition to the significant access expansion efforts that we began to implement last quarter to enable multiples of growth in our core markets, we are growing our presence in locations that are relatively new to our team. This includes Japan, where we've recently sent our first shipment of G6 systems to a local distributor. Although we have had a minor presence in Japan to the use of our key for professional CGM. These GS systems represent the expanded use of our product to serve people with diabetes with our core ambulatory solution. We're incredibly excited to bring our CGM technology to empower people with diabetes in Japan, and look forward to developing that as a nice growth market for DexCom. In addition to the strong G7 performance data show to ATTD in the clinical and regulatory updates that Kevin provided. Our operations team is continuing according to plan in our G7 manufacturing development and scaling efforts. We have automated lines producing G7 products as we speak, with a steady cadence of additional lines scheduled to be delivered to the back half of this year and throughout 2022. In addition, the vendors in our supply chain are scaling up G7 capabilities alongside us as we sit here today. We will take what we have learned from these automated lines in San Diego and Mesa and use them to quickly replicate and scale and a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. As we've said before, this effort will be critical to our ability to serve significant customer populations that we think can benefit from our CGM technology. Giving us a clear runway to produce more than 200 million sensors per year, and a much stronger presence in a key growth region for us. Our team is doing a great job to advance our efforts and what continues to be a challenging environment to navigate. because of the impact of the pandemic globally. We are currently building out the manufacturing facility while also scaling our supply chain, putting us on track to be ready for production in 2022. As you can see from our 70% gross margin this quarter, we're making this progress on G7, we are also advancing our efforts towards operational excellence, resulting in even greater improvements and efficiencies to our G6 manufacturing, procurement and distribution capabilities. Overall as I think Kevin and Jeremy would agree. We are very proud of the work of our teams to execute on the ambitious plans that we set forth in 2021. With that, I will pass the call back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Quentin. I agree with that message as we are all very pleased with the progress that we made during the quarter. To be able to raise guidance across the board, including another revenue raise was $65 million added to the midpoint of guidance is a great result for the company. We're excited to continue that momentum into the second half of the year. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time, and then reenter the queue if necessary. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus. Robbie, go ahead.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. I want to congratulate you guys on a really nice quarter. If I can ask, I think we're all interested in updated G7 approval timing. It sounds like you haven't filed in the U.S yet. And you had a great international number. I'd love if you could provide, just any, any examples or tangible examples of how the expansion of benefit is already helping you and how it might continue to help you the rest of this year and next year. Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Well, I'll start with G7. Then I'll let Quentin and Jereme take over the benefit expansion. I mean, with respect to G7 we're very deliberate about what we disclose. We have filed for CE Mark and we are on schedule for that we hit our goal there. And we are now gathering the data from the U.S pivotal study. It was a much larger study than the data it was presented at ATDD. However, the trial was run under actually what we think are improved protocols from what we ran before. So we have no reason not -- to not expect great data. We believe the product will be very robust. We will make sure that we deliver that file in a very pristine manner. We hear a lot of things about FDA delays and things of that nature. We don't want to create delays, it's been our experience over time, and we deliver what the FDA expects, they move very quickly and they\u2019re very cooperative with us. We have no reason to believe the file we're preparing isn't going to meet those expectations, or moving along those lines. So again, with the CE Mark filing, we're on track for an OUS launch later this year. And we'll update you more on the U.S as time goes on.\nRobbie Marcus: When?\nKevin Sayer: Yes, Robbie, with respect to your question or comments on the OUS business. Look, there was strength really across the board in that entire portfolio of ours. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there, primarily on the heels of awareness just continuing to grow. To be honest with you, I don't think we've seen the benefit yet of the increased access that we spoke to, really back in the first quarter and the team has made incredible progress. And working with the payers and negotiating these contracts, I'd say we are through 90% or so of those, all landing in favorable positions where we've probably increased or improved access for nearly a million patients in the first half of the year alone, and thaw OUS business. But the reality is that benefits not going to show up until the back half of the year. So the strength in the second quarter, I wouldn't attribute that to the increased access just yet. But we're very excited about how we're positioned as we go into the back half of the year around those access efforts.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Appreciate the thought.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins. Bob, go ahead.\nBob Hopkins: Okay. Thank you. Just love your comment on two quick things. First, Clint, I think this is what you're referencing in terms of the access fees. But I just curious if there's any more detail on just how that how, process of the price cuts and negotiating better actions. Just how you feel that\u2019s going. I think I apologize if that's kind of what you are referencing with that last question. And then Kevin, I'd love you to just give a quick update on -- just a little more time has passed since the MOBILE trial. Just curious as to kind of what you're hearing from insurance partners or other important parties in terms of the potential impact on that data on facilitating greater reimbursement for a broader range of patients going forward?\nKevin Sayer: Sure. So I'll jump on that first one, Bob. We are talking the exact same thing there. In terms of the fact that we've negotiated or work through the majority of those negotiations through the course of the second quarter. More than 90% or so of them behind us all landing in favorable positions relative to improving the access for the patients reducing the administrative, burdens that were there. So that folks can get on the technology a whole lot easier. So very bullish around where we're at, and creating incremental access for our patients, and how that sets up into the back half of the year. The pricing assumptions have come right in line with what we expected as we were going into it, no surprises there. So from our perspective, all those very positive on that front.\nQuen Blackford: And, Bob, with respect to the MOBILE study, obviously, we're very excited about it. Just a little time has passed here. We also have a bunch of other analyses on this data that are coming that will support our position on basal insulin reimbursement for these patients. It's time to get the word out. Now, I think one of the big areas here is going to be CMS discussions down the line because a lot of these patients fall into the Medicare bucket. Haven't done any of that yet, but we are looking forward and we're preparing because this day yet, it's just but we are looking forward. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson. Go ahead, Jeff.\nJeff Johnson: Yes, thanks. Good Afternoon, guys. Yes, just saying on maybe the international side for a second, Jeremy, last quarter, you talked about a 15 million incremental headwind from Quentin's comments. It sounds like maybe those really haven't started to flow in yet. So do we think about that $50 million headwind kind of next 12-month number? Is that how to think about it. And then those initial $200 million headwinds that we kind of were expecting heading into this year, the first quarter kind of straight lined in right at about 50 did it straight line again in the second quarter about the 50 on the US side, and still thinking about the international than 50 over the next 12 months. Thanks, guys.\nKevin Sayer: Sure. So the full year guidance around pricing or channel mix headwinds is still the same. And so the $200 million on what we call the original shift mix primarily in the U.S., It's still the same in the second quarter. It came in a little bit lighter than the first quarter but generally in line and so I think we're seeing that stable and we talked about at the beginning you're being pretty stable throughout the course of the year. To your point on the international incremental headwinds about the access for price conversation that has started its back half loaded. We certainly will have some of those in the first half of next year, as we anniversary, some of those contracts of the $250 million we talked about was really the impact on 2021. And so you'll see the 50 million in the back half of the year, there will be a little of that into 2022. We'll get more into that in the future. But that will happen over a 12 month period.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew O'Brian. Go ahead, Matthew.\nMatthew O'Brian: Afternoon, thanks for taking the question. I know traditionally discounts been pretty conservative with their outlook. But I think Jeremy just said the pricing concessions are going to be impactful in the back half. But as I look at the model, the back half of the year as easier comps than the first half, and you just put up a monster Q2, especially in the U.S. So is there something specifically you're trying to call out? As far as incremental pressure in the back half of the year that we should be aware of? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. Thanks for the question. Certainly nothing that we're trying to call out. I think when we thought about guidance, we certainly talked about the performance in the first half of the year. And certainly thinking about that patient base and how that plays out for the balance of the year. So that's contemplated in the guidance. And look, we raised the guidance $65 million at the midpoint and $75 million when you exclude the impact of currency. So we've certainly raised it and pass through some of that for the balance of the year. As we think about the back half of the year, we simply don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We talked about the impact, and you pointed out the international access, but there still is COVID out there and the Delta variant is out there. And so rather than increase it and get bullish and get ahead of ourselves, we want to see how it plays through for the balance of the year. We do here and this is out there outside the U.S where primary care physicians are taking their practice, and ultimately using their time to administer vaccinations. While we've done a great job navigating through those thus far this year. We do want to be prudent and make sure that we are contemplating and look if we can deliver more than that, we certainly will and will talk to it if we are able to.\nMatthew O'Brian: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew Blackman. Go ahead Matthew.\nQ - Matthew Blackma: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Jereme, I just was curious about the second half cadence and whether we should be thinking about sort of a typical third quarter or fourth quarter cadence? Or are we sort of at the point or approaching the point where things like increasing pharmacy access may make the year somewhat less for Q weighted, as we've seen historically any help therapy would be appreciate it. Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, sure, absolutely happy to take it. So the way to think about Q3 and by default, you'll back into Q4, Q3 generally is not that impacted by changing and shifts and dynamic. In fact, I think for the past few years, you've generally seen it right around that 26% of full year revenue. And we expect the same to happen this year. So I think that'll help you at least think about Q3 and in the balance of the year. We do expect Q4 to have less of a weighting, you saw it in Q1 as a result of the move to the pharmacy where the year gets a little bit less seasonal. I think you'll expect the same in Q4 where you don't have folks in the DME channel rushing to meet benefits. So I do think you'll see -- as we've talked about before, as we make move -- more move -- more and more moves to the pharmacy, less heavy weighting on Q4 and less lightweighting on Q1 and start to move out of that seasonality. But hopefully I give you some context. Q3 in the near-term, we do expect Q3 to mirror that of prior periods, which is generally in that 26% seasonality.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Taylor. Go ahead, Matt.\nMatt Taylor: Thank you. So I wanted to ask one on the margins here. I guess the way I'll ask it is you showed significant progress. Quentin, you talked about a lot of the scaling and automation activities you're doing in these facilities. Has the results that you've had so far and be able to raise guidance changed your view on the longer term potential for margins at all to the positive versus the LRP?\nQuen Blackford: Yes, what I would say is, look, our confidence level continues to increase and our ability to keep it in that mid 60s range that we've guided to long-term. Is there the opportunity to take it north of there over time? If so you can bet on it that we're going to flow that through and give that up if possible. But look, we're in the midst of evaluating a lot of different potential business models. As you look at the whole type 2 non-intensive space as it opens up. We're looking at the international business continue to expand in a significant way. Pharmacy access continues to grow. All of these things are going to continue to put a bit of pressure on the gross margin profile. But if you saw the way that we were able to take cost out of the product from a design perspective and improve the process efficiencies around manufacturing this, your confidence level only increases and where we can keep that gross margin over time. So we're incredibly excited by what we're seeing, a lot of that doesn't contemplate the fact that over time, you probably see us move into a 15 day where cycle on the product itself, and so there's significant benefits that come there also. So, again, a bit back to Jeremy's point earlier, this is not an area that we're going to get ahead of ourselves. But we feel like we have the flexibility we need to really get after the market opportunities that present themselves and still deliver a very attractive gross margin profile in this business.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Thanks for the comments and congrats on a good result.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor. Go ahead, Margaret.\nMargaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the real time APIs, you guys got approval for and it seems like to me like it could be one of the next evolutions for the business. So I was curious if you could talk to us how important it is today versus three years from now. What it can facilitate both clinically and commercially. And I guess just to round it out, what's been the reaction from the potential partners to the API so far?\nQuen Blackford: So maybe I'll start with the reaction. The reaction has been incredibly positive, I think folks understand and desire to see the real time information coming into their tools and being able to put that into the hands of the patients, the more real time that information is, the more reactive the patient can be to that information and improve their outcomes over time. And I think, we're incredibly bullish in the sense that we believe we have the capability in a platform to build these tools off of. And that's exactly where we want to be, we want to provide as much input to these tools as we possibly can and work with as many partners as possible. I think from the very beginning, we've always had a bit of a different approach to the value of information, data and software in particular. And what you're seeing play out right now is part of that vision that we've had there and the approval of the real time API, we've invested heavily in the ability to produce this capability. We understand the importance of interoperability, the importance of putting information in the hands of the patients. That's who DexCom is. And you're going to continue to see us invest in that area and really use it as a differentiator. In terms of how that evolves into the future and, is there opportunity to create value in that, monetization of the data stream or the real time API, those are all things will evaluate over time. That's not our strategy today. Today, it's all about improving outcomes for patients that's going to show up in the way of incremental sensor sales over time. And we're very happy with that approach. But it leaves us with some great flexibility.\nMargaret Kaczor: Great, thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Go ahead, [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst: Congratulations on a good quarter. I know you've talked about the OUS quantity 7 here in the back half. And just curious if you could put some context on expectations for how would you think about that launch? And which countries if you\u2019re willing to share that and you've also got probably 40 to 50 million G6 sensors that you're making a year. And just curious what you're going to do with that G6 capacity as G7 launches?\nKevin Sayer: That's a great question. I'll take that one. We're not going to give you color on the specific countries, because we don't want to -- for competitive reasons, we don't release the playbook. But we are on track for that. And as we look going forward, it is a very interesting question for us and one for us to debate. How do we use our G6 capacity while we're bringing up G7 lines at the same time, because the two don't intersect. We believe we'll have a market for G6 for quite some time. While we're going to do a global launch and go very quickly, there will be places where G7 isn't going to be available immediately. Our partners are going to take a while to catch up on the automated insulin delivery side. We're working with them now on G7, but we've got it, we've still got some G6 for him to go there. And there's some countries where we aren't yet or some geographies where we need to get started where we can offer G6 in those areas while we sell G7 in others. So we are planning this. It's one of our areas of great debate. And I think we'll manage as best we can. We won't be bashful about taking down GE six lines of G7 is ready to go and is the home run we think it's going to be and we've got several in fairness, Quentin and his operating relations team, along with our R&D guys have developed some absolutely spectacular manufacturing methods for G7. They can give us a tremendous amount of flexibility to expand there very, very quickly and very thoughtfully. So we'll monitor that very, very closely. That's a really good question and something we think about a lot here.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy. Go ahead, Danielle.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I'll echo everyone's congrats on a really strong quarter. I'm not sure who this question is for, but it's on the DTC initiatives, you guys had a very successful Super Bowl ad campaign. Just curious if there's any way to quantify what you're seeing from a return perspective yet. I mean, this quarter, what seems exceptionally strong to me, I'm wondering if we're seeing any benefit from that not sure if you can even tell? Or if you can tell us. But if so, we'd love to hear even qualitative feedback there. Thanks so much.\nKevin Sayer: Sure. Yes, we'll take that question. And I think there's probably two data points that we can give you that will help you -- get your arms around, the feedback we're seeing. First off, Q2 was a record quarter for new patient adds. So we're continuing to see record new patient adds, no doubt in many ways driven by the work we're doing around DTC and Sales force as well as samples. So I think you\u2019ve got certainly a data point, that's helpful. The other piece is, is over the past 18 months, we've doubled the active prescribers of our product. And no doubt as we get out and get into the field and see endocrinologists, but also primary care physicians, the work we're doing around expanding that access has yielded really incredible benefits for the amount of prescribers that are out there that are one aware and two prescribing our product. I think those two things are just clear indications of the investments we're making in the awareness in the DTC, in the sales force is paying off. And hopefully that gives you some context, of course, looking at the quarter's revenue performance also helps as well. So those all data points, I think, really give you some color as to why we think it's still an incredible investment and why we think the returns still are some of the best in the business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jayson Bedford. Go ahead, Jayson.\nJayson Bedford: Thanks. Just a quick one. I wanted to get back to the gross margin line of questioning. What weighs on gross margin in the second half of the year to get to 67 for the year. Is it international pricing? Is the buildup of Malaysia? And just if you can comment on, it seems like a large portion of these costs may be transitory. Any color there would be helpful.\nKevin Sayer: Sure. Yes, so there's two that are the biggest. The first one is some of the international pricing. You're correct. Does some of that plays through -- we'll have a little bit of pressure on margin. The other one is the launch of G7. When we launched G7, those lines won't be at full capacity. And they won't be at full yields. Just like when we launched G6, and we launched some of the automation around G6, it took a little bit of time to work through some of the kinks on these automated lines. And while we still expect incredible output out -- right out the gate, that's going to cost us a little bit more. And so I think what you're seeing is some of the international access, but then when we launched G7 and those lines start to appreciate the cost of producing those in that shorter period are going to be a little bit higher. To your question is that transitory, all the work that the team is doing around the capability of manufacturing at high capacity as well as high yields, all of that will bounce back and play through. And if this quarter is any demonstration of how good they are, you can see the margins that you see this quarter have shown that this team does an incredible job of yielding out these lines over time. And we expect that to turn around with G7 into the future. But there will be some time as we launched G7 as we get those lines up and running, where there will be a little bit of weight just similar to what we had with G6 that we're going to have to navigate through. But again, I think we're still super bullish on the capability and we're super proud of the team and really expecting that team to do an incredible job as we launched G7.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch. Go ahead, Joanne.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you and nice quarter. Two questions. Was there any stocking in the quarter either in the U.S or the OUS market? And then you gave us sort of a blended volume price number. Could you sort of parse that out for the U.S and for the International sales dynamic? Thank you.\nQuen Blackford: Yes, so there was no stocking in the quarter, nothing out of the normal. Everybody was at normal levels. In terms of your question on a blended number, I'm not sure what you're referring to. Certainly, we have a price dynamic of around the $250 million. When we say price, it's really more channel. But we want to make sure we're very clear. It's really that shift in channel as well as the international access. We also talked about unit volumes. And I'm not sure if you're referencing that, but our unit volumes on the quarter the growth year-over-year were in the mid 40% range. And so certainly a strong unit volume growth quarter. So hopefully that answers your question. And if you have any other certainly follow-up, we can happy to be -- happy to clarify.\nJoanne Wuensch: Actually it's the unit volume number that mid 40%, that's what I want to call a blended number. What is that number in the U.S and international?\nQuen Blackford: We don't break it out. That's our global number. But we can tell you that the growth on unit volume was strong in both the U.S and outside the U.S.\nJoanne Wuensch: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steve Lichtman. Go ahead, Steve.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi, guys. Kevin, you talked about momentum in intensive type 2. Where do you think U.S penetration into that market can go over the next few years? Or are there any hurdles to drive penetration? Or are you feeling good now where awareness and payer coverage are continuing to drop penetration there?\nKevin Sayer: We feel very good about coverage we have there. On the commercial side, it's up over 80% of the intensive type 2 patients now covered for commercial payers plus the Medicare coverage. So we have that it covers a number of these patients already. So access for these patients isn't going to be a problem. It's now all about awareness. We went and double the size of our sales force at the beginning of this year. So we get access to more primary care physicians who do see a lot of the insulin using type 2 patients. And we've seen great results from that team. We've had a huge increase in the number of prescribers of our product over the course of this year. So that is a big win. For us it's about getting to him and explain to him what technology is available. We think this market will be every bit as penetrated as type 1 at some point in time. We view it as a very strong opportunity.\nSteven Lichtman: Okay. Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone. Go ahead, Anthony.\nAnthony Petrone: Great. Thanks. Congratulations. Great quarter and hope everyone's doing well on the team. Maybe a quick one on Malaysia and G7. Is it safe to assume G7 will exclusively be manufactured out of there? And if so, what does that mean for the margin of that product? And then maybe a quick update on the integrated device partnerships, Control-IQ, and eventually Omnipod 5, just how you see those partnerships and those product cycles evolving over the next 24 months. Thank you.\nQuen Blackford: Yes, I'll speak to the Malaysia question. Kevin, will jump on the last part of that. With respect to Malaysia, it will not be exclusive -- G7 will not be exclusive to that location. We will start with G7 here in the States, both in San Diego and Mesa. As a matter of fact, lines are there as we speak and will continue to ramp up there into the back part of this year and into next year as well. As Malaysia comes online and the buildings up out of the ground, and we've validated the clean room and the capability there will begin to build out the G7 capability there as well. So we'll have G7 in both locations over time. That's going to give us an opportunity to produce north of 200 million sensors all together. And when you think about the distribution of those sensors, and where they're going both in the U.S and internationally speaking, I think it makes a lot of sense to continue to have that capability here in the States as well in Malaysia, particularly when you start to look at the logistical distribution costs associate with moving that product around in the volumes that we're talking. So it will exist in both locations. I do think over time, the lower cost profile will come out of that Malaysia business. That's a big part of the value proposition there. But that's going to let us serve a lot of those international markets very effectively and efficiently.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, and with respect to the integrated systems, we're very excited for these opportunities. I actually made it out in the field last week. There is a whole bunch of pent-up demand for Omnipod 5. People are very ready for it. They've been ready for it for a long time and we're looking forward to that day as well on the Tandem side. We know they're working on new products and have new projects. I think the best thing I can talk about with Tandem is, just a recent story. I got a note on my computer. Somebody wanted to give me a Facebook message and it was person who told me it's been 22 years on Medtronic systems and is now on Tandem Control-IQ with DexCom and he has never been healthier never had a lower A1c. Never had better, he said my whole life has changed because this system is amazing. So we believe the integrated systems driven by DexCom sensors are game changers. People get accurate sensors, information that can take these sophisticated algorithms and make proper decisions. We're very bullish and optimistic on both these opportunities going forward. Very excited.\nAnthony Petrone: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ravi Misra. Go ahead, Ravi.\nRavi Misra: All right. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the DexCom API, can you talk a little bit about how you chose some of the partners that you're working with? I understand Livongo [ph], of course, but with Garmin [ph] and then just more on that. Just walk us through kind of how you envision this being separate or integrated with CLARITY in the future? Just curious why this is for industry rather than kind of providers itself? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, this is Kevin, I'll handle the CLARITY piece. With the live API, the patient still has to run the DexCom app in the background. So the data will go straight to CLARITY and it will be there as is now. The better question is will we ever have a CLARITY type system for those who don't have the same needs as intensive insulin users. And I think over time, you'll see us migrate our tools to that platform. Hence, you heard these guys talk about software investments over the last half of the year. And as we look at 2022, we see the same. We're quickly becoming a software company in addition to a sensor company. It's very exciting there. Quentin, do you want to talk \u2026\nQuen Blackford: Yes, in terms of the partners, I mean, you think about the Teladoc Livongo's diabetes program, the UnitedHealth, the Welldoc and Garmin, these are partners that we've had established relationships with in the past. There is a little bit of integration work that goes into providing the real time API and the connection into their systems. These were the easy ones out of the gate that really sync up with and get programs going with. But I think the important thing is we want to be a foundation that we can provide this sort of information into many programs out there, and really improve the outcomes for the patients themselves. And I don't think we can be better positioned to be able to do that right now. So incredibly thrilled with where it's at, and expect more partners to be lining up.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Marie Thibault. Go ahead, Marie.\nMarie Thibault: Thank you. Congrats on a nice quarter and thanks for the time today. Just a quick follow-up, I think on the comments around the sales force. I know that you doubled the sales force this year. So just want to get an update on where they are in their productivity ramp. I know we typically think of at least 6 to 9 months to get to a more normal productivity level. So would love to hear kind of a status update on that. Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: I think you're right on target. It does take about 6 to 9 months for everybody to get to speed. The one thing we are saying, if I can just give you one trend though, is we try and expand our coverage into the PCP offices where we haven't been before. It's a lot of work. We haven't been there. And as we knock on doors, it's taken these guys a while to get appointments. Once they get in, we're finding the physicians do not know a whole lot about DexCom. And if anything, we totally validated our assumptions. In this expansion, we had to get out there, we had to get more feet on the street and more faces to be as competitive as we want it to and to achieve our goals.\nMarie Thibault: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Go ahead.\nKyle Rose: This is actually Kyle Rose on from Canaccord. So just one of the -- obviously, you made some big investments on the commercial side this year, with DTC doubling the sales force and the trialing. So I just was trying to understand, if you had to call up maybe one of those as a bigger driver rather than the other, which one would it be? Just trying to understand how far into realizing some of the productivity gains from the sales force we might really be seeing from the primary care channel.\nQuen Blackford: Yes, I can take that. So, at first, there's -- these all really needed to be done in conjunction. But the immediate one that you get returns on is, obviously, awareness. And awareness comes in many forms and factors, but clearly through DTC. I think at this point, they all go hand in hand because you're making folks aware, you're getting out into the physician's office, you're making the physician aware certainly through your rep and through the Hello DexCom program, people are getting the opportunity to trial it. And so we all -- we did them all together. So maybe early out the gate, DTC was the immediate shot in the arm, but at this point, they're all really contributing in conjunction. And so that's the way we think about it. Over the longer haul, you think that feet on the street are going to be incredibly important as these physicians need to have relationships with folks in conjunction with all the other offerings that we provide. We have to validate that over time, Kevin referenced it was we get in front of these doctors, we're educating them, but the way I think about it as DTC was the immediate more quick return. But I think at this point, they're all contributing equally.\nOperator: And we have no more questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to Kevin Sayer, for closing comments.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you very much. And thank you everybody for participating in and listening to our earnings report today. In summary, this was a quarter of tremendous accomplishment. Just under $600 million in revenue for this quarter with our highest ever absolute revenue and dollar increase when compared to the previous year's quarter. Our worldwide field and access expansion efforts are working exactly the way we planned. Positioning is very well for the rest of 2021 and beyond. 70% gross margins during a period of continued plan annual revenue per patient reductions to increase global access for all diabetes customers, new record operating income during a period of increased investment and what I believe is the most robust product pipeline we've ever had. G7 progress continues. Very important measurable milestones have been achieved on schedule this quarter. And there's nothing like being around here as we approach a deadline. It is just energizing. Other projects here made great progress as well. And finally, we are laying the groundwork for our future growth with irrefutable fact based clinical evidence. This technology will have a major impact in health care all over the world. Thanks, everybody and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone for joining us. Today we reported great results for our second quarter with 32% revenue growth for the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2020, as well as solid execution on our key strategic initiatives that we will discuss throughout the call today. The $143 million in absolute dollar revenue growth compared to the second quarter in 2020 represents the highest quarterly increase in DexCom's history. We continue to believe that we are early in our story with the potential to drive a far greater impact on global health. Our growth performance is closely related to the progress we've made to advance access on our CGM systems for people with diabetes. And because there is often so much misinformation spread about access to DexCom's CGM in the field, or the cost of our products for people with diabetes. Let me point out several key points that our investors, clinicians and current and potential customer should know. We've advanced pharmacy access in the U.S where more than 70% of our commercial customers have a monthly out of pocket cost of less than $60 per month and nearly one-third of our customers have zero out of pocket costs for the G6 Sensors. According to IQVIA, this is less than a comparable out of pocket cost for our nearest competitor. The latest research from diabetes market research firm [indiscernible] Partners confirms our conclusion. With DexCom having the lowest customer copays of the three largest CGM suppliers in the U.S for customers on intensive insulin therapy. We've significantly expanded coverage for people with intensively managed type 2 diabetes, with the overwhelming majority of these patients now having coverage for DexCom CGM in the U.S. We also continue to advocate for equitable access to our CGM supplies for populations that are often underserved. As of July 2021, there are now 43 state Medicaid programs providing coverage for DexCom CGM, including a growing number of states providing access to the pharmacy channel for both type 1 and type 2 intensive users. We are building even more on those advocacy efforts in collaboration with several key nonprofit organizations that support the diabetes community. In June, we launched the global movement for time and range to broaden awareness of time and range and its benefits for people with diabetes and their health care providers. And we hope that this collaboration effort will lead to future solutions for improved CGM access. Our teams have taken a leading role to drive the removal of administrative barriers that prevent people with diabetes from accessing the benefits of real-time CGM. Along these lines, we are pleased to see the update from CMS in the second quarter to remove the requirement of at least four daily fingersticks for Medicare customers. This will simplify the CGM onboarding process for both customers and clinicians. We've also made solid progress internationally, building from our position of operational strength to advocate for broader reimbursement for G6. This initiative is moving forward according to plan with several geographies publicly announcing enhancements to their coverage of DexCom CGM in the second quarter. Despite these developments, a majority of people on mealtime insulin continue to manage their diabetes with fingersticks. Even in U.S., a leader in CGM adoption, we continue to believe that the type 1 market remains less than 50% penetrated and the type 2 intensive market is less than 25% penetrated. So there remains a great opportunity ahead of us even in the markets that we currently serve. At the same time, we are generating a growing evidence base for the use of DexCom CGM. At the ATTD and ADA industry conferences in June, we presented exciting research affirming the benefits of our product platform, including the ALERTT1 trial. This randomized controlled trial was simultaneously published in The Lancet showing superior health outcomes associated with the use of DexCom CGM relative to our nearest competitors/glucose monitor. These conferences also featured several presentations on the use of CGM for people with type 2 diabetes, including those not using mealtime insulin as well as use in women who are pregnant, use in the hospital setting and even conclusions applicable to health and wellness using CGM data. Perhaps the most significant of these presentations was the long awaited readout of our MOBILE trial, which was also published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. MOBILE was another rigorous randomized controlled trial assessing the value of DexCom CGM compared to the current standard of care Fingersticks. For people with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin. Importantly, the study looked at a diverse user base representative of the U.S population, and it assess these people in the primary care clinical environments where they're traditionally served. So what did we see? We saw a clinically significant A1c reductions for uses of our DexCom CGM systems. And perhaps even more telling, we saw a 16% time and range increase for the CGM cohort, which is four additional hours per day spend in the target glucose range. These were results produced with DexCom CGM and DexCom Software. We design the trial with the goal of changing the standard of care for these basal insulin users, a group that we believe includes between 3 million and 4 million people in the U.S alone. With these results, we feel that mobile index com have the potential to do just that. And our team's look forward to driving better awareness and access based on the study outcomes and the JAMA publication. We also made great progress in the second quarter to advance the clinical and regulatory pathway for our next generation G7 CGM system. At ATDD in June, we provided an update on the performance of G7 drawn from our recent clinical trials. Based on the data shown we expect the G7 will continue the excellent clinical and real world performance and reliability that we have established with our G6 brand. And we will do so with several factors that we believe will enhance our customer experience, including a fully disposable sensor and transmitter a redesigned app experience and a market leading 30 minute warm-up period. Our G7 continues to progress according to our plans. During the second quarter, we concluded our U.S clinical trial that will support our ICJM filing, our teams have now shifted to processing the data and working toward preparing the regulatory filing. In addition, we've recently submitted G7 for CE Mark approval. As we previously discussed, we believe that this timing places still on track to begin the G7 launch by the end of 2021. These are incredible achievements and advances from the quarter and I step forward to fulfill the promise presented by our CGM technology. And this is just the beginning. There are several additional areas of progress that Jereme and Queen will discuss based on the great work of our teams in the past several months. So with that said, let me turn it over to Jereme for a review of our second quarter financial performance. Jereme? Thanks, Quentin. I agree with that message as we are all very pleased with the progress that we made during the quarter. To be able to raise guidance across the board, including another revenue raise was $65 million added to the midpoint of guidance is a great result for the company. We're excited to continue that momentum into the second half of the year. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Well, I'll start with G7. Then I'll let Quentin and Jereme take over the benefit expansion. I mean, with respect to G7 we're very deliberate about what we disclose. We have filed for CE Mark and we are on schedule for that we hit our goal there. And we are now gathering the data from the U.S pivotal study. It was a much larger study than the data it was presented at ATDD. However, the trial was run under actually what we think are improved protocols from what we ran before. So we have no reason not -- to not expect great data. We believe the product will be very robust. We will make sure that we deliver that file in a very pristine manner. We hear a lot of things about FDA delays and things of that nature. We don't want to create delays, it's been our experience over time, and we deliver what the FDA expects, they move very quickly and they're very cooperative with us. We have no reason to believe the file we're preparing isn't going to meet those expectations, or moving along those lines. So again, with the CE Mark filing, we're on track for an OUS launch later this year. And we'll update you more on the U.S as time goes on. Yes, Robbie, with respect to your question or comments on the OUS business. Look, there was strength really across the board in that entire portfolio of ours. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there, primarily on the heels of awareness just continuing to grow. To be honest with you, I don't think we've seen the benefit yet of the increased access that we spoke to, really back in the first quarter and the team has made incredible progress. And working with the payers and negotiating these contracts, I'd say we are through 90% or so of those, all landing in favorable positions where we've probably increased or improved access for nearly a million patients in the first half of the year alone, and thaw OUS business. But the reality is that benefits not going to show up until the back half of the year. So the strength in the second quarter, I wouldn't attribute that to the increased access just yet. But we're very excited about how we're positioned as we go into the back half of the year around those access efforts. Sure. So I'll jump on that first one, Bob. We are talking the exact same thing there. In terms of the fact that we've negotiated or work through the majority of those negotiations through the course of the second quarter. More than 90% or so of them behind us all landing in favorable positions relative to improving the access for the patients reducing the administrative, burdens that were there. So that folks can get on the technology a whole lot easier. So very bullish around where we're at, and creating incremental access for our patients, and how that sets up into the back half of the year. The pricing assumptions have come right in line with what we expected as we were going into it, no surprises there. So from our perspective, all those very positive on that front. Sure. So the full year guidance around pricing or channel mix headwinds is still the same. And so the $200 million on what we call the original shift mix primarily in the U.S., It's still the same in the second quarter. It came in a little bit lighter than the first quarter but generally in line and so I think we're seeing that stable and we talked about at the beginning you're being pretty stable throughout the course of the year. To your point on the international incremental headwinds about the access for price conversation that has started its back half loaded. We certainly will have some of those in the first half of next year, as we anniversary, some of those contracts of the $250 million we talked about was really the impact on 2021. And so you'll see the 50 million in the back half of the year, there will be a little of that into 2022. We'll get more into that in the future. But that will happen over a 12 month period. Yes, sure, absolutely happy to take it. So the way to think about Q3 and by default, you'll back into Q4, Q3 generally is not that impacted by changing and shifts and dynamic. In fact, I think for the past few years, you've generally seen it right around that 26% of full year revenue. And we expect the same to happen this year. So I think that'll help you at least think about Q3 and in the balance of the year. We do expect Q4 to have less of a weighting, you saw it in Q1 as a result of the move to the pharmacy where the year gets a little bit less seasonal. I think you'll expect the same in Q4 where you don't have folks in the DME channel rushing to meet benefits. So I do think you'll see -- as we've talked about before, as we make move -- more move -- more and more moves to the pharmacy, less heavy weighting on Q4 and less lightweighting on Q1 and start to move out of that seasonality. But hopefully I give you some context. Q3 in the near-term, we do expect Q3 to mirror that of prior periods, which is generally in that 26% seasonality. Thanks, Matt. That's a great question. I'll take that one. We're not going to give you color on the specific countries, because we don't want to -- for competitive reasons, we don't release the playbook. But we are on track for that. And as we look going forward, it is a very interesting question for us and one for us to debate. How do we use our G6 capacity while we're bringing up G7 lines at the same time, because the two don't intersect. We believe we'll have a market for G6 for quite some time. While we're going to do a global launch and go very quickly, there will be places where G7 isn't going to be available immediately. Our partners are going to take a while to catch up on the automated insulin delivery side. We're working with them now on G7, but we've got it, we've still got some G6 for him to go there. And there's some countries where we aren't yet or some geographies where we need to get started where we can offer G6 in those areas while we sell G7 in others. So we are planning this. It's one of our areas of great debate. And I think we'll manage as best we can. We won't be bashful about taking down GE six lines of G7 is ready to go and is the home run we think it's going to be and we've got several in fairness, Quentin and his operating relations team, along with our R&D guys have developed some absolutely spectacular manufacturing methods for G7. They can give us a tremendous amount of flexibility to expand there very, very quickly and very thoughtfully. So we'll monitor that very, very closely. That's a really good question and something we think about a lot here. Sure. Yes, we'll take that question. And I think there's probably two data points that we can give you that will help you -- get your arms around, the feedback we're seeing. First off, Q2 was a record quarter for new patient adds. So we're continuing to see record new patient adds, no doubt in many ways driven by the work we're doing around DTC and Sales force as well as samples. So I think you've got certainly a data point, that's helpful. The other piece is, is over the past 18 months, we've doubled the active prescribers of our product. And no doubt as we get out and get into the field and see endocrinologists, but also primary care physicians, the work we're doing around expanding that access has yielded really incredible benefits for the amount of prescribers that are out there that are one aware and two prescribing our product. I think those two things are just clear indications of the investments we're making in the awareness in the DTC, in the sales force is paying off. And hopefully that gives you some context, of course, looking at the quarter's revenue performance also helps as well. So those all data points, I think, really give you some color as to why we think it's still an incredible investment and why we think the returns still are some of the best in the business. Sure. Yes, so there's two that are the biggest. The first one is some of the international pricing. You're correct. Does some of that plays through -- we'll have a little bit of pressure on margin. The other one is the launch of G7. When we launched G7, those lines won't be at full capacity. And they won't be at full yields. Just like when we launched G6, and we launched some of the automation around G6, it took a little bit of time to work through some of the kinks on these automated lines. And while we still expect incredible output out -- right out the gate, that's going to cost us a little bit more. And so I think what you're seeing is some of the international access, but then when we launched G7 and those lines start to appreciate the cost of producing those in that shorter period are going to be a little bit higher. To your question is that transitory, all the work that the team is doing around the capability of manufacturing at high capacity as well as high yields, all of that will bounce back and play through. And if this quarter is any demonstration of how good they are, you can see the margins that you see this quarter have shown that this team does an incredible job of yielding out these lines over time. And we expect that to turn around with G7 into the future. But there will be some time as we launched G7 as we get those lines up and running, where there will be a little bit of weight just similar to what we had with G6 that we're going to have to navigate through. But again, I think we're still super bullish on the capability and we're super proud of the team and really expecting that team to do an incredible job as we launched G7. We feel very good about coverage we have there. On the commercial side, it's up over 80% of the intensive type 2 patients now covered for commercial payers plus the Medicare coverage. So we have that it covers a number of these patients already. So access for these patients isn't going to be a problem. It's now all about awareness. We went and double the size of our sales force at the beginning of this year. So we get access to more primary care physicians who do see a lot of the insulin using type 2 patients. And we've seen great results from that team. We've had a huge increase in the number of prescribers of our product over the course of this year. So that is a big win. For us it's about getting to him and explain to him what technology is available. We think this market will be every bit as penetrated as type 1 at some point in time. We view it as a very strong opportunity. Yes, and with respect to the integrated systems, we're very excited for these opportunities. I actually made it out in the field last week. There is a whole bunch of pent-up demand for Omnipod 5. People are very ready for it. They've been ready for it for a long time and we're looking forward to that day as well on the Tandem side. We know they're working on new products and have new projects. I think the best thing I can talk about with Tandem is, just a recent story. I got a note on my computer. Somebody wanted to give me a Facebook message and it was person who told me it's been 22 years on Medtronic systems and is now on Tandem Control-IQ with DexCom and he has never been healthier never had a lower A1c. Never had better, he said my whole life has changed because this system is amazing. So we believe the integrated systems driven by DexCom sensors are game changers. People get accurate sensors, information that can take these sophisticated algorithms and make proper decisions. We're very bullish and optimistic on both these opportunities going forward. Very excited. Yes, this is Kevin, I'll handle the CLARITY piece. With the live API, the patient still has to run the DexCom app in the background. So the data will go straight to CLARITY and it will be there as is now. The better question is will we ever have a CLARITY type system for those who don't have the same needs as intensive insulin users. And I think over time, you'll see us migrate our tools to that platform. Hence, you heard these guys talk about software investments over the last half of the year. And as we look at 2022, we see the same. We're quickly becoming a software company in addition to a sensor company. It's very exciting there. Quentin, do you want to talk ... I think you're right on target. It does take about 6 to 9 months for everybody to get to speed. The one thing we are saying, if I can just give you one trend though, is we try and expand our coverage into the PCP offices where we haven't been before. It's a lot of work. We haven't been there. And as we knock on doors, it's taken these guys a while to get appointments. Once they get in, we're finding the physicians do not know a whole lot about DexCom. And if anything, we totally validated our assumptions. In this expansion, we had to get out there, we had to get more feet on the street and more faces to be as competitive as we want it to and to achieve our goals. Thank you very much. And thank you everybody for participating in and listening to our earnings report today. In summary, this was a quarter of tremendous accomplishment. Just under $600 million in revenue for this quarter with our highest ever absolute revenue and dollar increase when compared to the previous year's quarter. Our worldwide field and access expansion efforts are working exactly the way we planned. Positioning is very well for the rest of 2021 and beyond. 70% gross margins during a period of continued plan annual revenue per patient reductions to increase global access for all diabetes customers, new record operating income during a period of increased investment and what I believe is the most robust product pipeline we've ever had. G7 progress continues. Very important measurable milestones have been achieved on schedule this quarter. And there's nothing like being around here as we approach a deadline. It is just energizing. Other projects here made great progress as well. And finally, we are laying the groundwork for our future growth with irrefutable fact based clinical evidence. This technology will have a major impact in health care all over the world. Thanks, everybody and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $595 million, compared to $452 million for the second quarter of 2020, representing growth of 32% on a reported basis, and 30% on a constant currency basis. As Kevin noted, this represents a record for absolute dollar growth in a quarter year-over-year. U.S revenue totaled $462 million in the second quarter, compared to $367 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing growth of 26%. Our momentum and market leadership position in the U.S remains strong. And we have been very encouraged with the continued interest in CGM in the marketplace. With the combination of greater depth in our sales force, solid results from our direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns and expanded ability to allow for patients and clinicians to trial the G6 experience, we are beginning to see preliminary results in our effort to further expand our presence into primary care offices and position the company to extend our customer base. International business grew about 58% in the second quarter, totaling $134 million. While the second quarter comp benefited from the impact of COVID on our second quarter 2020 results, we saw good sequential growth momentum as the business once again achieved a new high watermark. The international growth was broad based across all markets, including core markets like Germany, the U.K., Canada, Australia and the Nordic Region. Our shift to the pharmacy channel and sales initiatives in the U.S and our market expansion initiatives internationally, are all progressing according to plan, driving high volume growth in both regions. Volume growth for the second quarter came in around the mid 40% range on a global basis. Perhaps the greatest examples of the international effort during the quarter came from Canada, where we saw public announcements of provincial coverage for G6 from two of the largest Canadian provinces. Quebec, where coverage of G6 was established for people with type 1 diabetes, and British Columbia, which became the first Canadian province to cover G6 for people with type 1 diabetes and intentionally manage type 2 diabetes. These public announcements are representative of our broader strategy to advance access to our technology for people with diabetes. We are leveraging the increasing strength of our operations in driving a meaningful expansion to the total number of patients that we can address via reimbursed pathways. Our second quarter gross profit was $417.1 million or 70.1% of revenue compared to 64.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2020. We're very proud of the effort that's gone into these results. The 600 basis points of gross margin expansion is another great validation of the growing efficiencies that we've achieved through product design and efficient manufacturing operations. It is these types of efforts that drive the strategic flexibility to expand our addressable market that I just referenced. Operating expenses were $315.6 for Q2 2021, compared to $213 million for Q2 2020. These results reflect what we previously noted in our discussion of our 2021 plans. We have several areas of investment that we are pursuing, which account for the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales relative to the second quarter of 2020. These include the costs associated with our expanded field sales force, the pivotal trial in support of our U.S G7 regulatory submission, the G7 manufacturing scale up and global direct-to-consumer marketing. Our strategic investments have also included our efforts to efficiently scale and lower the cost to serve our customers. As we envision a future in which we serve meaningfully more people than we do today. Our global business services operations in Lithuania and the Philippines are key examples of those initiatives that are driving great customer service while leveraging our G&A spend. Operating income was $101.5 million or 17.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $76.7 million or 17% of revenue in the same quarter of 2020. The 10 basis point year-over-year improvement was driven by strong improvements to our gross margin resulting from the design of our products in the manufacturing efficiencies that come there through. These improvements more than offset the strategic investment that we've made during the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $156.6 million or 26.3% of revenue for the second quarter, compared to $122.6 million or 27.1% of revenue for the second quarter of 2020. Net income for the second quarter was $75.4 million or $0.76 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the second quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and great financial flexibility to drive our strategic initiatives. Turning to guidance. We continue to expect solid volume growth across all of our regions in the back half of the year with momentum driven by growing CGM awareness globally. Based on our second quarter performance, we are pleased to be in a position to once again raise our full year 2021 revenue guidance. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.35 billion to $2.4 billion, representing growth of 22% to 25% over 2020. This increase comes on top of our expectations for approximately $10 million of unfavorable currency impact in the back half relative to prior guidance. This revenue increase is primarily a reflection of our continued growth momentum as well as the ongoing impact of our channel mix and international access expansion strategies. We will see a greater revenue per patient impact to our existing base from our international access initiatives in the second half of the year. But we continue to expect the incremental volume driven by these efforts to offset those pressures in our base this year alone. More importantly, this will leave us in much better position in the years to come. Turning to margins. We're increasing our full year 2021 targets. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels. Gross profit margins of approximately 67%; operating margins of approximately 14% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 24%. With that, I will now turn the call over to Quen for a scale and strategy update. Yes. Thanks for the question. Certainly nothing that we're trying to call out. I think when we thought about guidance, we certainly talked about the performance in the first half of the year. And certainly thinking about that patient base and how that plays out for the balance of the year. So that's contemplated in the guidance. And look, we raised the guidance $65 million at the midpoint and $75 million when you exclude the impact of currency. So we've certainly raised it and pass through some of that for the balance of the year. As we think about the back half of the year, we simply don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We talked about the impact, and you pointed out the international access, but there still is COVID out there and the Delta variant is out there. And so rather than increase it and get bullish and get ahead of ourselves, we want to see how it plays through for the balance of the year. We do here and this is out there outside the U.S where primary care physicians are taking their practice, and ultimately using their time to administer vaccinations. While we've done a great job navigating through those thus far this year. We do want to be prudent and make sure that we are contemplating and look if we can deliver more than that, we certainly will and will talk to it if we are able to."

            "content": "Thank you, Jereme. As Kevin and Jereme indicated, we made great progress on our key strategic initiatives during the second quarter. It is hard not to be excited about the market potential for CGM after seeing the depth of research using DexCom technology at the recent ATDD and ADA industry conferences. We saw well over a dozen presentations from DexCom's insulin delivery partners, highlighting the clinical utility of DexCom integrated systems and DexCom's leadership in the field of interoperable solutions. Outside of the mobile and alert publications that Kevin mentioned. We also saw several presentations from our DexCom team members, as well as independent investigators with outcomes that are very promising for the continued growth of DexCom CGM. In one study presented by our health economics team, we looked at real world evidence documenting the cost savings for a significant number of patients with type two diabetes using G6, including both the intensive insulin therapy and those who are not treated with mealtime insulin. The results were compelling what the magnitude of cost savings generated for the G6 users being nearly identical to the cost savings we've seen in several of our other pilots. This is yet another data point supporting economic benefits associated with the better glucose control for our customers. And we are excited to leverage this growing evidence base into broader access for people with diabetes around the world. We also continue to innovate our software solutions to enable differentiated user experiences that meet the needs of the diverse customer bases that we serve. Most recently, in mid July, we received FDA clearance on a real-time API software solution. This is to our knowledge, one of the first if not the first, real time API clearance in the medical device sector that enables integration with third-party apps. As many of you likely know prior to the clearance of our real-time API, our various digital health partners were limited to the display of CGM data on a three hour delayed basis through our retrospective API. With this new API partners who are now invited by DexCom have the ability to integrate real time DexCom CGM data into the respective apps and devices. This is another great win for our customers, who will now benefit from the ability to see real time glucose levels in a variety of new displays, according to their needs. At the time of the approval, we announced Garmin and Teladoc [indiscernible] Livongo for diabetes program as early users of the new API solution. In addition, Welldoc and UnitedHealthcare's Level 2, are utilizing our real time connectivity solutions in their integrated offerings. This is an exciting innovation for us, and an example of how we are leveraging our leadership and software connectivity to advance our market position in the growing digital health landscape. On the commercial front, we remain well-positioned to drive growth and broader DexCom market penetration in several locations. In addition to the significant access expansion efforts that we began to implement last quarter to enable multiples of growth in our core markets, we are growing our presence in locations that are relatively new to our team. This includes Japan, where we've recently sent our first shipment of G6 systems to a local distributor. Although we have had a minor presence in Japan to the use of our key for professional CGM. These GS systems represent the expanded use of our product to serve people with diabetes with our core ambulatory solution. We're incredibly excited to bring our CGM technology to empower people with diabetes in Japan, and look forward to developing that as a nice growth market for DexCom. In addition to the strong G7 performance data show to ATTD in the clinical and regulatory updates that Kevin provided. Our operations team is continuing according to plan in our G7 manufacturing development and scaling efforts. We have automated lines producing G7 products as we speak, with a steady cadence of additional lines scheduled to be delivered to the back half of this year and throughout 2022. In addition, the vendors in our supply chain are scaling up G7 capabilities alongside us as we sit here today. We will take what we have learned from these automated lines in San Diego and Mesa and use them to quickly replicate and scale and a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. As we've said before, this effort will be critical to our ability to serve significant customer populations that we think can benefit from our CGM technology. Giving us a clear runway to produce more than 200 million sensors per year, and a much stronger presence in a key growth region for us. Our team is doing a great job to advance our efforts and what continues to be a challenging environment to navigate. because of the impact of the pandemic globally. We are currently building out the manufacturing facility while also scaling our supply chain, putting us on track to be ready for production in 2022. As you can see from our 70% gross margin this quarter, we're making this progress on G7, we are also advancing our efforts towards operational excellence, resulting in even greater improvements and efficiencies to our G6 manufacturing, procurement and distribution capabilities. Overall as I think Kevin and Jeremy would agree. We are very proud of the work of our teams to execute on the ambitious plans that we set forth in 2021. With that, I will pass the call back to Kevin. And, Bob, with respect to the MOBILE study, obviously, we're very excited about it. Just a little time has passed here. We also have a bunch of other analyses on this data that are coming that will support our position on basal insulin reimbursement for these patients. It's time to get the word out. Now, I think one of the big areas here is going to be CMS discussions down the line because a lot of these patients fall into the Medicare bucket. Haven't done any of that yet, but we are looking forward and we're preparing because this day yet, it's just but we are looking forward. Thank you. Yes, what I would say is, look, our confidence level continues to increase and our ability to keep it in that mid 60s range that we've guided to long-term. Is there the opportunity to take it north of there over time? If so you can bet on it that we're going to flow that through and give that up if possible. But look, we're in the midst of evaluating a lot of different potential business models. As you look at the whole type 2 non-intensive space as it opens up. We're looking at the international business continue to expand in a significant way. Pharmacy access continues to grow. All of these things are going to continue to put a bit of pressure on the gross margin profile. But if you saw the way that we were able to take cost out of the product from a design perspective and improve the process efficiencies around manufacturing this, your confidence level only increases and where we can keep that gross margin over time. So we're incredibly excited by what we're seeing, a lot of that doesn't contemplate the fact that over time, you probably see us move into a 15 day where cycle on the product itself, and so there's significant benefits that come there also. So, again, a bit back to Jeremy's point earlier, this is not an area that we're going to get ahead of ourselves. But we feel like we have the flexibility we need to really get after the market opportunities that present themselves and still deliver a very attractive gross margin profile in this business. So maybe I'll start with the reaction. The reaction has been incredibly positive, I think folks understand and desire to see the real time information coming into their tools and being able to put that into the hands of the patients, the more real time that information is, the more reactive the patient can be to that information and improve their outcomes over time. And I think, we're incredibly bullish in the sense that we believe we have the capability in a platform to build these tools off of. And that's exactly where we want to be, we want to provide as much input to these tools as we possibly can and work with as many partners as possible. I think from the very beginning, we've always had a bit of a different approach to the value of information, data and software in particular. And what you're seeing play out right now is part of that vision that we've had there and the approval of the real time API, we've invested heavily in the ability to produce this capability. We understand the importance of interoperability, the importance of putting information in the hands of the patients. That's who DexCom is. And you're going to continue to see us invest in that area and really use it as a differentiator. In terms of how that evolves into the future and, is there opportunity to create value in that, monetization of the data stream or the real time API, those are all things will evaluate over time. That's not our strategy today. Today, it's all about improving outcomes for patients that's going to show up in the way of incremental sensor sales over time. And we're very happy with that approach. But it leaves us with some great flexibility. Yes, so there was no stocking in the quarter, nothing out of the normal. Everybody was at normal levels. In terms of your question on a blended number, I'm not sure what you're referring to. Certainly, we have a price dynamic of around the $250 million. When we say price, it's really more channel. But we want to make sure we're very clear. It's really that shift in channel as well as the international access. We also talked about unit volumes. And I'm not sure if you're referencing that, but our unit volumes on the quarter the growth year-over-year were in the mid 40% range. And so certainly a strong unit volume growth quarter. So hopefully that answers your question. And if you have any other certainly follow-up, we can happy to be -- happy to clarify. We don't break it out. That's our global number. But we can tell you that the growth on unit volume was strong in both the U.S and outside the U.S. Yes, I'll speak to the Malaysia question. Kevin, will jump on the last part of that. With respect to Malaysia, it will not be exclusive -- G7 will not be exclusive to that location. We will start with G7 here in the States, both in San Diego and Mesa. As a matter of fact, lines are there as we speak and will continue to ramp up there into the back part of this year and into next year as well. As Malaysia comes online and the buildings up out of the ground, and we've validated the clean room and the capability there will begin to build out the G7 capability there as well. So we'll have G7 in both locations over time. That's going to give us an opportunity to produce north of 200 million sensors all together. And when you think about the distribution of those sensors, and where they're going both in the U.S and internationally speaking, I think it makes a lot of sense to continue to have that capability here in the States as well in Malaysia, particularly when you start to look at the logistical distribution costs associate with moving that product around in the volumes that we're talking. So it will exist in both locations. I do think over time, the lower cost profile will come out of that Malaysia business. That's a big part of the value proposition there. But that's going to let us serve a lot of those international markets very effectively and efficiently. Yes, in terms of the partners, I mean, you think about the Teladoc Livongo's diabetes program, the UnitedHealth, the Welldoc and Garmin, these are partners that we've had established relationships with in the past. There is a little bit of integration work that goes into providing the real time API and the connection into their systems. These were the easy ones out of the gate that really sync up with and get programs going with. But I think the important thing is we want to be a foundation that we can provide this sort of information into many programs out there, and really improve the outcomes for the patients themselves. And I don't think we can be better positioned to be able to do that right now. So incredibly thrilled with where it's at, and expect more partners to be lining up. Yes, I can take that. So, at first, there's -- these all really needed to be done in conjunction. But the immediate one that you get returns on is, obviously, awareness. And awareness comes in many forms and factors, but clearly through DTC. I think at this point, they all go hand in hand because you're making folks aware, you're getting out into the physician's office, you're making the physician aware certainly through your rep and through the Hello DexCom program, people are getting the opportunity to trial it. And so we all -- we did them all together. So maybe early out the gate, DTC was the immediate shot in the arm, but at this point, they're all really contributing in conjunction. And so that's the way we think about it. Over the longer haul, you think that feet on the street are going to be incredibly important as these physicians need to have relationships with folks in conjunction with all the other offerings that we provide. We have to validate that over time, Kevin referenced it was we get in front of these doctors, we're educating them, but the way I think about it as DTC was the immediate more quick return. But I think at this point, they're all contributing equally."

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we reported strong first quarter results with total revenue growth of 25% over the first quarter of 2020. As I often tell our employees, our ability to thrive as a company ultimately comes down to solving significant problems with a great product. And that is what we continue to see with G6. We hear incredible stories of improved glucose control, reduced disease burden and people being empowered and those responses have only increased as we've enhanced tools to better drive our customer experiences. These stories are coming from multiple sources as well. Whether it is coming from G6 users or their family members, who are gaining better control of their glucose levels to real-time data or clinicians, who are empowered by the ability to gather unique insights into the diabetes treatment of their type 1 or type 2 patients and optimize therapy accordingly. And even new settings, like nurses and doctors in the inpatient setting, who are deploying CGM and learning about its potential to optimize workflows and benefit from our remote monitoring technology. New customer additions are off to a great start in 2021, especially in the U.S., as we continue to see growth across all channels, building from the increased access that we've gained over the past several years. This includes continued traction for people with Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 intensively managed diabetes, both of which have continued the strong growth momentum that we've seen over the past couple of years. We're also seeing a growing number of Type 2 non-intensive customers on G6, not only through our partnerships like UnitedHealthcare's Level 2 program, but also including the other innovative programs and providers that are establishing early access to DexCom CGM. We're also progressing our strategic commercial efforts, with the remainder of our commercial sales force expansion completed in the first quarter and our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts, generating new levels of brand awareness. The Super Bowl commercial featuring Nick Jonas was a highlight for the company in the first quarter. We were able to generate significant excitement for our employees and customers, many of whom have sent us pictures and stories of their pride and feeling represented during one of the biggest annual events in the world. We also contribute to a broader conversation in the diabetes community that we hope will help facilitate broader access to CGM in the future. The ad drove a record number of visitors to our website, a record for single-day new customer leads and significantly more media impressions than we generated in all of 2020. And we are confident that there will be ongoing benefits that will come from the ad. In fact, according to the independent Harris Poll, DexCom led all Super Bowl advertisers in brand equity growth. Overall, it was a great investment for the company, and I'm really proud of our team for pulling it together. Our commercial efforts also include a strong push from our teams to expand access to DexCom CGM technology internationally, both deeper in existing markets as well into new geographies. With DexCom in the strongest inventory position in the company's history as a result of our scaling initiatives, we are aggressively advocating for broader access to our G6 systems for people with Type 1 diabetes and intensively managed Type 2 diabetes, similar to what we have done here in the United States. Since we last reported in February, we have received confirmation from three additional Canadian provinces that they will begin covering DexCom CGM. This is a great step forward in expanding access for people with diabetes. There is significant demand from customers and clinicians, and we are optimistic that we will continue this positive momentum in Canada with both the public and private payers over the coming months. In certain reimbursed markets, we are proactively lowering price to significantly expand access to incremental customer populations. This positions us well to continue to grow sensor volume significantly now and into the future, and we believe the incremental volumes will more than offset the impact of price in the near-term. In conjunction with our commercial initiatives and the growing CGM category awareness, we are advancing the clinical and regulatory path for our next-generation G7 CGM system. As a reminder, we expect G7 to improve all aspects of the current customer experience offered with G6 in a disposable wearable that is less than half the size. We are working to compare the submission for CE Mark in accordance with the new medical device reporting standard in the EU. At this point, we remain on track for our target launch of G7 in the second half of 2021. We also plan to present preliminary data on G7 performance at the upcoming ATTD conference in early June. Our trial that will support our U.S. ICGM filing is also well underway. And we have received outstanding feedback from the investigators and patients involved. We expect to complete that trial in the current quarter, and we'll keep you updated as we progress towards regulatory approvals and launch. Even as we advance our strategic plans and have seen continued customer growth over the past year, the evidence of the global pandemic remains with us. We continue to navigate certain closures and territories that have seen cases spike, and our team remains focused on the three priorities that we have emphasized throughout the past year: the health and safety of our employees, continued supply of our customers and service to our communities. Towards this end, we were pleased to recently work with the State of Arizona, to open the first indoor mass vaccination facility in Arizona, to help the community as it transitions to the heat of the summer months. This facility rests within our Mesa distribution facility and has the capacity to support several thousand appointments per day. I am proud to lead a company whose employees are so dedicated to the service of our customers and willing to think creatively about what it means to be a leader in the communities that we serve. As we come back to first quarter results, I want to welcome a new voice to our earnings call, though he\u2019s familiar to many of you already. Last month, we announced the promotion of Jereme Sylvain to the role of Chief Financial Officer and I'm pleased to have Jereme joined Quentin and I for his first DexCom earnings call this afternoon. Jereme?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. I'm excited to be with you today and in the new role as we advance our work together for people with diabetes. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found on today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. For the first quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $505 million, compared to $405 million for the first quarter of 2020, representing growth of 25% on a reported basis and 23% on a constant currency basis. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth of $100 million or more. Impressively, our revenue performance came against our toughest quarterly comparison in 2020, for both our U.S. and international businesses, as the first quarter of 2020 was largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also saw nearly 40% global unit volume growth in the quarter, demonstrating the continued customer growth in the business. U.S. revenue totaled $381 million for the first quarter, compared to $292 million for the first quarter in 2020, representing growth of 30%. Our U.S. business was the primary driver of growth in the first quarter, with our commercial efforts in rising CGM awareness, driving solid volumes and an acceleration from our fourth quarter growth percentage. We believe that we are well positioned to continue this momentum. Our DTC efforts are driving awareness of DexCom CGM. We have new connected systems coming to market that build from years of collaborative work with our partners and we have an expanded field sales force, equipped with the products that our customers love. Our international business reached another quarterly high watermark, with a revenue of $124 million, or 10% growth on a reported basis compared to the first quarter of 2020. As we saw in the final three quarters of 2020, the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns has had a greater impact on new customer growth in certain international markets, which has a compounding effect on our reoccurring revenue model. Nevertheless, we delivered growth against our toughest quarterly comp of 2020, where international revenue grew 61% before the pandemic. We continue to see strong growth across a number of our markets, particularly in countries where the administrative requirements to access CGM are minimized via our e-commerce channel or via broad reimbursement. As many of you have seen, we've successfully reduced our manufacturing costs and intentionally increased sensor production capacity. Through these manufacturing efficiencies and increased capacity, we are no longer restricted to focusing on high-risk, high-reimbursement populations. With this increased commercial flexibility, we are executing on our strategy to broaden access to our CGM technology by pushing deeper into existing markets we previously could not address. Through the incremental volumes generated by these efforts, we believe we will offset any near-term price impact while better positioning the company for long-term growth. Our first quarter gross profit was $343.9 million, or 68.1% of revenue compared to 63.9% of revenue in the first quarter of 2020. The fact that we are driving margin expansion, despite absorbing the channel mix impact associated with the acceleration of our U.S. business to the pharmacy channel is a testament to the work of our teams to drive down material and production costs. Operating expenses were $297.5 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $215.4 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2021 is a result of several of the key initiatives that we outlined in our original 2021 guidance in February. This includes our expanded commercial efforts with the doubling of our U.S. sales force and increase global DTC marketing efforts, both reflected in the quarterly results. In addition, the first quarter research and development expense includes costs associated with our large U.S. ICGM trial for G7, which will continue into the second quarter as we generate the data necessary to support our regulatory filing. Offsetting those strategic investments, we continue to gain leverage in our general and administrative expenses in the quarter demonstrating the benefits of our scaling initiatives. To that end, as we've previously indicated, we have launched a global business services facility in Lithuania, which is now officially live in servicing our customers. Operating income was $46.4 million or 9.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $43.3 million or 10.7% of revenue in the same quarter of 2020, with 150 basis point decrease resulting from our strategic investments offset by our gross margin improvement. Adjusted EBITDA was $94.4 million or 18.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $77.8 million or 19.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2020. Net income for the first quarter was $32.8 million or $0.33 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the first quarter with more than $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and well-positioned to continue our G7 scale-up and remain opportunistic as we look to expand our growth opportunities. Turning to guidance. We expect some impact to new customer starts to continue during the ongoing global vaccine rollout, particularly in certain international markets as well as continued higher than usual volumes in our U.S. Medicaid channel as the economy recovers. With the strong first quarter performance, as well as the currency benefit that we saw in the first quarter and continue to anticipate, we are pleased to be in a position to raise our full year 2021 revenue guidance. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.26 billion to $2.36 billion, representing growth of 17% to 22% over 2020. This growth continues to factor in strong unit growth volumes, which are offsetting the impact of lower revenue per customer channels and our recent efforts to broaden access to G6 in international markets as well as the impact of currency. Turning to margins. We are affirming the full year 2021 targets previously established on our fourth quarter call. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels; gross profit margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 13%. We continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA margins to be approximately 23%. And finally, as you may have noticed, from a tax perspective, we have transitioned to profitability and we'll have a tax rate applicable to earnings going forward. Our expectation [Technical Difficulty] turn the call over to Quen for a scale and strategy update.\nQuen Blackford: Thank you, Jereme. It's been a pleasure to work alongside Jeremy for the last seven years of our careers, and I am thrilled for him as he now steps into the CFO role. I look forward to watching you and take this next step in his career and look forward to the many contributions that he'll make in his new role, while also excited by the opportunity to turn my attention much more broadly to our strategic and scaling efforts across the organization. Our teams remain incredibly focused on our strategic initiatives and are making great progress on several fronts. As Kevin mentioned, we are advancing our regulatory and clinical efforts for G7 and will present the first set of G7 data at the upcoming ATTD conference in early June. As we press forward toward our G7 goals, we are making steady progress in our effort to scale G7 manufacturing to support our launches and the continued growth of our global customer base. In the near-term, this includes the lines that we are building in our San Diego and Mesa, Arizona facilities. We've also broken ground on our manufacturing site in Malaysia, which we expect to enable us to significantly scale our G7 production capacity to serve meaningfully more customers as we continue to grow our business in the years to come. Even with G7 on the horizon, we remain committed to building on the leading customer experience that we have established for users of our G6 system. Following the December regulatory approval in the US, we rolled out an update to the G6 algorithm in the first quarter. We believe this update will drive further reductions to times in which data is temporarily unavailable and have seen excellent results from the initial launch of this updated algorithm in Canada in 2020. These are the kinds of incremental improvements that we are always looking to provide, and they are contributing to our strong customer retention and satisfaction levels reflected in our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores. On the insulin delivery front, we were encouraged to see the great results from the Omnipod 5 pivotal trial presented at ENDO 2021, and look forward to the upcoming launch of that system for our DexCom customers using the Omnipod pump. With this launch in Omnipod's differentiated patch pump form factor, as well as tandem's continued market traction with their Dexcom-connected Control-IQ, we believe that we are very well positioned to continue to benefit from the growing appreciation for these automated insulin delivery systems. Similarly, we continue to advance our development with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and more recently, Ypsomed, leaving us in a strong position in future years as people with diabetes stand to benefit from greater variety in their choices for Bluetooth-connected insulin delivery options that integrate DexCom CGM. We've discussed the excellent first quarter performance in our US IIT market, as well as some of the key strategic initiatives that we are undertaking to expand access in our international markets. We are also making excellent progress in our effort to drive the third pillar of near-term growth that we highlighted at our 2020 Investor Day, the non-intensive type 2 market. As we've mentioned before, we are taking multichannel approach to enabling access to DexCom CGM in the absence of widespread reimbursement. This involves direct work with payers, digital health programs, health care providers, and integrated networks as well as the patients themselves. The early rollout of Level2 is progressing well, as we continue to see that program expand and our teams are working well with the United Healthcare team to optimize the experience for members using our G6 system as part of that program. We also worked with several partners to expand their use of G6 in their respective type 2 populations in the first quarter. This includes the initiation of commercial pilots with Teladoc Health's Livongo for Diabetes platform, as well as with Welldoc. Everside Health also announced that it will offer G6 to its members with type 2 diabetes in its health staff business unit, and we are proceeding there now in a pilot phase. This relationship builds from our initial work with Healthstat over the previous two years, including the use of DexCcom CGM in a pilot for health screenings at on-site clinics. Each of these relationships is expanding the pool of customers who can access our technology while generating evidence of the utility of DexCom CGM for the broader type 2 market that we believe will drive access and awareness in the future. Beyond these core growth initiatives, our teams continue to advance innovative research and product development that we feel will contribute to long-term growth for DexCom. This includes the hospital market, where we are generating data via our patient registry and receiving great feedback as many hospitals across America continue to take advantage of the FDA's temporary allowance to DexCom CGM in the inpatient setting during the pandemic. This also includes several clinical studies assessing the use of DexCom CGM for better management of gestational diabetes, a solution that we believe can enhance the outcomes for both the mother and the child. And finally, we continue to access next-generation technologies that we believe can build from the sensor platform that we've established with G6 and G7. We look forward to updating you as we progress. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Quintin. As you can see, we're off to a great start to the year and working hard to execute on the strategic pathway that we've laid out for 2021. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question this time and reenter the queue if necessary. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. So we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Let me -- I'll put it into a multi-part question, I guess. But Kevin, I think it's officially one question. But on the channel mix headwinds that we've been talking about here in the last six to eight quarters or so, is it still fair to be thinking around $200 million, plus or minus, this year, and given the exit rate from 4Q of 2020, still fair to think a little bit of that as front-end loaded? And then when I look at your 30% U.S. growth, it would seem like, if I ex out the channel headwinds, the pricing headwinds there, volumes must have grown well north of 40%. So if you could just kind of confirm that from a pricing versus volume mix in 1Q U.S. number, that would be helpful as well. Thanks, guys.\nKevin Sayer: Jereme will take that one, Jeff.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, Jeff. So to your question on what the channel mix headwinds are, we'll just tell you what the numbers were for the quarter. It was about $50 million for the quarter. And if you recall, we talked about it being a little bit more straight-lined over the course of 2021 due to comps. The one thing we have talked about, Kevin referred to it on the call as did I, is that we are going to be a little more aggressive in international markets. And so because of that, we're raising what we call channel mix/pricing headwinds to about $250 million on the year. And that obviously takes into account the aggressive steps we've taken outside the U.S. In terms of your question in terms of growth and unit volume, we talked about unit volume approaching 40% on a global basis. When you take the channel mix headwinds, we talked about, you are correct. The U.S. unit volume growth was well in excess of that, obviously, being the stronger point of the quarter from a growth perspective. So you are seeing that performance on the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much. Can I go back to what you just said, please? To be clear, the $50 million in the quarter, how much of that was U.S. versus OUS?\nQuen Blackford: Yes. So, Joanne, we generally don't break down the two. What we did talk about was $50 million is the global now. A majority of that has traditionally been the channel mix from pharmacy or from DME into pharmacy. But when we give that number, we give a global number. So that was $50 million globally on the quarter, again, heavily weighted U.S.\nJoanne Wuensch: Okay. I'm going to sneak one more because that was a clarification. Is there any reason that it's not possible for G7 to be in the U.S. by the end of this year?\nKevin Sayer: We're not giving any G7 timelines other than we will launch it by the end of the year. As I said in the earlier portion of our remarks, our U.S. pivotal study will conclude this quarter, and then we'll file. We're working on our filing in Europe under MDR rules for CE Mark, and we'll go from there. Time will tell, but everything is going well. We're happy with the progress of the product. We're extremely happy with the feedback we've gotten from clinicians and patients. In fact, one clinician called me this morning in between our prep for this call to tell me how great the product was. So we're very happy with it, but we're not going to give any other timelines on what we have so far.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Congrats on nice quarter, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk about the guidance raise. It was more than the beat you had in the first quarter. So maybe walk us through your new patient assumptions and what's driving that U.S. versus OUS. And if you could comment at all on how the early trends of the Super Bowl and increased DTC spend and sales force doubling has benefited the company so far and what to expect in 2021? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yeah. So we can walk you through it. The guidance raise was approximately $25 million of it was currency. So we referenced some of the foreign currency tailwinds associated with the other half was related to volume growth, expected both in the first quarter and on the balance of the year. In terms of what we saw, in terms of new patient adds in the first quarter, new patient adds were slightly ahead of expectations. And so that's really -- as we look to the balance of the year, certainly, those repeat customers, obviously, play through in the balance of revenue for the year. And so we've added that to the guidance. We still are bullish on the year. We still expect to have a very strong year. I think there was any question there. And I think if you see the performance in the U.S. result, I think you're obviously seeing a lot of \u2013 to your second question, a lot of the DTC, a lot of the Super Bowl ads as well as the new sales force ads starting to really play through, not to mention the fact that we have a sampling program that's out there that is starting to allow folks to trial the product, which we think is garnering interest as well. So that's all been contemplated in the guidance as we lay it out. And I think what you'd say is for the balance of the year, I do think you are seeing the momentum continue to support raising what we raised it by.\nQuen Blackford: And Robbie, I would just \u2013 the one thing I'd add to that is, as Jereme laid out in the prepared remarks, our decision on the international markets with respect to opening up access, I do expect you're going to see that new patient number continue to perform very nicely in the back half of the year as we're accessing markets that are five to six times larger than what we had coming into the year in some of these markets. So very excited about where that new patient number potentially goes to.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Brien: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the pricing commentary. The $200 million to $250 million is obviously a pretty meaningful increase. We've got Libre 3 over in Germany now. You're talking about being more aggressive in terms of lowering pricing. OUS, I think, for more access. I mean, does that \u2013 is it a function of Libra 3? You're trying to be aggressive in front of a more broad launch there with G6 over there? Is that a reason why you're increasing the pricing concessions right now? And then what does that say about when three comes to the US? And how can G7 kind of offset that?\nKevin Sayer: We've not made our decisions based on Libre 3, Matt. We've looked at what we accomplished in the US here, what we've done is we've increased access by going to the pharmacy channel by looking at Medicare approval, for example, which came in at a lower price than what our DME price was before. As we've set up, Medicaid pricing structures in the US that are yet once again a pricing structure lower than what we had before, but to increase access to a number of patients. We then have looked at our OUS business in several of our key geographies and said, you know what, our access is not broad enough. Our access is very much focused on very intensively managed type 1s, oftentimes just children or adults with pumps or adults with an incredibly bad hypoglycemia awareness or something along those lines. And it's more important to us to reach more patients. So we've taken the strategy we've used in the US, and we're deploying it in other places as well to increase our access. We won't let Libre 3 drive our decisions. We'll drive our own.\nQuen Blackford: I think one important thing to note there is the pricing point. It's always been part of our global pricing strategy and the level that we're going to is still very much in line with where we're at in the US pharmacy channel, to be honest with you. So we're just stepping down as we've had inventory availability now. We're in the best position we've ever been in from that perspective. We know we got to reduce the burdens to get on the product. We're in a position now to continue to execute against that global pricing strategy. So this is very much part of where we were heading. It doesn't create risk elsewhere globally. Like I mentioned, it's right in line with our US pharmacy pricing if you get into the comps. So excited about what this has a potential to create for us.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thank you and good afternoon. I just wanted to ask a question on G7. I was wondering if you could comment on two things. First thing, I just want to clarify, when do you expect to file CE Mark in Europe? I thought that was something that was going to happen or might have happened already. And then secondly, I was wondering if you just could comment on the upcoming data that we're going to see on G7, just maybe help give us a sense of just what we're going to see and how meaningful it might be? And just a little bit more detail there would be great. Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: Well, G7, we have not filed yet. We will file it in the not-too-distant future. We want to \u2013 we need all our ducks in a row. For example, we want to file both the Android and the iOS app at the same time, not file one and then do another filing. So making sure our software is validated and verified is really one of the bigger tasks. The clinical data is in, and we're ready with that part of the filing, and we've had direct discussions with our authorities over there, and we feel we're in good shape. But we'll file when we're ready. We don't want to do it twice and spend a lot of time answering questions. With respect to the data that we'll present here in the summer, it will be on some of the smaller studies that we've done. It will not be on any of the US pivotal data, obviously, but you'll see how the product performs and how consistent and how happy we are with it. Obviously, I'm happy with the data and as is our team. I've made the comment on several times when all said and done, everything you love about G6, you're going to love more about G7. And when that product comes to market, that's exactly how we're going to feel about it, not only from the smaller wearable and the easier insertion and all the other wonderful patient. Ease of use features we're putting in there, but the software, the app and the performance of the system, we believe, is going to be spectacular and again, set a real standard for people to go over.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Your line is open.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you very much. Wanted to talk about a few of the commercial initiatives in the U.S. I mean, obviously, still early in the sampling program. You've just completed the doubling of the sales force and kind of shifting some of the focus to more on the primary care. So maybe just help us understand how some of those initiatives have played out in the early days, with respect to the Q1 and early into Q2? And just, are there any metrics, or is there any sort of goal post you can help me frame the early execution on those initiatives for us? And how do we think about that as we move through 2021?\nQuen Blackford: Sure. I'll take a quick shot at the sampling and then hand it over to Kevin here. There aren't any metrics that we're going to disclose, particularly to sampling, in and of itself, although I will tell you, the early response to this program has been beyond our expectations, both from a physician's perspective of just how easy we've enabled these PCPs to get products into the hands of our patients and then also from a patient perspective, when they realize just how easy it is to use the Dexcom product. So the sampling program has been beyond what we imagined coming out of the gate. It will continue to be a big part of what we do into the future. But in terms of giving specific metrics around it, that's not something we will do. I will tell you, it's one of the better investments that we look to make at this point.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, I'd agree with that. With respect to the sales force, we've added everybody we were going to add. Everybody's in place. And everybody is getting up to speed. And some of the people came from a diabetes background, so they get it to speed easier, because they have relationships already established in these offices, possibly from another company. Others, it's going to take a little while longer, and we plan for that as we do this expansion. But as far as calling on more voices, we are learning that, in all fairness, we've been underserved with respect to our ability to call on people. There's a great story we heard from down in Texas. One of our reps called on a physician or -- and talk to them about our product and the doctor said, I know nothing about your product. I've put people on your competitors' product, because they come and ask me for it. So again, using the sample program that Quentin described with Hello DexCom, we put this patient on the system, introduced the physician to it, and now he's prescribing DexCom all the time. Because of the experience that patient had. We needed a deeper reach. We'll get that deeper reach with what we've done, and we'll continue to evaluate over time. And we've got tremendous metrics on our salespeople. We have an incredible commercial organization that monitors that. But we also very much understand it takes a while to get up to speed. The other great thing I can tell you about this expansion, we literally have thousands of people apply for these jobs. And a lot of very, very qualified people that we did not hire. This is a place that people want to work and a product that they really want to represent, and we want to continue that culture and maintain that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew Blackman from Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatthew Blackman: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the OUS pricing strategy and sort of a multipart question here, but is the incremental $50 million headwind you called out isolated to 2021, or will these price headwinds continue beyond 2021 outside the U.S.? And then if I think about the full year guidance range -- raise of about $50 million, I think about half of that you said is underlying outperformance. But that's also in the face of another $50 million headwind on price. So is it fair to say that the guidance rate is actually closer to, call it, $75 million ex-FX on an underlying basis? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So good question. So let's go step by step. So in terms of your question on the international pricing, a majority of the raise is our strategy outside the U.S. And so what you are seeing is we are taking an incremental $50 million of, call it, mix headwinds as a result of going into there. And we still -- yes, you're right. We did raise guidance in the face of that by $50 million, of which $25 million was currency. So absent that incremental, yes, you would have seen a $75 million. Now we are going to be taking those pricing headwinds, and we're going to be taking those pricing headwinds and making up for an incremental volume. So it's, obviously, net neutral to the full year guide. But you are correct. Absent taking on that strategy or because of that strategy, we expect to add new patients to the point where it increases our full year outlook.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Okay. So I'd like to ask one just about the U.S. momentum improvement. That was impressive, and you called out the factors. Is it possible for you to say, which of the DTC, sampling and salesforce, you think, contributed more to that? And which of those is still more to come, or is it just all equal?\nKevin Sayer: I think there are all more to come, and I think they're relatively equal. As I called out on the call, the effect of the Super Bowl, the ad was more than just short-term sales growth, in our minds, the awareness we generated, the text messages I was getting during the Super Bowl from industry and technology executives that I've met over the years made it all worth -- I'm just sitting on the couch saying, hey, this is really cool. It really created a lot of awareness for our company, awareness we hadn't had before, and that was really the goal, as we talked about. We developed more brand equity from our ad than anybody else. So that was important to us. The DTC remains important. As you watch our ads, you'll see certainly more with Nick and certainly other campaigns as well. And then on top of that, having more feet on the street is good. We needed it. But it will take time to develop those relationships. I think of the three, I couldn't quantify one of them, but I think ultimately the sales force expansion will be extremely helpful on this. We probably got less bang out of that just because we were ramping it up in the first quarter, but the DTC work and the Super Bowl ad and that was probably the biggest. And then Hello Dexcom and the reps will come more throughout the rest of the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. Somewhat similar to the last question. The first quarter strength in the U.S., much better than historical seasonality. I'm just wondering, is this more a function of just channel shifts that gone on the business, or a function of the new momentum that you've seen perhaps from some of these new initiatives? I know it's a tough question, but if there's any way to parse that out, that would be helpful.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. So good question. Some of that is a bit of a change in shift in dynamics, and you're absolutely right, as more and more goes to the pharmacy. I think you are seeing that neutralization, if you will, of the Q4, Q1 dynamic. One thing we did see this quarter, and we thought it was certainly a testament to the work that our customer experience team is doing is we saw a slight decline in attrition, and a slight increase in utilization. And so as you think about the customer experience that we're trying to create here, we've been talking about increases in Net Promoter Scores. That's starting to play through and customer utilization have it. So that's certainly something we saw a little bit of. And then I think what we also saw is just a little bit of incremental performance. We saw some of the performance outpaced expectations. I think what we talked about is an expectation of new patient growth, slightly outpacing it as a result of increased awareness as a result of DTC. So I think it's all three of those coming together.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Two quick questions for Jereme on the margin front. First, just given how strong gross margin was in 1Q, I was hoping you could talk about why 65% is the right number for the full year. And then your audio cut out a little bit when you were talking about the tax rate. If you could just go back to that what you're expecting for an overall tax rate this year, that would be great. Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. I'll start with the latter first. We expect the tax rate for the year to be between \u2013 a non-GAAP tax rate between 23% and 25%. Back to your question on margins, we did have a great quarter in Q1. Certainly, we're very proud of the 68%. The one thing we do want to do is, first off, is the first quarter. So we think about it from a first quarter and really thinking about before, taking a look at changing anything, being mindful that we won't see things play out over time. But there's really two components you have to be aware of. We do expect to take on incremental channel mix headwinds in our international markets for the back half of the year. So we have to contemplate that in light of some of the efficiencies you're starting to see. And then getting back to the \u2013 our previous discussions about the drivers when we set guidance is, in the back half of the year, it's when we're going to launch G7. And when we launched G7, the yield that you get on some of these lines generally is a little lower. You saw it also happen with our launch of G6. There's a little bit of step back as you start to work out the kinks of these lines and the yields start to play out. So as those play out in the back half of the year, that's why we don't \u2013 we feel comfortable, very comfortable with our guidance, but we didn't feel any need to raise it at this point and let the year play out.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley.\nCecilia Furlong: Great. Thanks for taking our question. I guess, I just wanted to go back to the pricing headwinds, but just in light of increasing ex-US headwinds, should we expect your 2Q ex US results to look more like they did in 2019, just in terms of relatively flat sequential performance, or can you really still grow ex-US revenues quarter-over-quarter before G7?\nQuen Blackford: Yes. I don't think we're going to get into details of providing specific guidance around US versus OUS, particularly at a quarterly level. I think we're incredibly bullish on where the international business can go. There's so much runway that continues to sit in front of us. A big part of that is continuing to step into this global pricing strategy that we've laid out over a multiyear basis. And really, what you're seeing with the pricing decisions today is that we're in a position now where we can pull some of those decisions forward, where we couldn't have historically. And a lot of that comes down to having inventory available to us being highly confident in the ability to continue to grow and scale into the future. So I'm confident you're going to see terrific results coming out of that international business over time. And with some of these decisions that we've made, we're now opening up access to the patient volumes that are five or six times larger than what we were really addressing historically. So I think all of that sets up very well for a very strong international business here into the future.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the potential impact from doubling the sales force and specifically, as it relates to the primary care physician. I'm curious if you guys have this detail, as to what percentage of your prescribing physicians are coming from primary care today, so we can sort of have a sense of with the sales force doubling and better calling on the primary care, how many more physicians you could potentially capture. Thanks so much.\nKevin Sayer: Well, this is Kevin. I'll take that. Very little comes from that channel right now. That's why we added them, and that's why we've expanded. If you take a look at the Type 2 intensive insulin users, most of them are found in those offices. And that's why we needed to get out there. Over time, this will certainly increase. We expect it to, and those are the expectations of the team we brought on board. We're hearing good anecdotal stories and things are starting to heat up and all reality. And with a large book of business we already have and the recurring orders from our current patients, it's -- we got a ways to go. We think they'll do great, and we'll monitor it. If we see great returns, we'll just keep giving them tools to get great returns is the best way to describe it. And I think Hello DexCom is going to be the best one that we have for that group.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Your line is open.\nRavi Misra: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good evening. Congrats, Jereme and Quentin on the moves. A lot of management changes over at DexCom -- or rotations, I guess, over the last year or so. The question I had, I guess, I wanted to go after the gross margin and pricing commentary from maybe a different angle. When you had the similar type of pricing impact in the U.S. When you started going into pharma channel, we really saw a pretty strong level of uptake through that arena, albeit the pricing headwind continues. So I guess what I'm trying to ask is, do you -- does guidance factor in that type of kind of immediate impact from the price cut, I guess, in Europe? And do you think that $50 million is the kind of extent of it, as we kind of go forward here? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. Sure. I can take that. So our gross margin certainly contemplates the impact of pricing impacts in our international markets. And so, I wouldn't expect any changes there. In terms of the extent of it, as we go after these incremental markets and open up access, we almost look at that as new patients. And so, when we go after new patients and new markets, certainly, pricing is going to change over time. So there could be impacts that drag out over time in the future years, as a result of just going after incremental pockets of patients and any sort of knock along impact, certainly not anything that we would expect to be significant. But that will always be contemplated in our guidance, and it will all be something that we certainly talk to on these calls. I wouldn't expect anything that we provide hasn't been thought through and then contemplated in any of the targets that we provide to you guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Marie Thibault: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats to you as well, Jeremy. I wanted to ask a question on OUS. I understand that the impact of COVID last year, obviously, having an impact on revenue this year. But curious if you're still seeing a COVID impact in this Q1 quarter, as well as the existing quarter here in terms of that still affecting new patient starts. We certainly heard from other companies that Europe is lagging on the vaccine rollout. So would love to hear if that's been contemplated in guidance. And if so, how you expect that to change over the year? Thanks.\nQuen Blackford: Yeah. I think from our perspective, all that we know right now is kind of the environment we operate within with respect to COVID, which we know from an international perspective has certainly created some incremental pressure in pockets of that business, particularly those that require in clinic visit to get onto the product or some of those administrative hurdles that have been put there. In other channels where we have e-commerce, for example, we're seeing incredible results. And so I think one thing to point out on that first quarter international result is that when you look at it from a two-year growth perspective, it's an incredibly strong number. Last year was an absolute record growth for us in that first quarter from an international perspective. So I think you got to normalize that when you're looking at that first quarter growth. But in terms of the remainder of the year, on an international basis and patient adoption, a big part of stepping price down in line with our global pricing strategy was the fact that we had to see administrative requirements reduced or eliminated altogether to get patients onto the product. And so in these markets where we've done that, the hurdle to get onto the product has been removed. And so we absolutely would expect to see patient, new patient acquisition become much easier for us and see that start to take off in a very positive way. So I do think you're going to see that uptick over the course of the year, even in the COVID environment. With, of course, the caveat being that it stays stable to where it's at today. If we were to get worse in some case, then we might have to think about that differently, but we're trying to look at the future based upon what we see today and how it's impacted the markets here in the moment.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. So on pricing, once G7 and Libre 3 are competing with each other, how much of a price premium do you think is sustainable? And how close do you think you are to that premium today in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? And do you see the opportunity to price G6 as a value brand? Thanks for taking the question.\nKevin Sayer: Larry, thanks for your question. We have numerous opportunities here, but I'm not going to give our pricing strategy on earnings call. We -- we're very thoughtful about this. We run several models. We know what our technology is worth, and we know what great benefit we provide. We'll price it accordingly, but we're also going to price our products in a manner to, whereby, our patients have access to it as well. And I think our commercial team combined with our finance team and everybody who's done a wonderful job balancing that. We'll continue to balance, but we continue to grow as well. I mean, look at the volume growth versus our dollar growth this quarter and we already said our U.S. volumes were in excess of the overall volume growth. We've managed it extremely well, and we'll continue to do so.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAnthony Petrone: Thanks. A couple of questions, one on G7 and one on margins as well. Just on G7, trying to get a sense when you look at U.S. timing to entry and efforts to get ICGM, do you think the market actually behaves differently? In other words, new patient starts potentially slow a bit as the new form factor is coming to market? And then on margins, taking the other side, the COGS side, specifically, breaking down \u2013 breaking ground in Malaysia, maybe just an update on timing as to when FDA inspections will take place for that facility. And just a recap of what that can do on the COGS side for sensors on a per unit basis? Thanks a lot.\nQuen Blackford: I'll take the latter part of that with respect to Malaysia. We're clearly well into that project, making great progress. We'll have a building in place as we exit the year, with plans in place to have a clean room up and ready for validation, either at the turn of the year into the first quarter \u2013 sorry, first quarter of next year. So the expectation is we'll be producing product out of that in the first half of next year there in Malaysia. So very excited about what we're seeing there.\nKevin Sayer: Yes. And I'll take the G6, G7 and the cutover question. Again, with respect to US timing, we've not disclosed anything. One of our great learnings on G6 was have enough product ready to go when you go and really be fully ready for launch, and we've made that commitment to our customers that we will be ready when we do launch this product, that we will be able to literally flip the switch and go over. As far as patients slowing their purchases of G6, in particular, in the pharmacy channel, you're buying one month of product at a time. So it's not like you're going in there and loading up with three to six months as we did in the past in the DME channel. And even in the DME channel today, there's less of that loading up by patients with G6 than there was in G5 and G4 prior to that. We don't view that, that people will quit purchasing their G6 is when G7 is announced because in all fairness, our customers can let without it. And when we have the opportunity to take care of them all, what we'll do is organized but as rapid migration as we possibly can. And as far as G6 future plans, we do see a lot of opportunity here, but we really haven't disclosed anything.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Great. Thanks for taking our question. Just had a question on your international expansion efforts. What are some of the key countries and focus for you here over the near term? And are you anticipating any contribution from these new regions in this year's guidance, or is that really more of a driver for 2022? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, I think that will be more of a driver for future years. We've talked about our launch in Japan with Terumo, and that's scheduled to happen in the second half of the year. We got reimbursement in France. As many of you know, so we do expect France to make a bigger part of our business that as in the past. But a lot of large numbers in our businesses, things have gotten so big, they can't give us a whole lot that moves the needle when we start. Hence, the discussion we've had about increasing access in our more mature markets and looking at how we follow similar paths in these other geographies. With the operating capability we have now, there's no sense in going through and selling just the top end of this market. We want to get more aggressive and be more broad. So I think you'll see as we go into these geographies, over time, we'll start as we started in the past, but we are going to get more reimbursement and try to get more patients more rapidly.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez from William Blair. Your line is open.\nBrandon Vazquez: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to one of the comments made during the prepared remarks. And it sounded like there was maybe a little hinting at new connected systems coming this year. Just curious if you could talk about those. And specifically, what those kind of products, I'm thinking, is there something outside of the regular hardware upgrades that we see maybe somewhere on the software side that could be a catalyst maybe for growth within maybe some of the TAM expansion opportunities like the type 2 non-intensives or gestational diabetes or anything like that. So is there anything we're kind of not thinking out of the box here from the normal hardware that will be important in the coming 12 months or so?\nQuen Blackford: No, I don't think that there's anything that you guys are missing in terms of the prepared remarks and speaking to some of those systems. The one thing that we certainly are excited about has to be the Omnipod 5 product in the back half of the year. And we'll let Insulet speak to the exact timing of when we're ready to put that product into the marketplace. But having connectivity into a product like that is something that we're very excited about and believe that they'll have success with, and we'll have success with as well. I think with respect to the whole Type 2 population and the opportunity there, we couldn't be more bullish on the opportunity that sits in front of us. And I think by the day, we learn more and more that increases that bullishness for us and the confidence that there's going to be some real opportunity there to create value coming from it. And you're going to see a study a little bit later this year, mid-year at some of the -- the mid-year society meetings that's going to start to really lay out the benefit of using CGM relative to BGM in this Type 2 population, particularly the non-intensive population that that just demonstrates the sort of impact we can have on patients say, they're on basal only. And that's a 4 million patient population in the U.S. So I think that sort of data starts to really accumulate in favor of opening up a whole another market segment that doubles the existing core U.S. intensive market today that that we're very excited about. So you'll see that data, here mid-year, but I think all of it starts to point to the fact that this Type 2 space is going to open up in a significant way, and we're well positioned to take advantage of it.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Kevin Sayer for final remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, and thanks, everybody, for participating. As we wrap up our call today, I want to take a minute to acknowledge some very important recognition that DexCom received this week. Forbes recently published their 100 company list of America's Best Employers for diversity. DexCom was honored to be number 66 on that list. While we consider this a perpetual journey, we're very happy to have been recognized for some of the work that we've done so far. As far as our outlook on the business going forward, our great quarter fuels our continued belief that best is yet to come. I recently caught up with a friend who a long-time healthcare industry executive and the gist of his message to me was very simple. Everything important in diabetes care is going to revolve around CGM. For example, there are numerous insulin delivery devices and algorithms available for automated insulin delivery. But there's only one CGM commercially capable of delivering the patient experience and outcomes that we've owned vision for a very long time. And that's only the beginning. They're incredible new compounds, treatments and programs stepping forward for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, and we are very confident that the right CGM experience will become an integral part of all these solutions, and we haven't even started talking about the difference we can make as part of our pre-diabetes program. We've never been more excited and engaged in our opportunity than we are today. Thank you again, everyone, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we reported strong first quarter results with total revenue growth of 25% over the first quarter of 2020. As I often tell our employees, our ability to thrive as a company ultimately comes down to solving significant problems with a great product. And that is what we continue to see with G6. We hear incredible stories of improved glucose control, reduced disease burden and people being empowered and those responses have only increased as we've enhanced tools to better drive our customer experiences. These stories are coming from multiple sources as well. Whether it is coming from G6 users or their family members, who are gaining better control of their glucose levels to real-time data or clinicians, who are empowered by the ability to gather unique insights into the diabetes treatment of their type 1 or type 2 patients and optimize therapy accordingly. And even new settings, like nurses and doctors in the inpatient setting, who are deploying CGM and learning about its potential to optimize workflows and benefit from our remote monitoring technology. New customer additions are off to a great start in 2021, especially in the U.S., as we continue to see growth across all channels, building from the increased access that we've gained over the past several years. This includes continued traction for people with Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 intensively managed diabetes, both of which have continued the strong growth momentum that we've seen over the past couple of years. We're also seeing a growing number of Type 2 non-intensive customers on G6, not only through our partnerships like UnitedHealthcare's Level 2 program, but also including the other innovative programs and providers that are establishing early access to DexCom CGM. We're also progressing our strategic commercial efforts, with the remainder of our commercial sales force expansion completed in the first quarter and our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts, generating new levels of brand awareness. The Super Bowl commercial featuring Nick Jonas was a highlight for the company in the first quarter. We were able to generate significant excitement for our employees and customers, many of whom have sent us pictures and stories of their pride and feeling represented during one of the biggest annual events in the world. We also contribute to a broader conversation in the diabetes community that we hope will help facilitate broader access to CGM in the future. The ad drove a record number of visitors to our website, a record for single-day new customer leads and significantly more media impressions than we generated in all of 2020. And we are confident that there will be ongoing benefits that will come from the ad. In fact, according to the independent Harris Poll, DexCom led all Super Bowl advertisers in brand equity growth. Overall, it was a great investment for the company, and I'm really proud of our team for pulling it together. Our commercial efforts also include a strong push from our teams to expand access to DexCom CGM technology internationally, both deeper in existing markets as well into new geographies. With DexCom in the strongest inventory position in the company's history as a result of our scaling initiatives, we are aggressively advocating for broader access to our G6 systems for people with Type 1 diabetes and intensively managed Type 2 diabetes, similar to what we have done here in the United States. Since we last reported in February, we have received confirmation from three additional Canadian provinces that they will begin covering DexCom CGM. This is a great step forward in expanding access for people with diabetes. There is significant demand from customers and clinicians, and we are optimistic that we will continue this positive momentum in Canada with both the public and private payers over the coming months. In certain reimbursed markets, we are proactively lowering price to significantly expand access to incremental customer populations. This positions us well to continue to grow sensor volume significantly now and into the future, and we believe the incremental volumes will more than offset the impact of price in the near-term. In conjunction with our commercial initiatives and the growing CGM category awareness, we are advancing the clinical and regulatory path for our next-generation G7 CGM system. As a reminder, we expect G7 to improve all aspects of the current customer experience offered with G6 in a disposable wearable that is less than half the size. We are working to compare the submission for CE Mark in accordance with the new medical device reporting standard in the EU. At this point, we remain on track for our target launch of G7 in the second half of 2021. We also plan to present preliminary data on G7 performance at the upcoming ATTD conference in early June. Our trial that will support our U.S. ICGM filing is also well underway. And we have received outstanding feedback from the investigators and patients involved. We expect to complete that trial in the current quarter, and we'll keep you updated as we progress towards regulatory approvals and launch. Even as we advance our strategic plans and have seen continued customer growth over the past year, the evidence of the global pandemic remains with us. We continue to navigate certain closures and territories that have seen cases spike, and our team remains focused on the three priorities that we have emphasized throughout the past year: the health and safety of our employees, continued supply of our customers and service to our communities. Towards this end, we were pleased to recently work with the State of Arizona, to open the first indoor mass vaccination facility in Arizona, to help the community as it transitions to the heat of the summer months. This facility rests within our Mesa distribution facility and has the capacity to support several thousand appointments per day. I am proud to lead a company whose employees are so dedicated to the service of our customers and willing to think creatively about what it means to be a leader in the communities that we serve. As we come back to first quarter results, I want to welcome a new voice to our earnings call, though he's familiar to many of you already. Last month, we announced the promotion of Jereme Sylvain to the role of Chief Financial Officer and I'm pleased to have Jereme joined Quentin and I for his first DexCom earnings call this afternoon. Jereme? Thanks, Quintin. As you can see, we're off to a great start to the year and working hard to execute on the strategic pathway that we've laid out for 2021. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Jereme will take that one, Jeff. We're not giving any G7 timelines other than we will launch it by the end of the year. As I said in the earlier portion of our remarks, our U.S. pivotal study will conclude this quarter, and then we'll file. We're working on our filing in Europe under MDR rules for CE Mark, and we'll go from there. Time will tell, but everything is going well. We're happy with the progress of the product. We're extremely happy with the feedback we've gotten from clinicians and patients. In fact, one clinician called me this morning in between our prep for this call to tell me how great the product was. So we're very happy with it, but we're not going to give any other timelines on what we have so far. We've not made our decisions based on Libre 3, Matt. We've looked at what we accomplished in the US here, what we've done is we've increased access by going to the pharmacy channel by looking at Medicare approval, for example, which came in at a lower price than what our DME price was before. As we've set up, Medicaid pricing structures in the US that are yet once again a pricing structure lower than what we had before, but to increase access to a number of patients. We then have looked at our OUS business in several of our key geographies and said, you know what, our access is not broad enough. Our access is very much focused on very intensively managed type 1s, oftentimes just children or adults with pumps or adults with an incredibly bad hypoglycemia awareness or something along those lines. And it's more important to us to reach more patients. So we've taken the strategy we've used in the US, and we're deploying it in other places as well to increase our access. We won't let Libre 3 drive our decisions. We'll drive our own. Well, G7, we have not filed yet. We will file it in the not-too-distant future. We want to \u2013 we need all our ducks in a row. For example, we want to file both the Android and the iOS app at the same time, not file one and then do another filing. So making sure our software is validated and verified is really one of the bigger tasks. The clinical data is in, and we're ready with that part of the filing, and we've had direct discussions with our authorities over there, and we feel we're in good shape. But we'll file when we're ready. We don't want to do it twice and spend a lot of time answering questions. With respect to the data that we'll present here in the summer, it will be on some of the smaller studies that we've done. It will not be on any of the US pivotal data, obviously, but you'll see how the product performs and how consistent and how happy we are with it. Obviously, I'm happy with the data and as is our team. I've made the comment on several times when all said and done, everything you love about G6, you're going to love more about G7. And when that product comes to market, that's exactly how we're going to feel about it, not only from the smaller wearable and the easier insertion and all the other wonderful patient. Ease of use features we're putting in there, but the software, the app and the performance of the system, we believe, is going to be spectacular and again, set a real standard for people to go over. Yes, I'd agree with that. With respect to the sales force, we've added everybody we were going to add. Everybody's in place. And everybody is getting up to speed. And some of the people came from a diabetes background, so they get it to speed easier, because they have relationships already established in these offices, possibly from another company. Others, it's going to take a little while longer, and we plan for that as we do this expansion. But as far as calling on more voices, we are learning that, in all fairness, we've been underserved with respect to our ability to call on people. There's a great story we heard from down in Texas. One of our reps called on a physician or -- and talk to them about our product and the doctor said, I know nothing about your product. I've put people on your competitors' product, because they come and ask me for it. So again, using the sample program that Quentin described with Hello DexCom, we put this patient on the system, introduced the physician to it, and now he's prescribing DexCom all the time. Because of the experience that patient had. We needed a deeper reach. We'll get that deeper reach with what we've done, and we'll continue to evaluate over time. And we've got tremendous metrics on our salespeople. We have an incredible commercial organization that monitors that. But we also very much understand it takes a while to get up to speed. The other great thing I can tell you about this expansion, we literally have thousands of people apply for these jobs. And a lot of very, very qualified people that we did not hire. This is a place that people want to work and a product that they really want to represent, and we want to continue that culture and maintain that. I think there are all more to come, and I think they're relatively equal. As I called out on the call, the effect of the Super Bowl, the ad was more than just short-term sales growth, in our minds, the awareness we generated, the text messages I was getting during the Super Bowl from industry and technology executives that I've met over the years made it all worth -- I'm just sitting on the couch saying, hey, this is really cool. It really created a lot of awareness for our company, awareness we hadn't had before, and that was really the goal, as we talked about. We developed more brand equity from our ad than anybody else. So that was important to us. The DTC remains important. As you watch our ads, you'll see certainly more with Nick and certainly other campaigns as well. And then on top of that, having more feet on the street is good. We needed it. But it will take time to develop those relationships. I think of the three, I couldn't quantify one of them, but I think ultimately the sales force expansion will be extremely helpful on this. We probably got less bang out of that just because we were ramping it up in the first quarter, but the DTC work and the Super Bowl ad and that was probably the biggest. And then Hello Dexcom and the reps will come more throughout the rest of the year. Well, this is Kevin. I'll take that. Very little comes from that channel right now. That's why we added them, and that's why we've expanded. If you take a look at the Type 2 intensive insulin users, most of them are found in those offices. And that's why we needed to get out there. Over time, this will certainly increase. We expect it to, and those are the expectations of the team we brought on board. We're hearing good anecdotal stories and things are starting to heat up and all reality. And with a large book of business we already have and the recurring orders from our current patients, it's -- we got a ways to go. We think they'll do great, and we'll monitor it. If we see great returns, we'll just keep giving them tools to get great returns is the best way to describe it. And I think Hello DexCom is going to be the best one that we have for that group. Larry, thanks for your question. We have numerous opportunities here, but I'm not going to give our pricing strategy on earnings call. We -- we're very thoughtful about this. We run several models. We know what our technology is worth, and we know what great benefit we provide. We'll price it accordingly, but we're also going to price our products in a manner to, whereby, our patients have access to it as well. And I think our commercial team combined with our finance team and everybody who's done a wonderful job balancing that. We'll continue to balance, but we continue to grow as well. I mean, look at the volume growth versus our dollar growth this quarter and we already said our U.S. volumes were in excess of the overall volume growth. We've managed it extremely well, and we'll continue to do so. Yes. And I'll take the G6, G7 and the cutover question. Again, with respect to US timing, we've not disclosed anything. One of our great learnings on G6 was have enough product ready to go when you go and really be fully ready for launch, and we've made that commitment to our customers that we will be ready when we do launch this product, that we will be able to literally flip the switch and go over. As far as patients slowing their purchases of G6, in particular, in the pharmacy channel, you're buying one month of product at a time. So it's not like you're going in there and loading up with three to six months as we did in the past in the DME channel. And even in the DME channel today, there's less of that loading up by patients with G6 than there was in G5 and G4 prior to that. We don't view that, that people will quit purchasing their G6 is when G7 is announced because in all fairness, our customers can let without it. And when we have the opportunity to take care of them all, what we'll do is organized but as rapid migration as we possibly can. And as far as G6 future plans, we do see a lot of opportunity here, but we really haven't disclosed anything. Yes, I think that will be more of a driver for future years. We've talked about our launch in Japan with Terumo, and that's scheduled to happen in the second half of the year. We got reimbursement in France. As many of you know, so we do expect France to make a bigger part of our business that as in the past. But a lot of large numbers in our businesses, things have gotten so big, they can't give us a whole lot that moves the needle when we start. Hence, the discussion we've had about increasing access in our more mature markets and looking at how we follow similar paths in these other geographies. With the operating capability we have now, there's no sense in going through and selling just the top end of this market. We want to get more aggressive and be more broad. So I think you'll see as we go into these geographies, over time, we'll start as we started in the past, but we are going to get more reimbursement and try to get more patients more rapidly. Thank you, and thanks, everybody, for participating. As we wrap up our call today, I want to take a minute to acknowledge some very important recognition that DexCom received this week. Forbes recently published their 100 company list of America's Best Employers for diversity. DexCom was honored to be number 66 on that list. While we consider this a perpetual journey, we're very happy to have been recognized for some of the work that we've done so far.

            "name": "Jereme Sylvain",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. I'm excited to be with you today and in the new role as we advance our work together for people with diabetes. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found on today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. For the first quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $505 million, compared to $405 million for the first quarter of 2020, representing growth of 25% on a reported basis and 23% on a constant currency basis. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth of $100 million or more. Impressively, our revenue performance came against our toughest quarterly comparison in 2020, for both our U.S. and international businesses, as the first quarter of 2020 was largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also saw nearly 40% global unit volume growth in the quarter, demonstrating the continued customer growth in the business. U.S. revenue totaled $381 million for the first quarter, compared to $292 million for the first quarter in 2020, representing growth of 30%. Our U.S. business was the primary driver of growth in the first quarter, with our commercial efforts in rising CGM awareness, driving solid volumes and an acceleration from our fourth quarter growth percentage. We believe that we are well positioned to continue this momentum. Our DTC efforts are driving awareness of DexCom CGM. We have new connected systems coming to market that build from years of collaborative work with our partners and we have an expanded field sales force, equipped with the products that our customers love. Our international business reached another quarterly high watermark, with a revenue of $124 million, or 10% growth on a reported basis compared to the first quarter of 2020. As we saw in the final three quarters of 2020, the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns has had a greater impact on new customer growth in certain international markets, which has a compounding effect on our reoccurring revenue model. Nevertheless, we delivered growth against our toughest quarterly comp of 2020, where international revenue grew 61% before the pandemic. We continue to see strong growth across a number of our markets, particularly in countries where the administrative requirements to access CGM are minimized via our e-commerce channel or via broad reimbursement. As many of you have seen, we've successfully reduced our manufacturing costs and intentionally increased sensor production capacity. Through these manufacturing efficiencies and increased capacity, we are no longer restricted to focusing on high-risk, high-reimbursement populations. With this increased commercial flexibility, we are executing on our strategy to broaden access to our CGM technology by pushing deeper into existing markets we previously could not address. Through the incremental volumes generated by these efforts, we believe we will offset any near-term price impact while better positioning the company for long-term growth. Our first quarter gross profit was $343.9 million, or 68.1% of revenue compared to 63.9% of revenue in the first quarter of 2020. The fact that we are driving margin expansion, despite absorbing the channel mix impact associated with the acceleration of our U.S. business to the pharmacy channel is a testament to the work of our teams to drive down material and production costs. Operating expenses were $297.5 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $215.4 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2021 is a result of several of the key initiatives that we outlined in our original 2021 guidance in February. This includes our expanded commercial efforts with the doubling of our U.S. sales force and increase global DTC marketing efforts, both reflected in the quarterly results. In addition, the first quarter research and development expense includes costs associated with our large U.S. ICGM trial for G7, which will continue into the second quarter as we generate the data necessary to support our regulatory filing. Offsetting those strategic investments, we continue to gain leverage in our general and administrative expenses in the quarter demonstrating the benefits of our scaling initiatives. To that end, as we've previously indicated, we have launched a global business services facility in Lithuania, which is now officially live in servicing our customers. Operating income was $46.4 million or 9.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $43.3 million or 10.7% of revenue in the same quarter of 2020, with 150 basis point decrease resulting from our strategic investments offset by our gross margin improvement. Adjusted EBITDA was $94.4 million or 18.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $77.8 million or 19.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2020. Net income for the first quarter was $32.8 million or $0.33 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the first quarter with more than $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and well-positioned to continue our G7 scale-up and remain opportunistic as we look to expand our growth opportunities. Turning to guidance. We expect some impact to new customer starts to continue during the ongoing global vaccine rollout, particularly in certain international markets as well as continued higher than usual volumes in our U.S. Medicaid channel as the economy recovers. With the strong first quarter performance, as well as the currency benefit that we saw in the first quarter and continue to anticipate, we are pleased to be in a position to raise our full year 2021 revenue guidance. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.26 billion to $2.36 billion, representing growth of 17% to 22% over 2020. This growth continues to factor in strong unit growth volumes, which are offsetting the impact of lower revenue per customer channels and our recent efforts to broaden access to G6 in international markets as well as the impact of currency. Turning to margins. We are affirming the full year 2021 targets previously established on our fourth quarter call. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels; gross profit margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 13%. We continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA margins to be approximately 23%. And finally, as you may have noticed, from a tax perspective, we have transitioned to profitability and we'll have a tax rate applicable to earnings going forward. Our expectation [Technical Difficulty] turn the call over to Quen for a scale and strategy update. Yes, Jeff. So to your question on what the channel mix headwinds are, we'll just tell you what the numbers were for the quarter. It was about $50 million for the quarter. And if you recall, we talked about it being a little bit more straight-lined over the course of 2021 due to comps. The one thing we have talked about, Kevin referred to it on the call as did I, is that we are going to be a little more aggressive in international markets. And so because of that, we're raising what we call channel mix/pricing headwinds to about $250 million on the year. And that obviously takes into account the aggressive steps we've taken outside the U.S. In terms of your question in terms of growth and unit volume, we talked about unit volume approaching 40% on a global basis. When you take the channel mix headwinds, we talked about, you are correct. The U.S. unit volume growth was well in excess of that, obviously, being the stronger point of the quarter from a growth perspective. So you are seeing that performance on the quarter. Sure. Yeah. So we can walk you through it. The guidance raise was approximately $25 million of it was currency. So we referenced some of the foreign currency tailwinds associated with the other half was related to volume growth, expected both in the first quarter and on the balance of the year. In terms of what we saw, in terms of new patient adds in the first quarter, new patient adds were slightly ahead of expectations. And so that's really -- as we look to the balance of the year, certainly, those repeat customers, obviously, play through in the balance of revenue for the year. And so we've added that to the guidance. We still are bullish on the year. We still expect to have a very strong year. I think there was any question there. And I think if you see the performance in the U.S. result, I think you're obviously seeing a lot of \u2013 to your second question, a lot of the DTC, a lot of the Super Bowl ads as well as the new sales force ads starting to really play through, not to mention the fact that we have a sampling program that's out there that is starting to allow folks to trial the product, which we think is garnering interest as well. So that's all been contemplated in the guidance as we lay it out. And I think what you'd say is for the balance of the year, I do think you are seeing the momentum continue to support raising what we raised it by. Yes. So good question. So let's go step by step. So in terms of your question on the international pricing, a majority of the raise is our strategy outside the U.S. And so what you are seeing is we are taking an incremental $50 million of, call it, mix headwinds as a result of going into there. And we still -- yes, you're right. We did raise guidance in the face of that by $50 million, of which $25 million was currency. So absent that incremental, yes, you would have seen a $75 million. Now we are going to be taking those pricing headwinds, and we're going to be taking those pricing headwinds and making up for an incremental volume. So it's, obviously, net neutral to the full year guide. But you are correct. Absent taking on that strategy or because of that strategy, we expect to add new patients to the point where it increases our full year outlook. Sure. Yes. So good question. Some of that is a bit of a change in shift in dynamics, and you're absolutely right, as more and more goes to the pharmacy. I think you are seeing that neutralization, if you will, of the Q4, Q1 dynamic. One thing we did see this quarter, and we thought it was certainly a testament to the work that our customer experience team is doing is we saw a slight decline in attrition, and a slight increase in utilization. And so as you think about the customer experience that we're trying to create here, we've been talking about increases in Net Promoter Scores. That's starting to play through and customer utilization have it. So that's certainly something we saw a little bit of. And then I think what we also saw is just a little bit of incremental performance. We saw some of the performance outpaced expectations. I think what we talked about is an expectation of new patient growth, slightly outpacing it as a result of increased awareness as a result of DTC. So I think it's all three of those coming together. Sure. I'll start with the latter first. We expect the tax rate for the year to be between \u2013 a non-GAAP tax rate between 23% and 25%. Back to your question on margins, we did have a great quarter in Q1. Certainly, we're very proud of the 68%. The one thing we do want to do is, first off, is the first quarter. So we think about it from a first quarter and really thinking about before, taking a look at changing anything, being mindful that we won't see things play out over time. But there's really two components you have to be aware of. We do expect to take on incremental channel mix headwinds in our international markets for the back half of the year. So we have to contemplate that in light of some of the efficiencies you're starting to see. And then getting back to the \u2013 our previous discussions about the drivers when we set guidance is, in the back half of the year, it's when we're going to launch G7. And when we launched G7, the yield that you get on some of these lines generally is a little lower. You saw it also happen with our launch of G6. There's a little bit of step back as you start to work out the kinks of these lines and the yields start to play out. So as those play out in the back half of the year, that's why we don't \u2013 we feel comfortable, very comfortable with our guidance, but we didn't feel any need to raise it at this point and let the year play out. Yeah. Sure. I can take that. So our gross margin certainly contemplates the impact of pricing impacts in our international markets. And so, I wouldn't expect any changes there. In terms of the extent of it, as we go after these incremental markets and open up access, we almost look at that as new patients. And so, when we go after new patients and new markets, certainly, pricing is going to change over time. So there could be impacts that drag out over time in the future years, as a result of just going after incremental pockets of patients and any sort of knock along impact, certainly not anything that we would expect to be significant. But that will always be contemplated in our guidance, and it will all be something that we certainly talk to on these calls. I wouldn't expect anything that we provide hasn't been thought through and then contemplated in any of the targets that we provide to you guys."

            "content": "Thank you, Jereme. It's been a pleasure to work alongside Jeremy for the last seven years of our careers, and I am thrilled for him as he now steps into the CFO role. I look forward to watching you and take this next step in his career and look forward to the many contributions that he'll make in his new role, while also excited by the opportunity to turn my attention much more broadly to our strategic and scaling efforts across the organization. Our teams remain incredibly focused on our strategic initiatives and are making great progress on several fronts. As Kevin mentioned, we are advancing our regulatory and clinical efforts for G7 and will present the first set of G7 data at the upcoming ATTD conference in early June. As we press forward toward our G7 goals, we are making steady progress in our effort to scale G7 manufacturing to support our launches and the continued growth of our global customer base. In the near-term, this includes the lines that we are building in our San Diego and Mesa, Arizona facilities. We've also broken ground on our manufacturing site in Malaysia, which we expect to enable us to significantly scale our G7 production capacity to serve meaningfully more customers as we continue to grow our business in the years to come. Even with G7 on the horizon, we remain committed to building on the leading customer experience that we have established for users of our G6 system. Following the December regulatory approval in the US, we rolled out an update to the G6 algorithm in the first quarter. We believe this update will drive further reductions to times in which data is temporarily unavailable and have seen excellent results from the initial launch of this updated algorithm in Canada in 2020. These are the kinds of incremental improvements that we are always looking to provide, and they are contributing to our strong customer retention and satisfaction levels reflected in our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores. On the insulin delivery front, we were encouraged to see the great results from the Omnipod 5 pivotal trial presented at ENDO 2021, and look forward to the upcoming launch of that system for our DexCom customers using the Omnipod pump. With this launch in Omnipod's differentiated patch pump form factor, as well as tandem's continued market traction with their Dexcom-connected Control-IQ, we believe that we are very well positioned to continue to benefit from the growing appreciation for these automated insulin delivery systems. Similarly, we continue to advance our development with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and more recently, Ypsomed, leaving us in a strong position in future years as people with diabetes stand to benefit from greater variety in their choices for Bluetooth-connected insulin delivery options that integrate DexCom CGM. We've discussed the excellent first quarter performance in our US IIT market, as well as some of the key strategic initiatives that we are undertaking to expand access in our international markets. We are also making excellent progress in our effort to drive the third pillar of near-term growth that we highlighted at our 2020 Investor Day, the non-intensive type 2 market. As we've mentioned before, we are taking multichannel approach to enabling access to DexCom CGM in the absence of widespread reimbursement. This involves direct work with payers, digital health programs, health care providers, and integrated networks as well as the patients themselves. The early rollout of Level2 is progressing well, as we continue to see that program expand and our teams are working well with the United Healthcare team to optimize the experience for members using our G6 system as part of that program. We also worked with several partners to expand their use of G6 in their respective type 2 populations in the first quarter. This includes the initiation of commercial pilots with Teladoc Health's Livongo for Diabetes platform, as well as with Welldoc. Everside Health also announced that it will offer G6 to its members with type 2 diabetes in its health staff business unit, and we are proceeding there now in a pilot phase. This relationship builds from our initial work with Healthstat over the previous two years, including the use of DexCcom CGM in a pilot for health screenings at on-site clinics. Each of these relationships is expanding the pool of customers who can access our technology while generating evidence of the utility of DexCom CGM for the broader type 2 market that we believe will drive access and awareness in the future. Beyond these core growth initiatives, our teams continue to advance innovative research and product development that we feel will contribute to long-term growth for DexCom. This includes the hospital market, where we are generating data via our patient registry and receiving great feedback as many hospitals across America continue to take advantage of the FDA's temporary allowance to DexCom CGM in the inpatient setting during the pandemic. This also includes several clinical studies assessing the use of DexCom CGM for better management of gestational diabetes, a solution that we believe can enhance the outcomes for both the mother and the child. And finally, we continue to access next-generation technologies that we believe can build from the sensor platform that we've established with G6 and G7. We look forward to updating you as we progress. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. Yes. So, Joanne, we generally don't break down the two. What we did talk about was $50 million is the global now. A majority of that has traditionally been the channel mix from pharmacy or from DME into pharmacy. But when we give that number, we give a global number. So that was $50 million globally on the quarter, again, heavily weighted U.S. And Robbie, I would just \u2013 the one thing I'd add to that is, as Jereme laid out in the prepared remarks, our decision on the international markets with respect to opening up access, I do expect you're going to see that new patient number continue to perform very nicely in the back half of the year as we're accessing markets that are five to six times larger than what we had coming into the year in some of these markets. So very excited about where that new patient number potentially goes to. I think one important thing to note there is the pricing point. It's always been part of our global pricing strategy and the level that we're going to is still very much in line with where we're at in the US pharmacy channel, to be honest with you. So we're just stepping down as we've had inventory availability now. We're in the best position we've ever been in from that perspective. We know we got to reduce the burdens to get on the product. We're in a position now to continue to execute against that global pricing strategy. So this is very much part of where we were heading. It doesn't create risk elsewhere globally. Like I mentioned, it's right in line with our US pharmacy pricing if you get into the comps. So excited about what this has a potential to create for us. Sure. I'll take a quick shot at the sampling and then hand it over to Kevin here. There aren't any metrics that we're going to disclose, particularly to sampling, in and of itself, although I will tell you, the early response to this program has been beyond our expectations, both from a physician's perspective of just how easy we've enabled these PCPs to get products into the hands of our patients and then also from a patient perspective, when they realize just how easy it is to use the Dexcom product. So the sampling program has been beyond what we imagined coming out of the gate. It will continue to be a big part of what we do into the future. But in terms of giving specific metrics around it, that's not something we will do. I will tell you, it's one of the better investments that we look to make at this point. Yes. I don't think we're going to get into details of providing specific guidance around US versus OUS, particularly at a quarterly level. I think we're incredibly bullish on where the international business can go. There's so much runway that continues to sit in front of us. A big part of that is continuing to step into this global pricing strategy that we've laid out over a multiyear basis. And really, what you're seeing with the pricing decisions today is that we're in a position now where we can pull some of those decisions forward, where we couldn't have historically. And a lot of that comes down to having inventory available to us being highly confident in the ability to continue to grow and scale into the future. So I'm confident you're going to see terrific results coming out of that international business over time. And with some of these decisions that we've made, we're now opening up access to the patient volumes that are five or six times larger than what we were really addressing historically. So I think all of that sets up very well for a very strong international business here into the future. Yeah. I think from our perspective, all that we know right now is kind of the environment we operate within with respect to COVID, which we know from an international perspective has certainly created some incremental pressure in pockets of that business, particularly those that require in clinic visit to get onto the product or some of those administrative hurdles that have been put there. In other channels where we have e-commerce, for example, we're seeing incredible results. And so I think one thing to point out on that first quarter international result is that when you look at it from a two-year growth perspective, it's an incredibly strong number. Last year was an absolute record growth for us in that first quarter from an international perspective. So I think you got to normalize that when you're looking at that first quarter growth. But in terms of the remainder of the year, on an international basis and patient adoption, a big part of stepping price down in line with our global pricing strategy was the fact that we had to see administrative requirements reduced or eliminated altogether to get patients onto the product. And so in these markets where we've done that, the hurdle to get onto the product has been removed. And so we absolutely would expect to see patient, new patient acquisition become much easier for us and see that start to take off in a very positive way. So I do think you're going to see that uptick over the course of the year, even in the COVID environment. With, of course, the caveat being that it stays stable to where it's at today. If we were to get worse in some case, then we might have to think about that differently, but we're trying to look at the future based upon what we see today and how it's impacted the markets here in the moment. I'll take the latter part of that with respect to Malaysia. We're clearly well into that project, making great progress. We'll have a building in place as we exit the year, with plans in place to have a clean room up and ready for validation, either at the turn of the year into the first quarter \u2013 sorry, first quarter of next year. So the expectation is we'll be producing product out of that in the first half of next year there in Malaysia. So very excited about what we're seeing there. No, I don't think that there's anything that you guys are missing in terms of the prepared remarks and speaking to some of those systems. The one thing that we certainly are excited about has to be the Omnipod 5 product in the back half of the year. And we'll let Insulet speak to the exact timing of when we're ready to put that product into the marketplace. But having connectivity into a product like that is something that we're very excited about and believe that they'll have success with, and we'll have success with as well. I think with respect to the whole Type 2 population and the opportunity there, we couldn't be more bullish on the opportunity that sits in front of us. And I think by the day, we learn more and more that increases that bullishness for us and the confidence that there's going to be some real opportunity there to create value coming from it. And you're going to see a study a little bit later this year, mid-year at some of the -- the mid-year society meetings that's going to start to really lay out the benefit of using CGM relative to BGM in this Type 2 population, particularly the non-intensive population that that just demonstrates the sort of impact we can have on patients say, they're on basal only. And that's a 4 million patient population in the U.S. So I think that sort of data starts to really accumulate in favor of opening up a whole another market segment that doubles the existing core U.S. intensive market today that that we're very excited about. So you'll see that data, here mid-year, but I think all of it starts to point to the fact that this Type 2 space is going to open up in a significant way, and we're well positioned to take advantage of it."

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'd like to start by reviewing some of DexCom's key accomplishments in 2022. Total revenue grew 20% on an organic basis driven by another year of record new customer starts. This translates into more than $475 million of organic revenue growth compared to last year as we saw another step forward for CGM awareness and DexCom brand loyalty. We added nearly 450,000 DexCom users to our base in 2022 and ended the year with close to 1.7 million customers globally. Our team did a great job generating this customer engagement and growth while simultaneously enhancing the scale and efficiency of our organization. Our operations team demonstrated world-class performance this year, ensuring adequate supply in a difficult macro environment and providing on-time delivery rates of greater than 99%. We drove over 500 basis points of operating expense leverage in 2022 despite broad inflationary pressure. This was not the result of reactionary cost cutting. Instead, it reflects decisions made years ago at our company to foster a culture of cost discipline as we grow. From a strategic perspective, we will look back at 2022 as a pivotal year for our company. We advanced several of our most important initiatives, including multiple new product launches, significant access wins, new market development and a further extension of our market-leading performance in connectivity. Everything we achieved this past year helps build a foundation for years of sustainable growth ahead. For example, in October, CMS published a proposed local coverage determination that would meaningfully expand access to CGM technology for the Medicare population. This proposal would broaden coverage to include people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only as well as certain non-insulin-using individuals that experience hypoglycemia. This result was led by the publication of DexCom's MOBILE study and furthered by a strong partnership with the diabetes community. We heard broad support and enthusiasm from key stakeholders during the comment period and expect the ruling to be finalized in the coming months. As a reminder, we size the basal-only type 2 population at 3 million people in the United States. Between this Medicare ruling and broader commercial coverage which we expect to follow shortly, this population has the potential to nearly double our addressable reimbursed market in the United States. Outside the United States, our team has been equally focused on building greater access. We drove many positive coverage decisions from Mobile payers over the course of 2022. These access wins were in response to the strong clinical evidence we continue to generate as well as the introduction of our portfolio strategy in many of these markets. 2022 was the first time that we brought multiple DexCom products to a single market and this strategy has enabled us to significantly extend our reach. By offering multiple products, we can provide a unique value proposition that meets the specific needs of our diverse base of customers, clinicians and payers. A great example is in the U.K., where DexCom ONE was added to the national formulary for all people with intensively managed diabetes. Collectively, our international access initiatives have helped us expand our reimbursed coverage by 3.5 million lives over the past 18 months. 2022 will also be remembered as the year of G7. We received both CE Mark and FDA regulatory clearance for G7 and initiated a full launch outside the United States. The feedback from our customers has been everything we'd hope for. We are hearing consistent praise for the new features, such as the 60% smaller form factor, shorter warm-up period and more engaging and consumer-friendly app. Perhaps the most encouraging is that 97% of initial users surveyed have found G7 easy to use. We designed this product to simplify the lives of our customers and we are thrilled to see that emphasis resonating. All of this leaves us incredibly excited to bring G7 to the U.S. In fact, we began shipping this week into our U.S. distribution channels to support our rollout. We have quickly ramped up production capacity to support the launch with our automated G7 lines already capable of producing more than 100,000 sensors a day. We want to get G7 into the hands of as many people as possible. So in conjunction with our launch, we've established a bridge program to simplify access for our early adopters. This program will provide new and existing customers access to G7 immediately and allow us to go to market in a broad and expedited manner. Behind the scenes, we continue to advance our discussions with payers to build reimbursement. Our conversations have progressed very well and we are well on track with our G7 coverage plans. More importantly, we are not going to be bashful about what we think of this product. G7 is the new gold standard in diabetes technology. This is the most accurate, easy-to-use and accessible CGM ever produced and we want to share this message with the world. As a result, we will be releasing our second-ever Super Bowl commercial this Sunday. We're again teaming up with one of our most recognizable DexCom warriors, Nick Jonas, to announce the G7 is here. This is a great opportunity to connect not only with our loyal G6 users but with the millions of people with diabetes that still do not use CGM. We want these individuals, their caregivers and their loved ones to know that DexCom can help them live healthier lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Jereme for a review of the fourth quarter financials. Jereme?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported worldwide revenue of $815 million compared to $698 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, representing growth of 20% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $606 million for the fourth quarter compared to $517 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing growth of 17%. Our recent momentum in the U.S. continued into Q4 as we delivered another strong quarter of volume growth and solid new customer starts. We were very encouraged by the prescribing trends we saw in the fourth quarter and we closed the year with around 75% of our commercial scripts going through the pharmacy channel. This represents the endpoint of a multiyear channel journey. And we believe our current structure maximizes access for our users as the most covered CGM and supports greater customer choice in how they access the most accurate CGM. International revenue grew 15%, totaling $209 million in the fourth quarter. International organic revenue growth was 27% for the fourth quarter. We continue to take share in international markets as the introduction of new products and access wins over the past year leave us in a wonderful position to compete for new users. For example, in response to the sizable U.K. coverage decision we received last August, our revenue growth has accelerated over the past 2 quarters in that region. Even though this was already one of our largest OUS markets, there has been a clear uptick in demand following this broad expansion of access. Our fourth quarter gross profit was $544 million or 66.7% of revenue compared to 67.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021. Foreign currency was an 80 basis point negative impact on gross margin in the quarter. Operating expenses were $372 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $461 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized an $87 million expense associated with the contingent milestone under the 2018 collaboration and license agreement with Verily Life Sciences. Absent this, our operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 would have been relatively flat year-over-year. This represents another quarter of very disciplined cost management as we generated 800 basis points of OpEx leverage. Operating income was $172.1 million or 21.1% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $12 million or 1.7% of revenue in the same quarter of 2021. Even excluding the Verily charge from 2021, this highlights incredibly strong operating expense leverage in our current year which more than offsets our step backwards in gross margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $237.1 million or 29.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $67.3 million or 9.6% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021. Net income for the fourth quarter was $136.3 million or $0.34 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents. This cash level provides organizational flexibility to support our organic growth opportunity and assess strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis, such as the accelerated share repurchase program we executed in 2022 and ongoing development of our Malaysia manufacturing facility. Turning to 2023 guidance. As we stated last month. We anticipate total revenue to be in the range of $3.35 billion to $3.49 billion, representing growth of 15% to 20%. This reflects another year of strong underlying volume growth which will again exceed our revenue growth rate for the year. To help provide some insight into the makeup of our guidance this year, we recently provided some additional color around our expectations. First, earlier on this call, Kevin discussed our plans to support our initial G7 customers with a bridge program. We expect this program to impact our revenue per customer early in the year as we provide G7 access at an affordable cash rate as we build reimbursement. We expect this impact to narrow over the course of the year as broader coverage is secured. Internationally, we estimate that around 1/3 of our new customer starts will come in through the DexCom ONE platform. Therefore, this business will start to have a more material impact on numbers this year as that customer base builds. For the type 2 basal opportunity, we anticipate CMS reimbursement to be finalized for this population by midyear and begin contributing to our results in the second half of 2023. We expect this population to contribute approximately 1% of our total revenue in 2023. Turning to margins. We expect gross profit margin to be in the range of 62% to 63%. This assumed year-over-year decline is primarily related to the impact of the broader G7 launch. As with any launch, we will initially be running at lower production volumes and it will take some time for our new manufacturing lines to scale. Importantly, this is a temporary dynamic and we still expect G7 product costs to be less than G6 at scale. Despite the step backwards in gross margin, we are guiding for operating margins to be relatively flat year-over-year at 16.5% which reflects another 150 to 250 basis points of operating expense leverage in 2023. This is the result of ongoing cost initiatives at our organization which continue to drive leverage even as we allocate greater investment to support our global commercial infrastructure and G7 launch. Finally, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 26% in 2023. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Jereme. To summarize, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead with G7 and we're rolling out product to our distributors as we speak and we're ready for a big launch in the U.S. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. [Operator Instructions] Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Let me ask you just a 2-part question on G7, if I could. Kevin, on your website, you talk about adding more commercial coverage for G7 every day. I guess, could you give us a number of what percentage of covered lives or lives are covered currently in the commercial channel for G7 and where you expect that to go maybe over the next quarter or two? And I think Libre 3 has now been in the pharmacy channel for about 4 months or so in the U.S. Obviously, your business looks like it's probably safe with the AID users in the Medicare channel. But for your stand-alone T1 users, have you seen any change in your attrition rate? Anything as we kind of look at that Libre 3 versus G6 dynamic that has changed in the last few months that Libre 3 has been out there?\nJereme Sylvain: Thanks, Jeff. Yes, I appreciate that. This is Jereme. So to your question on coverage, we're still in the throes of the commercial DME and the Medicare coverage. We talked about on G7 taking about 90 days. But on the pharmacy side, we're actually a little bit ahead of schedule. Kevin referenced, we're well on track to the point where I talked about, about a $30 million-ish hit in Q1 as a result of our bridge program. That number is more like $15 million now and that's because some of those pharmacy contracts are coming in earlier. So we are making great progress and we continue to get that every day. And the signs lead to more and more contracts coming over, maybe even ahead of schedule. In terms of the question then on competitive dynamics, maybe I can start and then Kevin will obviously have a few thoughts there. We had a record new patient start in Q4. If that gives you any context to we had another solid new patient quarter. So while we have seen competitive product out there, we continue to do very, very well with G6 to the point where we have seen incredible strength there. And that's, of course, on the heels of a G7 launch which as we referenced, is coming out here in the next coming days. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything else to add there.\nKevin Sayer: No. I would tell you what we're also hearing is a great deal of excitement from our user base for G7. So with respect to your question regarding how our G6 users doing, they're very anxious to get G7 and very excited to go. So we're feeling good about where we are right now.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Larry Beigelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Beigelsen: Kevin, I wanted to ask about the ramp in the type 2 basal population. I think people were a little surprised you only expected 1% growth contribution in '23. I guess, that would be about $60 million on an annual run rate. At the last investor meeting, you said you expect $700 million in revenues in 2025 from sources other than insulin-intensive patients and I think this was mostly type 2 basal. So the question is, do you still expect $700 million by 2025 from these non-intensive sources? And how do you see the ramp in the type 2 basal population?\nKevin Sayer: Well, Larry, our -- I'm going to talk for a bit. I'll turn it over to Jereme. Our initial estimates, it's 1% of our total revenues would come from that. And that's a reasonably sized number. We plan for July, second half of the year, approval and rolling it out from there. It may go faster than that but we've been conservative in our estimates and we will make every attempt to beat those. As we look out to 2025, that non-intensive insulin space is not just basal users. We believe our CGM product will be very valuable amongst a number of markets in the type 2 space and also in metabolic health. So it's not just basal users there. It's a lot more than that. And many of the basal users, as you well know, move up to be intensive insulin users as well. So we view that population as moving and shifting with us as they go. Jereme, you have anything else to add?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. Larry, so the $60 million number you're referencing would assume, say, everybody started on July 1 and they went through the end of the year. The reality is that some folks will start in July, some folks will start in December. And so really, the exit velocity is much higher than that on a run rate perspective. If you were to blend it, average it over the course of the year, you're really only getting 3 months of revenue contribution. And so you kind of do the math there and the exit rate is a little bit higher than I think what you're implying. So we are really, really bullish on it. But it is a recurring revenue business. So what we need to do is get those -- get that coverage out there, get the scripts in. And so, look, I understand the question. It's a big, big market with a big, big opportunity. We plan on playing in it and we plan on playing it in a big way. But obviously, we want to be prudent around guidance. And certainly, if things go better than that, then we'll always try to do so. We'll report back to everybody.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Margaret [ph] with William Blair.\nUnidentified Analyst: I wanted to maybe take Larry's question a step further and just kind of talk about the potential pace of adoption within type 2 basal, maybe not just this year but really more over an 18-month, 24-month period? And is it fair at all to compare it to, I guess, what attritional type of insulin diabetic population is? Is it going to be easier, harder, I guess, to drive adoption or are there guardrails on penetration? And then just because you brought up metabolic health to non-insulin diabetics, 2025 is just around the corner. So should we expect, I guess, a more meaningful impact from here as early as next year?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So let me start on the base and then I can turn it over to Kevin from that perspective. And so the ramp in basal is going to be a bit interesting. We'll give you kind of the way we think about it. Think about it as -- I generally start with type 2 intensive and you think about that ramp and you think about coverage and how that takes place. And if the coverage takes place over a similar time, you'd expect a relatively similar ramp. Now, I'd caveat that by saying there's more awareness today. And hence, the Super Bowl commercial is a good opportunity for us to continue to raise that awareness. However, the place in which the basal patients cede is a wider swath of physicians. And so we don't have an exact crystal ball here. If you're using prior analogs, the best analog is type 2 intensive would be about the adoption rate. But I think as time moves on, we'll be able to give you a little bit more color. But that's kind of our best crystal ball. And then maybe, Kevin, if you want to give just some general thoughts about metabolic health and the opportunities there.\nKevin Sayer: No. As we look out to the future, Margaret, particularly with our easy-to-use G7 platform that we're launching today, we believe our future is very bright as we deal with metabolic health. We've changed our mission statement to help people control their health, not just diabetes anymore. We continue to see very positive results from several programs who are using sensors to assist people in these endeavors. And over time and particularly with type 2 management and all the type 2 drug alternatives on the horizon, we believe CGM becomes a very important part of that health equation. And we're continuing to work on product offerings and business models. So it will be differentiated from what we do today and geared towards that population. We're really excited about the opportunity. And it will continue to mature over 2023 and then we'll see what happens in 2024. We've got a lot of basal patients to reach first. So let's go after them and then we'll continue to move to the other areas as well.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Congrats on a nice quarter. Wanted to ask about the European or OUS experience. And it looks like you're gaining share, you're doing well. How much of that is being driven by G7? And what's the feedback there? And any head-to-head color you could give us versus Libre 3 in the markets where it participates? And then also sort of same question on DexCom ONE and the impact you're seeing there.\nKevin Sayer: I will start off. With respect to the sales and the revenue numbers, G7 and DexCom ONE are still early enough in their launch life cycle that while they're additive, they're not what's driving a lot of the adoption, a lot of the growth that we've seen in European markets. A lot of that's been what we've established with G6, the additional coverage that we've obtained, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, in 18 months, we've added 3.5 million more reimbursed lives. That being said, initial response to G7 has been everything we'd hoped for. People love the app. They love the receiver. Again, in many of these markets, the receiver is a very, very strong tool. My most recent conversation with the G7 user focused completely around the 0.5-hour warm-up. A 0.5-hour warmup has eliminated 90 minutes of the longest 2 hours of somebody's life who ever used the G6. And certainly, in the comparative front compared to the hour warm-up, again, it is a much better experience. The majority of our G6 users are new to DexCom. They're not DexCom upgrade -- I mean G7 users, I apologize. The majority of our G7 users are new to DexCom. Some of them come from the competition. Some of them have not used CGM before but they're all finding it very easy to use and having great experiences. So we're very happy with the product to this point in time. We've done very well.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: So I'd like to spend just a minute on the gross margin and how you anticipate those ramping throughout the year. And then while I know we're sort of early to think -- be thinking about 2024, I do think people are looking at that as sort of a more normalized margin rate and if you could sort of shed any light on how to think about that.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate that. And you start off with, obviously, the fourth quarter. We had a really strong gross margin. I think it's a demonstration of what's to come with what our teams can do when you give them time with a new product launch. So I think as you think about the year, the cadence for 2023, we do expect in the first half of the year margins to be a little bit lower. And that's because of, as Kevin referenced earlier, the bridge program. Certainly, that has an impact. But most importantly, it's the launch of G7. Volumes won't be at where they would have been, say, in a more mature launch and we'll still be going through some of those early manufacturing scrap and yield challenges we always see. But what we've proven time and time again is if you give our engineering and R&D team time with these lines, they continue to get yields better over time. And so our expectation is as we start to exit the year in 2023, we start to come closer back to that long-term guide of 65% gross margins. And there's nothing longer term structurally that we don't believe, especially as G7 gets to scale, that gets us back to those long-term guides that we've originally provided. So we'll continue to work towards that. Think about 2023 as the first half of the year as a little bit lower. As we ramp up those lines in the back half, you start to tackle some of that absorption of those fixed overheads.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: Just on the bridging program, can you tease out a little bit more, maybe, Jereme, on expectations there? I think you had said $20 million to $30 million. You said you're trending better than that for Q1 which is great to hear. But I don't think you ever said how much the bridging program is going to cost you for the full year. It seems like it's going to be even better than expected overall versus maybe what you were thinking starting off '23. But then also bridging is supposed to be more of a headwind on the gross margin side, too. And if it's less of a headwind, maybe that helps out the gross margin profile a little bit more, maybe sooner than expected. So I'm just wondering like based on all these things on the bridging program specifically being better than expected, should we start to creep up a little bit more as far as our expectations for top line growth and then even gross margins for the full year?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. I don't think we're at a point where we'd necessarily change our guidance. But let me take your question head on which is in isolation, what does this do? So certainly, what the bridging program, what this effectively means is we have contracts in place a little bit more ahead of when we ultimately expected. And so ASPs will be a little bit higher and that's as a result of most folks going through coverage as opposed to the bridging program. So that does a couple of things. Certainly, it does help revenue and it does help margin. That all being said, we're not changing guidance for the year. But I think what this does mean is, one, it's a great thing for patients who want to access the product. We talked about coverage being a key strategy. That's wonderful. It does help longer term for those margin profiles. And while I wouldn't necessarily guide you outside of our ranges, you are correct. It does help on revenue and gross margin on the full year. And the other question was how much for the full year. We expected a majority of it, almost all of the $20 million, $30 million, in the first quarter. We do expect a nominal amount in Q2. We haven't expected any of it beyond Q2. Really, a majority of your concern would be in Q1.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Marie Thibault with BTIG.\nMarie Thibault: Congrats on a strong quarter. Wanted to ask a little bit more on kind of the backlog around the Medicare decision making. I'm very curious how physicians and patients, how aware they are of that decision, whether we might see a bolus of patients sort of come on once that Medicare coverage took place.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks for the question. It will be up to us to drive awareness in that community to make sure people are aware of that decision. There will certainly be those very familiar with DexCom and with continuous glucose monitoring will be aware of it and will pick it up quickly. But it will be up to us to drive awareness in both communities. the physicians and users of the product to go and ask for it and to create that environment. So we're not going to sit back and wait. We're going to have to push.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: So U.S. growth the last couple of quarters has been around 17%. So second half of the year, I think, was record patient growth for both quarters. So trying to think about ex the contra [indiscernible] for the bridge program if we should be seeing an acceleration here in the first quarter and the U.S. growth specifically and how that builds over the course of the year. And then on the Super Bowl ad, what kind of impact did you see on U.S. new patient starts last time you did that?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. So I'll start with how we're thinking about Q1. And the way we've generally thought about Q1 is in terms of full year contribution, absent any sort of bridging program, to be a very similar contributor as a percentage of total year revenue in the first quarter. So that's total company, not just U.S. total company. And then, you add the bridging program and then you pull it down from there. And that's generally how we think about the quarter which is just an indication of continued strong new patient growth. Clearly, we'll be working through driving new patients and driving growth over the course of the year. In terms of the Super Bowl and then how to think about the Super Bowl and how that contributes, last time we did it, there were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of inbound leads. Not all of those obviously translated into patients but there was a lot of interest. One of the challenges, though, if you rewind the clock a couple of years, is there wasn't as much coverage there. And so I think what we're hoping this time around is, one, the awareness is the most important thing. And the awareness, as that gets out there, will be very, very helpful. But as coverage starts to come through and we have this bridging program in place, it's a real opportunity to take advantage of it. We're not ready to give exact patient numbers out there other than to say that the return on capital is a very strong investment. And so, you should expect we do that math before we sign up for this. And we wouldn't be doing if we didn't expect a return on investment that was commensurate with what you and we would expect.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Just maybe an OpEx question. It looks like it's a bit bigger of a step up implied in '23. I know the Super Bowl ad is a contributor. But just wondering if you can comment on what are the sources of the OpEx growth and maybe hit on any planned changes to the sales force in support of G7.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Jayson. This is Kevin. I'll take it, rather big picture. We'll continue to invest in R&D. Our spend will grow some but not as rapidly as it has in other years. And quite honestly, as a percentage of revenue, it's probably come down a little bit. Same with -- on the G&A side, we'll continue to invest in infrastructure and build things out for our continued growth. But a lot of that investing has been done. Our biggest dollar investment, our biggest increases are going to be on the commercial side and in all areas, create awareness in the sales force, marketing across the board, we'll be spending on the commercial side. Those expenditures will -- could adjust and move over the course of the year as we learn more. We've always been very adept at channeling those dollars where they can be the most effective. We're analyzing some of that now. We certainly have a plan but we've never been afraid to deviate from it if it makes more sense. And so we're looking at all those things. A lot of international investment this year, quite honestly, as a percentage of our investment. International is getting a bigger piece of it than they have in the past because we really look at these opportunities. We've got G7 and several of these companies combined with the DexCom launch and all those covered lives we've added. We think there's great growth opportunities over there but we've got to invest in that infrastructure.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. And just to kind of add to that one, Jayson, just to give you some context. We launched outside the U.S. with DexCom ONE and G7, call it, in the first couple of phases. But we have more phases to go. And so we're going to make the marketing push obviously with G7 in the U.S but there's also a second phase of G7 launchings outside the U.S. and a second and third phase of DexCom ONE outside the U.S. So sales and marketing is really where we want to put our investment and we'll get leverage elsewhere. But hopefully, that gives you kind of some context for how we're thinking about that spend in 2023.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nMatt Taylor: So I just want to get some thoughts on gross margin longer term. I know you touched on this year. And obviously, with the new product launch, there's some initial depression and then you get spring loaded with leverage over time. So help us think about G7 over the next couple of years. Does that expand? How can that impact gross margins with and without the potential for a longer wear label?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. I can start there. You're 100% right. I mean, obviously, there's the levers to get the actual cost of the product and we've been very transparent about it. We want to get to basically $1 per day and a 10-day sensor or a $10 sensor. And then we want to go even beyond that. But that has always been kind of our public goal. Then, of course, as you move to a 15-day sensor, that cost is spread out over a longer period. So we have intentions over the long haul of doing all of that. Now the math, if you do that, would indicate there's some real opportunities in gross margin even beyond potential long-term guide. The one thing we want to be mindful of is we don't want to shortchange ourselves and other opportunities to either partner or otherwise over the long haul. So while the long-term guide remains intact, there are certainly levers and opportunities for us to do well there. And so I think you're hitting on all the right points. That all being said, we really hold to that long-term 65% gross margin. That's what we'll work to. And if there's other opportunities to get fill you in on some other things we're doing in the future, we'll certainly do so.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mathew Blackman with Stifel.\nMathew Blackman: Jereme, just curious, I appreciate all the inputs that you gave us that roll up to the 15% to 20% guide. I'm just curious, have you contemplated in that 15% to 20% range any competitive pressures in the event that your competitor gets approved to integrate with a pump sometime in 2023?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, we do. We've considered all of that when providing that guidance. I mean, when we think about all the competitive pressures and then we think about all the opportunities ahead of us, we consider all that in the guidance. And you are right, there is the potential out there, at least according to some of the commentary, that there could be some potential pressure out there. I would say that we've contemplated it. At the same time, we feel very confident in our product offering and what it ultimately does, how it integrates and the safety features that people rely on our product for the accuracy, the ease of use. So I think we feel very confident about it. But yes, we did contemplate that in our guide.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Chris Pasquale with Nephron.\nChrisPasquale: Love the update on how you guys are thinking about price. You said in the past, your U.S. channel mix could start to stabilize once you hit 75% of the pharmacy. You're there now. But you also have D1 making a bigger portion of the OUS starts which I would imagine might pull down your international ASP a bit. So can you tell us what impact price had on revenue in '22 and then how you're thinking about the potential impact this year?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So we'll talk about 2022 since we gave kind of a guide there which was around $200 million in the U.S. and around $50 million outside the U.S. And the full year of 2022 was generally in line with that. It was, I think, just south of $200 million in the U.S. and just south of $50 million outside the U.S. So basically right in line with that. So I think you can feel good about what guidance we gave there. Going forward, the expectation is in the G Series, that delta -- that price-volume delta starts to come down over time. What we would expect to see is -- and we're not going to give a specific number for 2023 since most of that migration is done but we will have to lap the 2022 migration. And then if there's drift, say, 75 say drifts to 80, you wouldn't expect material moves there. But those are all things we've contemplated in those figures. To your point and I think you're hitting out the way we model the business, we model the business as a G Series and a DexCom ONE. And I would suggest you do that going forward. And then to your point, DexCom ONE modeled as a percentage of total business will allow you to then understand the contributions to ASP there which is why it was important for us to give you our expectation of new patient starts in 2023 that 1/3 of them outside the U.S. will be on DexCom ONE. So I think the way you're thinking about the model is exactly the way we model it internally and that's the way I'd go about doing that for 2023 and beyond.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: I wanted to ask an additional question just on the commercial strategy moving forward. I understand the DTC advertising and you doubled the sales force a few years ago. But just as you prepare for basal approval in the U.S., how does the focus or the call point of the actual sales force need to change? Do you need to make additional investments in people? Just help us understand how the targeting goes moving forward.\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that. Jereme gave us a bit of color earlier. 75% of our calls already by our U.S. sales force are in the PCP arena. And I think you'll continue to see that expand as our team spends more of their time addressing that marketplace, at the same time, not ignoring the places where we've been so successful in the past with the intensive management diabetes. So we will look at that structure in great detail. On a geographical basis, even within the U.S., there may be some places where we need to expand geographically versus large expansion across the entire country. We'll analyze that in great detail as we go. We're in the process of doing that now. We just brought on a new Chief Commercial Officer, as many of you will remember, in early January. And she's deep in the middle of that today as we manage those thoughts and the launch and everything else going on but we'll look at it very strongly.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteveLichtman: Question on DexCom ONE outlook. Can you talk about any major new geographic regions you expect to roll out the platform this year? And should we expect to see any movement in bringing DexCom ONE onto the G7 platform this year? Or is that a longer-term play?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. It's a fair question. Let me just say, we're not necessarily going to give the playbook as to what countries we are going into. Now we have launched recently in Croatia, Romania and Greece for DexCom ONE. That is out there now. So hopefully, that gives you some context but we will be launching in more countries. But rather than give the playbook publicly, we'll let our commercial team execute that and give you that feedback. But just know, we will go into more countries. So hopefully, that gives you at least some context. We will go. In terms of the movement from DexCom ONE to the G7 form factor, we are absolutely going to be moving to that factor. It's going to take a little bit of time and the reason it's going to take a little bit of time is, as we get economies of scale on G6 which we have today across the existing user base as well as DexCom ONE as well as a lot of opportunity for new users on G7, we want to make sure we prioritize G7 and that form factor for those patients coming on to therapy on the G Series. Make no mistake, though, as soon as possible, right after that, we will be moving DexCom ONE to that G7 form factor. Stay tuned. We'll have some updates as the years progress on. But you're thinking about it the right way. We will move there in relatively short order.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: I was hoping to follow up on the pricing question. And I'm not sure if you've given a recent update just on how investors should think about the average reimbursement DexCom receives in the U.S. for a G6 or a G Series patient. And then just a follow-up on that is, will that change with the G7 introduction for one? And then two, is it important the share shifts in the pump market just considering the reimbursement DexCom gets to the DME channel with the Tandem pump versus the pharmacy channel with the Insulet pump?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. It's a good question. Look, I think the way to think about the ASP is it's really more about channel than it is about version. And so as you think about where folks and who folks -- who gets access, the general way to think about it is Medicare which is publicly out there, I think after the increase, it's around $250 a month. There's a delta there which goes to the distributor who ultimately fulfills that. So the net price to us is south of that. But ultimately, that would be our price in that range; that's publicly available. Generally, commercial DME is higher than that and pharmacy is lower than that number. And so that's the way to think about it. In terms of then how ASP moves over time, think about it less of generation of product and think about it more as where folks want to get their product. And so I think you're thinking about it the right way. As we talked about, 75% of our lives covered in commercial. 75% of those patients, those patients obviously then come through at a lower price point. If that drifts to, say, 80%, you could see that having a potential tick on there. Again, most of that is behind us but that's the way to think about the split there. And then in terms of pump partners and how folks ultimately access it, it really depends again consumer preference. You're right, Tandem is generally accessed through the DME and Insulet's generally access to the pharmacy. So it makes sense that folks get their CGMs through that channel. That all being said, it's ultimately consumer preference. And we believe the consumer experience through the pharmacy is great. We have some really great DME partners. They do a wonderful job fulfilling product through that DME channel. And so we believe that, that folks can be fulfilled either way.\nJosh Jennings: Great. If I could sneak in just a quick follow-up. Just thinking about your CGM platform attached to pumps, is there a premium reimbursement that DexCom receives in that scenario versus standalone? Or is it all consistent across the board? It just depends on the channel, as you said?\nKevin Sayer: No. Right now, there's one class of CGM products and reimbursement is consistent across the board.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley.\nCecilia Furlong: I was hoping to follow up. You talked, though, the last quarter just about rolling out cash pay models in the U.S. Just curious if you could provide more color as you're thinking about that opportunity today. And then for 2023, specifically, how we should think about potential incremental contributions from that?\nKevin Sayer: You bet. This is Kevin. I'll take it. Big picture, our cash pay program for G7 to start with is going to be our bridging program. And people will be able to pay cash for G7 that way. Ultimately, as we get access and coverage of G7, when people's co-pays will be significantly lower than the bridging program cost, we'll phase that out and have a cash pay program on G7 that individuals will be able to access. We continue our cash pay program on G6 but that is not a major portion of our revenues. It's just a piece of them. We do this to create access primarily where people's insurance doesn't cover it and they can't get access through the federal or the other governmental channels as well. It's not a huge percentage of our revenues. We need to continue to be cognizant of it and address those patients' needs. And that's why we have it there.\nOperator: Next question from Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatt Miksic: If I could, just 2 quick follow-ups on some of the topics that were covered earlier. So on ramping production for G7 to the gross margins and the impact and improving on scrap rates and all that. And just wondering, by the end of the year, we're sort of hitting what you say about your manufacturing and sort of representative margins maybe in the facilities that you have. And the other was just on the comment you had on contemplation or competition on the pump integration front this year. And if that were not to come, I'm just wondering, not to put you in a tough spot or anything like that or credit margin the guidance range. But if that were not to come, does that -- is that sort of a slight tailwind to the -- to the top end of your guided range or how to think about that?\nKevin Sayer: This is Kevin. I'll take that bigger picture. Jereme has been very familiar with the numbers but I'll give you a bit of my perspective. With respect to no competition in the pump integration point, we may pick up more, we may not. What I do know is everybody using those pumps integrated systems right now uses a DexCom. And they're achieving remarkable results with the technology we've developed over the years and we'll continue to receive such. It is our position that the experience that they're going to have with algorithms based upon DexCom's CGM that have been developed through the data and the performance of our sensor will continue to make us the leader in that space regardless of who the competing sensor is. And so we're very confident there that we will continue to have a very strong product offering going forward. With respect to the margin change over the course of the year, there's a couple of factors in there. Obviously, Jereme has talked about the bridging program in the first half of the year bringing margins down a bit because the revenue per patient will be a bit lower there when we start. But as we see that pick up, we'll pick that up on the revenue side. Then you have basal come in and Medicare reimbursement is strong; so that will help on pricing. The flip side of that is it's sometimes lost on folks, everything we do with G7 is different. All these lines are completely different. All the capacity is different. But the only thing that's the same is we're building in Arizona and we're building it in San Diego. And that's not going to be the same for a good portion of the year because we expect the factory in Malaysia to be up and running in the second half and producing product there. So you have a number of variables with respect to scrap, with respect to purchasing components, with respect to how these lines run as we get them up and running and functioning at full speed versus where they are today and then bringing on a new factory. We have tried to contemplate every one of those variables as we've started and we'll update you as to how things are going as time goes on. But whenever you do a product launch, particularly when this significant because when we did our last big G6 product launch, we had similar margin activity but it was on a much smaller scale because we're so much bigger than we were before, there's just more variables that we have to plan for. We've tried to be conservative and thoughtful in our guidance based on the performance we expect of our teams. We also expect our teams to be better than this too. We don't ever lower the bar for them, as they will tell you. But we've looked at all -- every one of those things and contemplating that and we meet on this literally every day to make sure we're covering all of our bases. This launch is really important to us as are our margins. But it's really important to get product out to all the users that want it.\nOperator: And we will take our last question from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research.\nMichael Polark: I just wanted to follow up on first quarter to make sure I have my modeling square. Jereme, I heard in response to prior question using the full year guide, you're thinking about 1Q consistent with seasonal patterns. The last 3 years, I have 21% of full year revenue in the first quarter. If I use the midpoint of your range this year, that's $720 million. But then you made the comment about the bridge program down from there. So that would be another, say, $15 million or $20 million for the quarter. So I'd be at $700 million or $705 million. Have I put this together correctly? If not, can you help?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. I mean you're not far directionally off. I mean you are right, we do expect the Q1 contribution and really the sequential decline from Q4 into Q1 to be very similar to what you've seen in the past. And so that will help you get a little bit closer as you think about sequential decline as well from Q4 into Q1. That will put you into a ballpark. And then from there, you're right. We updated our number. It's about $15 million now as a result of the bridging program as opposed to the $20 million to $30 million. But that will get you in the ballpark. You're not far off but there's probably a little bit of tweaking to do around the edges there. But use that 21% contribution but think also 10% sequential. Those little rounding differences ultimately matter in there. Hopefully, that gives you the context you need though.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions at this time, I will turn the call back to Kevin Sayer for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you very much and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We spent a lot of time in our fourth quarter call talking about 2023. I want to just step back again and thank all of our great people here at this company for their hard work in a year where we delivered on our revenue targets, we controlled our costs. At the same time, we've advanced our technologies, our infrastructure and we've advanced coverage and accessibility for our product all over the world to enhance people's lives. But we are very excited for this launch. This is my fourth major launch here at DexCom. And every single time, it's taken our company to another level. The first time was G4 and that was when accuracy really came to bear. And we truly established what accuracy standard should be for CGM and we will remain the most accurate system in the world. G7 is going to be a better experience than G6. Every time we try to make the product easier to use and this is the biggest ease-of-use advancement we've ever had as we look at the responses from our users so far. And as always, we will make this product as accessible as we can. DexCom has always been the most accessible brand CGM as far as coverage and we will continue to do so. That's our commitment to drive that very hard for our end users. It is going to be a busy and great 2023. I am very confident we'll be sitting here a year from now and I'll be able to say the same things. Thanks, everybody and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'd like to start by reviewing some of DexCom's key accomplishments in 2022. Total revenue grew 20% on an organic basis driven by another year of record new customer starts. This translates into more than $475 million of organic revenue growth compared to last year as we saw another step forward for CGM awareness and DexCom brand loyalty. We added nearly 450,000 DexCom users to our base in 2022 and ended the year with close to 1.7 million customers globally. Our team did a great job generating this customer engagement and growth while simultaneously enhancing the scale and efficiency of our organization. Our operations team demonstrated world-class performance this year, ensuring adequate supply in a difficult macro environment and providing on-time delivery rates of greater than 99%. We drove over 500 basis points of operating expense leverage in 2022 despite broad inflationary pressure. This was not the result of reactionary cost cutting. Instead, it reflects decisions made years ago at our company to foster a culture of cost discipline as we grow. From a strategic perspective, we will look back at 2022 as a pivotal year for our company. We advanced several of our most important initiatives, including multiple new product launches, significant access wins, new market development and a further extension of our market-leading performance in connectivity. Everything we achieved this past year helps build a foundation for years of sustainable growth ahead. For example, in October, CMS published a proposed local coverage determination that would meaningfully expand access to CGM technology for the Medicare population. This proposal would broaden coverage to include people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only as well as certain non-insulin-using individuals that experience hypoglycemia. This result was led by the publication of DexCom's MOBILE study and furthered by a strong partnership with the diabetes community. We heard broad support and enthusiasm from key stakeholders during the comment period and expect the ruling to be finalized in the coming months. As a reminder, we size the basal-only type 2 population at 3 million people in the United States. Between this Medicare ruling and broader commercial coverage which we expect to follow shortly, this population has the potential to nearly double our addressable reimbursed market in the United States. Outside the United States, our team has been equally focused on building greater access. We drove many positive coverage decisions from Mobile payers over the course of 2022. These access wins were in response to the strong clinical evidence we continue to generate as well as the introduction of our portfolio strategy in many of these markets. 2022 was the first time that we brought multiple DexCom products to a single market and this strategy has enabled us to significantly extend our reach. By offering multiple products, we can provide a unique value proposition that meets the specific needs of our diverse base of customers, clinicians and payers. A great example is in the U.K., where DexCom ONE was added to the national formulary for all people with intensively managed diabetes. Collectively, our international access initiatives have helped us expand our reimbursed coverage by 3.5 million lives over the past 18 months. 2022 will also be remembered as the year of G7. We received both CE Mark and FDA regulatory clearance for G7 and initiated a full launch outside the United States. The feedback from our customers has been everything we'd hope for. We are hearing consistent praise for the new features, such as the 60% smaller form factor, shorter warm-up period and more engaging and consumer-friendly app. Perhaps the most encouraging is that 97% of initial users surveyed have found G7 easy to use. We designed this product to simplify the lives of our customers and we are thrilled to see that emphasis resonating. All of this leaves us incredibly excited to bring G7 to the U.S. In fact, we began shipping this week into our U.S. distribution channels to support our rollout. We have quickly ramped up production capacity to support the launch with our automated G7 lines already capable of producing more than 100,000 sensors a day. We want to get G7 into the hands of as many people as possible. So in conjunction with our launch, we've established a bridge program to simplify access for our early adopters. This program will provide new and existing customers access to G7 immediately and allow us to go to market in a broad and expedited manner. Behind the scenes, we continue to advance our discussions with payers to build reimbursement. Our conversations have progressed very well and we are well on track with our G7 coverage plans. More importantly, we are not going to be bashful about what we think of this product. G7 is the new gold standard in diabetes technology. This is the most accurate, easy-to-use and accessible CGM ever produced and we want to share this message with the world. As a result, we will be releasing our second-ever Super Bowl commercial this Sunday. We're again teaming up with one of our most recognizable DexCom warriors, Nick Jonas, to announce the G7 is here. This is a great opportunity to connect not only with our loyal G6 users but with the millions of people with diabetes that still do not use CGM. We want these individuals, their caregivers and their loved ones to know that DexCom can help them live healthier lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Jereme for a review of the fourth quarter financials. Jereme? Thanks, Jereme. To summarize, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead with G7 and we're rolling out product to our distributors as we speak and we're ready for a big launch in the U.S. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? No. I would tell you what we're also hearing is a great deal of excitement from our user base for G7. So with respect to your question regarding how our G6 users doing, they're very anxious to get G7 and very excited to go. So we're feeling good about where we are right now. Well, Larry, our -- I'm going to talk for a bit. I'll turn it over to Jereme. Our initial estimates, it's 1% of our total revenues would come from that. And that's a reasonably sized number. We plan for July, second half of the year, approval and rolling it out from there. It may go faster than that but we've been conservative in our estimates and we will make every attempt to beat those. As we look out to 2025, that non-intensive insulin space is not just basal users. We believe our CGM product will be very valuable amongst a number of markets in the type 2 space and also in metabolic health. So it's not just basal users there. It's a lot more than that. And many of the basal users, as you well know, move up to be intensive insulin users as well. So we view that population as moving and shifting with us as they go. Jereme, you have anything else to add? No. As we look out to the future, Margaret, particularly with our easy-to-use G7 platform that we're launching today, we believe our future is very bright as we deal with metabolic health. We've changed our mission statement to help people control their health, not just diabetes anymore. We continue to see very positive results from several programs who are using sensors to assist people in these endeavors. And over time and particularly with type 2 management and all the type 2 drug alternatives on the horizon, we believe CGM becomes a very important part of that health equation. And we're continuing to work on product offerings and business models. So it will be differentiated from what we do today and geared towards that population. We're really excited about the opportunity. And it will continue to mature over 2023 and then we'll see what happens in 2024. We've got a lot of basal patients to reach first. So let's go after them and then we'll continue to move to the other areas as well. I will start off. With respect to the sales and the revenue numbers, G7 and DexCom ONE are still early enough in their launch life cycle that while they're additive, they're not what's driving a lot of the adoption, a lot of the growth that we've seen in European markets. A lot of that's been what we've established with G6, the additional coverage that we've obtained, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, in 18 months, we've added 3.5 million more reimbursed lives. That being said, initial response to G7 has been everything we'd hoped for. People love the app. They love the receiver. Again, in many of these markets, the receiver is a very, very strong tool. My most recent conversation with the G7 user focused completely around the 0.5-hour warm-up. A 0.5-hour warmup has eliminated 90 minutes of the longest 2 hours of somebody's life who ever used the G6. And certainly, in the comparative front compared to the hour warm-up, again, it is a much better experience. The majority of our G6 users are new to DexCom. They're not DexCom upgrade -- I mean G7 users, I apologize. The majority of our G7 users are new to DexCom. Some of them come from the competition. Some of them have not used CGM before but they're all finding it very easy to use and having great experiences. So we're very happy with the product to this point in time. We've done very well. Thanks for the question. It will be up to us to drive awareness in that community to make sure people are aware of that decision. There will certainly be those very familiar with DexCom and with continuous glucose monitoring will be aware of it and will pick it up quickly. But it will be up to us to drive awareness in both communities. the physicians and users of the product to go and ask for it and to create that environment. So we're not going to sit back and wait. We're going to have to push. Thanks, Jayson. This is Kevin. I'll take it, rather big picture. We'll continue to invest in R&D. Our spend will grow some but not as rapidly as it has in other years. And quite honestly, as a percentage of revenue, it's probably come down a little bit. Same with -- on the G&A side, we'll continue to invest in infrastructure and build things out for our continued growth. But a lot of that investing has been done. Our biggest dollar investment, our biggest increases are going to be on the commercial side and in all areas, create awareness in the sales force, marketing across the board, we'll be spending on the commercial side. Those expenditures will -- could adjust and move over the course of the year as we learn more. We've always been very adept at channeling those dollars where they can be the most effective. We're analyzing some of that now. We certainly have a plan but we've never been afraid to deviate from it if it makes more sense. And so we're looking at all those things. A lot of international investment this year, quite honestly, as a percentage of our investment. International is getting a bigger piece of it than they have in the past because we really look at these opportunities. We've got G7 and several of these companies combined with the DexCom launch and all those covered lives we've added. We think there's great growth opportunities over there but we've got to invest in that infrastructure. Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that. Jereme gave us a bit of color earlier. 75% of our calls already by our U.S. sales force are in the PCP arena. And I think you'll continue to see that expand as our team spends more of their time addressing that marketplace, at the same time, not ignoring the places where we've been so successful in the past with the intensive management diabetes. So we will look at that structure in great detail. On a geographical basis, even within the U.S., there may be some places where we need to expand geographically versus large expansion across the entire country. We'll analyze that in great detail as we go. We're in the process of doing that now. We just brought on a new Chief Commercial Officer, as many of you will remember, in early January. And she's deep in the middle of that today as we manage those thoughts and the launch and everything else going on but we'll look at it very strongly. No. Right now, there's one class of CGM products and reimbursement is consistent across the board. You bet. This is Kevin. I'll take it. Big picture, our cash pay program for G7 to start with is going to be our bridging program. And people will be able to pay cash for G7 that way. Ultimately, as we get access and coverage of G7, when people's co-pays will be significantly lower than the bridging program cost, we'll phase that out and have a cash pay program on G7 that individuals will be able to access. We continue our cash pay program on G6 but that is not a major portion of our revenues. It's just a piece of them. We do this to create access primarily where people's insurance doesn't cover it and they can't get access through the federal or the other governmental channels as well. It's not a huge percentage of our revenues. We need to continue to be cognizant of it and address those patients' needs. And that's why we have it there. This is Kevin. I'll take that bigger picture. Jereme has been very familiar with the numbers but I'll give you a bit of my perspective. With respect to no competition in the pump integration point, we may pick up more, we may not. What I do know is everybody using those pumps integrated systems right now uses a DexCom. And they're achieving remarkable results with the technology we've developed over the years and we'll continue to receive such. It is our position that the experience that they're going to have with algorithms based upon DexCom's CGM that have been developed through the data and the performance of our sensor will continue to make us the leader in that space regardless of who the competing sensor is. And so we're very confident there that we will continue to have a very strong product offering going forward. With respect to the margin change over the course of the year, there's a couple of factors in there. Obviously, Jereme has talked about the bridging program in the first half of the year bringing margins down a bit because the revenue per patient will be a bit lower there when we start. But as we see that pick up, we'll pick that up on the revenue side. Then you have basal come in and Medicare reimbursement is strong; so that will help on pricing. The flip side of that is it's sometimes lost on folks, everything we do with G7 is different. All these lines are completely different. All the capacity is different. But the only thing that's the same is we're building in Arizona and we're building it in San Diego. And that's not going to be the same for a good portion of the year because we expect the factory in Malaysia to be up and running in the second half and producing product there. So you have a number of variables with respect to scrap, with respect to purchasing components, with respect to how these lines run as we get them up and running and functioning at full speed versus where they are today and then bringing on a new factory. We have tried to contemplate every one of those variables as we've started and we'll update you as to how things are going as time goes on. But whenever you do a product launch, particularly when this significant because when we did our last big G6 product launch, we had similar margin activity but it was on a much smaller scale because we're so much bigger than we were before, there's just more variables that we have to plan for. We've tried to be conservative and thoughtful in our guidance based on the performance we expect of our teams. We also expect our teams to be better than this too. We don't ever lower the bar for them, as they will tell you. But we've looked at all -- every one of those things and contemplating that and we meet on this literally every day to make sure we're covering all of our bases. This launch is really important to us as are our margins. But it's really important to get product out to all the users that want it. Thank you very much and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We spent a lot of time in our fourth quarter call talking about 2023. I want to just step back again and thank all of our great people here at this company for their hard work in a year where we delivered on our revenue targets, we controlled our costs. At the same time, we've advanced our technologies, our infrastructure and we've advanced coverage and accessibility for our product all over the world to enhance people's lives. But we are very excited for this launch. This is my fourth major launch here at DexCom. And every single time, it's taken our company to another level. The first time was G4 and that was when accuracy really came to bear. And we truly established what accuracy standard should be for CGM and we will remain the most accurate system in the world. G7 is going to be a better experience than G6. Every time we try to make the product easier to use and this is the biggest ease-of-use advancement we've ever had as we look at the responses from our users so far. And as always, we will make this product as accessible as we can. DexCom has always been the most accessible brand CGM as far as coverage and we will continue to do so. That's our commitment to drive that very hard for our end users. It is going to be a busy and great 2023. I am very confident we'll be sitting here a year from now and I'll be able to say the same things. Thanks, everybody and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported worldwide revenue of $815 million compared to $698 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, representing growth of 20% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $606 million for the fourth quarter compared to $517 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing growth of 17%. Our recent momentum in the U.S. continued into Q4 as we delivered another strong quarter of volume growth and solid new customer starts. We were very encouraged by the prescribing trends we saw in the fourth quarter and we closed the year with around 75% of our commercial scripts going through the pharmacy channel. This represents the endpoint of a multiyear channel journey. And we believe our current structure maximizes access for our users as the most covered CGM and supports greater customer choice in how they access the most accurate CGM. International revenue grew 15%, totaling $209 million in the fourth quarter. International organic revenue growth was 27% for the fourth quarter. We continue to take share in international markets as the introduction of new products and access wins over the past year leave us in a wonderful position to compete for new users. For example, in response to the sizable U.K. coverage decision we received last August, our revenue growth has accelerated over the past 2 quarters in that region. Even though this was already one of our largest OUS markets, there has been a clear uptick in demand following this broad expansion of access. Our fourth quarter gross profit was $544 million or 66.7% of revenue compared to 67.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021. Foreign currency was an 80 basis point negative impact on gross margin in the quarter. Operating expenses were $372 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $461 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized an $87 million expense associated with the contingent milestone under the 2018 collaboration and license agreement with Verily Life Sciences. Absent this, our operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 would have been relatively flat year-over-year. This represents another quarter of very disciplined cost management as we generated 800 basis points of OpEx leverage. Operating income was $172.1 million or 21.1% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $12 million or 1.7% of revenue in the same quarter of 2021. Even excluding the Verily charge from 2021, this highlights incredibly strong operating expense leverage in our current year which more than offsets our step backwards in gross margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $237.1 million or 29.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $67.3 million or 9.6% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021. Net income for the fourth quarter was $136.3 million or $0.34 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents. This cash level provides organizational flexibility to support our organic growth opportunity and assess strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis, such as the accelerated share repurchase program we executed in 2022 and ongoing development of our Malaysia manufacturing facility. Turning to 2023 guidance. As we stated last month. We anticipate total revenue to be in the range of $3.35 billion to $3.49 billion, representing growth of 15% to 20%. This reflects another year of strong underlying volume growth which will again exceed our revenue growth rate for the year. To help provide some insight into the makeup of our guidance this year, we recently provided some additional color around our expectations. First, earlier on this call, Kevin discussed our plans to support our initial G7 customers with a bridge program. We expect this program to impact our revenue per customer early in the year as we provide G7 access at an affordable cash rate as we build reimbursement. We expect this impact to narrow over the course of the year as broader coverage is secured. Internationally, we estimate that around 1/3 of our new customer starts will come in through the DexCom ONE platform. Therefore, this business will start to have a more material impact on numbers this year as that customer base builds. For the type 2 basal opportunity, we anticipate CMS reimbursement to be finalized for this population by midyear and begin contributing to our results in the second half of 2023. We expect this population to contribute approximately 1% of our total revenue in 2023. Turning to margins. We expect gross profit margin to be in the range of 62% to 63%. This assumed year-over-year decline is primarily related to the impact of the broader G7 launch. As with any launch, we will initially be running at lower production volumes and it will take some time for our new manufacturing lines to scale. Importantly, this is a temporary dynamic and we still expect G7 product costs to be less than G6 at scale. Despite the step backwards in gross margin, we are guiding for operating margins to be relatively flat year-over-year at 16.5% which reflects another 150 to 250 basis points of operating expense leverage in 2023. This is the result of ongoing cost initiatives at our organization which continue to drive leverage even as we allocate greater investment to support our global commercial infrastructure and G7 launch. Finally, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 26% in 2023. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, I appreciate that. This is Jereme. So to your question on coverage, we're still in the throes of the commercial DME and the Medicare coverage. We talked about on G7 taking about 90 days. But on the pharmacy side, we're actually a little bit ahead of schedule. Kevin referenced, we're well on track to the point where I talked about, about a $30 million-ish hit in Q1 as a result of our bridge program. That number is more like $15 million now and that's because some of those pharmacy contracts are coming in earlier. So we are making great progress and we continue to get that every day. And the signs lead to more and more contracts coming over, maybe even ahead of schedule. In terms of the question then on competitive dynamics, maybe I can start and then Kevin will obviously have a few thoughts there. We had a record new patient start in Q4. If that gives you any context to we had another solid new patient quarter. So while we have seen competitive product out there, we continue to do very, very well with G6 to the point where we have seen incredible strength there. And that's, of course, on the heels of a G7 launch which as we referenced, is coming out here in the next coming days. Kevin, I don't know if you have anything else to add there. Sure. Yes. Larry, so the $60 million number you're referencing would assume, say, everybody started on July 1 and they went through the end of the year. The reality is that some folks will start in July, some folks will start in December. And so really, the exit velocity is much higher than that on a run rate perspective. If you were to blend it, average it over the course of the year, you're really only getting 3 months of revenue contribution. And so you kind of do the math there and the exit rate is a little bit higher than I think what you're implying. So we are really, really bullish on it. But it is a recurring revenue business. So what we need to do is get those -- get that coverage out there, get the scripts in. And so, look, I understand the question. It's a big, big market with a big, big opportunity. We plan on playing in it and we plan on playing it in a big way. But obviously, we want to be prudent around guidance. And certainly, if things go better than that, then we'll always try to do so. We'll report back to everybody. Yes. So let me start on the base and then I can turn it over to Kevin from that perspective. And so the ramp in basal is going to be a bit interesting. We'll give you kind of the way we think about it. Think about it as -- I generally start with type 2 intensive and you think about that ramp and you think about coverage and how that takes place. And if the coverage takes place over a similar time, you'd expect a relatively similar ramp. Now, I'd caveat that by saying there's more awareness today. And hence, the Super Bowl commercial is a good opportunity for us to continue to raise that awareness. However, the place in which the basal patients cede is a wider swath of physicians. And so we don't have an exact crystal ball here. If you're using prior analogs, the best analog is type 2 intensive would be about the adoption rate. But I think as time moves on, we'll be able to give you a little bit more color. But that's kind of our best crystal ball. And then maybe, Kevin, if you want to give just some general thoughts about metabolic health and the opportunities there. Sure. Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate that. And you start off with, obviously, the fourth quarter. We had a really strong gross margin. I think it's a demonstration of what's to come with what our teams can do when you give them time with a new product launch. So I think as you think about the year, the cadence for 2023, we do expect in the first half of the year margins to be a little bit lower. And that's because of, as Kevin referenced earlier, the bridge program. Certainly, that has an impact. But most importantly, it's the launch of G7. Volumes won't be at where they would have been, say, in a more mature launch and we'll still be going through some of those early manufacturing scrap and yield challenges we always see. But what we've proven time and time again is if you give our engineering and R&D team time with these lines, they continue to get yields better over time. And so our expectation is as we start to exit the year in 2023, we start to come closer back to that long-term guide of 65% gross margins. And there's nothing longer term structurally that we don't believe, especially as G7 gets to scale, that gets us back to those long-term guides that we've originally provided. So we'll continue to work towards that. Think about 2023 as the first half of the year as a little bit lower. As we ramp up those lines in the back half, you start to tackle some of that absorption of those fixed overheads. Sure. Yes. I don't think we're at a point where we'd necessarily change our guidance. But let me take your question head on which is in isolation, what does this do? So certainly, what the bridging program, what this effectively means is we have contracts in place a little bit more ahead of when we ultimately expected. And so ASPs will be a little bit higher and that's as a result of most folks going through coverage as opposed to the bridging program. So that does a couple of things. Certainly, it does help revenue and it does help margin. That all being said, we're not changing guidance for the year. But I think what this does mean is, one, it's a great thing for patients who want to access the product. We talked about coverage being a key strategy. That's wonderful. It does help longer term for those margin profiles. And while I wouldn't necessarily guide you outside of our ranges, you are correct. It does help on revenue and gross margin on the full year. And the other question was how much for the full year. We expected a majority of it, almost all of the $20 million, $30 million, in the first quarter. We do expect a nominal amount in Q2. We haven't expected any of it beyond Q2. Really, a majority of your concern would be in Q1. Sure. Yes. So I'll start with how we're thinking about Q1. And the way we've generally thought about Q1 is in terms of full year contribution, absent any sort of bridging program, to be a very similar contributor as a percentage of total year revenue in the first quarter. So that's total company, not just U.S. total company. And then, you add the bridging program and then you pull it down from there. And that's generally how we think about the quarter which is just an indication of continued strong new patient growth. Clearly, we'll be working through driving new patients and driving growth over the course of the year. In terms of the Super Bowl and then how to think about the Super Bowl and how that contributes, last time we did it, there were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of inbound leads. Not all of those obviously translated into patients but there was a lot of interest. One of the challenges, though, if you rewind the clock a couple of years, is there wasn't as much coverage there. And so I think what we're hoping this time around is, one, the awareness is the most important thing. And the awareness, as that gets out there, will be very, very helpful. But as coverage starts to come through and we have this bridging program in place, it's a real opportunity to take advantage of it. We're not ready to give exact patient numbers out there other than to say that the return on capital is a very strong investment. And so, you should expect we do that math before we sign up for this. And we wouldn't be doing if we didn't expect a return on investment that was commensurate with what you and we would expect. Yes. And just to kind of add to that one, Jayson, just to give you some context. We launched outside the U.S. with DexCom ONE and G7, call it, in the first couple of phases. But we have more phases to go. And so we're going to make the marketing push obviously with G7 in the U.S but there's also a second phase of G7 launchings outside the U.S. and a second and third phase of DexCom ONE outside the U.S. So sales and marketing is really where we want to put our investment and we'll get leverage elsewhere. But hopefully, that gives you kind of some context for how we're thinking about that spend in 2023. Yes. I can start there. You're 100% right. I mean, obviously, there's the levers to get the actual cost of the product and we've been very transparent about it. We want to get to basically $1 per day and a 10-day sensor or a $10 sensor. And then we want to go even beyond that. But that has always been kind of our public goal. Then, of course, as you move to a 15-day sensor, that cost is spread out over a longer period. So we have intentions over the long haul of doing all of that. Now the math, if you do that, would indicate there's some real opportunities in gross margin even beyond potential long-term guide. The one thing we want to be mindful of is we don't want to shortchange ourselves and other opportunities to either partner or otherwise over the long haul. So while the long-term guide remains intact, there are certainly levers and opportunities for us to do well there. And so I think you're hitting on all the right points. That all being said, we really hold to that long-term 65% gross margin. That's what we'll work to. And if there's other opportunities to get fill you in on some other things we're doing in the future, we'll certainly do so. Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, we do. We've considered all of that when providing that guidance. I mean, when we think about all the competitive pressures and then we think about all the opportunities ahead of us, we consider all that in the guidance. And you are right, there is the potential out there, at least according to some of the commentary, that there could be some potential pressure out there. I would say that we've contemplated it. At the same time, we feel very confident in our product offering and what it ultimately does, how it integrates and the safety features that people rely on our product for the accuracy, the ease of use. So I think we feel very confident about it. But yes, we did contemplate that in our guide. Yes. So we'll talk about 2022 since we gave kind of a guide there which was around $200 million in the U.S. and around $50 million outside the U.S. And the full year of 2022 was generally in line with that. It was, I think, just south of $200 million in the U.S. and just south of $50 million outside the U.S. So basically right in line with that. So I think you can feel good about what guidance we gave there. Going forward, the expectation is in the G Series, that delta -- that price-volume delta starts to come down over time. What we would expect to see is -- and we're not going to give a specific number for 2023 since most of that migration is done but we will have to lap the 2022 migration. And then if there's drift, say, 75 say drifts to 80, you wouldn't expect material moves there. But those are all things we've contemplated in those figures. To your point and I think you're hitting out the way we model the business, we model the business as a G Series and a DexCom ONE. And I would suggest you do that going forward. And then to your point, DexCom ONE modeled as a percentage of total business will allow you to then understand the contributions to ASP there which is why it was important for us to give you our expectation of new patient starts in 2023 that 1/3 of them outside the U.S. will be on DexCom ONE. So I think the way you're thinking about the model is exactly the way we model it internally and that's the way I'd go about doing that for 2023 and beyond. Yes. It's a fair question. Let me just say, we're not necessarily going to give the playbook as to what countries we are going into. Now we have launched recently in Croatia, Romania and Greece for DexCom ONE. That is out there now. So hopefully, that gives you some context but we will be launching in more countries. But rather than give the playbook publicly, we'll let our commercial team execute that and give you that feedback. But just know, we will go into more countries. So hopefully, that gives you at least some context. We will go. In terms of the movement from DexCom ONE to the G7 form factor, we are absolutely going to be moving to that factor. It's going to take a little bit of time and the reason it's going to take a little bit of time is, as we get economies of scale on G6 which we have today across the existing user base as well as DexCom ONE as well as a lot of opportunity for new users on G7, we want to make sure we prioritize G7 and that form factor for those patients coming on to therapy on the G Series. Make no mistake, though, as soon as possible, right after that, we will be moving DexCom ONE to that G7 form factor. Stay tuned. We'll have some updates as the years progress on. But you're thinking about it the right way. We will move there in relatively short order. Yes. It's a good question. Look, I think the way to think about the ASP is it's really more about channel than it is about version. And so as you think about where folks and who folks -- who gets access, the general way to think about it is Medicare which is publicly out there, I think after the increase, it's around $250 a month. There's a delta there which goes to the distributor who ultimately fulfills that. So the net price to us is south of that. But ultimately, that would be our price in that range; that's publicly available. Generally, commercial DME is higher than that and pharmacy is lower than that number. And so that's the way to think about it. In terms of then how ASP moves over time, think about it less of generation of product and think about it more as where folks want to get their product. And so I think you're thinking about it the right way. As we talked about, 75% of our lives covered in commercial. 75% of those patients, those patients obviously then come through at a lower price point. If that drifts to, say, 80%, you could see that having a potential tick on there. Again, most of that is behind us but that's the way to think about the split there. And then in terms of pump partners and how folks ultimately access it, it really depends again consumer preference. You're right, Tandem is generally accessed through the DME and Insulet's generally access to the pharmacy. So it makes sense that folks get their CGMs through that channel. That all being said, it's ultimately consumer preference. And we believe the consumer experience through the pharmacy is great. We have some really great DME partners. They do a wonderful job fulfilling product through that DME channel. And so we believe that, that folks can be fulfilled either way. Sure. Yes. I mean you're not far directionally off. I mean you are right, we do expect the Q1 contribution and really the sequential decline from Q4 into Q1 to be very similar to what you've seen in the past. And so that will help you get a little bit closer as you think about sequential decline as well from Q4 into Q1. That will put you into a ballpark. And then from there, you're right. We updated our number. It's about $15 million now as a result of the bridging program as opposed to the $20 million to $30 million. But that will get you in the ballpark. You're not far off but there's probably a little bit of tweaking to do around the edges there. But use that 21% contribution but think also 10% sequential. Those little rounding differences ultimately matter in there. Hopefully, that gives you the context you need though."

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Today, we reported another strong quarter for DexCom with third quarter organic revenue growth of 20% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Our teams executed incredibly well as we work to advance our strategic initiatives while preparing for the largest product launch in our company's history. In the U.S., we saw continued momentum after our strong second quarter new customer starts with ongoing loyalty among endocrinologists and growing traction with primary care physicians. We are finding these physicians eager to engage with our teams as they learn more about the clinical benefits and superior outcomes that DexCom CGM can provide their patients. While we expect these primary care relationships to be critical to our long-term customer aspirations, they also help us better serve the intensive insulin-using population in the U.S. today. The domestic core market still has a long runway of growth ahead as we expect the vast majority of the population to adopt CGM to help them better manage their health. Outside the U.S., our team continued to deliver customer access wins this quarter. One example, in August, the NHS announced the inclusion of DexCom ONE on prescription via the England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland drug tariff for everyone with type 1 diabetes and type 2 intensively managed diabetes. This announcement meaningfully expanded access to DexCom within these markets as our previous reimbursement was generally limited to a smaller population of higher-risk individuals. Importantly, this is a clear example of how we can leverage our portfolio strategy to reach many more people with diabetes across the globe. Whether we use DexCom ONE to enter new geographies or to improve access within existing markets, there is a large opportunity to expand our reach. In many cases, these are segments of the market that have lacked product choice for customers. So providing DexCom's leading real-time CGM solution is being welcomed enthusiastically from customers and health systems alike. As many of you have seen, we were also very excited to initiate our full OUS launch of G7 following a successful limited launch. G7 is now available in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Hong Kong. We have been looking forward to this day for a long time as we view G7 is not only a major step forward for DexCom but for the entire diabetes technology market. This is a game-changing launch. As we often say, G7 takes everything about G6 and makes it better. It has a 60% smaller form factor, 30-minute warm-up time, 12-hour grace period to allow customers to choose a convenient time to change sensors, an improved app experience and more. All of this while building upon the product performance and accuracy that has earned the trust of our customers and clinicians. These advancements were specifically designed to improve the lives of our customers, and that is being recognized by our earliest G7 users. The feedback from our launch has been incredibly positive, which adds our confidence that this product will take DexCom to the next level. We are moving quickly to make this life-changing technology available broadly around the world, and we'll be rolling out G7 across a steady cadence of additional geographies over the next several months. In the U.S., we have responded to the FDA, and our G7 regulatory pathway is tracking in line with expectations we shared last quarter. We completed the necessary software changes in response to the feedback we received from the agency and subsequently validated the data to ensure the software is operating as designed. These efforts position us well to receive G7 clearance before the end of the year. This is a very exciting time for us. We believe this is the product of the future for DexCom, and we are working diligently to make that product accessible to a much broader population, not only the intensive insulin-using population but moving into people with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin only, noninsulin-using type 2s, gestational, hospital, metabolic health and beyond. Along those lines, there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating outcomes beyond the intensive insulin-using population, including a recently published study in Diabetes Technology and Therapies. This study assessed the benefits of DexCom CGM for a population of predominantly noninsulin-using type 2 individuals. Similar to our mobile study, it demonstrated meaningful reductions in A1C levels and improvements in time and range across the study group. Notably, the largest improvements in time and range came from the cohort being treated with one or less medication per day. This suggests that a sizable opportunity exists to help individuals earlier in their diabetes journey, potentially preventing escalation of the disease. This has meaningful long-term health implications for those starting on CGM and also holds promise to reduce the economic burden on our health system associated with progression of diabetes. CMS clearly recognized this potential in 2017 when they became one of the first global payers to cover CGM for people with intensively managed type 2 diabetes and they appear ready to lead yet again in customer care. In early October, CMS published a proposed local coverage determination that would again meaningfully expand CGM for the Medicare population. Once finalized, this proposal would expand Medicare coverage to include the basal-only population as well as noninsulin-using individuals that have experienced hypoglycemia. This proposal is in direct response to the clinical outcomes demonstrated in our MOBILE trial, where DexCom proved to meaningfully improve time and range for this population. Since publishing that data, we have been expecting a reimbursement decision and applaud CMS for taking the lead. Coverage for the basal-only population alone would allow us to help significantly more people in the U.S. as we size that population approximately 3 million individuals. This will be the first major reimbursement expansion beyond the intensively managed space and one that we expect to be the first of many. Historically, CMS has often led commercial payers on coverage decisions, and we anticipate the same dynamic to occur here. However, we're not stopping there. We will continue to advocate for the millions of additional individuals that could benefit from access to real-time CGM. There is a massive opportunity ahead for DexCom. With that, I'll turn it over to Jereme for a review of the third quarter financials. Jereme?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2022, we reported worldwide revenue of $770 million compared to $650 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing growth of 20% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $573 million for the third quarter compared to $490 million in the third quarter of 2021, representing a growth of 17%. Momentum continues to grow in our U.S. business. We saw initial signs of an inflection in late Q1 and have been encouraged to see those positive customer trends continue in the months that followed. This resulted in a reacceleration in revenue growth in the third quarter. The investments we have made in our salesforce over the past year are starting to pay off. We instituted new salesforce tools earlier this year to make calls more efficient. And today, our team is yielding productivity metrics in line with our high expectations. We have also taken steps recently to simplify access for people in the United States by creating multiple cash pay options. We are seeing growing demand coming from outside our current reimbursement landscape, including the type 2 non-intensive space. So we established these programs to help serve these customers as we work to broaden access. International revenue grew 22%, totaling $196 million in the third quarter. International organic revenue growth was 28% for the third quarter. Our international business continues to deliver impressive results as access initiatives completed over the past year are helping us gain market share. For example, in Australia, we are seeing very positive response to the recently expanded reimbursement for G6. Within weeks, we saw an uptick in demand. And currently, our new customers are trending around three times higher than prior to this expanded access. We have seen this dynamic play out again and again, where broader access can serve as an almost immediate catalyst to demand. As a result, we will continue to prioritize our efforts to make DexCom CGM accessible to many more people across the globe. Our third quarter gross profit was $494.2 million or 64.2% of revenue compared to 68.7% of revenue in the third quarter of 2021. Similar to last quarter, the launch of G7 creates a difficult year-over-year comparison on gross margin as G7 development costs are now included in COGS. This dynamic accounts for some of the expected step down compared to 2021. Additionally, there were 70 basis point negative impact on gross margin from currency. Absent this, gross margin would have been approximately 65%. Operating expenses were $333 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $320 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our focus on cost management was on full display this quarter as we generated over 600 basis points of operating expense leverage despite ongoing investment to support our growth. We drove leverage in every category of spend this quarter, while simultaneously offsetting inflationary pressures. Our focus will continue to be on generating leverage in non-variable expenses while reinvesting those savings into our global commercial infrastructure. Operating income was $160.8 million or 20.9% of revenue in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $123.8 million or 19% of revenue in the same quarter of 2021 as our significant operating expense leverage more than offset gross margin declines in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $226.6 million or 29.4% of revenue for the third quarter compared to $173.5 million or 26.7% of revenue for the third quarter of 2021. Net income for the third quarter was $111.9 million or $0.28 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.4 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents. We reached a new high watermark in terms of free cash flow this quarter, generating over $180 million of free cash. This provides us the flexibility to support our ongoing growth opportunity, while also assessing any strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis. Our largest use of capital continues to be the buildup of our Malaysia manufacturing plant. Construction continues to progress on schedule, and we expect this facility to be producing commercial product by mid-next year. This facility will provide us the necessary scale and manufacturing efficiency to support our long-term cost targets. During the third quarter, we also executed our previously announced accelerated share repurchase program, purchasing over 550 million of outstanding shares. This allowed us to reduce the dilution associated with our 2023 convertible notes while buying back our shares at what we viewed as an attractive price point. Turning to guidance. We are updating our full year 2022 revenue guidance to a range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion. For margins, we are updating our full year guidance to the following. We are reducing our gross profit margin guidance to approximately 64%, down from 65% previously. And we are maintaining our previous operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance at 16% and 25%, respectively. This guidance factors in another sizable uptick in currency headwinds relative to expectations we shared a quarter ago. We now expect approximately $55 million of foreign currency headwinds for the full year relative to our prior estimate of around $40 million. This currency impact is the primary reason we found it prudent to reduce our gross margin guidance for 2022. However, we reiterated our operating margin guidance as we expect to offset the additional foreign exchange pressure through ongoing operating expense leverage. We have been able to navigate through a shifting economic environment well to date, but we are certainly not immune to macro pressure. Leading economic indicators continue to point to additional uncertainty in the coming quarters. So we are working proactively to offset these impacts where we can. All these dynamics could create incremental challenges to work through in the near term. We are as bullish as ever about our underlying business and the opportunity ahead for DexCom. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Jereme. Our third quarter was characterized by sharp execution and delivering results in line with what we said we were going to do. We're committed to launching G7 internationally in the third quarter, and now we have G7 in five different countries with more following closely behind. We said that our growth rates in the U.S. would reaccelerate as the underlying trends in the business remain strong, and we delivered on an acceleration in the growth rate. We committed to advancing our G7 regulatory process in the U.S., and our efforts this quarter leaves us on track for a clearance before the end of the year. We said that the basal-only coverage would be a matter of when, not if. Now we have more clarity around when. We will continue to operate with this type of focus on execution going forward. Finally, as we move into Q&A, we have Jake Leach with us. We recently announced the promotion of Jake to the role of Chief Operating Officer, providing him with end-to-end responsibility for product. With almost two decades of experience at DexCom and serving most recently as our Chief Technology Officer, nobody knows G7 and our product road map better than Jake. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Kevin, I thought I'd start with a question on your international business. You guys have been benefiting in the last few quarters from recent access wins. You talked about those in the prepared remarks. One of your competitors this quarter was dealing with some company-specific issues. So it's kind of hard to get a good feel for what's going on maybe underlying demand trends outside the U.S. So I guess the questions are, are you seeing anything tied to macro uncertainties in your international markets? And with a lot of your international markets paid for through nationalized health care systems, do you consider international to be more or less, I guess, macro sensitive compared to your U.S. business? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Jeff, I may ask Jereme to help me on that. I'll take a first pass. We have learned in our U.S. markets getting access and getting reimbursement through these government agencies is absolutely critical and key to driving growth. As we've had wins in the UK, we've had wins in Spain. We've continued to have wins in Germany as we've shifted price to create more access. That's what's driving our growth. We're getting access to more people who can use our technology and use our better product. For right now, we haven't seen any macro trends that would make us feel that this isn't going to continue. As we get more access, we will continue to grow and do well. DexCom ONE is going to be a home run for us. G7 is doing very well out of the gate. We look very much forward to a great year internationally in 2023. I don't know, Jereme, if you want to add to that?\nJereme Sylvain: No, Jeff, outside the U.S., historically, there's been a cost-sensitive approach towards care, health care. And that's where DexCom ONE has really played a major role for us of winning some additional access outside the U.S. So we do believe that providing these opportunities around multiple systems to address the need both more acute and less acute, it provides us really a differentiation. So we continue to expect to do well there. And we'll keep you posted if we start to see anything change in terms of macroeconomic demand starting to dampen individual access. But for now, what we see is a great opportunity and an opportunity given our product portfolio do very, very well there.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really good quarter. Maybe I'll ask about the basal opportunity, and this is really exciting here. I just want to try and set expectations for how we should think about updates to the model. First off, when do you think this can really start to - when should it start to impact the model and add new patients? And I realize it's about one-third of patients are Medicare. And then expectations, if you have them for reimbursement, should this be at the normal Medicare rate, meaning higher than the pharmacy right now? And when should we start to think about commercial plans coming online? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: You know what, I'll start with the big picture things. We're starting commercial plans and talking about this now. This is such a big event for us and such a big win that we'd be stupid not to. So we are thinking about this now. Our product offerings, our distribution strategy and all those things, Robbie, as far as when it's exactly going to hit and go into your models, that's something we'll discuss later. We know the time frame for this can be anywhere from like four, five to nine months out as we work through this. But we're confident we're going to get through it. We're just thrilled with the ruling, and we are thrilled that we could be part of this. Our data from the MOBILE study was a large component in pushing this initiative across the finish line because we saw how well those people did. Jereme, if you want to get into more specifics on the numbers side, go ahead.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Absolutely. So Robbie, the way we're thinking about it now is really - it's likely a second half 2023 event just given the time. And so expect that, but we'll give you more clarity as to how much the contribution is as we guide for 2023. In terms of commercial payers following, we do expect to see that as you certainly think of Medicare Advantage plans. But even as you have folks really progressing throughout their journey, we know that this product ultimately reduces cost from the system, improves lives and outcomes. And so we do expect those to come along as well. In terms of reimbursement, the way that CMS typically reverses it is based on qualification, and this is an expansion of the category of qualification. And so thus far, it looks like it's reimbursed in line with the existing qualifications. And at the end of the day, it's incumbent upon us, and we think we continue to show it that the economic benefits of putting somebody on CGM far outweigh the costs. And so it's on us to continue to show that evidence, and we think we can continue to prove that as more and more evidence comes. So we'll get back to you a little bit later in terms of the expectations of 2023 contribution. But that should give you a feel for what we expect over the coming year.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Matthew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nMatthew Blackman: Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. I have another question on basal. Also, as we try to think about modeling the annual value of these basal - patients, what is a reasonable way to think about where frequency for a basal patient? We've heard varying feedback from clinicians. And frankly, it's been tracking higher than we would have thought, maybe a 20-plus days per month, but I can't tell if there's any early adopter SKU in that. Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Appreciate it.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. I'll maybe draw you back to the MOBILE study, which the MOBILE study was really targeted at folks wearing it full time, which was the basis for CMS coverage. And so I think what we would see is as folks get on to therapy, we would expect a relatively similar utilization. There might be dips in between it for here and there, a day here or there, a day here and there as product is coming in. But for the most part, we expect full-time wear, and that's how we've seen folks get the most benefit. So I'd expect it from there. Clearly, this is a new market for us, but all the early work we've done around patient satisfaction, patient results, these folks have wanted to wear it. They wanted to wear it full time. And so we expect that to be the baseline going forward.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to talk a little bit about U.S. growth. Obviously, you saw a really nice acceleration from Q2 to where we are in Q3. So can you provide any context around the growth in new patient adds, how that's trended going into Q3 and more specifically in Q4? And I know you'll love this, but going into 2023, all of this growth is coming in advance of G7 in basal. So why shouldn't we assume even more of an acceleration to occur for several quarters from now? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. Happy to talk about the patient trends. So what we saw kind of rewind back Q2, a record for us. Q3, early feedback is it's at least equivalent of that of Q2, and we'll even get more data here soon. So Q3 was another very strong new patient add quarter for us. And so when we talked last about and expecting a reacceleration that was on Q2 and an expectation of a strong Q3. I think we had a very, very strong Q3. And quite frankly, we expect a strong Q4. That's where you see that reacceleration in the U.S. So, very bullish on that particular opportunity. And you are right, that is with G6. And so we obviously are very offer G7 to the U.S. population. As it pertains to momentum and moving into 2023, we'll talk about that as we give guidance in 2023. But I think the takeaway here is we are still very bullish on this business, very bullish on the opportunity and ecstatic about the opportunity to offer G7.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open, sir.\nMatthew O'Brien: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Jereme, just if you could put a little bit finer point on basal for next year? I know you said second half of next year, and you're expecting a lot of wear. But it's going to be pretty early days. A lot of things got to work through. So is it fair to think of it as a fairly modest contributor next year? And then this might be a kind of a question, but you have G7 coming out next year and then you're going to have new basal patients. Just talk about manufacturing for all these products you're going to need over the next several years? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. Let me start with the - maybe the model expectation. We have Jake here. And I think it will be good for him to talk through the manufacturing. So in terms of how to model it out, Kevin alluded to it earlier. Generally, there's about a six to nine month period where look, there's a proposal, and things have to go through. And so as folks start to open up coverage, that's why we expect that coverage to really start in the back half. And again, this is a recurring revenue business. So there will be a contribution we expect in 2023. How material, we're going to size that up, and we'll make sure that we - as we size it up for you, we'll give you the context for how we're guiding to it in 2023 so you understand our assumptions. If things come earlier or things go faster or slower, we'll certainly give you that clarity so that you have it. But our expectation is there's a contribution. How material, it's going to take a little bit of time as that grows, but still a contribution and really momentum exiting 2023 into 2024. But in terms of capacity, maybe let me turn it over to Jake to give you some context there.\nJake Leach: Yea. Thanks, Jereme. So from a capacity perspective, we've been gearing up for this G7 launch for quite a while. So we've got G7 lines installed here in San Diego as well as in Mesa. And so we feel really good about our position to meet the needs of our full G7 U.S. launch as well as the international launches that will continue throughout the year. Also to remind you that we've got our Malaysia plant coming online the next year. So that should also help boost our capacity. And so I feel really good about the ability to both provide G6 and G7 product.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you for taking question. Sorry, I don't know, if you heard any of that. But...\nKevin Sayer: Let's start over.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening and thank you for taking the question. DexCom ONE launched in, I think you said six geographies outside the United States. How is that ramping? How should we think about that contributing? Because I was starting to put together in my mind like your core base business, you layer on top of that G7 benefit. You layer on top of that DexCom ONE and, of course, basal. What's the layer for DexCom ONE?\nKevin Sayer: I'm not going to get into numbers, and we'll get into models later, Joanne. I can tell you again, I'll reiterate our comments on the call. There are many geographies where CGM is accepted where we have been isolated to higher-risk patients, patients on pumps or severe hypoglycemia. And we were reimbursed more, but we were narrowly viewed. In many of these geographies now with DexCom ONE with our lower-cost offering, but with real-time CGM and the accuracy and other features we deliver, we're now able to go compete for those customers. That will be a very important level of business for us, particularly in Europe going forward and other countries and other places where we need to launch it. That will be a layer - I mean, our core business, our core G Series product is going to be our primary source of revenue for a while. But over time, you will see all these elements grow bigger and take a bigger piece of the pie. And Jereme, you build the models. You - why don't you add a little more?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So Joanne, I completely understand the question and how to model it. I think what I would say is in 2022, this is a business just getting started. So it's not a material contributor in 2022. However, we understand the challenge. And so we will make sure that we're able to identify what the contribution looks like as we start to give forward-looking guidance over time. So just rest assured, as that business gets bigger, we'll start to give you line of sight into that. For now, what's most important is we've unlocked an incredible amount of TAM. And that's super important as we think about how many new patients we're certainly going to be bringing in. So more to come there we'll certainly help you with models going forward. But for now, just know DexCom ONE is a relatively small contributor this year, and we'll talk about 2023 here in a few months.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon. Thanks. Just a quick one. I may have missed this, but did you talk about volume growth in the quarter? And if not, can you? And maybe comment on any geographic differences? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. So we were in the unit volume in the mid- to upper 30s globally. In terms of the performance, the U.S. was slightly below that but still in the mid-30s, and OUS was slightly above that in the upper 30s and so really just continued strong momentum in that patient cohort or that underlying patient volume.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nNathan Treybeck: Good evening. This is Nathan Treybeck on for Larry. In terms of your comments around G7 U.S. launch timing by year-end, is there anything that still needs to be done? And then how soon after the approval do you expect a full launch? And how should we think about the ramp? Is there any reason why it should be different than the G6? Thanks.\nJake Leach: Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Jacob. I'll take that one. So yes, we responded to the FDA in Q3 with the answers to their final questions. And so we feel really good about how that positions us for approval in Q4, so before the end of the year. We're really planning our launch to occur in Q1. So that will be a full launch and the - our status with the FDA is we've gone back and forth. We're feeling really good about this being kind of the end of the review period. And so we're very confident in that Q4 approval timing and a Q1 U.S. launch.\nOperator: The next question in the queue comes from [Matt Tyler] with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. I actually wanted to double-click on some of your commentary on DexCom ONE and thinking about your portfolio strategy as you get G7 out there. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about how you're going to use G7, G6 and one together to kind of meet customers where they're at in different markets around the world? What are some of the different flavors or different ways you could use that portfolio?\nKevin Sayer: Yes, this is Kevin. I'll take that at a high level. Certainly, our G Series product, our G7 is going to be our flagship product, we roll it out. And that will be - we're very comfortable with that being a home run. There will be some countries where G6 is so new. It's not going to be prudent to go rush G7 into those geographies. We can let that customer base grow while we expand others. So we look at G6 and G7 in a very similar light as far as their features, the connectivity and all the things that they do. With DexCom ONE currently on a G6 platform, we have areas where we need to grow, and we need to get there fast. And that product will remain on the G6 platform. We're not ready to move it to G7 anyway. We're going to use our existing G7 capacity to sell G7s in the beginning and strengthen ourselves in our current business and where we are doing very well now with our partners and everybody else ultimately DexCom ONE will shift to that platform. And we'll roll out that way. So as you look at DexCom ONE, we've said many times that product is for two major purposes. The first one is to go into new geographies where we can do an online e-commerce type business and launch it as we have in those first four countries, in countries where CGM is reimbursed. But again, we have this situation where there are two types of CGMs they will pay for the - that for the high-risk patient and connectivity and with those features that we've always had on the G Series. And then the other area, we are using DexCom ONE as a vehicle to get into those markets and utilize our capacity to go sell sensors and serve customers there and give them a better experience than they've ever had before. And that is the plan for right now.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Go ahead, Ma'am.\nMarie Thibault: Thank you so much for taking the question. Wanted to ask one here on your comments on cash pay in the U.S. Unless I'm mistaken, I believe that's a recent shift or a new shift for DexCom strategy? Would love to hear a little bit more about how that's being rolled out and how patients and providers are hearing about that cash pay option? Thanks so much.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. This is Jereme. It's a bit of a change. I'd say it's an addition or an augment to an existing strategy. So we've always believed that access is incredibly important. And we believe that over the long term, access is at the basis of adoption. However, there are some certain populations out there that have high interest in the product that continue to want to use the product to manage their diabetes. And we felt that this was a way to allow them to do so while we work on that access. And so what we are doing is we're launching multiple different versions of cash pays. We'll have those being promoted here shortly to targeted populations. And what the goal here is that folks don't have coverage, while we work in the background to get coverage, basal is a good opportunity, a good example, I should say. They can't get the product for a discount price. And the price is less than 50% of what - the cost of them is 50% less than what it historically would have been. So real good opportunity, multiple different options, multiple different ways we're going to be rolling it out. You'll see some marketing materials around it soon. But I would - I think this is a great thing for access. I think it's a great thing for folks who have been looking to get on a DexCom that, for whatever reason, haven't been able to allow them to do so.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you for taking the question. So obviously, the G7 launch, you're starting in a few countries now, going to move into the U.S. in the Q1 next year. Just how should we be thinking about gross margins when we - when you turn on those facilities and then in particular, the Malaysia facility coming online as well? Just how should we think about the COGS line over the course of the next 18 months?\nJereme Sylvain : Yes. So the best way - good question. The best way to think about it is in the first quarter in which we turn on lines, you generally have a dip in gross margin. And that's the initial set up the yields. We'll give you guys a little bit more line of sight into cadence as we get into 2023 guidance. But as you turn on those lines, the first sets, the yields are a little bit lower. You're absorbing in depreciation, and then as those yields start to improve, you start to get a better gross margin run on those. So I think the expectation is, is you'll have some blips there in the periods in which we launch into certain countries, specifically U.S. And then as more and more folks transition off of G6 to G7 and those increase, you're going to see those margins improve. Longer term, G7, we can make at a lower cost than G6. And so it's just this transitory. We'll help you out on the modeling as we get into 2023 guidance, but as you're trying to get your head around what the cadence looks like when we turn online, that's the expectation of when you'll have the dip and then a recovery after that.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And the next question in the queue is Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi, guys. As we think about some of these new opportunities from the LCD, I'm wondering in the near term how things are progressing on the intensive type 2 side. With - given the comments you made in terms of primary care doc progress as well as the work you've done on coverage, can you update us on where you guys - do you think the market is in terms of penetration intensive type 2s? And are the pieces in place for that just to continue to expand meaningfully in the coming couple of - 2 years?\nJereme Sylvain: Thanks for the question. We continue to do very, very well. So if you think about kind of where that type 2 intensive penetration is, it's surpassing 35%. In terms of how we're doing, I think couple of maybe data points, which I think is helpful. First off, record new patients, Q2. Q3 is in line with that based on early feedback, could even be a little bit higher. And so you're seeing patients coming in, which is just an indication of more and more folks adopting where a good majority of those are coming from that type 2 intensive population. It's our fastest-growing segment. I think you also think about it from a context of who we call on. And as we look at our sales team, we talk about productivity, more than third-quarters of the calls we make are now to primary care physicians. And that's because that's where we're looking to expand over time. So I think what we've done in expanding the salesforce last year and really focusing on those sales tools, thinking about the type 2 intensive and then beyond, basal and beyond, I think you're really seeing that play out. And you're seeing some very strong growth in that type 2 intensive segment, and it sets us up well for that basal segment.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatt Miksic: Hi. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on some of the questions about how the ramp-up of G7, it is a little bit of a modeling question, not really at all sort of a guidance question. But just in terms of how the portfolio comes together and works maybe following up on Kyle's question on ramping up these new lines. Can you talk a little bit about channel, how the sort of middle of the P&L might respond or flex as you kind of get into some of the opportunities you're talking about? Is there a channel synergy across all of these? Do you expect to have to kind of spend into some of these opportunities and then get leverage over time? Maybe if you could talk a little bit about that, that would be super helpful. Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, sure. So the line - the way you think about the lines and this is the way we've set it up is DexCom ONE physical form factor cost to manufacture, not necessarily cost to support and how we service it, but really the physical product. DexCom ONE is very similar to G6. There are other features that G6 has, but hardware is very similar. And it's very similar in G7. G7 lines and eventually DexCom ONE will migrate to a G7 line. And so as you think about these products, then it becomes a question of price point and then how we ultimately service the patient there. So that's the way to think about it. Over time, as we go into certain markets depending on price point, it's got much less to do with what I would say is the physical product itself. We grow into those markets over time through economies of scale. And so that's one of the reasons we believe with DexCom ONE, there's a real great opportunity here. The economies of scale for us are massive. And by going into those markets, we certainly can grow into that profitability profile. So as you think down the middle of the P& L, certainly, as you go into DexCom ONE, there could be a slight margin differentiation, but those economies of scales help offset it. We also look at the service model, and we're able to manage the service model in a different way. So the ultimate operating margin contribution is the same. So that's how we think about it. And so as you're modeling it through, that's how I would think about it.\nKevin Sayer: Yes. I'd just add to that. And I don't want this lost on the call. Take a look at our operating performance this quarter. Record cash flows as a former CFO is something I love to hear. And so we have managed our business very tightly. As we look at these, we're works new product lines, your question is very appropriate. And we do have work streams about our cost to serve our patients, our cost to develop our new products, our manufacturing costs given all these new things we're doing. We are looking at the cost structure of the company every bit as much as we're looking at the product launches. So we can make sure that when we get to the end of this road with these launches and with these products and new markets and new products that we have operating margins that are acceptable to us as we increase our customer base dramatically.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Joshua Jennings with Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: All right. Good evening. Thanks for question. I wanted to just ask about the sequential acceleration in 3Q of revenue growth. And either if you could quantify or just qualitatively describe the contributions from your new pump partner. And just on that topic, if you can just remind us the requirements once G7 is approved to integrate G7 into the Tandem insulin pumps. Any steps that you can highlight and what your expectations are on that front? And can anything be done in front of G7 approval with year-over-year partners? Thanks for taking the question.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure, I'll start with the contribution. And let me turn it over to Jake, who is our maestro on product development and understanding products. In terms of contribution, look, we're very excited about both Tandem and Insulet products. And as they launch more and more products that we are obviously integrated with, we expect it to contribute. Now quantifying that and having those contributions, it's a little bit difficult to do given some products - some folks were already on DexCom CGM who bring in a pump, and some folks pull over. So as time moves on, we'll be able to really tease that apart. But I think what we would say is we're still bullish on the opportunity of folks ultimately using our product with these incredible pump partners. I'll leave it at that just because it gets hard to contribute. Again, we'll be able to retrospectively give feedback as time moves on. But let me give it to Jake in terms of the connectivity and the timelines on G7.\nJake Leach: Yes. Thanks, Jereme. So on G7 integration with our pump partners, basically, the steps are to make a few updates on the pump side to take advantage of the new features that are within G7 such as the fast warm up as well as the grace period. And so those groups are already - they have been already working on that for quite a while. And so we do see great progress on those integrations. They've gone through kind of final steps of development and validation. So a lot of that work can be, to your point, done ahead of time. And so when it comes to a specific timing of approvals and launches, we'll leave that to our pump partners. But we're progressing very rapidly, and we do expect them to be integrated soon. One thing I'll note is that on our other side on the digital health partners, for example, in Europe where we have G7 out, those that are connected up to our real-time API already have G7 integrations. For example, Sugarmate is a group that's already consuming G7 data within their app at the beginning of the launch. So very excited about the opportunity to bring more to the ecosystem with G7.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Mr. Sayer for closing remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks a lot, everybody. This was a great quarter for us with growth, with excitement related to our product launches, expanding global access and performance on the bottom line as well in a time when the world is in a lot of chaos, we've done what we said we were going to do yet again. Our teams are just executing very well as we press towards the end of the year and look to build momentum next year. I want to thank our team members for their hard work to strive towards these goals. It is all hands on deck to get G7 done, to get DexCom ONE out in these markets and do all the things that we are trying to do. But I want to close with a special note. I want to thank all the members of the diabetes community that have been working together to help improve access to CGM technology. The recent CMS proposal represents a big win for people with diabetes. And we're only one member of a large group advocating for this result. This was a collective effort from the diabetes community on behalf of the diabetes community. We want to acknowledge the hard work that led to this proposal, both inside and outside of DexCom and share our excitement to help so many more people with diabetes in the U.S. live healthier lives, and it's only the beginning. Thanks a lot, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This will conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Today, we reported another strong quarter for DexCom with third quarter organic revenue growth of 20% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Our teams executed incredibly well as we work to advance our strategic initiatives while preparing for the largest product launch in our company's history. In the U.S., we saw continued momentum after our strong second quarter new customer starts with ongoing loyalty among endocrinologists and growing traction with primary care physicians. We are finding these physicians eager to engage with our teams as they learn more about the clinical benefits and superior outcomes that DexCom CGM can provide their patients. While we expect these primary care relationships to be critical to our long-term customer aspirations, they also help us better serve the intensive insulin-using population in the U.S. today. The domestic core market still has a long runway of growth ahead as we expect the vast majority of the population to adopt CGM to help them better manage their health. Outside the U.S., our team continued to deliver customer access wins this quarter. One example, in August, the NHS announced the inclusion of DexCom ONE on prescription via the England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland drug tariff for everyone with type 1 diabetes and type 2 intensively managed diabetes. This announcement meaningfully expanded access to DexCom within these markets as our previous reimbursement was generally limited to a smaller population of higher-risk individuals. Importantly, this is a clear example of how we can leverage our portfolio strategy to reach many more people with diabetes across the globe. Whether we use DexCom ONE to enter new geographies or to improve access within existing markets, there is a large opportunity to expand our reach. In many cases, these are segments of the market that have lacked product choice for customers. So providing DexCom's leading real-time CGM solution is being welcomed enthusiastically from customers and health systems alike. As many of you have seen, we were also very excited to initiate our full OUS launch of G7 following a successful limited launch. G7 is now available in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Hong Kong. We have been looking forward to this day for a long time as we view G7 is not only a major step forward for DexCom but for the entire diabetes technology market. This is a game-changing launch. As we often say, G7 takes everything about G6 and makes it better. It has a 60% smaller form factor, 30-minute warm-up time, 12-hour grace period to allow customers to choose a convenient time to change sensors, an improved app experience and more. All of this while building upon the product performance and accuracy that has earned the trust of our customers and clinicians. These advancements were specifically designed to improve the lives of our customers, and that is being recognized by our earliest G7 users. The feedback from our launch has been incredibly positive, which adds our confidence that this product will take DexCom to the next level. We are moving quickly to make this life-changing technology available broadly around the world, and we'll be rolling out G7 across a steady cadence of additional geographies over the next several months. In the U.S., we have responded to the FDA, and our G7 regulatory pathway is tracking in line with expectations we shared last quarter. We completed the necessary software changes in response to the feedback we received from the agency and subsequently validated the data to ensure the software is operating as designed. These efforts position us well to receive G7 clearance before the end of the year. This is a very exciting time for us. We believe this is the product of the future for DexCom, and we are working diligently to make that product accessible to a much broader population, not only the intensive insulin-using population but moving into people with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin only, noninsulin-using type 2s, gestational, hospital, metabolic health and beyond. Along those lines, there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating outcomes beyond the intensive insulin-using population, including a recently published study in Diabetes Technology and Therapies. This study assessed the benefits of DexCom CGM for a population of predominantly noninsulin-using type 2 individuals. Similar to our mobile study, it demonstrated meaningful reductions in A1C levels and improvements in time and range across the study group. Notably, the largest improvements in time and range came from the cohort being treated with one or less medication per day. This suggests that a sizable opportunity exists to help individuals earlier in their diabetes journey, potentially preventing escalation of the disease. This has meaningful long-term health implications for those starting on CGM and also holds promise to reduce the economic burden on our health system associated with progression of diabetes. CMS clearly recognized this potential in 2017 when they became one of the first global payers to cover CGM for people with intensively managed type 2 diabetes and they appear ready to lead yet again in customer care. In early October, CMS published a proposed local coverage determination that would again meaningfully expand CGM for the Medicare population. Once finalized, this proposal would expand Medicare coverage to include the basal-only population as well as noninsulin-using individuals that have experienced hypoglycemia. This proposal is in direct response to the clinical outcomes demonstrated in our MOBILE trial, where DexCom proved to meaningfully improve time and range for this population. Since publishing that data, we have been expecting a reimbursement decision and applaud CMS for taking the lead. Coverage for the basal-only population alone would allow us to help significantly more people in the U.S. as we size that population approximately 3 million individuals. This will be the first major reimbursement expansion beyond the intensively managed space and one that we expect to be the first of many. Historically, CMS has often led commercial payers on coverage decisions, and we anticipate the same dynamic to occur here. However, we're not stopping there. We will continue to advocate for the millions of additional individuals that could benefit from access to real-time CGM. There is a massive opportunity ahead for DexCom. With that, I'll turn it over to Jereme for a review of the third quarter financials. Jereme? Thanks, Jereme. Our third quarter was characterized by sharp execution and delivering results in line with what we said we were going to do. We're committed to launching G7 internationally in the third quarter, and now we have G7 in five different countries with more following closely behind. We said that our growth rates in the U.S. would reaccelerate as the underlying trends in the business remain strong, and we delivered on an acceleration in the growth rate. We committed to advancing our G7 regulatory process in the U.S., and our efforts this quarter leaves us on track for a clearance before the end of the year. We said that the basal-only coverage would be a matter of when, not if. Now we have more clarity around when. We will continue to operate with this type of focus on execution going forward. Finally, as we move into Q&A, we have Jake Leach with us. We recently announced the promotion of Jake to the role of Chief Operating Officer, providing him with end-to-end responsibility for product. With almost two decades of experience at DexCom and serving most recently as our Chief Technology Officer, nobody knows G7 and our product road map better than Jake. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Jeff, I may ask Jereme to help me on that. I'll take a first pass. We have learned in our U.S. markets getting access and getting reimbursement through these government agencies is absolutely critical and key to driving growth. As we've had wins in the UK, we've had wins in Spain. We've continued to have wins in Germany as we've shifted price to create more access. That's what's driving our growth. We're getting access to more people who can use our technology and use our better product. For right now, we haven't seen any macro trends that would make us feel that this isn't going to continue. As we get more access, we will continue to grow and do well. DexCom ONE is going to be a home run for us. G7 is doing very well out of the gate. We look very much forward to a great year internationally in 2023. I don't know, Jereme, if you want to add to that? You know what, I'll start with the big picture things. We're starting commercial plans and talking about this now. This is such a big event for us and such a big win that we'd be stupid not to. So we are thinking about this now. Our product offerings, our distribution strategy and all those things, Robbie, as far as when it's exactly going to hit and go into your models, that's something we'll discuss later. We know the time frame for this can be anywhere from like four, five to nine months out as we work through this. But we're confident we're going to get through it. We're just thrilled with the ruling, and we are thrilled that we could be part of this. Our data from the MOBILE study was a large component in pushing this initiative across the finish line because we saw how well those people did. Jereme, if you want to get into more specifics on the numbers side, go ahead. Let's start over. I'm not going to get into numbers, and we'll get into models later, Joanne. I can tell you again, I'll reiterate our comments on the call. There are many geographies where CGM is accepted where we have been isolated to higher-risk patients, patients on pumps or severe hypoglycemia. And we were reimbursed more, but we were narrowly viewed. In many of these geographies now with DexCom ONE with our lower-cost offering, but with real-time CGM and the accuracy and other features we deliver, we're now able to go compete for those customers. That will be a very important level of business for us, particularly in Europe going forward and other countries and other places where we need to launch it. That will be a layer - I mean, our core business, our core G Series product is going to be our primary source of revenue for a while. But over time, you will see all these elements grow bigger and take a bigger piece of the pie. And Jereme, you build the models. You - why don't you add a little more? Yes, this is Kevin. I'll take that at a high level. Certainly, our G Series product, our G7 is going to be our flagship product, we roll it out. And that will be - we're very comfortable with that being a home run. There will be some countries where G6 is so new. It's not going to be prudent to go rush G7 into those geographies. We can let that customer base grow while we expand others. So we look at G6 and G7 in a very similar light as far as their features, the connectivity and all the things that they do. With DexCom ONE currently on a G6 platform, we have areas where we need to grow, and we need to get there fast. And that product will remain on the G6 platform. We're not ready to move it to G7 anyway. We're going to use our existing G7 capacity to sell G7s in the beginning and strengthen ourselves in our current business and where we are doing very well now with our partners and everybody else ultimately DexCom ONE will shift to that platform. And we'll roll out that way. So as you look at DexCom ONE, we've said many times that product is for two major purposes.

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2022, we reported worldwide revenue of $770 million compared to $650 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing growth of 20% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $573 million for the third quarter compared to $490 million in the third quarter of 2021, representing a growth of 17%. Momentum continues to grow in our U.S. business. We saw initial signs of an inflection in late Q1 and have been encouraged to see those positive customer trends continue in the months that followed. This resulted in a reacceleration in revenue growth in the third quarter. The investments we have made in our salesforce over the past year are starting to pay off. We instituted new salesforce tools earlier this year to make calls more efficient. And today, our team is yielding productivity metrics in line with our high expectations. We have also taken steps recently to simplify access for people in the United States by creating multiple cash pay options. We are seeing growing demand coming from outside our current reimbursement landscape, including the type 2 non-intensive space. So we established these programs to help serve these customers as we work to broaden access. International revenue grew 22%, totaling $196 million in the third quarter. International organic revenue growth was 28% for the third quarter. Our international business continues to deliver impressive results as access initiatives completed over the past year are helping us gain market share. For example, in Australia, we are seeing very positive response to the recently expanded reimbursement for G6. Within weeks, we saw an uptick in demand. And currently, our new customers are trending around three times higher than prior to this expanded access. We have seen this dynamic play out again and again, where broader access can serve as an almost immediate catalyst to demand. As a result, we will continue to prioritize our efforts to make DexCom CGM accessible to many more people across the globe. Our third quarter gross profit was $494.2 million or 64.2% of revenue compared to 68.7% of revenue in the third quarter of 2021. Similar to last quarter, the launch of G7 creates a difficult year-over-year comparison on gross margin as G7 development costs are now included in COGS. This dynamic accounts for some of the expected step down compared to 2021. Additionally, there were 70 basis point negative impact on gross margin from currency. Absent this, gross margin would have been approximately 65%. Operating expenses were $333 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $320 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our focus on cost management was on full display this quarter as we generated over 600 basis points of operating expense leverage despite ongoing investment to support our growth. We drove leverage in every category of spend this quarter, while simultaneously offsetting inflationary pressures. Our focus will continue to be on generating leverage in non-variable expenses while reinvesting those savings into our global commercial infrastructure. Operating income was $160.8 million or 20.9% of revenue in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $123.8 million or 19% of revenue in the same quarter of 2021 as our significant operating expense leverage more than offset gross margin declines in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $226.6 million or 29.4% of revenue for the third quarter compared to $173.5 million or 26.7% of revenue for the third quarter of 2021. Net income for the third quarter was $111.9 million or $0.28 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.4 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents. We reached a new high watermark in terms of free cash flow this quarter, generating over $180 million of free cash. This provides us the flexibility to support our ongoing growth opportunity, while also assessing any strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis. Our largest use of capital continues to be the buildup of our Malaysia manufacturing plant. Construction continues to progress on schedule, and we expect this facility to be producing commercial product by mid-next year. This facility will provide us the necessary scale and manufacturing efficiency to support our long-term cost targets. During the third quarter, we also executed our previously announced accelerated share repurchase program, purchasing over 550 million of outstanding shares. This allowed us to reduce the dilution associated with our 2023 convertible notes while buying back our shares at what we viewed as an attractive price point. Turning to guidance. We are updating our full year 2022 revenue guidance to a range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion. For margins, we are updating our full year guidance to the following. We are reducing our gross profit margin guidance to approximately 64%, down from 65% previously. And we are maintaining our previous operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance at 16% and 25%, respectively. This guidance factors in another sizable uptick in currency headwinds relative to expectations we shared a quarter ago. We now expect approximately $55 million of foreign currency headwinds for the full year relative to our prior estimate of around $40 million. This currency impact is the primary reason we found it prudent to reduce our gross margin guidance for 2022. However, we reiterated our operating margin guidance as we expect to offset the additional foreign exchange pressure through ongoing operating expense leverage. We have been able to navigate through a shifting economic environment well to date, but we are certainly not immune to macro pressure. Leading economic indicators continue to point to additional uncertainty in the coming quarters. So we are working proactively to offset these impacts where we can. All these dynamics could create incremental challenges to work through in the near term. We are as bullish as ever about our underlying business and the opportunity ahead for DexCom. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. No, Jeff, outside the U.S., historically, there's been a cost-sensitive approach towards care, health care. And that's where DexCom ONE has really played a major role for us of winning some additional access outside the U.S. So we do believe that providing these opportunities around multiple systems to address the need both more acute and less acute, it provides us really a differentiation. So we continue to expect to do well there. And we'll keep you posted if we start to see anything change in terms of macroeconomic demand starting to dampen individual access. But for now, what we see is a great opportunity and an opportunity given our product portfolio do very, very well there. Sure. Absolutely. So Robbie, the way we're thinking about it now is really - it's likely a second half 2023 event just given the time. And so expect that, but we'll give you more clarity as to how much the contribution is as we guide for 2023. In terms of commercial payers following, we do expect to see that as you certainly think of Medicare Advantage plans. But even as you have folks really progressing throughout their journey, we know that this product ultimately reduces cost from the system, improves lives and outcomes. And so we do expect those to come along as well. In terms of reimbursement, the way that CMS typically reverses it is based on qualification, and this is an expansion of the category of qualification. And so thus far, it looks like it's reimbursed in line with the existing qualifications. And at the end of the day, it's incumbent upon us, and we think we continue to show it that the economic benefits of putting somebody on CGM far outweigh the costs. And so it's on us to continue to show that evidence, and we think we can continue to prove that as more and more evidence comes. So we'll get back to you a little bit later in terms of the expectations of 2023 contribution. But that should give you a feel for what we expect over the coming year. Yes. I'll maybe draw you back to the MOBILE study, which the MOBILE study was really targeted at folks wearing it full time, which was the basis for CMS coverage. And so I think what we would see is as folks get on to therapy, we would expect a relatively similar utilization. There might be dips in between it for here and there, a day here or there, a day here and there as product is coming in. But for the most part, we expect full-time wear, and that's how we've seen folks get the most benefit. So I'd expect it from there. Clearly, this is a new market for us, but all the early work we've done around patient satisfaction, patient results, these folks have wanted to wear it. They wanted to wear it full time. And so we expect that to be the baseline going forward. Sure. Yes. Happy to talk about the patient trends. So what we saw kind of rewind back Q2, a record for us. Q3, early feedback is it's at least equivalent of that of Q2, and we'll even get more data here soon. So Q3 was another very strong new patient add quarter for us. And so when we talked last about and expecting a reacceleration that was on Q2 and an expectation of a strong Q3. I think we had a very, very strong Q3. And quite frankly, we expect a strong Q4. That's where you see that reacceleration in the U.S. So, very bullish on that particular opportunity. And you are right, that is with G6. And so we obviously are very offer G7 to the U.S. population. As it pertains to momentum and moving into 2023, we'll talk about that as we give guidance in 2023. But I think the takeaway here is we are still very bullish on this business, very bullish on the opportunity and ecstatic about the opportunity to offer G7. Sure. Yes. Let me start with the - maybe the model expectation. We have Jake here. And I think it will be good for him to talk through the manufacturing. So in terms of how to model it out, Kevin alluded to it earlier. Generally, there's about a six to nine month period where look, there's a proposal, and things have to go through. And so as folks start to open up coverage, that's why we expect that coverage to really start in the back half. And again, this is a recurring revenue business. So there will be a contribution we expect in 2023. How material, we're going to size that up, and we'll make sure that we - as we size it up for you, we'll give you the context for how we're guiding to it in 2023 so you understand our assumptions. If things come earlier or things go faster or slower, we'll certainly give you that clarity so that you have it. But our expectation is there's a contribution. How material, it's going to take a little bit of time as that grows, but still a contribution and really momentum exiting 2023 into 2024. But in terms of capacity, maybe let me turn it over to Jake to give you some context there. Yes. So Joanne, I completely understand the question and how to model it. I think what I would say is in 2022, this is a business just getting started. So it's not a material contributor in 2022. However, we understand the challenge. And so we will make sure that we're able to identify what the contribution looks like as we start to give forward-looking guidance over time. So just rest assured, as that business gets bigger, we'll start to give you line of sight into that. For now, what's most important is we've unlocked an incredible amount of TAM. And that's super important as we think about how many new patients we're certainly going to be bringing in. So more to come there we'll certainly help you with models going forward. But for now, just know DexCom ONE is a relatively small contributor this year, and we'll talk about 2023 here in a few months. Sure. Yes. So we were in the unit volume in the mid- to upper 30s globally. In terms of the performance, the U.S. was slightly below that but still in the mid-30s, and OUS was slightly above that in the upper 30s and so really just continued strong momentum in that patient cohort or that underlying patient volume. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. This is Jereme. It's a bit of a change. I'd say it's an addition or an augment to an existing strategy. So we've always believed that access is incredibly important. And we believe that over the long term, access is at the basis of adoption. However, there are some certain populations out there that have high interest in the product that continue to want to use the product to manage their diabetes. And we felt that this was a way to allow them to do so while we work on that access. And so what we are doing is we're launching multiple different versions of cash pays. We'll have those being promoted here shortly to targeted populations. And what the goal here is that folks don't have coverage, while we work in the background to get coverage, basal is a good opportunity, a good example, I should say. They can't get the product for a discount price. And the price is less than 50% of what - the cost of them is 50% less than what it historically would have been. So real good opportunity, multiple different options, multiple different ways we're going to be rolling it out. You'll see some marketing materials around it soon. But I would - I think this is a great thing for access. I think it's a great thing for folks who have been looking to get on a DexCom that, for whatever reason, haven't been able to allow them to do so. Yes. So the best way - good question. The best way to think about it is in the first quarter in which we turn on lines, you generally have a dip in gross margin. And that's the initial set up the yields. We'll give you guys a little bit more line of sight into cadence as we get into 2023 guidance. But as you turn on those lines, the first sets, the yields are a little bit lower. You're absorbing in depreciation, and then as those yields start to improve, you start to get a better gross margin run on those. So I think the expectation is, is you'll have some blips there in the periods in which we launch into certain countries, specifically U.S. And then as more and more folks transition off of G6 to G7 and those increase, you're going to see those margins improve. Longer term, G7, we can make at a lower cost than G6. And so it's just this transitory. We'll help you out on the modeling as we get into 2023 guidance, but as you're trying to get your head around what the cadence looks like when we turn online, that's the expectation of when you'll have the dip and then a recovery after that. Thanks for the question. We continue to do very, very well. So if you think about kind of where that type 2 intensive penetration is, it's surpassing 35%. In terms of how we're doing, I think couple of maybe data points, which I think is helpful. First off, record new patients, Q2. Q3 is in line with that based on early feedback, could even be a little bit higher. And so you're seeing patients coming in, which is just an indication of more and more folks adopting where a good majority of those are coming from that type 2 intensive population. It's our fastest-growing segment. I think you also think about it from a context of who we call on. And as we look at our sales team, we talk about productivity, more than third-quarters of the calls we make are now to primary care physicians. And that's because that's where we're looking to expand over time. So I think what we've done in expanding the salesforce last year and really focusing on those sales tools, thinking about the type 2 intensive and then beyond, basal and beyond, I think you're really seeing that play out. And you're seeing some very strong growth in that type 2 intensive segment, and it sets us up well for that basal segment. Yes, sure. So the line - the way you think about the lines and this is the way we've set it up is DexCom ONE physical form factor cost to manufacture, not necessarily cost to support and how we service it, but really the physical product. DexCom ONE is very similar to G6. There are other features that G6 has, but hardware is very similar. And it's very similar in G7. G7 lines and eventually DexCom ONE will migrate to a G7 line. And so as you think about these products, then it becomes a question of price point and then how we ultimately service the patient there. So that's the way to think about it. Over time, as we go into certain markets depending on price point, it's got much less to do with what I would say is the physical product itself. We grow into those markets over time through economies of scale. And so that's one of the reasons we believe with DexCom ONE, there's a real great opportunity here. The economies of scale for us are massive. And by going into those markets, we certainly can grow into that profitability profile. So as you think down the middle of the P& L, certainly, as you go into DexCom ONE, there could be a slight margin differentiation, but those economies of scales help offset it. We also look at the service model, and we're able to manage the service model in a different way. So the ultimate operating margin contribution is the same. So that's how we think about it. And so as you're modeling it through, that's how I would think about it. Sure, I'll start with the contribution. And let me turn it over to Jake, who is our maestro on product development and understanding products. In terms of contribution, look, we're very excited about both Tandem and Insulet products. And as they launch more and more products that we are obviously integrated with, we expect it to contribute. Now quantifying that and having those contributions, it's a little bit difficult to do given some products - some folks were already on DexCom CGM who bring in a pump, and some folks pull over. So as time moves on, we'll be able to really tease that apart. But I think what we would say is we're still bullish on the opportunity of folks ultimately using our product with these incredible pump partners. I'll leave it at that just because it gets hard to contribute. Again, we'll be able to retrospectively give feedback as time moves on. But let me give it to Jake in terms of the connectivity and the timelines on G7."

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you everyone for joining us. Today we reported another strong quarter for DexCom with second quarter organic revenue growth of 16% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Momentum for global CGM adoption remains high and we once again achieved a worldwide record new customer starts in the second quarter. Following some disruption early in the year related to the Omicron wave, office access has continued to improve and we experienced a return to a more normalized customer journey, which helped us deliver this record. Customer satisfaction also continues to reach new levels as our U.S. net promoter score hit another all-time record in the second quarter. Our own customers value the differentiated experience at DexCom provides with consistent praise for our real-world accuracy, connectivity, actionable features and customer support. Product performance has been a hallmark for DexCom throughout our history, customers and caretakers alike rely upon the accuracy of DexCom\u2019s CGM and can be confident performance across all aspects of glucose management backed by numerous clinical trials and borne out by real-world experience. We have long viewed software as an avenue to differentiate enabling unique user experiences, supporting greater connectivity and enhancing our ability to move more seamlessly into new markets. In support of this vision, we have invested significantly in building our software infrastructure in recent years and now spend more of our R&D budget on software than hardware, a tangible example of this can be found in our rollout of DexCom ONE. This product leverages our G6 hardware and we will use our G7 platform in the future. By using software to provide a different experience in our G series systems, this has allowed us to meaningfully expand our market presence in recent months. Entering new markets and winning tenders internationally that were previously not available to our G Series product, this is just the beginning of our journey of leveraging software to create products that meet the needs of our end users. Our software infrastructure is also positioned us to be the partner of choice for technology companies are looking to build new and innovative experiences around CGM data. Our list of real-time API partners continues to grow, as we are the only company that can provide partners real-time CGM data in an FDA regulated solution, our software capabilities are also laying the foundation for our success beyond the intensively managed population. For example, two partners focused on the use of CGM for weight management and metabolic health signals and levels helped have clinical trials underway that are leveraging our real-time API capabilities. We are excited to see the outcome from these trials as they provide a glimpse into the future for CGM technology that could serve as a much broader end market than today. The second quarter saw a number of strategic accomplishments in the international markets that continue to strengthen our competitive position. The excitement continues to grow for our portfolio of CGM systems G6, G7 and DexCom ONE, and we have made significant strides in both direct and distributor markets to broaden access to our technology. We launched DexCom ONE in both Spain and the U.K., and have secured reimbursement for key segments of the population. Opening large parts of these markets have previously lagged reimbursement for DexCom CGM. We also announced a partnership with Roche to distribute DexCom ONE in Italy. This relationship will allow us to leverage Russia\u2019s well-established commercial infrastructure to bring DexCom ONE to a much larger Italian market. In Australia, the government recently committed to providing subsidized access to our G6 system for all people living with Type 1 diabetes, which is a significant improvement in coverage and a great win for Australians deserving access to CGM technology. Our limited launch of G7 in the U.K. continues to be met with significant enthusiasm from our customers, who provided consistently positive feedback on product size, ease-of-use, the shorter warm up time, the app experience and more. Many customers shared that they would often forget they were even wearing the G7 during the recession and indicated they can\u2019t wait to continue wearing the product full-time in the future. The period has proven to be incredibly valuable, allowing us to assess the functionality of the sensor, adapting a real-world setting, and providing feedback on ways to refine our support system to make the broader rollout as streamlined as possible. We are excited to get G7 in the hands of more customers and plan to expand our launch in the third quarter starting in the U.K. In the U.S., our 510(k) submission for G7 remains under review at the FDA. As part of this process, we are making a subtle change to the G7 software based on feedback from the FDA slightly delaying our expected timelines for clearance and U.S. launch. We expect FDA clearance and limited launch later this year and a large commercial launch in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023. Encouragingly, our preliminary discussions with payers have progressed very well. They understand what this product will mean for our customers and people with diabetes broadly, giving us increasing confidence in the ability to ramp up commercial coverage quickly. Finally, we were very proud to showcase our expanded CGM portfolio two of the largest diabetes conferences of the year TBD in Barcelona and ADA in New Orleans. These events provide us an opportunity to connect with thought leaders across the diabetes space and we continue to see a clear consensus on real-time CGM being the standard-of-care in diabetes management and a growing appreciation of the health and economic benefits of extending the use of this technology beyond the intensively managed population, including the broader Type 2 population and use in the hospital. Between these two events, there were dozens of presentations, abstracts and posters highlighting success stories of CGM to-date on what the future hold for this technology. I started attending diabetes conferences almost 30 years ago. As I look back even two years or three years ago, these types of conversations around the broad potential of CGM were non-existent. Now it\u2019s become very apparent that CGM data will become the basis of where diabetes management and glucose control in the future is headed. We are very excited about the opportunity to add to DexCom. And with that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the second quarter financials. Jereme?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today\u2019s earnings release, as well as on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2022, we reported worldwide revenue of $696 million, which included $12 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact. This is compared to $595 million for the second quarter of 2021, which represents growth of 16% on an organic basis. We have slightly changed our definition of organic revenue based on feedback from our stakeholders to exclude currency and acquisition-related revenue in the trailing 12-month period. Volume growth for the second quarter came in around the mid-30% range on a global basis. U.S. revenue totaled $511 million for the second quarter compared to 462 million in the second quarter of 2021, representing a growth of 11%. Customer demand remained strong in the U.S. and our unit volume growth continued to grow at a very healthy clip this quarter, relatively in line with recent quarters. We have been launching a number of new tools for our sales force in the U.S. that leverage technology to make each physician visit more efficient and effective. These tools inform our team what each doctor is prescribing, the makeup of their payer mix and even out-of-pocket costs for each customer. This data can make each visit more impactful and help us continue to address the competitive mix that still exists in the market. We continue to see an ongoing impact in revenue growth from our strategic shift to the pharmacy channel. But as discussed previously, we believe this will ultimately set us up to serve meaningful, more customers over time. International revenue grew 39%, totaling $185 million in the second quarter. Organic revenue growth was 34% for the second quarter. Our positive momentum continued this quarter as the number of global initiatives we implemented in the past year has significantly improved our competitive position in international markets. In addition to the DexCom ONE new market wins Kevin highlighted before, we also continue to drive greater reimbursement in our initial launch countries in Eastern Europe this quarter. While we previously announced that patient reimbursement in Bulgaria and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have now established full or partial reimbursement for individuals with Type 1 diabetes. This is a great example of how our CGM portfolio strategy can help us enter completely new markets and be a catalyst for access. Through new product launches and reimbursement efforts over the past 18 months, we are happy to share that we have increased the reimbursed access to our product by more than 3 million customers and look forward to getting this much needed technology in the hands of as many people as possible. Our second quarter gross profit was $449.5 million or 64.6% of revenue, compared to 70.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2021. Given the initial launch of G7 in the U.K., this is the first quarter where G7 development costs started to flow through COGS, accounting for some of the expected year-over-year step down in gross margin. Additionally, there were greater than 50 basis points of impact from currency in the quarter. Our second quarter gross margin was a nice step-up from the first quarter and leaves us on track to hit our margin targets for the full year. Operating expenses were $347.6 million for Q2 of 2022, compared to $315 million in Q2 of 2021. Similar to last quarter, we generated meaningful operating expense leverage despite incremental investment to support the G7 launch. We saw OpEx as a percentage of sales this quarter drop by 310 basis points year-over-year, as we continue to leverage our R&D and G&A expense lines. Operating income was $101.9 million or 14.6% of revenue in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $101.5 million or 17.1% of revenue in the same quarter of 2021, as a tough year-over-year gross margin comp was partially offset by operating leverage in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $175.5 million or 25.2% of revenue for the second quarter, compared to $156.6 million or 26.3% of revenue for the second quarter of 2021. Net income for the second quarter was $69.5 million or $0.17 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.8 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents. This provides us the flexibility to continue to invest in our organic growth opportunity, including the ongoing build-out this year of our Malaysia manufacturing facility and to assess any compelling strategic investments that present themselves. Along those lines, we announced today, a $700 million share repurchase program, which will allow us to offset the dilutive impact from our 2023 convertible notes. We are always assessing the best uses of our capital and given the recent market pressure, we view this as a great time to invest in our own business, as we remain incredibly bullish on the sizable opportunity ahead for DexCom. Turning to guidance, we are updating our full year 2022 revenue guidance to a range of $2.86 billion to $2.91 billion. For margins, we are reaffirming our prior full year guidance of gross profit margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 16% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25%. This guidance factors in a significant uptick in currency headwinds relative to the expectations we shared a quarter ago. We now expect around $40 million of foreign currency headwinds for the full year relative to our prior estimate of around $15 million to $20 million. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Jeremy. As I look at this quarter, our underlying fundamentals remain incredibly strong. We experienced another quarter of solid volume growth, achieved worldwide record new customer starts, recorded our highest ever customer satisfaction rating. These results were before any material contribution from G7, which we expect to improve the customer experience in every way. We advanced our CGM portfolio outside the United States with a wider rollout of DexCom ONE, helping us reach more reimbursed lives and serving more new customers. For G7, the feedback from our limited launch in the U.K. has been fantastic, leaving us incredibly excited for a broader global launch in the coming weeks. And in the U.S., we now have clear visibility to the finish line on G7 clearance and our preliminary payer discussions are setting the stage for a big launch early next year. Despite all the macroeconomic challenges that exist today, runaway inflation, supply chain challenges, FX headwinds, we reiterated our margin guidance, continue to have no delivery delays across our business and remain committed to driving additional operating leverage in the coming years. And finally, we announced a $700 million share repurchase plan today. This will allow us to offset the dilutive impact of our 2023 convertible notes and also provides us an opportunity to send a clear message. We are betting on ourselves and the mass opportunity ahead of us. We are optimistic as we have ever been about our future. With that, I\u2019d now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then re-enter the queue if necessary. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Go ahead, Robbie.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking my question. It was when you filed G7 last year. You had a pretty high degree of confidence in the completeness of the filing. So, one, wondering if we could get a little more on what it is with the software, what you have to change and how different it\u2019s going to be from the European version? What gives you that level of confidence and how to think about U.S. sales growth until we get a G7 launch? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Robbie, this is Kevin, I will take the G7 questions. The software revisions relate to the management of the alerts and alarms in the U.S. app. FDA had some questions about some of the things that we have done and put in it. We discussed several options that we had, we decided the best option at this time was to revise the software and file it differently and we have added a few other features to it as well based on our discussions with them. We are in the middle of revising the software for that and have to run it through the complete validation and verification process and resubmit. We are not done with it yet, but we are working very quickly to get done with that and that\u2019s really our big major issue we talked through everything else. We did have a strong level of confidence and we still do in our relationships and our discussions with the FDA and G7. The one thing we figured out as we have been through this process is we changed absolutely everything. We changed the algorithm. We changed the insertion techniques. We changed every manufacturing procedure that we have and completely rewrote the entire app and the software experience, which is a lot for them to digest and a lot for us to submit. If I look at learnings for us over time, I think we will probably do things a little more incrementally going forward, rather as big as this one was and we can get things through faster. But we are in a good spot. We have a lot of clarity as to where we need to go going forward and I will let Robbie handle the growth issues regarding G6, because we are still doing extremely well with that product, not Robbie, Jereme, go ahead.\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. Hi. How are you doing, Robbie, and thanks for the question. So in the U.S., look, the quarter here, we had about 11% growth. That\u2019s generally due to some of what we talked about in prior quarters, us getting into physicians\u2019 offices and as those new patients didn\u2019t hit those record levels, you ultimately see that recur on a recurring business model such as ours it plays through. What gives us a lot of confidence for the back half of the year is Q2 was a record and we are back on that record track. We do expect strength for the rest of the year to the point where we expect the U.S. growth rates to accelerate in Q3 and Q4, as we come off of this quarter where we see these record new patient starts. And quite frankly, we expect to have record new patient starts going forward for the balance of the year, even without G7. So I hope that gives you that question. We are very confident in G6, and obviously, we are even more confident in G7 once that launches.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Go ahead, Jeff.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you, Kevin. I just want to go back on your comments about revising some of the software on the alerts and alarms on the G7 product. So it sounds like to me you are still in the process of that, but I think you also said in your prepared remarks that you were comfortable, that you would still have a limited launch in the fourth quarter and a fuller launch in the first quarter of 2023 in the U.S. So, one, can I just confirm that\u2019s what you said? Two, do you have some better certainty on all the other aspects of the filing from the FDA that gives you that ability to draw that line in the sand or at least where is your confidence on that timeline? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: We do have great certainty on the other components of the filing with the FDA. We have talked through all the other questions and things that we have discussed and we are very, very comfortable with that. So really, the outstanding major item is revision and filing of the revised software after we validated and verified all of that. So we are very, very comfortable with that. And yes, what I did say is we are anticipating a limited launch in the fourth quarter in the U.S. and then the full-on rollout in -- early in the year in 2023. One of the things I said in my prepared remarks is we are very bullish about the progress we have made with the payers as far as getting the G7 reimbursed, because they can see how important it\u2019s going to be for our patient base. So, on the one hand, while we have the delay in the approval and the launch that, look, none of us -- we don\u2019t like to be faster. The other thing we are seeing on the other side is a lot of cooperation in the payer community and just in the channel in getting this thing positioned for reimbursement very quickly after approval, so we can get the launch out and not too different of a time frame on a reimbursed basis from what we expected in the beginning. So those two factors together, again, add to where we think we are.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Go ahead, Margaret.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yeah. I wanted to maybe dive a little bit further into kind of this new patient add growth just because it\u2019s important as we get into 2023 as well. But any details that you can give in terms of how it looks like within T1, T2 intensive and others, and if there have been any changes, I guess, in the last six months, 12 months? Are things getting harder or easier and what kind of efforts do you guys put in place to reaccelerate more meaningfully those new patient adds? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yeah. I can answer that and thank you for the question. What we saw, and I think, this is -- we have really talked about it is, we found our folks are most effective when they are able to get into physicians\u2019 offices. That\u2019s always been the case and it\u2019s continued to show itself time and time again. And so what we found is, it rises all tides once we are able to do so. But the predominance of where our new patient adds are coming, if you want to kind of see what the more accelerate is, it\u2019s really in the Type 2 intensive space. As we get into more primary care physician\u2019s offices, these are folks we have called on really for the first time as we have expanded our sales force in 2021, getting their in-person has really unlocked that market and that\u2019s what you continue to see. And so now our focus is and we talked about it a little bit in the prepared remarks, now that we are in these offices, a record new patient quarter this quarter, certainly, that\u2019s encouraging. But we are also seeing that all of these tools that have been put in place means every call, every visit, every time we are in the office, we are able to be more effective about what might be the prescribers\u2019 decision making around that particular patient. And through doing that, whether it\u2019s debunking myths around co-pays and what the out-of-pocket is and making sure folks understand the cost, whether it\u2019s the ease-of-use in showing folks that a majority of our patients are able to put it on and use either training online or simple training in the box to ultimately put it on their body. What we are really finding is we are breaking down all of those myths out there and our sales force continues to get more and more effective. So we are going to continue to do that over time and we are seeing that continue to play out as better prescriber patterns, more prescriptions per provider and more providers coming over to prescribing DexCom. So all of those are playing out, which is what gives us confidence for acceleration in the U.S. in the back half of the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joanne Winch from Citigroup. Go ahead, Joanne.\nJoanne Winch: Good evening or afternoon and thank you. I am a little bit curious about some of the reimbursement landscape and things which may or may not have changed. Where do you think reimbursement is for bolus and are you seeing any other changes as it relates to prior authorization or one product versus or another or anything else that we really should be aware of? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Thanks, Joanne. Yeah, I can take the question. So in terms of basal, we continue to make progress there. So as you think about where we are having the conversations, the conversations are both on the government in the U.S., CMS, as well as the U.S. commercial providers. We are having conversations with both and our access team has submitted the data. They have submitted both clinical data, economic data, as well as clinician recommendations and so we are going through those conversations. So it\u2019s been submitted, discussions are ongoing. Timing is hard to peg in all of these, but we are continuing to advance it forward in terms of conversations. So that\u2019s basal, we will certainly be -- as that progresses forward, we will continue to give you line of sight as to how that goes. In terms of other areas, so existing coverage in areas around prior authorizations or otherwise, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of that. Now there are occasionally plans that have a prior authorization pop up or pull out, our goal is to all of the renegotiations that take place to limit those prior authorizations. And as we continue to show how CGM can improve patient outcomes, it\u2019s becoming very clear that prior authorizations, we see payers starting to pull those down over time, a better way to put it. And so we continue to expect to see and keep pushing that, we have not seen a material change in any form or factor. In fact, for the most part, we see them coming down and we will expect to see that over time in the intensive space.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien. Go ahead, Matt.\nMatthew O'Brien: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Can we just -- as I look at the stock down 18% in the aftermarket, that $6 billion in lost market cap, even a little bit more than that. So I think it would be helpful, I don\u2019t know if the reduction of the topline guidance from 2020 down to 2019 or maybe it\u2019s a little bit more is largely because of G7. But I am thinking it\u2019s like a $60 million headwind, maybe something like that this year versus not getting the approval. So is it about $100 million of incremental pressure you are going to see next year and not having the approval earlier this year that you can\u2019t get all the marketing activities up and going next year? Just how do we frame up some of this modest delay, it seems like on the payer side, things are better, but just frame up what this modest delay may do to the topline as we look forward?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. I can talk about, at least for 2022 and how it operates and we can maybe not get to too much into 2023, but it can help that conversation. So a lot of the guidance and the pull down of guidance is related to currency. So it\u2019s not necessarily related to the G7 and the timing associated with that. So as you look at where we are going and where we pulled that down, currency has, especially outside the U.S., has played a large impact on reported growth rates and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we have shifted and how we talk about organic growth. As you zoom back into the U.S., the G7 delay does have a little bit of an impact on guidance, and so, certainly, we would recognize that we had some impact in there and assumed it would launch. The longer-term impact is really determined on how fast we get commercial coverage and how fast we can roll it out. And so what we believe is by working alongside our coverage teams and trying to get access as fast as possible, and while we are working through getting formal approvals, partnering with folks to get quicker access and quicker coverage, we believe we can work on getting those patients back in quicker and faster to where we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to be a material impact on 2023 and beyond. And so a little bit in 2022, certainly it could have a little bit of tick in 2023, but for the most part, we are doing all the work now to make sure that we have a major launch or it doesn\u2019t impact longer term growth rates.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Go ahead. Jason.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon. Just two questions that require quick answers. Just a clarification, I get the sense that it was a record for new patient starts in both the U.S. and worldwide, if you could just confirm that? And then the second question is, you mentioned expanding the G7 launch in Europe over the coming weeks and I wasn\u2019t clear whether you are going into new countries or is this just more expansive in the U.K.? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yeah. This is Kevin. I will start. Yes. It was record new patients OUS and in our U.S. markets as well, both teams had new patient add records during this quarter. With respect to the rollout of G7 in Europe, what we had indicated was our first rollout will be in the U.K. and we expect we will add other geographies before the end of the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Go ahead, Travis.\nTravis Steed: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. One quick clarification, the pricing mix versus volume growth this quarter and then as you look ahead to next year, well, we start to see volume and revenue growth to start to match up a bit more. And I am thinking about the basal opportunity, is that an opportunity where you are going to have to lower price to get the volume or is the basal pricing probably pretty similar to the intensive market? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. So I can take those questions. In terms of pricing, and what I\u2019d say is, more channel mix, but the delta between the two, it was about the same this quarter as it was in prior quarter, which is what we had signaled at the start of the year. We still expect to migrate in the U.S. channel as we move more DME to pharmacy that continues as expected and then we had the OUS pricing where we took down pricing in exchange for access. We expected that to run through the end of Q2 before we lapped our strategy. So it\u2019s all gone and aligned with expectations. It was right around $70 million on the quarter. In terms of basal and beyond, look, basal coverage, we believe is out there. In terms of what the pricing is, at this point, a lot of the conversations are about category coverage, and currently, category coverage is already relatively defined, defined in pricing today. And so what that means is it could be the same, but would we be willing to talk to folks about increasing access in exchange for price? We would absolutely entertain the conversation. It have to make sense for us for both the returns that we would expect on our performance, as well as for our shareholders. But nothing to this point has indicated it would be lower. However, we understand that as more and more folks get access, we will be having those conversations.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Go ahead, Marie.\nMarie Thibault: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back to something Kevin said earlier about the new software and app experience for the patient with G7 in the U.S. Can you give us a hint of how meaningful that new app experience might be for patient willingness to try the G7, to switch to the G7, what it might do for patient demand? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: One of the best features of the limited launch in the U.K. has been getting feedback on the software and people absolutely love the app. From the very beginning, when you start, it is much easier to fire it up and get on the system and understand what CGM is going to do for you and how it\u2019s going to work. So for a new user, this is a much, much easier experience and much, much easier start. The other thing that\u2019s very obvious in the software is another feature that our patients love, it\u2019s a 30-minute warm up that actually ends up being about 25 minutes once you put the sensor on. I was speaking with a patient just last week and I asked her what is your favorite and what is your worst thing about G6 and the 2-hour warm-up is very frequently comes up -- was what came up and so this half hour warm-up is going to be a feature. But the software itself in addition to the typical graph in the sense of reading in the arrows, we also have clarity data built into the app that gives you feedback about how you are doing over one day, three days, seven days or even a month. So someone can go down and look and see exactly how they are doing and what their trends are, how much time they are spending in range. So it\u2019s much more of a full experience for somebody in their diabetes care and our patients like it tremendously. We will be ready to go on Android and iOS and launch. We are not going to hold either of them back. The other thing with the app, it\u2019s not really on the app, but it\u2019s a feature of this product that\u2019s been very well accepted as well. I didn\u2019t talk much about. We have a new receiver coming. The patients absolutely have loved and are using it very well. And while I figured when we went to the phone in the beginning, everybody would immediately migrate to the phone, there\u2019s a very large percentage of our customers who use that receiver. They will be greatly enhanced in their experience by going to the next receiver with us. And on the good news front as well, that new receiver while a better experience is a much lower cost offering. So I will get stuck there on the app.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mathew Blackman. Go ahead, Matthew.\nMathew Blackman: Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. International growth did step up even though you had a tougher comp. Is that the broader G7 rollout, DexCom ONE, some combination of those two? And I am also really curious about Germany, in particular, where I think you are going head-to-head versus the newest sensor from your competitors, just any commentary about geographic performance within that international number? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yeah. We can absolutely answer that and it\u2019s interesting, DexCom ONE and G7 really haven\u2019t contributed all that much to this point. So, certainly, it\u2019s an exciting future contributor and we are very, very bullish on both G7 and the opportunity in DexCom ONE. DexCom ONE really is in the bell countries and hasn\u2019t contributed all that much, and G7 was limited launch. And so what you are seeing is G7 with a more meaningful launch and DexCom ONE with a more meaningful launch in bigger countries in Q3 and beyond. So what you saw in Q2 was really a continuation of our access and going deeper into countries where we had our G Series and really it was broad-based and it\u2019s a continuation of broad-based performance outside the U.S., really across all of our countries, including Germany, where we do go head-to-head with Libre 3. And so I think what you can say is that business is doing incredibly well and there\u2019s new catalysts to ultimately support it for upcoming periods. So we are very excited about that international business. And like I said, in countries where we are going up head-to-head with our competitor\u2019s most recent product, we continue to do very well and take share. So very, very bullish on our opportunity going forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Go ahead, Josh.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Brian [ph] here for Josh. Are you currently seeking or planning to seek CE Mark approval for the software changes you are making in the U.S., and if so, could you share the projected timeline there? Thanks for taking the question.\nJereme Sylvain: We already have the software approved for CE Mark in Europe and we do not plan immediately on implementing the changes that we are putting into the U.S. app. We will consider that over time. We will -- we have the app and the software configured to whereby we can launch the product with what we are doing in Europe to sell it and support it there. And if we feel the need to in some period of time, we can implement those changes into the other software and upgrade patient\u2019s apps on the phone, but not immediately, no.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Go ahead, Steven.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi guys. As you are moving G7 to full launch in the U.K., where you now also have DexCom ONE, just wondering how will those two offerings be marketed relative to each other. Should we assume that over time, they sort of merge and with G7 becoming the primary hardware there, obviously, that\u2019s going to happen in more and more countries over time. So, wondering if you could talk to your thoughts on that? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: No. I appreciate that question. We launched DexCom ONE in Europe and we are launching in the U.K. because there are many reimbursement opportunities. We have not been able to participate in. Our G Series or our G6 and G7 products are regarded as very high end sensors for intensive insulin management, integration with insulin pumps. A lot of pediatrics to share the follow and the other features that have made our products so endeared to our users. The DexCom ONE app has -- doesn\u2019t have many of those features. It\u2019s much more simple and it falls into a different reimbursement category in many of these geographies. In the UK, for example, our DexCom ONE system will literally be -- will go through the pharmacy channel for broad-based distribution and broad-based accessibility for everybody, whereas our G Series, it requires more documentation, more approval and very specific conditions. As we look at these geographies, we think we have an opportunity with DexCom ONE to sell a different product and a different system with different features that really won\u2019t step over onto our G Series that is fully integrated with other systems and offers all these other features. Ultimately, as I said on the call, we want our DexCom ONE product to be on the G7 platform as well as we simplify our operating structure over time, but that will take a little while. And so G6 for DexCom ONE platform we think will do very well and our initial user feedback has been very good. The software for DexCom ONE, I would also add, has been designed on the same platform as the G7 software. So it looks and feels a little more -- much more like G7 than it does G6. So our users will have a great experience there. As long as there are two reimbursement categories, we do not see these two products coming together from a reimbursement perspective. They might look more like physically and be on the same platform once we get G7 enough capacity to transfer to the other DexCom under that platform, but they won\u2019t be the same experience, it won\u2019t be reimbursed at the same rates.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Go ahead, Larry.\nNathan Travis: Hi. This is Nathan on for Larry. Can you comment on what drives the margin improvement in the second half given the launch of G7 and how should we think about margins into 2023? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Let me talk about the second half and we won\u2019t get too much into 2023 specifically other than we all have -- with our long range plan is 65% and so that\u2019s the way we generally think about things. In terms of the back half of the year, typically, what happens is, as we go typical seasonality as we go through the course of the year and part of this has to do with who\u2019s ultimately purchasing the product, margins typically get better. Now that was thrown on its head a little bit and as we were launching G7. I mean we had some timing things about when that would launch and what countries that would go into. So what you are finding is, is for the first half of the year, we obviously had a few different unique items that impacted margins. What you are really finding is the run rate for our margin for the first half of the year, absent these was just below 65%. Back half of the year, we expect it to be just the opposite, just north of 65% as we hit that typical seasonality. We will have a little bit of pressure from the launch of G7 outside the U.S. However, that will clearly be offset through the G6 throughput that you ultimately see. And the reason to tick up in the back half of the year in some ways is due to with the G7 launch in a meaningful way outside -- inside the U.S. sliding into Q1 of next year, you do see that performance on that G6 platform, which continues to have nice margins play through over the course of the rest of the year. So we have a lot of confidence 65% for the year even despite all of the macroeconomic conditions.\nOperator: We have no more questions at this time. I will turn it back to the speakers for closing comments.\nKevin Sayer: Well, again, thanks everybody for participating on the call. One of the great things that\u2019s happened in the second quarter has been my own ability to get out and talk and meet with people going to ADA and also some other conferences where I have spoken and I have never seen DexCom more respected and more visible than we are now. Our customer satisfaction scores, as I talked earlier, have never been higher, and that\u2019s what you hear in real life. People are absolutely thrilled with the performance of our product and the problem that we solve for them. It\u2019s never been a better time here. We have a number of DexCom ONE launches coming out over the next few quarters on top of that with G7 as well. Both presenting great revenue and growth opportunities for us and our operations are running very efficiently and smoothly. Everybody have a great day and thanks for participating on the call.\nOperator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you everyone for joining us. Today we reported another strong quarter for DexCom with second quarter organic revenue growth of 16% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Momentum for global CGM adoption remains high and we once again achieved a worldwide record new customer starts in the second quarter. Following some disruption early in the year related to the Omicron wave, office access has continued to improve and we experienced a return to a more normalized customer journey, which helped us deliver this record. Customer satisfaction also continues to reach new levels as our U.S. net promoter score hit another all-time record in the second quarter. Our own customers value the differentiated experience at DexCom provides with consistent praise for our real-world accuracy, connectivity, actionable features and customer support. Product performance has been a hallmark for DexCom throughout our history, customers and caretakers alike rely upon the accuracy of DexCom's CGM and can be confident performance across all aspects of glucose management backed by numerous clinical trials and borne out by real-world experience. We have long viewed software as an avenue to differentiate enabling unique user experiences, supporting greater connectivity and enhancing our ability to move more seamlessly into new markets. In support of this vision, we have invested significantly in building our software infrastructure in recent years and now spend more of our R&D budget on software than hardware, a tangible example of this can be found in our rollout of DexCom ONE. This product leverages our G6 hardware and we will use our G7 platform in the future. By using software to provide a different experience in our G series systems, this has allowed us to meaningfully expand our market presence in recent months. Entering new markets and winning tenders internationally that were previously not available to our G Series product, this is just the beginning of our journey of leveraging software to create products that meet the needs of our end users. Our software infrastructure is also positioned us to be the partner of choice for technology companies are looking to build new and innovative experiences around CGM data. Our list of real-time API partners continues to grow, as we are the only company that can provide partners real-time CGM data in an FDA regulated solution, our software capabilities are also laying the foundation for our success beyond the intensively managed population. For example, two partners focused on the use of CGM for weight management and metabolic health signals and levels helped have clinical trials underway that are leveraging our real-time API capabilities. We are excited to see the outcome from these trials as they provide a glimpse into the future for CGM technology that could serve as a much broader end market than today. The second quarter saw a number of strategic accomplishments in the international markets that continue to strengthen our competitive position. The excitement continues to grow for our portfolio of CGM systems G6, G7 and DexCom ONE, and we have made significant strides in both direct and distributor markets to broaden access to our technology. We launched DexCom ONE in both Spain and the U.K., and have secured reimbursement for key segments of the population. Opening large parts of these markets have previously lagged reimbursement for DexCom CGM. We also announced a partnership with Roche to distribute DexCom ONE in Italy. This relationship will allow us to leverage Russia's well-established commercial infrastructure to bring DexCom ONE to a much larger Italian market. In Australia, the government recently committed to providing subsidized access to our G6 system for all people living with Type 1 diabetes, which is a significant improvement in coverage and a great win for Australians deserving access to CGM technology. Our limited launch of G7 in the U.K. continues to be met with significant enthusiasm from our customers, who provided consistently positive feedback on product size, ease-of-use, the shorter warm up time, the app experience and more. Many customers shared that they would often forget they were even wearing the G7 during the recession and indicated they can't wait to continue wearing the product full-time in the future. The period has proven to be incredibly valuable, allowing us to assess the functionality of the sensor, adapting a real-world setting, and providing feedback on ways to refine our support system to make the broader rollout as streamlined as possible. We are excited to get G7 in the hands of more customers and plan to expand our launch in the third quarter starting in the U.K. In the U.S., our 510(k) submission for G7 remains under review at the FDA. As part of this process, we are making a subtle change to the G7 software based on feedback from the FDA slightly delaying our expected timelines for clearance and U.S. launch. We expect FDA clearance and limited launch later this year and a large commercial launch in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023. Encouragingly, our preliminary discussions with payers have progressed very well. They understand what this product will mean for our customers and people with diabetes broadly, giving us increasing confidence in the ability to ramp up commercial coverage quickly. Finally, we were very proud to showcase our expanded CGM portfolio two of the largest diabetes conferences of the year TBD in Barcelona and ADA in New Orleans. These events provide us an opportunity to connect with thought leaders across the diabetes space and we continue to see a clear consensus on real-time CGM being the standard-of-care in diabetes management and a growing appreciation of the health and economic benefits of extending the use of this technology beyond the intensively managed population, including the broader Type 2 population and use in the hospital. Between these two events, there were dozens of presentations, abstracts and posters highlighting success stories of CGM to-date on what the future hold for this technology. I started attending diabetes conferences almost 30 years ago. As I look back even two years or three years ago, these types of conversations around the broad potential of CGM were non-existent. Now it's become very apparent that CGM data will become the basis of where diabetes management and glucose control in the future is headed. We are very excited about the opportunity to add to DexCom. And with that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the second quarter financials. Jereme? Thanks, Jeremy. As I look at this quarter, our underlying fundamentals remain incredibly strong. We experienced another quarter of solid volume growth, achieved worldwide record new customer starts, recorded our highest ever customer satisfaction rating. These results were before any material contribution from G7, which we expect to improve the customer experience in every way. We advanced our CGM portfolio outside the United States with a wider rollout of DexCom ONE, helping us reach more reimbursed lives and serving more new customers. For G7, the feedback from our limited launch in the U.K. has been fantastic, leaving us incredibly excited for a broader global launch in the coming weeks. And in the U.S., we now have clear visibility to the finish line on G7 clearance and our preliminary payer discussions are setting the stage for a big launch early next year. Despite all the macroeconomic challenges that exist today, runaway inflation, supply chain challenges, FX headwinds, we reiterated our margin guidance, continue to have no delivery delays across our business and remain committed to driving additional operating leverage in the coming years. And finally, we announced a $700 million share repurchase plan today. This will allow us to offset the dilutive impact of our 2023 convertible notes and also provides us an opportunity to send a clear message. We are betting on ourselves and the mass opportunity ahead of us. We are optimistic as we have ever been about our future. With that, I'd now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Robbie, this is Kevin, I will take the G7 questions. The software revisions relate to the management of the alerts and alarms in the U.S. app. FDA had some questions about some of the things that we have done and put in it. We discussed several options that we had, we decided the best option at this time was to revise the software and file it differently and we have added a few other features to it as well based on our discussions with them. We are in the middle of revising the software for that and have to run it through the complete validation and verification process and resubmit. We are not done with it yet, but we are working very quickly to get done with that and that's really our big major issue we talked through everything else. We did have a strong level of confidence and we still do in our relationships and our discussions with the FDA and G7. The one thing we figured out as we have been through this process is we changed absolutely everything. We changed the algorithm. We changed the insertion techniques. We changed every manufacturing procedure that we have and completely rewrote the entire app and the software experience, which is a lot for them to digest and a lot for us to submit. If I look at learnings for us over time, I think we will probably do things a little more incrementally going forward, rather as big as this one was and we can get things through faster. But we are in a good spot. We have a lot of clarity as to where we need to go going forward and I will let Robbie handle the growth issues regarding G6, because we are still doing extremely well with that product, not Robbie, Jereme, go ahead. We do have great certainty on the other components of the filing with the FDA. We have talked through all the other questions and things that we have discussed and we are very, very comfortable with that. So really, the outstanding major item is revision and filing of the revised software after we validated and verified all of that. So we are very, very comfortable with that. And yes, what I did say is we are anticipating a limited launch in the fourth quarter in the U.S. and then the full-on rollout in -- early in the year in 2023. One of the things I said in my prepared remarks is we are very bullish about the progress we have made with the payers as far as getting the G7 reimbursed, because they can see how important it's going to be for our patient base. So, on the one hand, while we have the delay in the approval and the launch that, look, none of us -- we don't like to be faster. The other thing we are seeing on the other side is a lot of cooperation in the payer community and just in the channel in getting this thing positioned for reimbursement very quickly after approval, so we can get the launch out and not too different of a time frame on a reimbursed basis from what we expected in the beginning. So those two factors together, again, add to where we think we are. Yeah. This is Kevin. I will start. Yes. It was record new patients OUS and in our U.S. markets as well, both teams had new patient add records during this quarter. With respect to the rollout of G7 in Europe, what we had indicated was our first rollout will be in the U.K. and we expect we will add other geographies before the end of the year. One of the best features of the limited launch in the U.K. has been getting feedback on the software and people absolutely love the app. From the very beginning, when you start, it is much easier to fire it up and get on the system and understand what CGM is going to do for you and how it's going to work. So for a new user, this is a much, much easier experience and much, much easier start. The other thing that's very obvious in the software is another feature that our patients love, it's a 30-minute warm up that actually ends up being about 25 minutes once you put the sensor on. I was speaking with a patient just last week and I asked her what is your favorite and what is your worst thing about G6 and the 2-hour warm-up is very frequently comes up -- was what came up and so this half hour warm-up is going to be a feature. But the software itself in addition to the typical graph in the sense of reading in the arrows, we also have clarity data built into the app that gives you feedback about how you are doing over one day, three days, seven days or even a month. So someone can go down and look and see exactly how they are doing and what their trends are, how much time they are spending in range. So it's much more of a full experience for somebody in their diabetes care and our patients like it tremendously. We will be ready to go on Android and iOS and launch. We are not going to hold either of them back. The other thing with the app, it's not really on the app, but it's a feature of this product that's been very well accepted as well. I didn't talk much about. We have a new receiver coming. The patients absolutely have loved and are using it very well. And while I figured when we went to the phone in the beginning, everybody would immediately migrate to the phone, there's a very large percentage of our customers who use that receiver. They will be greatly enhanced in their experience by going to the next receiver with us. And on the good news front as well, that new receiver while a better experience is a much lower cost offering. So I will get stuck there on the app. No. I appreciate that question. We launched DexCom ONE in Europe and we are launching in the U.K. because there are many reimbursement opportunities. We have not been able to participate in. Our G Series or our G6 and G7 products are regarded as very high end sensors for intensive insulin management, integration with insulin pumps. A lot of pediatrics to share the follow and the other features that have made our products so endeared to our users. The DexCom ONE app has -- doesn't have many of those features. It's much more simple and it falls into a different reimbursement category in many of these geographies. In the UK, for example, our DexCom ONE system will literally be -- will go through the pharmacy channel for broad-based distribution and broad-based accessibility for everybody, whereas our G Series, it requires more documentation, more approval and very specific conditions. As we look at these geographies, we think we have an opportunity with DexCom ONE to sell a different product and a different system with different features that really won't step over onto our G Series that is fully integrated with other systems and offers all these other features. Ultimately, as I said on the call, we want our DexCom ONE product to be on the G7 platform as well as we simplify our operating structure over time, but that will take a little while. And so G6 for DexCom ONE platform we think will do very well and our initial user feedback has been very good. The software for DexCom ONE, I would also add, has been designed on the same platform as the G7 software. So it looks and feels a little more -- much more like G7 than it does G6. So our users will have a great experience there. As long as there are two reimbursement categories, we do not see these two products coming together from a reimbursement perspective. They might look more like physically and be on the same platform once we get G7 enough capacity to transfer to the other DexCom under that platform, but they won't be the same experience, it won't be reimbursed at the same rates. Well, again, thanks everybody for participating on the call. One of the great things that's happened in the second quarter has been my own ability to get out and talk and meet with people going to ADA and also some other conferences where I have spoken and I have never seen DexCom more respected and more visible than we are now. Our customer satisfaction scores, as I talked earlier, have never been higher, and that's what you hear in real life. People are absolutely thrilled with the performance of our product and the problem that we solve for them. It's never been a better time here. We have a number of DexCom ONE launches coming out over the next few quarters on top of that with G7 as well. Both presenting great revenue and growth opportunities for us and our operations are running very efficiently and smoothly. Everybody have a great day and thanks for participating on the call."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2022, we reported worldwide revenue of $696 million, which included $12 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact. This is compared to $595 million for the second quarter of 2021, which represents growth of 16% on an organic basis. We have slightly changed our definition of organic revenue based on feedback from our stakeholders to exclude currency and acquisition-related revenue in the trailing 12-month period. Volume growth for the second quarter came in around the mid-30% range on a global basis. U.S. revenue totaled $511 million for the second quarter compared to 462 million in the second quarter of 2021, representing a growth of 11%. Customer demand remained strong in the U.S. and our unit volume growth continued to grow at a very healthy clip this quarter, relatively in line with recent quarters. We have been launching a number of new tools for our sales force in the U.S. that leverage technology to make each physician visit more efficient and effective. These tools inform our team what each doctor is prescribing, the makeup of their payer mix and even out-of-pocket costs for each customer. This data can make each visit more impactful and help us continue to address the competitive mix that still exists in the market. We continue to see an ongoing impact in revenue growth from our strategic shift to the pharmacy channel. But as discussed previously, we believe this will ultimately set us up to serve meaningful, more customers over time. International revenue grew 39%, totaling $185 million in the second quarter. Organic revenue growth was 34% for the second quarter. Our positive momentum continued this quarter as the number of global initiatives we implemented in the past year has significantly improved our competitive position in international markets. In addition to the DexCom ONE new market wins Kevin highlighted before, we also continue to drive greater reimbursement in our initial launch countries in Eastern Europe this quarter. While we previously announced that patient reimbursement in Bulgaria and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have now established full or partial reimbursement for individuals with Type 1 diabetes. This is a great example of how our CGM portfolio strategy can help us enter completely new markets and be a catalyst for access. Through new product launches and reimbursement efforts over the past 18 months, we are happy to share that we have increased the reimbursed access to our product by more than 3 million customers and look forward to getting this much needed technology in the hands of as many people as possible. Our second quarter gross profit was $449.5 million or 64.6% of revenue, compared to 70.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2021. Given the initial launch of G7 in the U.K., this is the first quarter where G7 development costs started to flow through COGS, accounting for some of the expected year-over-year step down in gross margin. Additionally, there were greater than 50 basis points of impact from currency in the quarter. Our second quarter gross margin was a nice step-up from the first quarter and leaves us on track to hit our margin targets for the full year. Operating expenses were $347.6 million for Q2 of 2022, compared to $315 million in Q2 of 2021. Similar to last quarter, we generated meaningful operating expense leverage despite incremental investment to support the G7 launch. We saw OpEx as a percentage of sales this quarter drop by 310 basis points year-over-year, as we continue to leverage our R&D and G&A expense lines. Operating income was $101.9 million or 14.6% of revenue in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $101.5 million or 17.1% of revenue in the same quarter of 2021, as a tough year-over-year gross margin comp was partially offset by operating leverage in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $175.5 million or 25.2% of revenue for the second quarter, compared to $156.6 million or 26.3% of revenue for the second quarter of 2021. Net income for the second quarter was $69.5 million or $0.17 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.8 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents. This provides us the flexibility to continue to invest in our organic growth opportunity, including the ongoing build-out this year of our Malaysia manufacturing facility and to assess any compelling strategic investments that present themselves. Along those lines, we announced today, a $700 million share repurchase program, which will allow us to offset the dilutive impact from our 2023 convertible notes. We are always assessing the best uses of our capital and given the recent market pressure, we view this as a great time to invest in our own business, as we remain incredibly bullish on the sizable opportunity ahead for DexCom. Turning to guidance, we are updating our full year 2022 revenue guidance to a range of $2.86 billion to $2.91 billion. For margins, we are reaffirming our prior full year guidance of gross profit margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 16% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25%. This guidance factors in a significant uptick in currency headwinds relative to the expectations we shared a quarter ago. We now expect around $40 million of foreign currency headwinds for the full year relative to our prior estimate of around $15 million to $20 million. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. Yeah. Hi. How are you doing, Robbie, and thanks for the question. So in the U.S., look, the quarter here, we had about 11% growth. That's generally due to some of what we talked about in prior quarters, us getting into physicians' offices and as those new patients didn't hit those record levels, you ultimately see that recur on a recurring business model such as ours it plays through. What gives us a lot of confidence for the back half of the year is Q2 was a record and we are back on that record track. We do expect strength for the rest of the year to the point where we expect the U.S. growth rates to accelerate in Q3 and Q4, as we come off of this quarter where we see these record new patient starts. And quite frankly, we expect to have record new patient starts going forward for the balance of the year, even without G7. So I hope that gives you that question. We are very confident in G6, and obviously, we are even more confident in G7 once that launches. Sure. Yeah. I can answer that and thank you for the question. What we saw, and I think, this is -- we have really talked about it is, we found our folks are most effective when they are able to get into physicians' offices. That's always been the case and it's continued to show itself time and time again. And so what we found is, it rises all tides once we are able to do so. But the predominance of where our new patient adds are coming, if you want to kind of see what the more accelerate is, it's really in the Type 2 intensive space. As we get into more primary care physician's offices, these are folks we have called on really for the first time as we have expanded our sales force in 2021, getting their in-person has really unlocked that market and that's what you continue to see. And so now our focus is and we talked about it a little bit in the prepared remarks, now that we are in these offices, a record new patient quarter this quarter, certainly, that's encouraging. But we are also seeing that all of these tools that have been put in place means every call, every visit, every time we are in the office, we are able to be more effective about what might be the prescribers' decision making around that particular patient. And through doing that, whether it's debunking myths around co-pays and what the out-of-pocket is and making sure folks understand the cost, whether it's the ease-of-use in showing folks that a majority of our patients are able to put it on and use either training online or simple training in the box to ultimately put it on their body. What we are really finding is we are breaking down all of those myths out there and our sales force continues to get more and more effective. So we are going to continue to do that over time and we are seeing that continue to play out as better prescriber patterns, more prescriptions per provider and more providers coming over to prescribing DexCom. So all of those are playing out, which is what gives us confidence for acceleration in the U.S. in the back half of the year. Thanks, Joanne. Yeah, I can take the question. So in terms of basal, we continue to make progress there. So as you think about where we are having the conversations, the conversations are both on the government in the U.S., CMS, as well as the U.S. commercial providers. We are having conversations with both and our access team has submitted the data. They have submitted both clinical data, economic data, as well as clinician recommendations and so we are going through those conversations. So it's been submitted, discussions are ongoing. Timing is hard to peg in all of these, but we are continuing to advance it forward in terms of conversations. So that's basal, we will certainly be -- as that progresses forward, we will continue to give you line of sight as to how that goes. In terms of other areas, so existing coverage in areas around prior authorizations or otherwise, we haven't seen a lot of that. Now there are occasionally plans that have a prior authorization pop up or pull out, our goal is to all of the renegotiations that take place to limit those prior authorizations. And as we continue to show how CGM can improve patient outcomes, it's becoming very clear that prior authorizations, we see payers starting to pull those down over time, a better way to put it. And so we continue to expect to see and keep pushing that, we have not seen a material change in any form or factor. In fact, for the most part, we see them coming down and we will expect to see that over time in the intensive space. Sure. I can talk about, at least for 2022 and how it operates and we can maybe not get to too much into 2023, but it can help that conversation. So a lot of the guidance and the pull down of guidance is related to currency. So it's not necessarily related to the G7 and the timing associated with that. So as you look at where we are going and where we pulled that down, currency has, especially outside the U.S., has played a large impact on reported growth rates and that's one of the reasons why we have shifted and how we talk about organic growth. As you zoom back into the U.S., the G7 delay does have a little bit of an impact on guidance, and so, certainly, we would recognize that we had some impact in there and assumed it would launch. The longer-term impact is really determined on how fast we get commercial coverage and how fast we can roll it out. And so what we believe is by working alongside our coverage teams and trying to get access as fast as possible, and while we are working through getting formal approvals, partnering with folks to get quicker access and quicker coverage, we believe we can work on getting those patients back in quicker and faster to where we don't believe it's going to be a material impact on 2023 and beyond. And so a little bit in 2022, certainly it could have a little bit of tick in 2023, but for the most part, we are doing all the work now to make sure that we have a major launch or it doesn't impact longer term growth rates. Sure. So I can take those questions. In terms of pricing, and what I'd say is, more channel mix, but the delta between the two, it was about the same this quarter as it was in prior quarter, which is what we had signaled at the start of the year. We still expect to migrate in the U.S. channel as we move more DME to pharmacy that continues as expected and then we had the OUS pricing where we took down pricing in exchange for access. We expected that to run through the end of Q2 before we lapped our strategy. So it's all gone and aligned with expectations. It was right around $70 million on the quarter. In terms of basal and beyond, look, basal coverage, we believe is out there. In terms of what the pricing is, at this point, a lot of the conversations are about category coverage, and currently, category coverage is already relatively defined, defined in pricing today. And so what that means is it could be the same, but would we be willing to talk to folks about increasing access in exchange for price? We would absolutely entertain the conversation. It have to make sense for us for both the returns that we would expect on our performance, as well as for our shareholders. But nothing to this point has indicated it would be lower. However, we understand that as more and more folks get access, we will be having those conversations. Sure. Yeah. We can absolutely answer that and it's interesting, DexCom ONE and G7 really haven't contributed all that much to this point. So, certainly, it's an exciting future contributor and we are very, very bullish on both G7 and the opportunity in DexCom ONE. DexCom ONE really is in the bell countries and hasn't contributed all that much, and G7 was limited launch. And so what you are seeing is G7 with a more meaningful launch and DexCom ONE with a more meaningful launch in bigger countries in Q3 and beyond. So what you saw in Q2 was really a continuation of our access and going deeper into countries where we had our G Series and really it was broad-based and it's a continuation of broad-based performance outside the U.S., really across all of our countries, including Germany, where we do go head-to-head with Libre 3. And so I think what you can say is that business is doing incredibly well and there's new catalysts to ultimately support it for upcoming periods. So we are very excited about that international business. And like I said, in countries where we are going up head-to-head with our competitor's most recent product, we continue to do very well and take share. So very, very bullish on our opportunity going forward. We already have the software approved for CE Mark in Europe and we do not plan immediately on implementing the changes that we are putting into the U.S. app. We will consider that over time. We will -- we have the app and the software configured to whereby we can launch the product with what we are doing in Europe to sell it and support it there. And if we feel the need to in some period of time, we can implement those changes into the other software and upgrade patient's apps on the phone, but not immediately, no. Sure. Let me talk about the second half and we won't get too much into 2023 specifically other than we all have -- with our long range plan is 65% and so that's the way we generally think about things. In terms of the back half of the year, typically, what happens is, as we go typical seasonality as we go through the course of the year and part of this has to do with who's ultimately purchasing the product, margins typically get better. Now that was thrown on its head a little bit and as we were launching G7. I mean we had some timing things about when that would launch and what countries that would go into. So what you are finding is, is for the first half of the year, we obviously had a few different unique items that impacted margins. What you are really finding is the run rate for our margin for the first half of the year, absent these was just below 65%. Back half of the year, we expect it to be just the opposite, just north of 65% as we hit that typical seasonality. We will have a little bit of pressure from the launch of G7 outside the U.S. However, that will clearly be offset through the G6 throughput that you ultimately see. And the reason to tick up in the back half of the year in some ways is due to with the G7 launch in a meaningful way outside -- inside the U.S. sliding into Q1 of next year, you do see that performance on that G6 platform, which continues to have nice margins play through over the course of the rest of the year. So we have a lot of confidence 65% for the year even despite all of the macroeconomic conditions."

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean and thank you everyone for joining us. Today, we reported strong first quarter results with organic revenue growth of 22% over the first quarter of 2021 or 23% on a constant currency basis. Demand for DexCom CGM remains very high globally across all of our customer segments. We have also seen a nice rebound in customer growth throughout the first quarter with new customer starts ramping after the Omicron wave and ultimately meeting our expectations for the quarter. As many of you know, we have significantly scaled our business to drive demand and greatly expand the number of people with diabetes that we can serve globally. This scale goes beyond manufacturing capacity, extending to the efficiencies that we can bring as we serve customers and clinicians. Our relentless focus on meeting the needs of our customers continues to be validated in our results. In the first quarter, our net promoter scores for G6 remained near record levels, with customers also indicating that the strategies and tools that we have implemented are simplifying their experiences with DexCom. The teams have driven several innovations that may not always draw the attention of our investors, but they are critically important to the experience of our customers. For example, our customers rely on DexCom to make dozens of decisions each day and therefore, a reliable supply of DexCom CGM is critically important. In the first quarter, we established new records for on-time shipping for commercial orders and timing of replacement systems at 99.7% and 99.9% respectively. We are especially proud of this result given the challenges of current global supply chain dynamics. Product supply should never be on the minds of our customers and our operations team is making sure that this is the case. These efforts are delivering results in our performance as both retention and utilization levels have steadily improved since the launch of G6, reflecting a competitive strength as we engage with clinicians and payers on the value of our CGM systems. Building on this momentum, we are thrilled to now be underway with the initial launch of our G7 CGM system. G7 builds upon the best-in-class G6 experience with a form factor that is 60% smaller with the reduced environmental footprint, a streamlined set of experience, including a 30-minute warm-up time, an improved app experience with CLARITY integrated into the core app and all of this with accuracy that improves upon the reliable performance that is a hallmark of DexCom CGM technology. Following the receipt of CE Mark for G7 in March, we initiated our limited launch of G7 in the UK in the subsequent weeks. During this brief window, we are assessing the functionality of the sensor and app in the real world and gathering initial feedback from our users, which has been very positive so far. Our plan is to extend the G7 launch to a steady cadence of additional international markets over the remainder of 2022 with a growing impact to our overall sensor mix in the second half of the year. In the U.S., our 510(k) submission for the G7 sensor, receiver and Android and iOS apps remains under review. We are in the traditional back and forth that comes with these processes. And we appreciate the FDA\u2019s ongoing attention to their view even as they juggle a very busy schedule. In the meantime, the teams are busy preparing for a seamless transition once G7 is available. This includes preliminary discussions with payers to drive market access, where possible in advance of approval. It includes significant preparations from our operations team to add incremental G7 lines in advance of the launch to support the expected ramp in demand. And it includes ongoing work with our insulin delivery partners to ensure that we are progressing towards the goal of connected pump and insulin pen systems that are integrated with our latest sensor technology. As we progress with the launch of G7, we continue to pursue creative solutions to expand access to our CGM technology and bring the value of real-time CGM to people who previously faced limited options for diabetes management. Beyond G7, we recently introduced DexCom ONE in Spain, which is the newest of our direct markets and will launch DexCom ONE in the UK shortly. These represent the first dual product markets for DexCom, bringing two excellent options for real-time CGM to customers and their respective health systems of these countries. We expect this dual product strategy to significantly expand the number of people with reimbursed access to our CGM technology, broadening our growth opportunity in these countries as well as additional countries where we plan to bring DexCom ONE in the future. And geographic expansion is only one element of the significant growth opportunity ahead for DexCom. In the first quarter, we were also pleased to receive breakthrough device designation from the FDA for the CGM system that we are working to develop for use in the hospital setting. The breakthrough designation represents the FDA\u2019s recognition of DexCom\u2019s potential to offer a more effective solution for glucose management and patient outcomes in the hospital relative to the current standard of care. This recognition is designed to expedite the regulatory pathway as we continue to build evidence for the safety and impact of DexCom CGM in the inpatient setting. As you can see, we have a busy year plan as we navigate some of the most exciting launches in DexCom history and build out the foundation of growth for years to come. The foundation for long-term growth emerges from the core values that motivate us and the noble mission that our employees embrace to drive greater health outcomes throughout the world. Along those lines, we are pleased to publish our third annual sustainability report shortly after the conclusion of the first quarter. This report demonstrates our commitment to our stakeholders and details some great progress in our reporting efforts, including the publication of our first SASB Index, which is the reporting framework we find to be most preferred among our stakeholders. We also added updates to our efforts to drive access to our CGM technology globally via a comprehensive strategy that involves product differentiation, leveraging scale and demonstrating robust clinical outcomes. And we enhanced our disclosures around the composition of our workforce, employee engagement metrics, climate-related disclosure. And we are still early in our journey and these updates provide just a glimpse of the many things that made DexCom a company that I am truly proud to lead. With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy for a review of the first quarter financials. Jeremy?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today\u2019s earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the first quarter of 2022, we reported worldwide revenue of $629 million compared to $505 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing growth of 25% on a reported basis and 26% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue, which excludes non-CGM revenue related to last year\u2019s acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand, was 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue totaled $451 million for the first quarter compared to $381 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing growth of 18%. As Kevin mentioned, we saw a nice reacceleration of new customer starts over the course of the quarter, coinciding with improved access to healthcare providers for our sales force as the impact of Omicron waned. Our team continues to do a great job expanding the DexCom prescriber base and making sure that these clinicians are aware of the DexCom stories and the benefits of our system, leaving us well-positioned to extend new customer growth both now and well into the future. International revenue grew 43%, totaling $178 million for the first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which excludes the non-CGM revenue related to our distributor acquisition, was 33% for the first quarter. These international results include approximately $6 million of unfavorable impact from foreign currency or approximately 4% impact to our international growth result for the quarter. We continue to see very good international momentum as we broaden our commercial footprint. This includes the recently announced expansion of our DexCom ONE rollout that Kevin mentioned as well as additional access wins that have expanded our addressable market beyond the improvements that we achieved in 2021. As we mentioned earlier this year, following the successful launch of DexCom ONE late last year, we saw two of the four regions we serve to establish reimbursement starting in the first quarter. We have also secured reimbursement for DexCom ONE in Spain in conjunction with our launch this month and are hopeful to have DexCom ONE added to the UK drug tariff shortly. In Canada, we secured provincial coverage for people with Type 1 diabetes in Ontario. With this addition, DexCom has now established coverage for 7 provinces, representing greater than 93% of the Canadian population. Our first quarter gross profit was $398.1 million or 63.3% of revenue compared to 68.1% of revenue for the first quarter of 2021. Our first quarter gross margin reflects the traditional step down that we see from our fourth quarter as we see a greater mix of pharmacy revenue and less contribution from our DME customers with high deductible health plans. We also took a write-off of some obsolete G5 inventory in the quarter as Australia, previously the largest remaining G5 market in the world, as it added G6 to its CGM subsidy as of March. With this update, we are now able to fully transition the Australian market to G6, something our customers have long awaited. That impact, combined with a one-time impact related to facility damage, impacted our gross margin for the quarter by 100 basis points. Our teams are doing a good job leveraging our significant volume growth and operational efficiencies to offset the inflationary environment, allowing us to remain on track our full year margin expectations as we continue to advance our G7 launch. Operating expenses were $347.8 million for Q1 of 2022 compared to $297.5 million in Q1 of 2021. Despite ongoing investments in our commercial infrastructure, including the final quarter that includes incremental impact from our U.S. sales force expansion in 2021 as well as preparation for the G7 launch and pre-commercial G7 development costs that remained in our R&D expense, we still saw first quarter operating expenses as a percentage of sales decrease by 360 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2021. Operating income was $50.3 million or 8% of revenue in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $46.4 million or 9.2% of revenue in the same quarter of 2021, with the Q1 channel mix dynamic offsetting the operating leverage we continue to drive across the business. Adjusted EBITDA was $112.4 million or 17.9% of revenue for the first quarter compared to $94.4 million or 18.7% of revenue for the first quarter of 2021. Net income for the first quarter was $32.3 million or $0.32 per share. We remain in great financial position as we closed the first quarter, with approximately $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. This gives us the flexibility to support our ongoing organic growth investments, including the scale-up of our Malaysia manufacturing facility and global commercial infrastructure, while also being opportunistic to look at strategic options that accelerate our long-term growth potential through either our ventures unit or M&A. Turning to guidance. We are pleased to be in a position to reaffirm our full year 2022 guidance for revenue and margin. This includes total revenue of between $2.82 billion and $2.94 billion, gross profit margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25%. This guidance continues to factor in our strong customer growth momentum for our CGM platform, whether that is G6, DexCom ONE or G7, with approximately $15 million to $20 million of incremental currency headwinds versus our previous expectations. We are focused on meeting the complex operating environment and global inflationary pressures head on, with our teams committed to driving efficiencies and operating leverage for our shareholders. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Jeremy. As you can tell, there is no shortage of exciting things underway at DexCom and we look forward to providing updates as they come throughout the course of the year. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then reenter the queue, if necessary. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] The first question in the queue comes from Jeff Johnson. Your line is open please proceed. \nJeff Johnson: Thank you, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the call. I tend to focus on your top line, but, Jeremy, I think I want to start maybe on a gross margin question, if I could. With the gross margin down to 480 basis points, it looks like G&A was up about $16 million year-over-year. I\u2019m assuming that was largely driven by the G7 new manufacturing lines, if you could just confirm that? Obviously, you broke up the 100 basis points on the Australia write-off and the facility issue. That would still put gross margin down about 100 basis points year-over-year adjust for all those factors. Is that just some of those channel mix headwinds? Is there any other core pricing issues going on? Or what else is impacting on that other 100 basis points seems to be left over in my math? Thanks, guys.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes, no problem. And I can certainly give you some of the context in terms of that impact. There is a couple of other smaller pieces of gross margin. So we will first recap. We had about 50 bps associated with the impact we had at our facility, and that will be recovered via insurance on the balance of the year. So that\u2019s certainly a temporal thing. We certainly talked about the G5 and, again, that\u2019s a temporal thing as well as we have more folks on G6, that certainly will bode well for the balance of the year on margin. The other couple of pieces in there. There were some impacts associated with one-time use sensors. These are warranty sensors. It\u2019s actually a good thing. They expired, and they expired because our warranty rates continue to come down. And so for the quarter, certainly, we had to take a charge for those. But for the balance of the year, we expect our warranties to do better. That was about 50 bps as well. So some of that is the equation you\u2019re looking at. And there was a little bit of an impact of currency as it flows through. There is about 30 or 40 basis points of currency as you push that through. The remainder of that, and this will push you above the 65% number, is associated with mix and we talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks. As more and more of the mix in Q1 is tilted towards pharmacy and more folks go through the pharmacy, there is a little bit of pressure as you have less DME in the first quarter. We expect that to normalize over the balance of the year, and that\u2019s historically why you had that step back. As more and more goes to the pharmacy in the first quarter, you just get a little bit of a dynamic from that point of view from a gross margin perspective. But nothing pricing wise, nothing that would expect us to change the full year. In fact, that\u2019s why we reiterated the full year gross margin. We certainly expect to get there.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question in queue is from Danielle Antalffy. Your line is open pleas proceed.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question and better late the never right. So, just, Kevin, I\u2019m curious, we\u2019ve done a lot of work recently on CGN and adoption beyond the Type 1 patient population. And as I say, one of the things that has been very surprising is that they are still \u2013 even with the Endo community, some holdouts on Type 2s and whether the burden of therapy offsets the benefit you get from the CGM. And I know this is a high-level question. But I guess I\u2019m just curious about what you think the right strategy is to get those people over the hump here? You have data. You have coverage for non-insulin intensive Type 2. So where to from here with these types of folks, which, I\u2019m surprised, quite frankly, exists at all, but they do, I guess.\nKevin Sayer: Well, we could take the rest of the call time, Danielle, and talk about this because it\u2019s something we talk about a lot. Let\u2019s get to the starting point, and that\u2019s the evidence. The fact is over and over again. Every single time we use CGM and run a study in this patient group, people have much better outcomes than they had before. Getting the data from CGM absolutely changes people\u2019s lives and their view of their health, and they make changes because they have feedback that gives them something exactly as to what they should do. We also need to remember that this group of patients, this Type 2 patient who is not on insulin, most of them don\u2019t see endocrinologists or people that are always in the diabetes community, they see their primary care doctors. So we have to come up with a set of tools. It will make it very easy for that position and for this whole group to engage with CGM. Let\u2019s take another look at some of the dynamics going on here. CGM, over time, the cost of CGM has come down, but the cost of these drugs has not come down. The cost of these drugs is very high. What a great way to titrate a new GLP-1 then to have somebody with a CGM to say, hey, this is helping you. This is the right dose. This isn\u2019t the correct dose. It\u2019s going to play a vital role in that space, and it\u2019s going to be a very cost-effective solution for patients in that space, and it\u2019s going to be cost-effective for all the payers. We need to continue to push for reimbursement. Things really don\u2019t grow until they are covered, but we have some very aggressive plans with our partners in the other programs. We have plans of our own. And quite honestly, the feedback we get from the individuals who do get coverage for this, like I said, it\u2019s phenomenal. And none of them write me an e-mail or none of them say, I\u2019m doing better because I\u2019m on a new drug. They attribute their improved health to the CGM and the information that they have and the changes they have been able to make. So we remain bullish on this, but it does take time. I remember the first right along I ever did when I came here years ago, and I asked every doctor I visited, when you put a patient on CGM only after they have been on a pump for a few years because they are not serious about diabetes unless they wear a pump. We will look how that\u2019s changed. We can change the other equation too. We just need a little more time and a little more evidence.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. And when we read the study, Danielle, will certainly understand the questions you\u2019re asking out there. If you were winded the results you got from that, say, 2 or 3 to 4 years ago, it would have been a much different outcome as well. And I think you\u2019re just seeing that the recognition of this technology over time moves. But we do have to move people off of preconceived notions or the questions around the advancement of technology through education and awareness. So it\u2019s a continued focus there. And again, it all kind of aligns to all the work we did last year around expanding the sales force, direct-to-consumer advertising, really getting that education and awareness out there. We have to continue to do that, and that should help us over time.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question in the queue comes from Robbie Marcus. Your line is open please proceed.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I can ask, in the U.S. business in fourth quarter, you talked about how you had difficulty accessing primary care channel. First quarter growth in the U.S. came in a little lighter than we would have expected. Maybe just talk about trends there and then conversely talk about some of the early responder trends and feedback you\u2019re getting on G7 in Europe? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes, I\u2019ll take the U.S. question, Robbie, and then Kevin can certainly cover the early feedback on G7. So in the U.S., and we talked a little bit about this as we kind of rounded out the year last year, in December \u2013 certainly, in December, we saw the impact of Omicron and that continued pretty heavily into January in terms of getting out there and getting in front of prescribers. And so as you kind of look through the quarter, the way the quarter worked out was you had a kind of a lower January. And as the quarter progressed, each month got a little bit better as things really opened up. And so what we saw was exactly that is January was a bit tough. February was better and March was even better than that. And so the momentum continues in the right way, and that\u2019s the way I think we think about it. And so it played out a little bit how we expect when we gave guidance a little bit better as we\u2019re kind of coming out a little bit about the top end of at least where we thought the quarter was going to run. But that momentum you\u2019re seeing, I think, is pretty common to what we\u2019ve seen and heard in the market. It\u2019s also what we\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve been getting in front of these positions. In terms of the experience in the UK on the G7 launch, Kevin?\nKevin Sayer: Yes. We\u2019re early on, Robbie, but the feedback has been exactly what we expected has been phenomenal. As you start with product features, size is the first thing everybody sees and even the smaller size of the applicator, lesser materials, size on the body, the half hour warm-up, people love the app being much different than what we\u2019ve had before is being very well accepted and very easy to use, setup as much easier and much more friendly. So far so good with the limited launch. Everybody is very happy who\u2019s on our products so far. And we continue to gather feedback and then we will take the feedback we get and incorporate anything we hear that would be valuable into the full launch when we roll it out later this year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Jayson Bedford. Your line is open.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon and nice job on making this co-work. So my question is, typically, you commented on unit volume I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard that this quarter. So can you maybe, Jereme, talk about the interplay between volume growth and rev growth this quarter, both U.S. and international?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. So I think you saw it play out about the same way you saw it in prior quarters. And as we kind of make that migration that\u2019s happening, our unit volume growth was in the low 40s. And so as you kind of draw that correlation to what happened last quarter, it\u2019s about a similar correlation, which is about what you would have expected, right, as we\u2019re going into this year of the final major migration to the pharmacy as well as annualizing some of the access wins that we got. In terms of the split, U.S., o-U.S., we really don\u2019t break it out. However, you generally know that there is price \u2013 there is channel mix and pricing in both of those. And so as you talk about the growth numbers, the unit volume numbers are generally higher than that, and it\u2019s generally pretty proportionate. That\u2019s generally where we sit today. And for the balance of the year, clearly, we have not changed on what we expect those headwinds to be. So hopefully that helps low 40% unit volume growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien. Your line is open, sir.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Here in the U.S., just to follow-up a bit more on the U.S. commentary, I think people are expecting a little bit more in Q1, understanding Omicron was a little bit of a headwind, but your 55%, 60% penetrated of Type 1s. Consumer confidence is dropping like a rock. You\u2019re getting into some of the people that have been more hesitant to get on to CGM so far. So is there a risk that the domestic business could see a little bit more softness than expected throughout the course of this year or even into next year as those factors really kind of start to pile up? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Matt, I appreciate the question. We do not feel that way at all. With respect to the U.S. population, again, Jereme hit unit volume growth. Our unit volume growth was outstanding this quarter, and our new patient numbers, once we got past the Omicron wave early in the quarter, our new patient as were very, very strong. And we finished where we plan to finish for the quarter in general. So we did not feel that softness at all. And with respect to confidence, people have never had more confidence in our product than they have in G6 right now. As I said earlier, our customer satisfaction scores are better than they have ever been. Patients are very satisfied with DexCom. As we look at further penetration in this marketplace, there are some very significant catalysts coming as well on the Type 1 side, and they\u2019ll also be more applicable to Type 2 intensive users as well. You look at our integrated partners with Tandem and with Omnipod 5 on the horizon and then you look at a G7 product for those who aren\u2019t on because we won\u2019t be integrated with those pumps immediately out of the gate, but a G7 product for our MDI patients that is a much, much better experience than what we have now. And when we have now is world-class, we don\u2019t lack for being bullish at all right now here in the U.S. We think we\u2019re in a good spot.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch. Your line is open please proceed.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good evening and thank you for pulling this off. I ask you what\u2019s included in your guidance? You\u2019ve got DexCom ONE going out the door in different regions. You\u2019ve got G7 outside the United States and in the United States in the back half of the year, I would assume. How do you think about putting all those factors into your guidance?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. So we\u2019ve got a little bit of all. So what we do generally in our guidance is we look at multiple different scenarios. And so we have DexCom ONE in various country launches, timed to different times. It helps us align where that guidance should ultimately sit. We also have a G7 launch outside the U.S. as well as in the U.S. at various times throughout the course of the year that helps us understand the impact. And we run various scenarios to make sure that under all of these scenarios, whether it\u2019s G7 or G6 or DexCom ONE, that we make sure that we\u2019re putting out reasonable guidance around what we can achieve. And again, we will always try to outperform it. So the way to think about it is, is there is various difference in all of them ultimately play in to kind of coming up with a guidance number we feel comfortable coming out with. And let me give you an example about that. G7 comes out great. It can be an extra catalyst, but you still have to remember G6 is an incredible product that\u2019s going to be connected to Omnipod 5, as Kevin previously referenced. So there is some catalysts there. DexCom ONE is certainly interesting. And when you win tenders, that can ultimately drive it, knowing when exactly you will win those tenders. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to pick because we have various different scenarios that play in. So, a little bit of all of it is the way to think about it, and we expect to be able to hit guidance irrespective of the timing of a lot of these launches to the extent the launches fall the right way, we certainly hope to outperform.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mathew Blackman. Sir, you may proceed.\nMathew Blackman: Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned the growing prescriber base, anything you are willing to share on the size of the prescriber base and in particular, the percent that primary care physicians comprised of that base today versus prior to the sales force expansion? Just anything to help us frame the progress of that newer call point? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. So, I would say, while we haven\u2019t necessarily sized it and I don\u2019t think we are ready to size it exactly today, it has grown dramatically. Like I think we have had, it\u2019s doubled over the past, call it, 18 months, and it continues to grow faster. In fact, we expect it to grow another sizable portion this year as our folks call on more. In terms of the mix, it is predominantly primary care physicians at this point. When you think about the endocrinologists over \u2013 across the United States, there is about 6,600 endocrinologists across the United States, and we call on tens of thousands of prescribers. And so you can probably get a feel for how many we are calling on. The larger prescribers still in the endocrinologist community, so that still is where we spend a good chunk of our time. But at this point, due to the expansion of the sales force, we are calling on more primary care physicians than we are in endocrinologists.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen. Your line is open sir.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to focus on G7, so Kevin, I know you can\u2019t predict the FDA, but how are you feeling about having approval of G7 in the U.S. by ADA? Is it still plausible? And with the G6 launch, we saw a pretty big inflection when you launched that in the U.S. Do you think we could see something similar with G7? Thanks for taking the question.\nKevin Sayer: Larry, thanks for asking. Let\u2019s go back a little bit on G7. Remember, this is a global launch for us, not just a U.S. one. Our limited launch right now in the UK is going on. We have seen mark there. UK will be our first launch as we roll out internationally. And then we roll out to other countries after that as we go through the local approval and filing process. So, we are on track with our international plans. One of the things we have learned over the years is we really don\u2019t give dates as far as when we think things are going to be approved. And we are in our back and forth time with the FDA. We applaud them for spending as much time as they have an effort doing a busy time with us in getting this done. And we are confident, we will have a meaningful U.S. launch of G7 this year. Approval more than likely will come after ADA as knowing what we know and what we see today. And we are comfortable with that. We are also comfortable that there are no showstoppers in the things we are discussing with them. We are having a very good dialogue and look forward to that launch. As far as a bolus with G7, you are absolutely right, we do believe this is going to be a great product launch for us and will lead to more people using CGM. I think it\u2019s important that everybody remember, we are in a different time now with respect to reimbursement particularly with the time it will take to get this into the pharmacy channel. So, as you start lining things up, once you have approval, you file with CMS to get reimbursement that takes some time and the pharmacy contracts take some time. So, we will launch the product and absolutely seek to get reimbursement and approval every place we can as quick as we can and even some prelaunch where we can do that. We have those efforts going on as well. So, this will roll out as quickly as we can do it. We are optimistic we will get approved, but more than likely after ADA.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Marie Thibault. Your line is open ma\u2019am.\nMarie Thibault: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask here on DexCom ONE as you expand that launch. I am curious who is appealing to how these early users are hearing about it? And who is telling them about how it\u2019s being positioned versus the G-Series? Thanks so much.\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. I will take that. Our first users in the BELL countries, this is all an e-commerce effort. This has been an e-commerce platform with some advertising from us. But by and large, our e-commerce platform has reached these people. That\u2019s how they have heard about it and have paid cash for this product on their own. As far as positioning right now, DexCom ONE is positioned for insulin users, but it\u2019s not positioned for those who are going to integrate with another device or even share data with others. It\u2019s a simplified version of our product for that type of use. In the other countries that we rolled out, as Jereme said earlier, we are involved in the tender process. In Spain, we have reimbursement for DexCom ONE in Spain. In many of the European markets, there is a positioning of what you would call high-risk pool and then another pool of insulin using patients. We have always played very well on the high-risk pool with these patients because of our connectivity, our accuracy and our performance. And that is a higher price point within those geographies as well. With DexCom ONE, we now have access to the other patients. And again, the qualification of those patients varies tender-to-tender and country-to-country. But it gives us a much larger playing field \u2013 our playing field is going to be expanded anywhere between 80% and 90% in some of these countries where we launched DexCom ONE is a dual product. So, that\u2019s there, that\u2019s why we are doing it and that\u2019s what we believe. So, expanding into new geographies with the product, with the e-commerce platform, but also expanding our reach and making available to more people.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Travis Steed. Your line is open, please proceed.\nTravis Steed: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted a little bit more color on the basal-only population and the conversations that you guys are having with payers. I am hearing more and more patients in that population getting entrance coverage. So, just kind of curious is that what you are seeing on your end as well in conversations with Medicare moving along?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So, I will start \u2013 thanks for the question, and welcome back. I will start with the CMS conversation. So certainly, we have the discussions. And that\u2019s a process that takes a little bit more time, but it is simple and that\u2019s where the significance of the basal population resides. And we are working with CMS to look at what that opportunity looks like. And so we will be making progress there over the course of the year. And as we have more and more information, we will certainly share it. In terms of the insurance coverage and the population on the commercial side, there are some insurance carriers that do cover it. It\u2019s a little sparse in between. There are some that folks kind of get access to it to it through some edits or forms around those lines around insulin use without look backs. And so there are folks that are getting access to it. However, it is very, very light penetration at this point in that space. And so \u2013 but those conversations are going. We are having the similar conversations that we talked about having with CMS. We are having those with commercial payers, and we will continue to have those over time because we have shown and certainly with our MOBILE study was an obvious game changer that people on CGM do better. And I think that the insurance companies as well as CMS are starting to see it. So, more updates to come over time as we get those coverages and we will share those, certainly those that are significant in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Steven Lichtman. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi guys. I wanted to ask on the intensive Type 2 patient population in the U.S. where penetration still meaningfully trails Type 1. With the coverage efforts you have made over the past few years, are you seeing momentum pick up in this group? And what\u2019s your outlook from where penetration can go over time?\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. I will take that. Obviously, we are getting very good coverage in that segment. That population, again, Medicare covers that, and that is really our fastest-growing patient segment right now. We are doing very well in these Type 2 patients. Hence, the reason for expansion of the sales force and calling on more primary care physicians. As far as penetration in that population, their needs for CGM data are equal to those in our Type 1 population, and we believe not only is CGM going to be successful there, but we will be successful there with our pump partners as well through our integrated systems. So, I \u2013 many years ago, I have said 80% penetration for CGM in the Type 1 world and even people from our own company kind of gave me a funny look. I don\u2019t see that as being a problem over time. If you are going to be intensively using insulin, there is no reason to not treat yourself with CGM. It is just a much better tool. So, I believe that penetration get every bit as high as the Type 1 population without any question.\nOperator: Thank you. And then the last question in the queue comes from Margaret Kaczor. Your line is open now.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to focus on completely different opportunity that we haven\u2019t talked too much about, but you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks. You have a lot of data that you have gathered in the hospital for inpatient use of CGM during COVID. You have breakthrough status. So, maybe could you just talk to us about what\u2019s the next steps in that market clearly a meaningful opportunity for you, but maybe some market education, some market development work that needs to be done? So, what are you guys focused on this year? And what should we look out for progress there? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you for the question. This is definitely a passion of mine going way back to my early days in diabetes therapy back in \u201890s. One of the things we have done this year, we have hired a General Manager for our hospital business, a very experienced executive who spent a lot of time here, and we are starting to build a full team around him in that organization. We are running clinical studies right now to show how the product performs in the hospital environment. And we have had numerous discussions with the FDA. I think for us the key here is to get the sensing technology and the performance of the sensor validated and verified that it will be approved and usable in that environment. And the feedback we have gotten certainly during the pandemic has been very, very positive for those facilities that did use CGM. Once we do that and validate the product performance just from a technical perspective, then it becomes a question of what does that product look like, what does it connect to and what is the distribution channel and business model look like. And that\u2019s why we have an experienced GM in the team built out here. We know how much better things work in a hospital if you have continuous data. I have had several experiences where people have told me about having their fingers stuck every 30 minutes without diabetes in a post-surgical order in an ICU, and it drives them crazy when they know they could be on CGM. As you look at the number of hospitalizations and the number of people hospitalized with diabetes and cardiovascular awards, in particular, the CGM opportunity here is vast. The questions we need to answer, business model, product configuration, ease of use, outcomes, all those things. And we have a great team that can put that data together for us. So, we are very optimistic and bullish about it over time. I do appreciate the question. Hopefully, we will have you some more information over the course of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. We have one question in the queue from Frank Pinal. Your line is open sir.\nFrank Pinal: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question and squeezing me in here. Just one on FX really quickly. Seeing a few companies at this point raised their forward FX headwind expectations for the next two quarters to three quarters, and I am wondering to what degree is that \u2013 are you baking in FX? What\u2019s in there now? Could we see that challenge to lower in the guide? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Thanks for the question, Frank. And I think you will see it in our prepared remarks, we do expect $15 million to $20 million of FX headwinds, but we kept our guide the same. And so the way to think about it is we think we can grow through that in the current period. And so as you do the math for the full year, if you include the impact, the incremental impacts of headwind versus a 15% to 20% guide, it\u2019s a 16% to 21% guide. So, that should give you some comfort that, yes, there are headwinds associated with currency. Yes, we do believe we can grow through it. And so a currency-adjusted growth rate certainly would reflect that. So, call it $15 million to $20 million on the year, but it doesn\u2019t change our full year guide.\nOperator: And sir, we have no further questions in the queue. Do you have any closing remarks?\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. I absolutely do. We appreciate all of you for hanging with us today. Obviously, to say things have been a little hectic here would be an understatement. But as always, we get through it. I just \u2013 if you look at this quarter, again, $110 million in organic growth, volume increases in the low-40%, great new patient numbers post the Omicron care. DexCom ONE launched in Spain, launch announced in the UK. CE Mark for G7, limited launch for G7 in the UK, continued G7 progress in the U.S., continued scale in our business, positive momentum on the operating leverage side. There is not a whole lot more we could do. Times cannot be better and more hectic they are at DexCom right now. We appreciate everybody\u2019s support and all the fine people who make this possible. Thanks everybody and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, operator. We apologize for being a bit late today. We have had some difficulties with our conference call service provider here, but we are up and running now. And we are excited to talk about a good quarter. I am going to turn it over to Sean. Sean? Thank you, Sean and thank you everyone for joining us. Today, we reported strong first quarter results with organic revenue growth of 22% over the first quarter of 2021 or 23% on a constant currency basis. Demand for DexCom CGM remains very high globally across all of our customer segments. We have also seen a nice rebound in customer growth throughout the first quarter with new customer starts ramping after the Omicron wave and ultimately meeting our expectations for the quarter. As many of you know, we have significantly scaled our business to drive demand and greatly expand the number of people with diabetes that we can serve globally. This scale goes beyond manufacturing capacity, extending to the efficiencies that we can bring as we serve customers and clinicians. Our relentless focus on meeting the needs of our customers continues to be validated in our results. In the first quarter, our net promoter scores for G6 remained near record levels, with customers also indicating that the strategies and tools that we have implemented are simplifying their experiences with DexCom. The teams have driven several innovations that may not always draw the attention of our investors, but they are critically important to the experience of our customers. For example, our customers rely on DexCom to make dozens of decisions each day and therefore, a reliable supply of DexCom CGM is critically important. In the first quarter, we established new records for on-time shipping for commercial orders and timing of replacement systems at 99.7% and 99.9% respectively. We are especially proud of this result given the challenges of current global supply chain dynamics. Product supply should never be on the minds of our customers and our operations team is making sure that this is the case. These efforts are delivering results in our performance as both retention and utilization levels have steadily improved since the launch of G6, reflecting a competitive strength as we engage with clinicians and payers on the value of our CGM systems. Building on this momentum, we are thrilled to now be underway with the initial launch of our G7 CGM system. G7 builds upon the best-in-class G6 experience with a form factor that is 60% smaller with the reduced environmental footprint, a streamlined set of experience, including a 30-minute warm-up time, an improved app experience with CLARITY integrated into the core app and all of this with accuracy that improves upon the reliable performance that is a hallmark of DexCom CGM technology. Following the receipt of CE Mark for G7 in March, we initiated our limited launch of G7 in the UK in the subsequent weeks. During this brief window, we are assessing the functionality of the sensor and app in the real world and gathering initial feedback from our users, which has been very positive so far. Our plan is to extend the G7 launch to a steady cadence of additional international markets over the remainder of 2022 with a growing impact to our overall sensor mix in the second half of the year. In the U.S., our 510(k) submission for the G7 sensor, receiver and Android and iOS apps remains under review. We are in the traditional back and forth that comes with these processes. And we appreciate the FDA's ongoing attention to their view even as they juggle a very busy schedule. In the meantime, the teams are busy preparing for a seamless transition once G7 is available. This includes preliminary discussions with payers to drive market access, where possible in advance of approval. It includes significant preparations from our operations team to add incremental G7 lines in advance of the launch to support the expected ramp in demand. And it includes ongoing work with our insulin delivery partners to ensure that we are progressing towards the goal of connected pump and insulin pen systems that are integrated with our latest sensor technology. As we progress with the launch of G7, we continue to pursue creative solutions to expand access to our CGM technology and bring the value of real-time CGM to people who previously faced limited options for diabetes management. Beyond G7, we recently introduced DexCom ONE in Spain, which is the newest of our direct markets and will launch DexCom ONE in the UK shortly. These represent the first dual product markets for DexCom, bringing two excellent options for real-time CGM to customers and their respective health systems of these countries. We expect this dual product strategy to significantly expand the number of people with reimbursed access to our CGM technology, broadening our growth opportunity in these countries as well as additional countries where we plan to bring DexCom ONE in the future. And geographic expansion is only one element of the significant growth opportunity ahead for DexCom. In the first quarter, we were also pleased to receive breakthrough device designation from the FDA for the CGM system that we are working to develop for use in the hospital setting. The breakthrough designation represents the FDA's recognition of DexCom's potential to offer a more effective solution for glucose management and patient outcomes in the hospital relative to the current standard of care. This recognition is designed to expedite the regulatory pathway as we continue to build evidence for the safety and impact of DexCom CGM in the inpatient setting. As you can see, we have a busy year plan as we navigate some of the most exciting launches in DexCom history and build out the foundation of growth for years to come. The foundation for long-term growth emerges from the core values that motivate us and the noble mission that our employees embrace to drive greater health outcomes throughout the world. Along those lines, we are pleased to publish our third annual sustainability report shortly after the conclusion of the first quarter. This report demonstrates our commitment to our stakeholders and details some great progress in our reporting efforts, including the publication of our first SASB Index, which is the reporting framework we find to be most preferred among our stakeholders. We also added updates to our efforts to drive access to our CGM technology globally via a comprehensive strategy that involves product differentiation, leveraging scale and demonstrating robust clinical outcomes. And we enhanced our disclosures around the composition of our workforce, employee engagement metrics, climate-related disclosure. And we are still early in our journey and these updates provide just a glimpse of the many things that made DexCom a company that I am truly proud to lead. With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy for a review of the first quarter financials. Jeremy? Thanks, Jeremy. As you can tell, there is no shortage of exciting things underway at DexCom and we look forward to providing updates as they come throughout the course of the year. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Well, we could take the rest of the call time, Danielle, and talk about this because it's something we talk about a lot. Let's get to the starting point, and that's the evidence. The fact is over and over again. Every single time we use CGM and run a study in this patient group, people have much better outcomes than they had before. Getting the data from CGM absolutely changes people's lives and their view of their health, and they make changes because they have feedback that gives them something exactly as to what they should do. We also need to remember that this group of patients, this Type 2 patient who is not on insulin, most of them don't see endocrinologists or people that are always in the diabetes community, they see their primary care doctors. So we have to come up with a set of tools. It will make it very easy for that position and for this whole group to engage with CGM. Let's take another look at some of the dynamics going on here. CGM, over time, the cost of CGM has come down, but the cost of these drugs has not come down. The cost of these drugs is very high. What a great way to titrate a new GLP-1 then to have somebody with a CGM to say, hey, this is helping you. This is the right dose. This isn't the correct dose. It's going to play a vital role in that space, and it's going to be a very cost-effective solution for patients in that space, and it's going to be cost-effective for all the payers. We need to continue to push for reimbursement. Things really don't grow until they are covered, but we have some very aggressive plans with our partners in the other programs. We have plans of our own. And quite honestly, the feedback we get from the individuals who do get coverage for this, like I said, it's phenomenal. And none of them write me an e-mail or none of them say, I'm doing better because I'm on a new drug. They attribute their improved health to the CGM and the information that they have and the changes they have been able to make. So we remain bullish on this, but it does take time. I remember the first right along I ever did when I came here years ago, and I asked every doctor I visited, when you put a patient on CGM only after they have been on a pump for a few years because they are not serious about diabetes unless they wear a pump. We will look how that's changed. We can change the other equation too. We just need a little more time and a little more evidence. Yes. We're early on, Robbie, but the feedback has been exactly what we expected has been phenomenal. As you start with product features, size is the first thing everybody sees and even the smaller size of the applicator, lesser materials, size on the body, the half hour warm-up, people love the app being much different than what we've had before is being very well accepted and very easy to use, setup as much easier and much more friendly. So far so good with the limited launch. Everybody is very happy who's on our products so far. And we continue to gather feedback and then we will take the feedback we get and incorporate anything we hear that would be valuable into the full launch when we roll it out later this year. Matt, I appreciate the question. We do not feel that way at all. With respect to the U.S. population, again, Jereme hit unit volume growth. Our unit volume growth was outstanding this quarter, and our new patient numbers, once we got past the Omicron wave early in the quarter, our new patient as were very, very strong. And we finished where we plan to finish for the quarter in general. So we did not feel that softness at all. And with respect to confidence, people have never had more confidence in our product than they have in G6 right now. As I said earlier, our customer satisfaction scores are better than they have ever been. Patients are very satisfied with DexCom. As we look at further penetration in this marketplace, there are some very significant catalysts coming as well on the Type 1 side, and they'll also be more applicable to Type 2 intensive users as well. You look at our integrated partners with Tandem and with Omnipod 5 on the horizon and then you look at a G7 product for those who aren't on because we won't be integrated with those pumps immediately out of the gate, but a G7 product for our MDI patients that is a much, much better experience than what we have now. And when we have now is world-class, we don't lack for being bullish at all right now here in the U.S. We think we're in a good spot. Larry, thanks for asking. Let's go back a little bit on G7. Remember, this is a global launch for us, not just a U.S. one. Our limited launch right now in the UK is going on. We have seen mark there. UK will be our first launch as we roll out internationally. And then we roll out to other countries after that as we go through the local approval and filing process. So, we are on track with our international plans. One of the things we have learned over the years is we really don't give dates as far as when we think things are going to be approved. And we are in our back and forth time with the FDA. We applaud them for spending as much time as they have an effort doing a busy time with us in getting this done. And we are confident, we will have a meaningful U.S. launch of G7 this year. Approval more than likely will come after ADA as knowing what we know and what we see today. And we are comfortable with that. We are also comfortable that there are no showstoppers in the things we are discussing with them. We are having a very good dialogue and look forward to that launch. As far as a bolus with G7, you are absolutely right, we do believe this is going to be a great product launch for us and will lead to more people using CGM. I think it's important that everybody remember, we are in a different time now with respect to reimbursement particularly with the time it will take to get this into the pharmacy channel. So, as you start lining things up, once you have approval, you file with CMS to get reimbursement that takes some time and the pharmacy contracts take some time. So, we will launch the product and absolutely seek to get reimbursement and approval every place we can as quick as we can and even some prelaunch where we can do that. We have those efforts going on as well. So, this will roll out as quickly as we can do it. We are optimistic we will get approved, but more than likely after ADA. Yes. This is Kevin. I will take that. Our first users in the BELL countries, this is all an e-commerce effort. This has been an e-commerce platform with some advertising from us. But by and large, our e-commerce platform has reached these people. That's how they have heard about it and have paid cash for this product on their own. As far as positioning right now, DexCom ONE is positioned for insulin users, but it's not positioned for those who are going to integrate with another device or even share data with others. It's a simplified version of our product for that type of use. In the other countries that we rolled out, as Jereme said earlier, we are involved in the tender process. In Spain, we have reimbursement for DexCom ONE in Spain. In many of the European markets, there is a positioning of what you would call high-risk pool and then another pool of insulin using patients. We have always played very well on the high-risk pool with these patients because of our connectivity, our accuracy and our performance. And that is a higher price point within those geographies as well. With DexCom ONE, we now have access to the other patients. And again, the qualification of those patients varies tender-to-tender and country-to-country. But it gives us a much larger playing field \u2013 our playing field is going to be expanded anywhere between 80% and 90% in some of these countries where we launched DexCom ONE is a dual product. So, that's there, that's why we are doing it and that's what we believe. So, expanding into new geographies with the product, with the e-commerce platform, but also expanding our reach and making available to more people. Yes. This is Kevin. I will take that. Obviously, we are getting very good coverage in that segment. That population, again, Medicare covers that, and that is really our fastest-growing patient segment right now. We are doing very well in these Type 2 patients. Hence, the reason for expansion of the sales force and calling on more primary care physicians. As far as penetration in that population, their needs for CGM data are equal to those in our Type 1 population, and we believe not only is CGM going to be successful there, but we will be successful there with our pump partners as well through our integrated systems. So, I \u2013 many years ago, I have said 80% penetration for CGM in the Type 1 world and even people from our own company kind of gave me a funny look. I don't see that as being a problem over time. If you are going to be intensively using insulin, there is no reason to not treat yourself with CGM. It is just a much better tool. So, I believe that penetration get every bit as high as the Type 1 population without any question. Thank you for the question. This is definitely a passion of mine going way back to my early days in diabetes therapy back in \u201890s. One of the things we have done this year, we have hired a General Manager for our hospital business, a very experienced executive who spent a lot of time here, and we are starting to build a full team around him in that organization. We are running clinical studies right now to show how the product performs in the hospital environment. And we have had numerous discussions with the FDA. I think for us the key here is to get the sensing technology and the performance of the sensor validated and verified that it will be approved and usable in that environment. And the feedback we have gotten certainly during the pandemic has been very, very positive for those facilities that did use CGM. Once we do that and validate the product performance just from a technical perspective, then it becomes a question of what does that product look like, what does it connect to and what is the distribution channel and business model look like. And that's why we have an experienced GM in the team built out here. We know how much better things work in a hospital if you have continuous data. I have had several experiences where people have told me about having their fingers stuck every 30 minutes without diabetes in a post-surgical order in an ICU, and it drives them crazy when they know they could be on CGM. As you look at the number of hospitalizations and the number of people hospitalized with diabetes and cardiovascular awards, in particular, the CGM opportunity here is vast. The questions we need to answer, business model, product configuration, ease of use, outcomes, all those things. And we have a great team that can put that data together for us. So, we are very optimistic and bullish about it over time. I do appreciate the question. Hopefully, we will have you some more information over the course of the year. Yes. This is Kevin. I absolutely do. We appreciate all of you for hanging with us today. Obviously, to say things have been a little hectic here would be an understatement. But as always, we get through it. I just \u2013 if you look at this quarter, again, $110 million in organic growth, volume increases in the low-40%, great new patient numbers post the Omicron care. DexCom ONE launched in Spain, launch announced in the UK. CE Mark for G7, limited launch for G7 in the UK, continued G7 progress in the U.S., continued scale in our business, positive momentum on the operating leverage side. There is not a whole lot more we could do. Times cannot be better and more hectic they are at DexCom right now. We appreciate everybody's support and all the fine people who make this possible. Thanks everybody and have a great day."

            "name": "Jereme Sylvain",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the first quarter of 2022, we reported worldwide revenue of $629 million compared to $505 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing growth of 25% on a reported basis and 26% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue, which excludes non-CGM revenue related to last year's acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand, was 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. U.S. revenue totaled $451 million for the first quarter compared to $381 million for the first quarter of 2021, representing growth of 18%. As Kevin mentioned, we saw a nice reacceleration of new customer starts over the course of the quarter, coinciding with improved access to healthcare providers for our sales force as the impact of Omicron waned. Our team continues to do a great job expanding the DexCom prescriber base and making sure that these clinicians are aware of the DexCom stories and the benefits of our system, leaving us well-positioned to extend new customer growth both now and well into the future. International revenue grew 43%, totaling $178 million for the first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which excludes the non-CGM revenue related to our distributor acquisition, was 33% for the first quarter. These international results include approximately $6 million of unfavorable impact from foreign currency or approximately 4% impact to our international growth result for the quarter. We continue to see very good international momentum as we broaden our commercial footprint. This includes the recently announced expansion of our DexCom ONE rollout that Kevin mentioned as well as additional access wins that have expanded our addressable market beyond the improvements that we achieved in 2021. As we mentioned earlier this year, following the successful launch of DexCom ONE late last year, we saw two of the four regions we serve to establish reimbursement starting in the first quarter. We have also secured reimbursement for DexCom ONE in Spain in conjunction with our launch this month and are hopeful to have DexCom ONE added to the UK drug tariff shortly. In Canada, we secured provincial coverage for people with Type 1 diabetes in Ontario. With this addition, DexCom has now established coverage for 7 provinces, representing greater than 93% of the Canadian population. Our first quarter gross profit was $398.1 million or 63.3% of revenue compared to 68.1% of revenue for the first quarter of 2021. Our first quarter gross margin reflects the traditional step down that we see from our fourth quarter as we see a greater mix of pharmacy revenue and less contribution from our DME customers with high deductible health plans. We also took a write-off of some obsolete G5 inventory in the quarter as Australia, previously the largest remaining G5 market in the world, as it added G6 to its CGM subsidy as of March. With this update, we are now able to fully transition the Australian market to G6, something our customers have long awaited. That impact, combined with a one-time impact related to facility damage, impacted our gross margin for the quarter by 100 basis points. Our teams are doing a good job leveraging our significant volume growth and operational efficiencies to offset the inflationary environment, allowing us to remain on track our full year margin expectations as we continue to advance our G7 launch. Operating expenses were $347.8 million for Q1 of 2022 compared to $297.5 million in Q1 of 2021. Despite ongoing investments in our commercial infrastructure, including the final quarter that includes incremental impact from our U.S. sales force expansion in 2021 as well as preparation for the G7 launch and pre-commercial G7 development costs that remained in our R&D expense, we still saw first quarter operating expenses as a percentage of sales decrease by 360 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2021. Operating income was $50.3 million or 8% of revenue in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $46.4 million or 9.2% of revenue in the same quarter of 2021, with the Q1 channel mix dynamic offsetting the operating leverage we continue to drive across the business. Adjusted EBITDA was $112.4 million or 17.9% of revenue for the first quarter compared to $94.4 million or 18.7% of revenue for the first quarter of 2021. Net income for the first quarter was $32.3 million or $0.32 per share. We remain in great financial position as we closed the first quarter, with approximately $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. This gives us the flexibility to support our ongoing organic growth investments, including the scale-up of our Malaysia manufacturing facility and global commercial infrastructure, while also being opportunistic to look at strategic options that accelerate our long-term growth potential through either our ventures unit or M&A. Turning to guidance. We are pleased to be in a position to reaffirm our full year 2022 guidance for revenue and margin. This includes total revenue of between $2.82 billion and $2.94 billion, gross profit margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25%. This guidance continues to factor in our strong customer growth momentum for our CGM platform, whether that is G6, DexCom ONE or G7, with approximately $15 million to $20 million of incremental currency headwinds versus our previous expectations. We are focused on meeting the complex operating environment and global inflationary pressures head on, with our teams committed to driving efficiencies and operating leverage for our shareholders. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. Sure. Yes, no problem. And I can certainly give you some of the context in terms of that impact. There is a couple of other smaller pieces of gross margin. So we will first recap. We had about 50 bps associated with the impact we had at our facility, and that will be recovered via insurance on the balance of the year. So that's certainly a temporal thing. We certainly talked about the G5 and, again, that's a temporal thing as well as we have more folks on G6, that certainly will bode well for the balance of the year on margin. The other couple of pieces in there. There were some impacts associated with one-time use sensors. These are warranty sensors. It's actually a good thing. They expired, and they expired because our warranty rates continue to come down. And so for the quarter, certainly, we had to take a charge for those. But for the balance of the year, we expect our warranties to do better. That was about 50 bps as well. So some of that is the equation you're looking at. And there was a little bit of an impact of currency as it flows through. There is about 30 or 40 basis points of currency as you push that through. The remainder of that, and this will push you above the 65% number, is associated with mix and we talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks. As more and more of the mix in Q1 is tilted towards pharmacy and more folks go through the pharmacy, there is a little bit of pressure as you have less DME in the first quarter. We expect that to normalize over the balance of the year, and that's historically why you had that step back. As more and more goes to the pharmacy in the first quarter, you just get a little bit of a dynamic from that point of view from a gross margin perspective. But nothing pricing wise, nothing that would expect us to change the full year. In fact, that's why we reiterated the full year gross margin. We certainly expect to get there. Yes. And when we read the study, Danielle, will certainly understand the questions you're asking out there. If you were winded the results you got from that, say, 2 or 3 to 4 years ago, it would have been a much different outcome as well. And I think you're just seeing that the recognition of this technology over time moves. But we do have to move people off of preconceived notions or the questions around the advancement of technology through education and awareness. So it's a continued focus there. And again, it all kind of aligns to all the work we did last year around expanding the sales force, direct-to-consumer advertising, really getting that education and awareness out there. We have to continue to do that, and that should help us over time. Sure. Yes, I'll take the U.S. question, Robbie, and then Kevin can certainly cover the early feedback on G7. So in the U.S., and we talked a little bit about this as we kind of rounded out the year last year, in December \u2013 certainly, in December, we saw the impact of Omicron and that continued pretty heavily into January in terms of getting out there and getting in front of prescribers. And so as you kind of look through the quarter, the way the quarter worked out was you had a kind of a lower January. And as the quarter progressed, each month got a little bit better as things really opened up. And so what we saw was exactly that is January was a bit tough. February was better and March was even better than that. And so the momentum continues in the right way, and that's the way I think we think about it. And so it played out a little bit how we expect when we gave guidance a little bit better as we're kind of coming out a little bit about the top end of at least where we thought the quarter was going to run. But that momentum you're seeing, I think, is pretty common to what we've seen and heard in the market. It's also what we've seen as we've been getting in front of these positions. In terms of the experience in the UK on the G7 launch, Kevin? Sure. Yes. So I think you saw it play out about the same way you saw it in prior quarters. And as we kind of make that migration that's happening, our unit volume growth was in the low 40s. And so as you kind of draw that correlation to what happened last quarter, it's about a similar correlation, which is about what you would have expected, right, as we're going into this year of the final major migration to the pharmacy as well as annualizing some of the access wins that we got. In terms of the split, U.S., o-U.S., we really don't break it out. However, you generally know that there is price \u2013 there is channel mix and pricing in both of those. And so as you talk about the growth numbers, the unit volume numbers are generally higher than that, and it's generally pretty proportionate. That's generally where we sit today. And for the balance of the year, clearly, we have not changed on what we expect those headwinds to be. So hopefully that helps low 40% unit volume growth. Sure. So we've got a little bit of all. So what we do generally in our guidance is we look at multiple different scenarios. And so we have DexCom ONE in various country launches, timed to different times. It helps us align where that guidance should ultimately sit. We also have a G7 launch outside the U.S. as well as in the U.S. at various times throughout the course of the year that helps us understand the impact. And we run various scenarios to make sure that under all of these scenarios, whether it's G7 or G6 or DexCom ONE, that we make sure that we're putting out reasonable guidance around what we can achieve. And again, we will always try to outperform it. So the way to think about it is, is there is various difference in all of them ultimately play in to kind of coming up with a guidance number we feel comfortable coming out with. And let me give you an example about that. G7 comes out great. It can be an extra catalyst, but you still have to remember G6 is an incredible product that's going to be connected to Omnipod 5, as Kevin previously referenced. So there is some catalysts there. DexCom ONE is certainly interesting. And when you win tenders, that can ultimately drive it, knowing when exactly you will win those tenders. Sometimes it's hard to pick because we have various different scenarios that play in. So, a little bit of all of it is the way to think about it, and we expect to be able to hit guidance irrespective of the timing of a lot of these launches to the extent the launches fall the right way, we certainly hope to outperform. Sure. Yes. So, I would say, while we haven't necessarily sized it and I don't think we are ready to size it exactly today, it has grown dramatically. Like I think we have had, it's doubled over the past, call it, 18 months, and it continues to grow faster. In fact, we expect it to grow another sizable portion this year as our folks call on more. In terms of the mix, it is predominantly primary care physicians at this point. When you think about the endocrinologists over \u2013 across the United States, there is about 6,600 endocrinologists across the United States, and we call on tens of thousands of prescribers. And so you can probably get a feel for how many we are calling on. The larger prescribers still in the endocrinologist community, so that still is where we spend a good chunk of our time. But at this point, due to the expansion of the sales force, we are calling on more primary care physicians than we are in endocrinologists. Yes. So, I will start \u2013 thanks for the question, and welcome back. I will start with the CMS conversation. So certainly, we have the discussions. And that's a process that takes a little bit more time, but it is simple and that's where the significance of the basal population resides. And we are working with CMS to look at what that opportunity looks like. And so we will be making progress there over the course of the year. And as we have more and more information, we will certainly share it. In terms of the insurance coverage and the population on the commercial side, there are some insurance carriers that do cover it. It's a little sparse in between. There are some that folks kind of get access to it to it through some edits or forms around those lines around insulin use without look backs. And so there are folks that are getting access to it. However, it is very, very light penetration at this point in that space. And so \u2013 but those conversations are going. We are having the similar conversations that we talked about having with CMS. We are having those with commercial payers, and we will continue to have those over time because we have shown and certainly with our MOBILE study was an obvious game changer that people on CGM do better. And I think that the insurance companies as well as CMS are starting to see it. So, more updates to come over time as we get those coverages and we will share those, certainly those that are significant in the future. Thanks for the question, Frank. And I think you will see it in our prepared remarks, we do expect $15 million to $20 million of FX headwinds, but we kept our guide the same. And so the way to think about it is we think we can grow through that in the current period. And so as you do the math for the full year, if you include the impact, the incremental impacts of headwind versus a 15% to 20% guide, it's a 16% to 21% guide. So, that should give you some comfort that, yes, there are headwinds associated with currency. Yes, we do believe we can grow through it. And so a currency-adjusted growth rate certainly would reflect that. So, call it $15 million to $20 million on the year, but it doesn't change our full year guide."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and a-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Sean Christensen, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. You may begin.\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Aby, and welcome to Dexcom's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Our agenda begins with Kevin Sayer, Dexcom's Chairman, President, and CEO, who will summarize our recent highlights and ongoing strategic initiatives, followed by a financial review and outlook from Jereme Sylvain, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions. At that time, we ask analysts to limit themselves to one question so we can provide an opportunity for everyone participating today. Please note that there are also slides available related to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 performance on the Dexcom investor relations website on the Events and Presentations page. With that, let's review our safe harbor statement. Some of the statements we will make in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements.

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you everyone for joining us. 2023 was an incredible year for Dexcom, and I'd like to start by reviewing some of our key accomplishments. Total revenue grew by 24% on an organic basis, driven by another year of record customer starts. This translates into more than $700 million of organic revenue growth compared to last year as we built strong commercial momentum through recent coverage expansion and the performance of Dexcom's CGM systems. In 2023, we added over 600, 000 Dexcom users to our base and ended the year with approximately 2.3 million customers globally. Importantly, we delivered this level of growth again while enhancing scale and efficiency of our operations. The key milestone here was the opening of our Malaysia manufacturing facility around mid-year. Production at this site is ramping quickly, and the team is already delivering yields on par with our more established US facilities. This facility will help support our growth and cost ambitions for years to come. As a measure of our success for 2023, we not only generated $1 billion in Q4 revenue, we also delivered $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the year and generated record levels of free cash flow, which is up nearly 70% compared to 2022. By establishing a disciplined cost culture that focuses years in advance, we are striking the right balance of margin progression while still investing strategically in pathways to support our significant growth opportunities. From a strategic perspective, 2023 will go down as one of the most transformational years in our company's history. We launched G7 and Dexcom 1 into multiple new markets, significantly expanding our global access and advancing key technical and clinical work that will provide the foundation for the future of Dexcom. This started with the rollout of G7 in the US in February. G7 is the most accurate CGM ever launched, and the market's reception to G7 has been exceptional. Customers and clinicians have been thrilled with the new form factor, product performance, and ease of use, and payers wasted no time establishing coverage as they recognized the clear value proposition that G7 provides. We immediately started to see a change in prescribing patterns once this product reached the market, and this trend became even more pronounced as we completed the largest expansion of coverage in our company's history. In mid-April, Medicare coverage went live for people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only, as well as certain non-insulin using individuals with hypoglycemia risk. Between this decision and the broad commercial coverage that quickly followed for the basal markets, we have effectively doubled our reimbursed population in the US. This has completely changed the market landscape in the US. With broader coverage available and a new product that greatly simplifies the prescribing process, we have attracted a sizable new cohort of clinicians to our ecosystem. In fact, in 2023, we expanded our prescriber base by approximately 40%. And we're not stopping there. We have always known that the primary care channel would become increasingly important as our business evolves. Much of the work our commercial team has done in recent years has been tailored to this market. And we are now seeing the direct result of that effort as more than 70% of our new scripts are being written by primary care physicians. These relationships are not only critical to help us reach the millions of insulin-using individuals who have not yet started on CGM, but also the tens of millions with broader type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, and beyond. Based on the success of our team in 2023 and the magnitude of these future opportunities, we are excited to continue our investment in our U.S. salesforce this year. When we have a presence with prescribers, we win. Now it is up to us to continue to expand that prescriber pool. We are already seeing more clinicians want to incorporate Dexcom CGM earlier into patients' care plans as they recognize our unique ability to drive behavior change, sustainable outcomes, and greater accountability. This is why we are thrilled to be introducing our newest product, Stelo, later this summer. Stelo will be the first CGM designed specifically for people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin. Leveraging our leading sensor platform, we have built a custom software experience that is tailored to the needs of this population. Stelo will feature a 15-day wear time and launch as a cash paid product while we build our case with payers for broader coverage. With several trials currently underway, we will continue to add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating Dexcom's unique ability to drive greater health and economic outcomes for all people with diabetes. The launch of Stelo also presents a great opportunity to bolster our evidence with a large collection of real world data as we see the impact this product is having on our customers. We filed Stelo with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, leaving us well on track for our highly anticipated launch this summer. As our product portfolio continues to grow, it provides a greater glimpse into the future potential of our company. We have built a platform technology that we can customize to provide creative solutions for different populations. Our redesigned software infrastructure is a key component to this as it enables much quicker iteration and greater connectivity. Connectivity has always been a distinct advantage for Dexcom and with our recent filing of direct to watch with the FDA and new G7 pump integrations, we are further advancing this leadership position. We will also continue innovating on our hardware technology with our current efforts focused on launching an extended wear sensor across all of our product offerings. As we look at this significant opportunity ahead of us, we are as excited as we've ever been. As I said at our Investor Day this past summer, we are just getting started. With that, I will now turn it over to Jereme for a view of the fourth quarter financials. Jereme?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $1.035 billion compared to $815 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27% on a reported basis and 26% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $769 million for the fourth quarter compared to $606 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27%. Between the ongoing success of G7 and our significantly improved access in recent months, the momentum in our U.S. business continues to grow. In fact, we delivered our fastest quarterly U.S. growth rate since the beginning of 2021 as our revenue accelerated for the third quarter in a row. International revenue grew 27%, totaling $265 million in the fourth quarter. International organic revenue growth was 23% for the fourth quarter. We continued to execute very well across our international footprint and again took share in Q4 as our global access work and product portfolio strategy have helped broaden our reach in many markets. Our fourth quarter gross profit was $664 million or 64.2% of revenue compared to 66.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. This year-over-year decline in gross margin was expected as G7 was a much larger percent of our product and customer mix in Q4 compared to a year ago. As a reminder, G7 has a higher cost profile than G6 today, but we expect this to change in the coming quarters as we drive greater volume through our G7 lines. As it reaches scale, we continue to expect G7's margin profile to improve upon that of our G6 platform. Operating expenses were $421 million for Q4 2023 compared to $372 million in Q4 of 2022. This quarter was another demonstration of our commitment to being disciplined and thoughtful with our spend. Our operating expenses grew at half the rate of revenue this quarter and we delivered nearly 500 basis points of operating expense leverage compared to last year. This extended our streak to eight straight quarters of at least 250 basis points of year over year OpEx leverage. Operating income was $242.7 million or 23.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $172.1 million or 21.1% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million or 31.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $237.1 million or 29.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income for the third quarter was $202.8 million or $0.50 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the year with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Having financial flexibility allows the organization to take advantage of opportunities. Case in point, we executed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program mentioned on our Q3 results. Through this transaction, we were able to offset the remaining dilution related to our maturing 2023 converts while purchasing our stock at what we viewed as an attractive price. As Kevin mentioned earlier, our free cash flow grew by 70% in 2023 as our business continues to scale and become more efficient. As our cash flow profile continues to grow, it only adds to our significant financial flexibility. This allows us to continue to invest behind our meaningful organic growth opportunity while assessing strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis. Turning to 2024 guidance, as we stated last month, we anticipate total revenue to be in the range of $4.15 billion to 4.35 billion, representing organic growth of 16% to 21% for the year. This guidance assumed continued momentum in the type 2 basal only population in the US, the expansion of Dexcom ONE on the G7 platform into new geographies, and the launch of Stelo in the summer of 2024. It also assumes the divestiture of our non-diabetes distribution business in Australia and New Zealand this quarter, which represented around $30 million of revenue in 2023. From a margin perspective, we expect full year non-GAAP gross profit margin to be in a range of 63% to 64%, operating profit margin to be approximately 20%, and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 29%. Our gross margin guidance reflects the ongoing conversion from G6 to G7 within our customer base and the associated scale that comes with that process. Below gross margin, we'll continue to be very diligent with our spend in 2024 while investing strategically behind multiple growth opportunities. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Jereme. I would now like to open up the call for Q &A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time, and then re-enter the queue if necessary. Abby, please provide the Q &A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. I'll offer up for the second time. Congrats on a really good quarter. I wanted to tie two ideas together. The first is the great operating margins we saw in the fourth quarter. It came in well above the street. In the slide deck presentation, you have the slide about making progress on the 15-day sensor. The question here is really, one, any updates on the timeframe of when that G-Series 15-day sensor will be approved, and how to really think about where that could take the good operating margins you put up here and what you've guided for next year and where that could really take it in the future. Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Robbie. This is Kevin. I'll take the 15-day sensor timing, and then Jereme can talk about the numbers and the effect on operating margins going forward. As we said earlier this year, we're in the middle of clinical testing and scientific evaluation of some fundamental science changes to the sensor that will make it more reliable for that 15-day period. One of the reasons that we've done so well, two things, the accuracy of our sensor and the performance of our sensor over time. But combined with the fact, people expect to get a certain amount of days from a sensor and we deliver what we tell them we're going to do. And we want to make sure that 15-day experience is every bit as good as the 10-day experience that we offer now. So we're making a few slight changes on a science basis. We'll run a clinical study, file that, and we certainly would expect you to prove. But right now, we're still evaluating some of the technologies. And we really won't provide a lot of color until we're filed and we see we're on a path towards approval.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, and then to your question, longer term on operating margins. We've done a really nice job to date, creating leverage and opportunities within our operating margin profile. And despite some of the moves and the channel mix changes we've made on the top line; we've been able to maintain a gross margin based on a lot of the work we've done around design to value and a lot of the scale that we've been able to achieve. But when you think about 15-day, it provides a real big opportunity for us to think about, both leverage from a gross margin and then operating margin profile, but also opportunities to grow the business in areas profitably that maybe would be a little bit more of a challenge with the 10-day product. So it is absolutely the number one effort going on in the organization. It does provide us lots of flexibility to either a, continue to grow the business or b, deliver operating margins that can be world-class over time. So I think longer term there's a lot of opportunities there, we are not ready to particularly lay what that is. We've obviously given our 2025 LRP and we'll execute to that, but I do think it provides real long-term opportunities for this company to deliver back to shareholders and take advantage of opportunities globally.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong end to the year. It's great to see. I'm going to ask this question about; we're hearing more about potential competition coming to market. And I would just love, Kevin, if maybe you could highlight for us the competitive modes that Dexcom has built. Obviously, we don't know much about what this competitor is planning to bring to market. So, but maybe if you could just highlight where you think Dexcom is from a competition perspective and how defensible your share is here? Thanks so much.\nKevin Sayer: No, I appreciate that question. First and foremost, we can start with the core technology and then the fundamental beliefs we've had here as a company. The performance of our sensors has been unparalleled. We've got over many years, for example, and AID systems with great outcomes and patients who have done very well there. We built our platforms on connectivity. One of the features that I've talked with the engineers about and kind of complained about because it took a lot of time to engineer, we can connect up to three devices at the same time. This is the type of connectivity that our competitors have not put into their platforms, and is a feature that's very important to our patients, which is the reason, for example, why we just filed our direct-to-watch features with the FDA. One of the other things our competition thinks about as they look at us today, and they think this is where we're going to stay, we're not. We certainly have new pipeline efforts across all fronts on the technology side, better connectivity, communications, software investments. We've had to evolve from being literally a medical device software company to being a world-class software organization over the past couple of years, and it has been an evolution for us, and it's been a big investment. So we've looked at the areas to invest to make ourselves stronger and made investments there. Now that's on the technology side. Here's the other piece of this. We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past three years getting fully automated factories up and running both here in the United States and our new factory in Malaysia that opened mid-year, and that is a tremendous facility. But we built out those automated lines there, and we've just turned ground on what will be our next world-class factory over in Ireland that would open in 2026. There's a huge investment that has to be made to play in the CGM business going forward, particularly at the scale and the performance that we see now. And we've made those investments and done those things and evolved as a company. So we think we're very well positioned, and we'll see where everybody else comes. But we're comfortable. Well, let me phrase that. We're never comfortable, but we believe we've done all the right things.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on Stelo. You expect this product to add approximately, I think, 100 basis points to your growth in \u201824, which is almost $40 million in six months. So that's a pretty healthy number for only half a year. Kevin, what's informing your confidence in the launch? How big could this product be over time and what are the margin implications? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: Larry, thanks for the question and we have guided at 1%. The purpose of this launch is to get this product out here and learn. And as we look at that 1% of revenue number, we certainly have models to build and support that and we believe in designing this product for the type 2 non-insulin user and others that we're targeting the right segment to go after that. Our most important experience with Stelo is learning and getting it out there and starting to develop and grow this new market. We're confident that this product over time can become a very, very large portion of our business and this can be a very large segment within our markets. This year's launch is all about learning more than anything else and we have a model for that 1%. I would love to exceed it, but if we learn all the lessons that we need to learn, this is not a backbreaker for our company and our guidance either. So the most important thing is to get the product out there and to learn more than anything else.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, and then to your question on margin, we're not necessarily talking about it from a gross margin perspective. That'll come in time when we start to release more details around it, Larry. From an operating margin, yes, this is something we're going to invest in. And so when you think about it from an overall company margin, certainly as we invest in this and we invest in launching it, there will be some sales and marketing, but it's an investment we're going to make this year. And we're going to make that investment in this product because we believe in the future and we're going to do so and still expand operating margins as a company. So you can be safe that we're going to be very, very careful and measured about how we invest our dollars, but know that this is part of the investments we've set aside as an organization while still again improving profitability.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Mathew Blackman with Stifel.\nMathew Blackman: Oh, great. Appreciate you taking my question. And maybe for Kevin and Jereme, you obviously mentioned Salesforce and the PCP channel. Can you just remind us at least today what kind of PCP, Salesforce coverage you have? And then more importantly, sort of leaning into your comments, Kevin, about investing incrementally in that channel this year. What does that mean in terms of spend magnitude, spend timing? And how much more coverage you're expecting to add with these investments or any other way to frame what you're trying to accomplish? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So thanks for the question, Matt. So you think about the investment, we are going to expand that Salesforce. And today we have a good amount of coverage. It's tens of thousands of primary care physicians and predominantly the entirety of the endocrinologist space. But as you start to think about basal coverage expanding, the opportunity ahead of us certainly Stelo out on the horizon. We found there was an opportunity to continue to expand. And as we know, CGM, specifically Dexcom CGM can play a very important role in how folks manage their diabetes. We know that having those call points is helpful. So we are going to expand it. You can take a look at LinkedIn for the amount. There are quite a few openings out there in terms of the size of it. So we'll expand our salesforce and we will get more coverage. In terms of the cadence, the LinkedIn wrecks are out there right now. So you'll see us hire over the course of the first quarter. Obviously, then the fully loaded burden associated with those reps will take place over the back half of the year. So Q2s through Q4. So that's how to think about the cadence of that. But again, that's all contemplated in the overall guidance we've provided, the 20% operating margin. So expect it as part of typical work that we do around creating leverage in the business and investing where we need to. But if you're thinking about it for a cadence over the course of the year, expect the hires to be made over the course of the first quarter. And then for folks to ramp up and be part of our run, really Q2 through the balance of the year.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Marie Thibault with BTIG.\nMarie Thibault: Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question here on international. I think you've reminded us that you'll be selling a non-CGM business in Australia and also going direct in Japan. I wanted to understand the cadence for Q1 versus the rest of the year. And also any sort of comments you could make on G7 being on the Dexcom ONE platform, just an all-around international question there.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Thanks, Marie. And we'll give you some context. So the non-CGM business, that effectively is gone at this point. So that's why we've been comfortable pulling it out and talking about it to organic. So this quarter you can expect, we talked about the $30-ish million last year. The math on that, you can kind of do the allocation by quarter. That's out as of this point, for the most part. And so think about that in the quarter. Japan, certainly a similar type thing. We talked about it in Q4 being effectively nil. I'd expect a similar contribution in the first quarter. And then as we start to take that book of business so that business live in the second quarter, I expect it to start to contribute as we build that business back up over the course of the year. So those are really the international kind of timing. So Q1 will be the heaviest burden in terms of as we transition through that. As it pertains to Dexcom ONE on G7, great news is, I think we press release it a couple days ago, four countries have launched. And so that has come out, it is now out there today. Those four countries are our first foray and we're getting great feedback from early adopters within those countries. The expectation is we have a cadence of launches of Dexcom ONE on a G7 form factor, really over the course of the year. So I'd expect a lot more press releases around where and when we're launching that, but expect that to really take place over the course of the year, which gives us a lot of confidence again in Dexcom ONE being a really incredible growth driver for the long term.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Maybe I'll just keep it on that international point. I think this is the first quarter in a while we've seen international growth below the US growth. And if I look back the last few quarters, I think you've gone 40, 30, 23 here on the organic growth rate. Just help us understand kind of where that international versus US growth might settle out here in 2024. Would we expect them to be similar to each other? Does international continue to slow for any reason? And as I think about some of the competitive AID approvals that have happened over in Europe, especially with one year with a competitive CGM. Just how are you thinking about the stability of your maybe installed base on the AID side over there versus win rate for new AID systems there? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Okay, thanks, Jeff. So as you think about the cadence, so thanks to the question on international, as you think about the cadence over the course of the year, certainly Q4 was buoyed by a few different or weighed down, I guess, and say by a few different things. We talked a little bit about earlier about the Japan business and really the revenues were effectively nil as we make that transition. And so that's a negative grower in the quarter. And then, the non-diabetes business is was really a flat. And so when you think about the business being historically a pretty significant grower, those pull you down as you start to exclude those things, we are still growing quite well. In fact, all of the core businesses where we operate today, UK, Germany, Australia, et cetera, all continue to grow relatively consistently between Q2, Q3, Q4. There are some ebbs and flows, but for the most part, those all should do well. So then you think about what does that mean going forward? We haven't changed our stance that the o-US business, the international business, as a percentage of revenue by the end of 2025 will be bigger than it is today. And about two thirds, one third, or that split today is more like 70:30 or 72:28. So I think on the whole, expect the international business with all of the opportunity out there with certainly the under penetration we have today to grow faster than that of the US business over the coming. That's not to say that we're not incredibly bullish on the U.S. business. Look, if we can outperform on both of those, we'll do the work on both. But at least that's in our LRP. As you think about competitive systems and AID, we are highly confident in what we have to offer. Our product there's multiple different reasons why we believe our product is special in that space. Kevin alluded to a little bit about it earlier around Bluetooth connectivity as one. I'll just give you an example there. Someone can be on a pump can talk to their phone and can be on a direct-to-watch application all while on our product. No one else can offer that. We are the only one that can do that. And as you think about this population which really needs and deserves quite frankly the technology to manage their diabetes, we believe that that is a differentiator and a meaningful differentiator going forward. Add to that the many and many of years that we're compiling on these systems. We feel highly confident that when we sit in front of a physician, and we sit in front of an endocrinologist and we sit in front of a parent a child that needs an AID system we feel confident that we are the choice. We'll continue to battle and make sure that that message continues to go out there but as we think about that international book of business, we continue to feel very confident even post-launch of a competitive system we'll do incredibly well there.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could update us on the cadence of data that we could expect to see this year not only around you mentioned before GLP-1 data that could come from you or from investigators and then also on Stelo. Are we going to see anything on that at upcoming conferences or from you before during or after the launch?\nKevin Sayer: Now this Kevin I'll take that we don't really, we don't need a clinical trial for Stelo as far as getting that product approved. There is a lot of data on use of continuous glucose monitoring, particularly Dexcom systems in this type 2 diabetes world that will be published by investigators over the course of the next several months, and we'll reference to that and we'll talk to you about that. We know, we have a very good idea where this data comes out because we've seen in all our studies, patients have better outcomes, they're healthier, we end up saving the system money, and those are the outcomes that we're hoping to drive with Stelo over time. With respect to GLP-1s, again, the list of studies ongoing is very large, and there are studies where CGM is an element. Again, we expect those studies when they're published to demonstrate the same things that we've talked about before, that the use of the CGM with the GLP-1 provides a better result than a study without it, and those studies we've published over time, we don't control those investigators, but we expect good data over the course of the year.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for the question. I just wanted to understand a little bit more, Kevin, that you could give some more clarity on how you think a reimbursement pathway for Stelo to look over the next couple of years, what you think is needed to open reimbursement up for that product, and how you think that would look if it would be done kind of in a more traditional way, or you think it would be done kind of a one -off, like the levels program with UnitedHealthcare.\nKevin Sayer: Our goal is to do this in a more traditional way over time. As we've said earlier, we'll launch the product as a cash pay product and have a cash pay option, a cash pay that people can get into and purchase the product. We will accumulate data from those users over time. We'll accumulate data, again, from the clinical trials that we see out there, and ultimately build a case for reimbursement for this product. I think over time, we certainly expect to go to CMS and have people with type 2 diabetes who are not insulin-covered at some point in time by that group, because, again, our goal is to spend less money in the healthcare system, and we're one of the few technologies that enables an outcome of that nature. So we see it being more traditional and working with payers and the various government agencies over time. The programs we will continue to support, we're happy to support them and be partners with them. But I think over time, we need a more traditional reimbursement path, and that can be -- the partnerships and the relationships can be the only way. On top of that, we'll continue to develop our tools around Stelo. This first generation that we launch is going to be our first-pass app. We will have numerous iterations over the course of the first 24 months of that product that really make it a much more inviting and engaging product and lead people to better experiences. So stay tuned for what we have to say on that front over the next 12 months. It's going to be very exciting.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citigroup.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon, and nice quarter. A couple of questions, queue are really boring. Can you give us the guidance for tax and how to think about net interest expense? And then the one that strikes me as somewhat more interesting is I think your LRP is for 21% operating margins. And this is the second quarter in a row where you bypassed that number. So why is 21% still the right number to be had? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes, so we'll start with tax. I think this year we kind of dropped down to closer to that 26% range. Well, we don't necessarily guide year by year to tax. The goal is over the course of the next three to five years to get down into the low 20s. So I would expect it to continue to come down every year as we grow into the tax structure that we put in place. In terms of net interest income, some of that, it's one of those, it's a bit of a difficult one, but just given where interest rate is going to go over time, but it's pretty straightforward that our cash interest cost is pretty low, just given our converts. And so you can basically take a look at the cash on the balance sheet, multiply it by about 4%. And that gets you to about where you'd be for the year. Again, we'll have to keep you updated as interest rates change over time. But that's the way to think about it. And then from an operating margin perspective, we gave the 2025 LRP, that's a 21%. Your point is valid. If you take a look at our guide this year at 20% in our gross margin of 63% to 64%, if we hold true to our 65% gross margin in 2025, which is absolutely our belief, you're already there at a 21% off margin. So I absolutely understand the mathematics. It just means we're ahead. We're ahead of our LRP, but we're not necessarily willing to update it at this point. We'll come forward and we'll update it at some point in the future. But I think it's a good thing. We've done a lot of work around this, Joanne, around getting lean and making sure we drive leverage into the business. And the great news is, is we are ahead. And so that's a good spot to be in. And we'll continue to do so. One other maybe caveat is that I think it's important to note on the year I guess the question a little bit about the year and where we on the year. We're making some good investments this year in the organization, we're launching Stelo. And we talked about that being a significant investment in the business. We're certainly doing a lot of work around our salesforce and if you recall few years ago, we did some work around that we took step back on march, we are going to do all that and still step forward. We're going to go direct in Japan this year. That's another thing that we're making an investment in and then all the work Kevin referenced around the clinical work that we're doing around continuing to improve our product. We're going to make all those investments and still deliver an expansion of operating margin. So I think it just goes to show you we're building the levers in here that you can see that we're building and that you can rely on us longer term to continue to drive that through the business.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Looking at the domestic performance. There's been a clear acceleration in the back half of \u201823 on a two year stacked basis. And I'm wondering specifically if that's just basal that's helping there. It looks like it's as much as 200, maybe 250 basis points of the acceleration. Is that the primary contributor to the domestic acceleration? What should we think about in terms of basal contribution to the top line this year? And are we inflecting right now as far as basal adoption goes with CGM here in the States? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, that's a good question. Let me maybe just give some color as to how we're thinking about the guidance. As you see the performance in the back half of the year, a lot of that has to do with being the most accurate sensor, launching with a G7 form factor, and then of course having the basal coverage there. And so when you think about it, and you can see the share taking when you look at script data, we are taking share and having the sensor, the most advanced sensor on the market is the driver there. So that's taking share. Now within those spaces, basal is a contributor, no question. As that category expands and we take share within that category, that does contribute to the overall numbers. And so you are right, basal is a contributor, but it has as much to do with us taking share as it does with category expansion. So think about both of those as contributors. As you think about 2024, we've talked a little bit about the adoption rate, basal in total, adopting in the back half of the year around 9% to 10% per year on a per annum basis. The guide assumes about 8% there. And so, I think you can assume that was the case. Our long range plan was more like 6% to 7% per year. So we are seeing basal going faster than what was in our long range plan. And what's great about that is as we continue to take share and the category grows a little faster than expected, that will help contribute over the longer haul. So hopefully that gives you some context to how we're seeing basal. It absolutely is a contributor. I don't want to overstate the fact though that basal because quite frankly, our intensive insulin businesses continue to do really, really well. And you see us taking share there as well.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, I just add to Jereme's comments, Matt, if you look at the second half of the year, that's when G7 rolled out. There's a direct correlation to G7 launching and the acceleration of our growth. It really was an important event. And the other thing that just as a consequence of what you saw, again, this supports what we're doing in the U.S. with respect to our field sales expansion. We do need to spend more time with physicians who aren't as familiar with our technology as they would have been in the past. As I said on the call earlier, where we call on somebody, we win. We do very well. So we need more calls. We needed more feet on the street and more voice, given the acceleration that we saw and the good things that we saw happen over the second half of the year. So it all flows together nicely.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Malgaret Andrew with William Blair.\nMalgaret Andrew: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to maybe spin back to non-insulin. When we kind of run our market models, non-insulin adoption seems to have meaningfully increased probably for you as well it's certainly for the market the last couple of years. And again, our numbers probably aren't perfect, but maybe the market's not at a million users in the U.S. but could get there this year. That's a pretty sizable amount. So I guess one, are this meaningful patient adds to Dexcom already in 2023 and what drove that? And going back to the Stelo guidance of $40 million per year, we can obviously throw some assumptions around ASPs or patient adds. But regardless of what those inputs can be, it pretty quickly gets you to $200 million plus sales in 2025, which is a pretty meaningful chunk of the chain. So I guess, is that correct? Why could it be right or wrong and how much of that could be incremental to the initial LRP that you provided in \u201823. Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Jereme can probably get into more detail than me. It is a part of our business today, Malgaret. We do have some non-insulin users. Our product, we have some plans that actually cover non-insulin users for CGM, and we've seen and had wonderful experiences there. We've also have not an aggressive cash pay program, but a cash pay program nonetheless where non-insulin users have access to our product through some very traditional distribution channels outside the pharmacy and outside traditional DME. So some of those individuals have purchased CGM and use it on the non-insulin front as well, and we continue to support programs. But it is not a remarkable chunk of our business. It has not been a tremendous driver of our growth. It has grown, but it hasn't been a significant percentage. As we look going forward, certainly again, we gave guidance of 1% for 2024. And we're committed to that and that certainly is our forecast and what we've guided. We're most committed to learning because what we're really interested in is a number like $200 million like you're talking about for 2025 and to be positioned with the right product there. With respect to pricing and how offer that product we're going to have tremendous flexibility as this is a cash pay program. And it's not labeled for the current population where we have reimbursement and where we're reimbursed for our products. So we believe we'll have again flexibility to grow that and grow it profitably is again we have a 15-day product going into that market. So we will have lower COGS and we're developing a lot of things around that that is a roll out as you see we really are changing the business model to serve this type of individual versus those we've served up to this point in time. We're going to offer a different experience that will definitely meet their needs across the board. So we're bullish on it over time. I mean it could be very big number in 2025. That's what we're -- that's what we're planning on.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon. Excuse me. Just on gross margin. I think we came in the last year thinking gross margin would be lower in the second half. It wasn't. I'm guessing revenue levels play a part there. But outside of price and mix what weighs on gross margin in \u201924? And then just the related question, you had some encouraging comments on Malaysia and I think you alluded to it. But at what point do we see Malaysia and G7 starting to have a positive impact on gross margin.\nJereme Sylvain: Hey Jayson. Yes, thanks for the question. Last year when we made the assumption on what the margin look like, the assumption was is the G6 to G7 transition. We had a range of assumptions. But the assumption was the G6 to G7 transition would take place perhaps a little bit earlier. And some of that had to do with timing of when the AID systems were available in the market and coverage and how that that goes over time. And so it took a little bit longer. And as a result, we outperformed on margin and it gets back to G6 cost less to make the G7 today. And it\u2019s still majority of our user, our legacy base still sits on the G6 system. With the launch of Tandem and Control-IQ integrated with G7 and obviously the limited launch with the Omnipod 5 coming out here in the back half of Q1, and then obviously a launch sometime later in the year, we do believe that base starts to move over quicker. And so what you have there is as that takes place, Jayson, you have that shift from a lower cost to a higher cost product weighing in the start of the year. And hence that's why the margin goes where it goes. Now in the back half of the year, assuming that base transitions and our models show that over the course of the year that should, that equilibrium should balance then tilt in the favor of G7. It puts us in a position exiting the year where G7 should be and we'll have to give you updates on the base as the year progresses, but it should be lower than G6, but then at that point it should be accretive. And that would be the exit rate leading out of \u201824. And then of course, then bodes well as we move into 2025 and beyond. So that's the big driver. It's just, when does that base transition and when it does, when do we have that cost kind of equilibrium? So again, we thought it was going to happen in the back half in 2023. It didn't take place. We outperformed there in 2023 as a result, probably going to take place here in the first half of 2024.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity.\nBill Plovanic: Great, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. Just kind of a follow-up, just trying to get a color granularity, if possible, on, as you look at the growth in the business and kind of the Matt O'Brien's question, but the contribution from Basal, Hypo, Intensive and Type 1, just, is it kind of shifting to that order these days where it's more of the Basal and Hypo and the Intensive Type II is really the new patient growth, and then if so, how should we think about that cadence as you continue to move forward? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. I mean, if you think about 2024, at least, 2024, the main contributor to new patients, or at least revenue from new patients, is still going to sit in the intensive insulin. So the type 1 and the type 2 insulin-intensive patients, and that still is where the combination of those two makes up a majority of the new revenue over the course of the year. Basal is catching up, and Basal doing a nice job of catching up, but those are still part of our core business, and it's still actually driving the underlying business. Now, over time, we do expect basal, given it's a larger population, to do very, very well. We'll have to give you more of an update as we get into 2025 and beyond as we get closer to that. So incredibly bullish on the long-term opportunity there with basal. But think about at least 2024. Our core business is actually still driving a lot of the growth with obviously longer-term opportunities in basal and then to your point Hypo which is quite frankly still a low contributor and then with Stelo kind of coming online as well. All of those are real opportunities in 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research.\nMichael Polark: Good afternoon, thank you. I want to ask a follow-up on Kevin your response to the prior question on 15-day and timing. I heard we won't provide a lot of color until we're filed and see a path to approval. There kind of had been, it seemed like there was a thought that Stelo was kind of the appetizer this year for 15-day and maybe a broader rollout in 2025 and I don't want to, I'm not asking you to pin down timing but is 2025 a year where a broader transition to 15-day could be affected or might all this testing and innovation take a little longer?\nKevin Sayer: We would like to go as fast as possible. If it were on my time frame it'd be it'd be yesterday. Stelo at 15-day is a primer for that so we can learn and gather data from those users as they use it particularly with our current sensor configuration. As we go through the technology changes that we're making as we dial in on those features that we're going to put in the final product we'll get a pivotal trial started and we'll go but we're learning each and every day. We are not in a position like we were with G7 where we're submitting an entire new system with completely new hardware and new features and new manufacturing lines, new suppliers, new everything. This 15-day product we've built on the same platform our current G7 has built. So the time from finishing a pivotal to filing is not going to be near as intense and difficult as it was with the last product being such as security and Bluetooth and stuff. We worked through all those issues already. So right now it's really refining the science and getting the 15 days and getting that reliability and quality level that our patients expect from us. We don't view this as an extremely, I think \u201825 is a reasonable assumption, but I'm not going to give you an end date or as to when, because there's too many variables, but we're certainly headed down a path along that type of speed, and then we'll see where we land and give you more updates along the way. I just, filing things or starting things, what's important to us is getting things done, and those should be your milestones as well. So we'll keep you posted, but that's where we are.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Chris Pasquale with Nephron.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks, and congrats on the quarter. I want to ask a couple of questions about Dexcom ONE and the progress there. I think you had said you expected it to account for about 30% of international new patient starts in \u201823. Curious if that's where you ended up and what portion of new patient starts you expected to be in \u201824.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure, Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, we did, we thought it was going to be about a third of patient starts in 2023 outside the US. It was closer to about a quarter of new patient starts, so a little bit behind there. Some of the tenders took a little bit more time to get on, and so it was still a really good year for us, but a little bit behind, where we had started the year, at least in the expectations. This year, we expect it to be more and a bigger contributor as a percentage. So if you think about last year, that was certainly the case that was on the G6 form factor, very excited about obviously coming out here on the G7 form factor here in 2024 and the four countries that we are to launch in. So our expectation is it's a bigger percentage while we haven't necessarily given that number, expect it to be bigger and the team wants it to be bigger as a percentage of new patients outside the US in 2024.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask a follow-up on the type 2 hypo, not it's on hypo indication, does have coverage. We didn't think you would, it would move as fast as type 2 basal, but I think you guys talked about a bigger patient opportunity in the US than the type 2 basal patient opportunity. Anything that's been a bottleneck in terms of penetrating that indication and just how do you see a deeper penetration going forward \u201824, \u201825, \u201926. Thanks a lot.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, thanks, Josh. It's an area that in all candor it's gone and we knew this was going to be a bit of a challenge. It's a big opportunity, but it's going to take a little bit more time on awareness and getting in front of physicians and letting folks know that, hey, look, if you've had a hypo event, you do qualify. And by the way, here's how to document it. So it has been certainly slower than basal. It's not been a real all that material contributor in 2023. What we do know, however, is Teri, our Chief Commercial Officer and her team are very, very focused in getting the word out and making sure that folks understand if they are suffering with hypo events, this technology can help and it can help change that and that they do qualify and there is reimbursement out there. And so it's working on that messaging and making sure that we get out there and understand where those events are taking place. That is, believe it or not, it is a challenge in understanding how to identify when those have taken place so that we can get out in front of those folks. But we are working on it. We have good data around that. And then making sure, we're making those physicians that are then serving those patients aware of what the requirements are for documentation so that they can qualify for reimbursement. So there's some work to be done, but there's a team working very, very intently on it and making sure that we do arm our salesforce and then arm the community with the information needed to help it grow faster. I think it's a big opportunity for us, but I think it's an opportunity that's going to take a little bit longer to penetrate. So to your point, I think it's a driver a little bit here in 2024, certainly an opportunity in 2024, but I think it's going to continue to slow roll, but over the longer haul, we do think this is a contributor over time that can be meaningful.\nKevin Sayer: I just add to that it feeds to the salesforce investment we're making in the States. We need to educate physicians and patients. And once you get a population of people who have positive outcomes in this space and they go back to their doctors and those conversations start taking place, this becomes easier, but there's a lot of seeding that we have to do to do it and we needed more, more feet on the street to do that.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners.\nMike Kratky: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. One clarifying one on basal. You've previously talked about framing the penetration within basal population relative to the trajectory you saw in insulin intensive type 2 patients. How would you characterize that comparison based on where you are today and also as you're looking out over the next few years?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure, yes. So in our long-term guide, we had talked about basal effectively being about six to seven points of adoption as a percentage of the total population here in the US. And I'll start with the US because internationally, there's a coverage as we work through coverage there, there's opportunities. But we had talked about that in our 2025 LRP. In our first couple of quarters, we saw it mirror that to your question, to your point, I should say, that it was mirroring the type 2 intensive, which was about a 9% to 10% penetration rate. Our guide, at least for 2024, assumes the middle between those two, 8%. We got a couple quarters under our belt. It's very, very positive. But we also want to make sure we're prudent when it comes to guidance. And so that's why we've assumed about an 8% penetration rate over the course of 2024. Obviously, if it mirrors that, which we saw in the back half of 2023, there's opportunities to outperform. And clearly, we're tracking ahead of our LRP, which I think is both positive signals, I think, for the business in total. But we, again, our guidance has been 8% as a percent of penetration. Hopefully that helps you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. Good evening, guys. Kevin, you mentioned, to an earlier question, different business models for Stelo. How should we think what the go-to-market could look like? Does it have a Dexcom ONE more direct-to-patient feel? And do you need to make any significant investments in back office support as the denominator really expands as you go after this large non-insulin group?\nKevin Sayer: That is a great question. And that is a very, very pertinent topic of discussion and meeting here within the walls of our company. We are very much evaluating very efficient ways to serve such a large patient group, had a patient group that may interact differently with us than those who've been on insulin over time as we build those models out. So we're looking at distribution models that appear different than what we're doing today, so we can most efficiently get that product to people. And again, starting with cash pay gives us some opportunities to do things a little different than we've done in the past. And so you'll have to stay tuned for that. It's a very thoughtful question and very much in line with everything that's going on here every day.\nOperator: And we will take our final question from Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatt Miksic: Hi, great. Thanks so much for fitting in. So one follow-up on margins and kind of mix as you drive G7 to be a bigger part of your business. You mentioned before, I think we understand the ramping G7 volumes improving gross, large, and profitability of that product line over time. Just wondering if you could share maybe how we should think about the long term. Like in other words, G7 is more profitable now. I mean G6 more profitable now, rather just maturity of those lines so G7 exceed that. Does Stelo trail G7? Does Dexcom ONE with G7 kind of trail that maybe, just some sense directionally of where those are headed over the intermediate and long term would be super helpful as you drive these volumes up. Thanks so much.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, so maybe what I'll talk about is how we're thinking about the cost of the product. And then I think from there we can kind of make some calls on how we think about margin from that perspective. And I'll maybe comment a little bit on the on the service model, which I think is also important because that'll help from the operating margin. So as you think about the G7, just the product itself, as of today, it costs more than G6. And so that'll eventually we expect over the course of this year flip. And as you kind of get your models kind of bent out into kind of laid out, we expect to get down to a $10 sensor, irrespective of whether it's 10 or 15 days as we exit the 2025 LRP into early 2026. So that gives you some kind of feel for where we'll get to the cost of each sensor. Now, each sensor, the hardware is about the same cost, whether it's Stelo, whether it's Dexcom ONE, or whether it's the G-Series. It's the support models, the software, the support, the R&D, the investment in it. And then of course the service models that ultimately then change it. And so as you think about all of the work that we put into the G-Series, the G -Series will have the highest reimbursement, but it'll also have the highest service model and then most investment in software and otherwise. Dexcom ONE is a little bit more of a different service model, and thus we are able to reduce the burden associated with some of the warranty and then the support cost that play into that. And then Stelo is in a 15-day form factor. And so that's helpful from a gross margin perspective as you think through that over time. So I think that's the way to think about the cost profile. We haven't launched the price of Stelo at this point, so we can't necessarily give you the specific margin at this point. Otherwise, it'd be pretty obvious how we're thinking about it. But over time, as that comes out, I think it'll help align the models. And I think there's real opportunities here as you think about a 15-day product starting with Stelo, but as that then makes its way through Dexcom ONE and the G-Series over time, again, more levers there where there's some real opportunities in those product lines to continue to drive profitability. So I think there's levers across all of these. I hope that gives you some context. I realize I'm not giving you a P&L for each one of them, but at least it gives you some context at the hardware costs, and we differentiate on the OpEx costs and service models, and then, of course, the days of wear on each one.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Sayer for closing remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you very much. It's very easy during these earnings calls to talk about percentages and margins and future technologies, financial guidance, competitors, a whole host of important and engaging topics. But as we wrap up today, I really want to focus on 2023, which is truly the most remarkable year in our history. Let's review these numbers again. $700 million in organic revenue growth, more than a $1 billion in EBITDA, 600, 000 new customers in our active user base, standing up a plant in Asia without missing a beat, and, of course, launching our G7 product all over the world. While best-in-class technology is foundational and fundamental to these types of accomplishment, it doesn't happen without exceptional people going above and beyond. So as we close out 2023, I want to thank our, I guess we are, we're now more than 10, 000 Dexcom employees around the world. Incredibly well done. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you everyone for joining us. 2023 was an incredible year for Dexcom, and I'd like to start by reviewing some of our key accomplishments. Total revenue grew by 24% on an organic basis, driven by another year of record customer starts. This translates into more than $700 million of organic revenue growth compared to last year as we built strong commercial momentum through recent coverage expansion and the performance of Dexcom's CGM systems. In 2023, we added over 600, 000 Dexcom users to our base and ended the year with approximately 2.3 million customers globally. Importantly, we delivered this level of growth again while enhancing scale and efficiency of our operations. The key milestone here was the opening of our Malaysia manufacturing facility around mid-year. Production at this site is ramping quickly, and the team is already delivering yields on par with our more established US facilities. This facility will help support our growth and cost ambitions for years to come. As a measure of our success for 2023, we not only generated $1 billion in Q4 revenue, we also delivered $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the year and generated record levels of free cash flow, which is up nearly 70% compared to 2022. By establishing a disciplined cost culture that focuses years in advance, we are striking the right balance of margin progression while still investing strategically in pathways to support our significant growth opportunities. From a strategic perspective, 2023 will go down as one of the most transformational years in our company's history. We launched G7 and Dexcom 1 into multiple new markets, significantly expanding our global access and advancing key technical and clinical work that will provide the foundation for the future of Dexcom. This started with the rollout of G7 in the US in February. G7 is the most accurate CGM ever launched, and the market's reception to G7 has been exceptional. Customers and clinicians have been thrilled with the new form factor, product performance, and ease of use, and payers wasted no time establishing coverage as they recognized the clear value proposition that G7 provides. We immediately started to see a change in prescribing patterns once this product reached the market, and this trend became even more pronounced as we completed the largest expansion of coverage in our company's history. In mid-April, Medicare coverage went live for people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only, as well as certain non-insulin using individuals with hypoglycemia risk. Between this decision and the broad commercial coverage that quickly followed for the basal markets, we have effectively doubled our reimbursed population in the US. This has completely changed the market landscape in the US. With broader coverage available and a new product that greatly simplifies the prescribing process, we have attracted a sizable new cohort of clinicians to our ecosystem. In fact, in 2023, we expanded our prescriber base by approximately 40%. And we're not stopping there. We have always known that the primary care channel would become increasingly important as our business evolves. Much of the work our commercial team has done in recent years has been tailored to this market. And we are now seeing the direct result of that effort as more than 70% of our new scripts are being written by primary care physicians. These relationships are not only critical to help us reach the millions of insulin-using individuals who have not yet started on CGM, but also the tens of millions with broader type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, and beyond. Based on the success of our team in 2023 and the magnitude of these future opportunities, we are excited to continue our investment in our U.S. salesforce this year. When we have a presence with prescribers, we win. Now it is up to us to continue to expand that prescriber pool. We are already seeing more clinicians want to incorporate Dexcom CGM earlier into patients' care plans as they recognize our unique ability to drive behavior change, sustainable outcomes, and greater accountability. This is why we are thrilled to be introducing our newest product, Stelo, later this summer. Stelo will be the first CGM designed specifically for people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin. Leveraging our leading sensor platform, we have built a custom software experience that is tailored to the needs of this population. Stelo will feature a 15-day wear time and launch as a cash paid product while we build our case with payers for broader coverage. With several trials currently underway, we will continue to add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating Dexcom's unique ability to drive greater health and economic outcomes for all people with diabetes. The launch of Stelo also presents a great opportunity to bolster our evidence with a large collection of real world data as we see the impact this product is having on our customers. We filed Stelo with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, leaving us well on track for our highly anticipated launch this summer. As our product portfolio continues to grow, it provides a greater glimpse into the future potential of our company. We have built a platform technology that we can customize to provide creative solutions for different populations. Our redesigned software infrastructure is a key component to this as it enables much quicker iteration and greater connectivity. Connectivity has always been a distinct advantage for Dexcom and with our recent filing of direct to watch with the FDA and new G7 pump integrations, we are further advancing this leadership position. We will also continue innovating on our hardware technology with our current efforts focused on launching an extended wear sensor across all of our product offerings. As we look at this significant opportunity ahead of us, we are as excited as we've ever been. As I said at our Investor Day this past summer, we are just getting started. With that, I will now turn it over to Jereme for a view of the fourth quarter financials. Jereme? Thanks, Jereme. I would now like to open up the call for Q &A. Sean? Thanks, Robbie. This is Kevin. I'll take the 15-day sensor timing, and then Jereme can talk about the numbers and the effect on operating margins going forward. As we said earlier this year, we're in the middle of clinical testing and scientific evaluation of some fundamental science changes to the sensor that will make it more reliable for that 15-day period. One of the reasons that we've done so well, two things, the accuracy of our sensor and the performance of our sensor over time. But combined with the fact, people expect to get a certain amount of days from a sensor and we deliver what we tell them we're going to do. And we want to make sure that 15-day experience is every bit as good as the 10-day experience that we offer now. So we're making a few slight changes on a science basis. We'll run a clinical study, file that, and we certainly would expect you to prove. But right now, we're still evaluating some of the technologies. And we really won't provide a lot of color until we're filed and we see we're on a path towards approval. No, I appreciate that question. First and foremost, we can start with the core technology and then the fundamental beliefs we've had here as a company. The performance of our sensors has been unparalleled. We've got over many years, for example, and AID systems with great outcomes and patients who have done very well there. We built our platforms on connectivity. One of the features that I've talked with the engineers about and kind of complained about because it took a lot of time to engineer, we can connect up to three devices at the same time. This is the type of connectivity that our competitors have not put into their platforms, and is a feature that's very important to our patients, which is the reason, for example, why we just filed our direct-to-watch features with the FDA. One of the other things our competition thinks about as they look at us today, and they think this is where we're going to stay, we're not. We certainly have new pipeline efforts across all fronts on the technology side, better connectivity, communications, software investments. We've had to evolve from being literally a medical device software company to being a world-class software organization over the past couple of years, and it has been an evolution for us, and it's been a big investment. So we've looked at the areas to invest to make ourselves stronger and made investments there. Now that's on the technology side. Here's the other piece of this. We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the past three years getting fully automated factories up and running both here in the United States and our new factory in Malaysia that opened mid-year, and that is a tremendous facility. But we built out those automated lines there, and we've just turned ground on what will be our next world-class factory over in Ireland that would open in 2026. There's a huge investment that has to be made to play in the CGM business going forward, particularly at the scale and the performance that we see now. And we've made those investments and done those things and evolved as a company. So we think we're very well positioned, and we'll see where everybody else comes. But we're comfortable. Well, let me phrase that. We're never comfortable, but we believe we've done all the right things. Larry, thanks for the question and we have guided at 1%. The purpose of this launch is to get this product out here and learn. And as we look at that 1% of revenue number, we certainly have models to build and support that and we believe in designing this product for the type 2 non-insulin user and others that we're targeting the right segment to go after that. Our most important experience with Stelo is learning and getting it out there and starting to develop and grow this new market. We're confident that this product over time can become a very, very large portion of our business and this can be a very large segment within our markets. This year's launch is all about learning more than anything else and we have a model for that 1%. I would love to exceed it, but if we learn all the lessons that we need to learn, this is not a backbreaker for our company and our guidance either. So the most important thing is to get the product out there and to learn more than anything else. Now this Kevin I'll take that we don't really, we don't need a clinical trial for Stelo as far as getting that product approved. There is a lot of data on use of continuous glucose monitoring, particularly Dexcom systems in this type 2 diabetes world that will be published by investigators over the course of the next several months, and we'll reference to that and we'll talk to you about that. We know, we have a very good idea where this data comes out because we've seen in all our studies, patients have better outcomes, they're healthier, we end up saving the system money, and those are the outcomes that we're hoping to drive with Stelo over time. With respect to GLP-1s, again, the list of studies ongoing is very large, and there are studies where CGM is an element. Again, we expect those studies when they're published to demonstrate the same things that we've talked about before, that the use of the CGM with the GLP-1 provides a better result than a study without it, and those studies we've published over time, we don't control those investigators, but we expect good data over the course of the year. Our goal is to do this in a more traditional way over time. As we've said earlier, we'll launch the product as a cash pay product and have a cash pay option, a cash pay that people can get into and purchase the product. We will accumulate data from those users over time. We'll accumulate data, again, from the clinical trials that we see out there, and ultimately build a case for reimbursement for this product. I think over time, we certainly expect to go to CMS and have people with type 2 diabetes who are not insulin-covered at some point in time by that group, because, again, our goal is to spend less money in the healthcare system, and we're one of the few technologies that enables an outcome of that nature. So we see it being more traditional and working with payers and the various government agencies over time. The programs we will continue to support, we're happy to support them and be partners with them. But I think over time, we need a more traditional reimbursement path, and that can be -- the partnerships and the relationships can be the only way. On top of that, we'll continue to develop our tools around Stelo. This first generation that we launch is going to be our first-pass app. We will have numerous iterations over the course of the first 24 months of that product that really make it a much more inviting and engaging product and lead people to better experiences. So stay tuned for what we have to say on that front over the next 12 months. It's going to be very exciting. Yes, I just add to Jereme's comments, Matt, if you look at the second half of the year, that's when G7 rolled out. There's a direct correlation to G7 launching and the acceleration of our growth. It really was an important event. And the other thing that just as a consequence of what you saw, again, this supports what we're doing in the U.S. with respect to our field sales expansion. We do need to spend more time with physicians who aren't as familiar with our technology as they would have been in the past. As I said on the call earlier, where we call on somebody, we win. We do very well. So we need more calls. We needed more feet on the street and more voice, given the acceleration that we saw and the good things that we saw happen over the second half of the year. So it all flows together nicely. Jereme can probably get into more detail than me. It is a part of our business today, Malgaret. We do have some non-insulin users. Our product, we have some plans that actually cover non-insulin users for CGM, and we've seen and had wonderful experiences there. We've also have not an aggressive cash pay program, but a cash pay program nonetheless where non-insulin users have access to our product through some very traditional distribution channels outside the pharmacy and outside traditional DME. So some of those individuals have purchased CGM and use it on the non-insulin front as well, and we continue to support programs. But it is not a remarkable chunk of our business. It has not been a tremendous driver of our growth. It has grown, but it hasn't been a significant percentage. As we look going forward, certainly again, we gave guidance of 1% for 2024. And we're committed to that and that certainly is our forecast and what we've guided. We're most committed to learning because what we're really interested in is a number like $200 million like you're talking about for 2025 and to be positioned with the right product there. With respect to pricing and how offer that product we're going to have tremendous flexibility as this is a cash pay program. And it's not labeled for the current population where we have reimbursement and where we're reimbursed for our products. So we believe we'll have again flexibility to grow that and grow it profitably is again we have a 15-day product going into that market. So we will have lower COGS and we're developing a lot of things around that that is a roll out as you see we really are changing the business model to serve this type of individual versus those we've served up to this point in time. We're going to offer a different experience that will definitely meet their needs across the board. So we're bullish on it over time. I mean it could be very big number in 2025. That's what we're -- that's what we're planning on. We would like to go as fast as possible. If it were on my time frame it'd be it'd be yesterday. Stelo at 15-day is a primer for that so we can learn and gather data from those users as they use it particularly with our current sensor configuration. As we go through the technology changes that we're making as we dial in on those features that we're going to put in the final product we'll get a pivotal trial started and we'll go but we're learning each and every day. We are not in a position like we were with G7 where we're submitting an entire new system with completely new hardware and new features and new manufacturing lines, new suppliers, new everything. This 15-day product we've built on the same platform our current G7 has built. So the time from finishing a pivotal to filing is not going to be near as intense and difficult as it was with the last product being such as security and Bluetooth and stuff. We worked through all those issues already. So right now it's really refining the science and getting the 15 days and getting that reliability and quality level that our patients expect from us. We don't view this as an extremely, I think \u201825 is a reasonable assumption, but I'm not going to give you an end date or as to when, because there's too many variables, but we're certainly headed down a path along that type of speed, and then we'll see where we land and give you more updates along the way. I just, filing things or starting things, what's important to us is getting things done, and those should be your milestones as well. So we'll keep you posted, but that's where we are. I just add to that it feeds to the salesforce investment we're making in the States. We need to educate physicians and patients. And once you get a population of people who have positive outcomes in this space and they go back to their doctors and those conversations start taking place, this becomes easier, but there's a lot of seeding that we have to do to do it and we needed more, more feet on the street to do that. That is a great question. And that is a very, very pertinent topic of discussion and meeting here within the walls of our company. We are very much evaluating very efficient ways to serve such a large patient group, had a patient group that may interact differently with us than those who've been on insulin over time as we build those models out. So we're looking at distribution models that appear different than what we're doing today, so we can most efficiently get that product to people. And again, starting with cash pay gives us some opportunities to do things a little different than we've done in the past. And so you'll have to stay tuned for that. It's a very thoughtful question and very much in line with everything that's going on here every day. Thank you very much. It's very easy during these earnings calls to talk about percentages and margins and future technologies, financial guidance, competitors, a whole host of important and engaging topics. But as we wrap up today, I really want to focus on 2023, which is truly the most remarkable year in our history. Let's review these numbers again. $700 million in organic revenue growth, more than a $1 billion in EBITDA, 600, 000 new customers in our active user base, standing up a plant in Asia without missing a beat, and, of course, launching our G7 product all over the world. While best-in-class technology is foundational and fundamental to these types of accomplishment, it doesn't happen without exceptional people going above and beyond. So as we close out 2023, I want to thank our, I guess we are, we're now more than 10, 000 Dexcom employees around the world. Incredibly well done. Thanks everybody."

            "name": "Jereme Sylvain",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $1.035 billion compared to $815 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27% on a reported basis and 26% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $769 million for the fourth quarter compared to $606 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27%. Between the ongoing success of G7 and our significantly improved access in recent months, the momentum in our U.S. business continues to grow. In fact, we delivered our fastest quarterly U.S. growth rate since the beginning of 2021 as our revenue accelerated for the third quarter in a row. International revenue grew 27%, totaling $265 million in the fourth quarter. International organic revenue growth was 23% for the fourth quarter. We continued to execute very well across our international footprint and again took share in Q4 as our global access work and product portfolio strategy have helped broaden our reach in many markets. Our fourth quarter gross profit was $664 million or 64.2% of revenue compared to 66.7% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. This year-over-year decline in gross margin was expected as G7 was a much larger percent of our product and customer mix in Q4 compared to a year ago. As a reminder, G7 has a higher cost profile than G6 today, but we expect this to change in the coming quarters as we drive greater volume through our G7 lines. As it reaches scale, we continue to expect G7's margin profile to improve upon that of our G6 platform. Operating expenses were $421 million for Q4 2023 compared to $372 million in Q4 of 2022. This quarter was another demonstration of our commitment to being disciplined and thoughtful with our spend. Our operating expenses grew at half the rate of revenue this quarter and we delivered nearly 500 basis points of operating expense leverage compared to last year. This extended our streak to eight straight quarters of at least 250 basis points of year over year OpEx leverage. Operating income was $242.7 million or 23.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $172.1 million or 21.1% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $321.5 million or 31.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $237.1 million or 29.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income for the third quarter was $202.8 million or $0.50 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the year with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Having financial flexibility allows the organization to take advantage of opportunities. Case in point, we executed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program mentioned on our Q3 results. Through this transaction, we were able to offset the remaining dilution related to our maturing 2023 converts while purchasing our stock at what we viewed as an attractive price. As Kevin mentioned earlier, our free cash flow grew by 70% in 2023 as our business continues to scale and become more efficient. As our cash flow profile continues to grow, it only adds to our significant financial flexibility. This allows us to continue to invest behind our meaningful organic growth opportunity while assessing strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis. Turning to 2024 guidance, as we stated last month, we anticipate total revenue to be in the range of $4.15 billion to 4.35 billion, representing organic growth of 16% to 21% for the year. This guidance assumed continued momentum in the type 2 basal only population in the US, the expansion of Dexcom ONE on the G7 platform into new geographies, and the launch of Stelo in the summer of 2024. It also assumes the divestiture of our non-diabetes distribution business in Australia and New Zealand this quarter, which represented around $30 million of revenue in 2023. From a margin perspective, we expect full year non-GAAP gross profit margin to be in a range of 63% to 64%, operating profit margin to be approximately 20%, and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 29%. Our gross margin guidance reflects the ongoing conversion from G6 to G7 within our customer base and the associated scale that comes with that process. Below gross margin, we'll continue to be very diligent with our spend in 2024 while investing strategically behind multiple growth opportunities. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. Yes, and then to your question, longer term on operating margins. We've done a really nice job to date, creating leverage and opportunities within our operating margin profile. And despite some of the moves and the channel mix changes we've made on the top line; we've been able to maintain a gross margin based on a lot of the work we've done around design to value and a lot of the scale that we've been able to achieve. But when you think about 15-day, it provides a real big opportunity for us to think about, both leverage from a gross margin and then operating margin profile, but also opportunities to grow the business in areas profitably that maybe would be a little bit more of a challenge with the 10-day product. So it is absolutely the number one effort going on in the organization. It does provide us lots of flexibility to either a, continue to grow the business or b, deliver operating margins that can be world-class over time. So I think longer term there's a lot of opportunities there, we are not ready to particularly lay what that is. We've obviously given our 2025 LRP and we'll execute to that, but I do think it provides real long-term opportunities for this company to deliver back to shareholders and take advantage of opportunities globally. Yes, and then to your question on margin, we're not necessarily talking about it from a gross margin perspective. That'll come in time when we start to release more details around it, Larry. From an operating margin, yes, this is something we're going to invest in. And so when you think about it from an overall company margin, certainly as we invest in this and we invest in launching it, there will be some sales and marketing, but it's an investment we're going to make this year. And we're going to make that investment in this product because we believe in the future and we're going to do so and still expand operating margins as a company. So you can be safe that we're going to be very, very careful and measured about how we invest our dollars, but know that this is part of the investments we've set aside as an organization while still again improving profitability. Yes. So thanks for the question, Matt. So you think about the investment, we are going to expand that Salesforce. And today we have a good amount of coverage. It's tens of thousands of primary care physicians and predominantly the entirety of the endocrinologist space. But as you start to think about basal coverage expanding, the opportunity ahead of us certainly Stelo out on the horizon. We found there was an opportunity to continue to expand. And as we know, CGM, specifically Dexcom CGM can play a very important role in how folks manage their diabetes. We know that having those call points is helpful. So we are going to expand it. You can take a look at LinkedIn for the amount. There are quite a few openings out there in terms of the size of it. So we'll expand our salesforce and we will get more coverage. In terms of the cadence, the LinkedIn wrecks are out there right now. So you'll see us hire over the course of the first quarter. Obviously, then the fully loaded burden associated with those reps will take place over the back half of the year. So Q2s through Q4. So that's how to think about the cadence of that. But again, that's all contemplated in the overall guidance we've provided, the 20% operating margin. So expect it as part of typical work that we do around creating leverage in the business and investing where we need to. But if you're thinking about it for a cadence over the course of the year, expect the hires to be made over the course of the first quarter. And then for folks to ramp up and be part of our run, really Q2 through the balance of the year. Sure. Thanks, Marie. And we'll give you some context. So the non-CGM business, that effectively is gone at this point. So that's why we've been comfortable pulling it out and talking about it to organic. So this quarter you can expect, we talked about the $30-ish million last year. The math on that, you can kind of do the allocation by quarter. That's out as of this point, for the most part. And so think about that in the quarter. Japan, certainly a similar type thing. We talked about it in Q4 being effectively nil. I'd expect a similar contribution in the first quarter. And then as we start to take that book of business so that business live in the second quarter, I expect it to start to contribute as we build that business back up over the course of the year. So those are really the international kind of timing. So Q1 will be the heaviest burden in terms of as we transition through that. As it pertains to Dexcom ONE on G7, great news is, I think we press release it a couple days ago, four countries have launched. And so that has come out, it is now out there today. Those four countries are our first foray and we're getting great feedback from early adopters within those countries. The expectation is we have a cadence of launches of Dexcom ONE on a G7 form factor, really over the course of the year. So I'd expect a lot more press releases around where and when we're launching that, but expect that to really take place over the course of the year, which gives us a lot of confidence again in Dexcom ONE being a really incredible growth driver for the long term. Okay, thanks, Jeff. So as you think about the cadence, so thanks to the question on international, as you think about the cadence over the course of the year, certainly Q4 was buoyed by a few different or weighed down, I guess, and say by a few different things. We talked a little bit about earlier about the Japan business and really the revenues were effectively nil as we make that transition. And so that's a negative grower in the quarter. And then, the non-diabetes business is was really a flat. And so when you think about the business being historically a pretty significant grower, those pull you down as you start to exclude those things, we are still growing quite well. In fact, all of the core businesses where we operate today, UK, Germany, Australia, et cetera, all continue to grow relatively consistently between Q2, Q3, Q4. There are some ebbs and flows, but for the most part, those all should do well. So then you think about what does that mean going forward? We haven't changed our stance that the o-US business, the international business, as a percentage of revenue by the end of 2025 will be bigger than it is today. And about two thirds, one third, or that split today is more like 70:30 or 72:28. So I think on the whole, expect the international business with all of the opportunity out there with certainly the under penetration we have today to grow faster than that of the US business over the coming. That's not to say that we're not incredibly bullish on the U.S. business. Look, if we can outperform on both of those, we'll do the work on both. But at least that's in our LRP. As you think about competitive systems and AID, we are highly confident in what we have to offer. Our product there's multiple different reasons why we believe our product is special in that space. Kevin alluded to a little bit about it earlier around Bluetooth connectivity as one. I'll just give you an example there. Someone can be on a pump can talk to their phone and can be on a direct-to-watch application all while on our product. No one else can offer that. We are the only one that can do that. And as you think about this population which really needs and deserves quite frankly the technology to manage their diabetes, we believe that that is a differentiator and a meaningful differentiator going forward. Add to that the many and many of years that we're compiling on these systems. We feel highly confident that when we sit in front of a physician, and we sit in front of an endocrinologist and we sit in front of a parent a child that needs an AID system we feel confident that we are the choice. We'll continue to battle and make sure that that message continues to go out there but as we think about that international book of business, we continue to feel very confident even post-launch of a competitive system we'll do incredibly well there. Sure. Yes, so we'll start with tax. I think this year we kind of dropped down to closer to that 26% range. Well, we don't necessarily guide year by year to tax. The goal is over the course of the next three to five years to get down into the low 20s. So I would expect it to continue to come down every year as we grow into the tax structure that we put in place. In terms of net interest income, some of that, it's one of those, it's a bit of a difficult one, but just given where interest rate is going to go over time, but it's pretty straightforward that our cash interest cost is pretty low, just given our converts. And so you can basically take a look at the cash on the balance sheet, multiply it by about 4%. And that gets you to about where you'd be for the year. Again, we'll have to keep you updated as interest rates change over time. But that's the way to think about it. And then from an operating margin perspective, we gave the 2025 LRP, that's a 21%. Your point is valid. If you take a look at our guide this year at 20% in our gross margin of 63% to 64%, if we hold true to our 65% gross margin in 2025, which is absolutely our belief, you're already there at a 21% off margin. So I absolutely understand the mathematics. It just means we're ahead. We're ahead of our LRP, but we're not necessarily willing to update it at this point. We'll come forward and we'll update it at some point in the future. But I think it's a good thing. We've done a lot of work around this, Joanne, around getting lean and making sure we drive leverage into the business. And the great news is, is we are ahead. And so that's a good spot to be in. And we'll continue to do so. One other maybe caveat is that I think it's important to note on the year I guess the question a little bit about the year and where we on the year. We're making some good investments this year in the organization, we're launching Stelo. And we talked about that being a significant investment in the business. We're certainly doing a lot of work around our salesforce and if you recall few years ago, we did some work around that we took step back on march, we are going to do all that and still step forward. We're going to go direct in Japan this year. That's another thing that we're making an investment in and then all the work Kevin referenced around the clinical work that we're doing around continuing to improve our product. We're going to make all those investments and still deliver an expansion of operating margin. So I think it just goes to show you we're building the levers in here that you can see that we're building and that you can rely on us longer term to continue to drive that through the business. Yes, that's a good question. Let me maybe just give some color as to how we're thinking about the guidance. As you see the performance in the back half of the year, a lot of that has to do with being the most accurate sensor, launching with a G7 form factor, and then of course having the basal coverage there. And so when you think about it, and you can see the share taking when you look at script data, we are taking share and having the sensor, the most advanced sensor on the market is the driver there. So that's taking share. Now within those spaces, basal is a contributor, no question. As that category expands and we take share within that category, that does contribute to the overall numbers. And so you are right, basal is a contributor, but it has as much to do with us taking share as it does with category expansion. So think about both of those as contributors. As you think about 2024, we've talked a little bit about the adoption rate, basal in total, adopting in the back half of the year around 9% to 10% per year on a per annum basis. The guide assumes about 8% there. And so, I think you can assume that was the case. Our long range plan was more like 6% to 7% per year. So we are seeing basal going faster than what was in our long range plan. And what's great about that is as we continue to take share and the category grows a little faster than expected, that will help contribute over the longer haul. So hopefully that gives you some context to how we're seeing basal. It absolutely is a contributor. I don't want to overstate the fact though that basal because quite frankly, our intensive insulin businesses continue to do really, really well. And you see us taking share there as well. Hey Jayson. Yes, thanks for the question. Last year when we made the assumption on what the margin look like, the assumption was is the G6 to G7 transition. We had a range of assumptions. But the assumption was the G6 to G7 transition would take place perhaps a little bit earlier. And some of that had to do with timing of when the AID systems were available in the market and coverage and how that that goes over time. And so it took a little bit longer. And as a result, we outperformed on margin and it gets back to G6 cost less to make the G7 today. And it's still majority of our user, our legacy base still sits on the G6 system. With the launch of Tandem and Control-IQ integrated with G7 and obviously the limited launch with the Omnipod 5 coming out here in the back half of Q1, and then obviously a launch sometime later in the year, we do believe that base starts to move over quicker. And so what you have there is as that takes place, Jayson, you have that shift from a lower cost to a higher cost product weighing in the start of the year. And hence that's why the margin goes where it goes. Now in the back half of the year, assuming that base transitions and our models show that over the course of the year that should, that equilibrium should balance then tilt in the favor of G7. It puts us in a position exiting the year where G7 should be and we'll have to give you updates on the base as the year progresses, but it should be lower than G6, but then at that point it should be accretive. And that would be the exit rate leading out of \u201824. And then of course, then bodes well as we move into 2025 and beyond. So that's the big driver. It's just, when does that base transition and when it does, when do we have that cost kind of equilibrium? So again, we thought it was going to happen in the back half in 2023. It didn't take place. We outperformed there in 2023 as a result, probably going to take place here in the first half of 2024. Yes. I mean, if you think about 2024, at least, 2024, the main contributor to new patients, or at least revenue from new patients, is still going to sit in the intensive insulin. So the type 1 and the type 2 insulin-intensive patients, and that still is where the combination of those two makes up a majority of the new revenue over the course of the year. Basal is catching up, and Basal doing a nice job of catching up, but those are still part of our core business, and it's still actually driving the underlying business. Now, over time, we do expect basal, given it's a larger population, to do very, very well. We'll have to give you more of an update as we get into 2025 and beyond as we get closer to that. So incredibly bullish on the long-term opportunity there with basal. But think about at least 2024. Our core business is actually still driving a lot of the growth with obviously longer-term opportunities in basal and then to your point Hypo which is quite frankly still a low contributor and then with Stelo kind of coming online as well. All of those are real opportunities in 2025 and beyond. Sure, Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, we did, we thought it was going to be about a third of patient starts in 2023 outside the US. It was closer to about a quarter of new patient starts, so a little bit behind there. Some of the tenders took a little bit more time to get on, and so it was still a really good year for us, but a little bit behind, where we had started the year, at least in the expectations. This year, we expect it to be more and a bigger contributor as a percentage. So if you think about last year, that was certainly the case that was on the G6 form factor, very excited about obviously coming out here on the G7 form factor here in 2024 and the four countries that we are to launch in. So our expectation is it's a bigger percentage while we haven't necessarily given that number, expect it to be bigger and the team wants it to be bigger as a percentage of new patients outside the US in 2024. Yes, thanks, Josh. It's an area that in all candor it's gone and we knew this was going to be a bit of a challenge. It's a big opportunity, but it's going to take a little bit more time on awareness and getting in front of physicians and letting folks know that, hey, look, if you've had a hypo event, you do qualify. And by the way, here's how to document it. So it has been certainly slower than basal. It's not been a real all that material contributor in 2023. What we do know, however, is Teri, our Chief Commercial Officer and her team are very, very focused in getting the word out and making sure that folks understand if they are suffering with hypo events, this technology can help and it can help change that and that they do qualify and there is reimbursement out there. And so it's working on that messaging and making sure that we get out there and understand where those events are taking place. That is, believe it or not, it is a challenge in understanding how to identify when those have taken place so that we can get out in front of those folks. But we are working on it. We have good data around that. And then making sure, we're making those physicians that are then serving those patients aware of what the requirements are for documentation so that they can qualify for reimbursement. So there's some work to be done, but there's a team working very, very intently on it and making sure that we do arm our salesforce and then arm the community with the information needed to help it grow faster. I think it's a big opportunity for us, but I think it's an opportunity that's going to take a little bit longer to penetrate. So to your point, I think it's a driver a little bit here in 2024, certainly an opportunity in 2024, but I think it's going to continue to slow roll, but over the longer haul, we do think this is a contributor over time that can be meaningful. Sure, yes. So in our long-term guide, we had talked about basal effectively being about six to seven points of adoption as a percentage of the total population here in the US. And I'll start with the US because internationally, there's a coverage as we work through coverage there, there's opportunities. But we had talked about that in our 2025 LRP. In our first couple of quarters, we saw it mirror that to your question, to your point, I should say, that it was mirroring the type 2 intensive, which was about a 9% to 10% penetration rate. Our guide, at least for 2024, assumes the middle between those two, 8%. We got a couple quarters under our belt. It's very, very positive. But we also want to make sure we're prudent when it comes to guidance. And so that's why we've assumed about an 8% penetration rate over the course of 2024. Obviously, if it mirrors that, which we saw in the back half of 2023, there's opportunities to outperform. And clearly, we're tracking ahead of our LRP, which I think is both positive signals, I think, for the business in total. But we, again, our guidance has been 8% as a percent of penetration. Hopefully that helps you. Yes, so maybe what I'll talk about is how we're thinking about the cost of the product. And then I think from there we can kind of make some calls on how we think about margin from that perspective. And I'll maybe comment a little bit on the on the service model, which I think is also important because that'll help from the operating margin. So as you think about the G7, just the product itself, as of today, it costs more than G6. And so that'll eventually we expect over the course of this year flip. And as you kind of get your models kind of bent out into kind of laid out, we expect to get down to a $10 sensor, irrespective of whether it's 10 or 15 days as we exit the 2025 LRP into early 2026. So that gives you some kind of feel for where we'll get to the cost of each sensor. Now, each sensor, the hardware is about the same cost, whether it's Stelo, whether it's Dexcom ONE, or whether it's the G-Series. It's the support models, the software, the support, the R&D, the investment in it. And then of course the service models that ultimately then change it. And so as you think about all of the work that we put into the G-Series, the G -Series will have the highest reimbursement, but it'll also have the highest service model and then most investment in software and otherwise. Dexcom ONE is a little bit more of a different service model, and thus we are able to reduce the burden associated with some of the warranty and then the support cost that play into that. And then Stelo is in a 15-day form factor. And so that's helpful from a gross margin perspective as you think through that over time. So I think that's the way to think about the cost profile. We haven't launched the price of Stelo at this point, so we can't necessarily give you the specific margin at this point. Otherwise, it'd be pretty obvious how we're thinking about it. But over time, as that comes out, I think it'll help align the models. And I think there's real opportunities here as you think about a 15-day product starting with Stelo, but as that then makes its way through Dexcom ONE and the G-Series over time, again, more levers there where there's some real opportunities in those product lines to continue to drive profitability. So I think there's levers across all of these. I hope that gives you some context. I realize I'm not giving you a P&L for each one of them, but at least it gives you some context at the hardware costs, and we differentiate on the OpEx costs and service models, and then, of course, the days of wear on each one."

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today we reported another great quarter for Dexcom with third quarter organic revenue growth of 26% compared to the third quarter of 2022. This year is proving to be one of the most exciting periods in our company's history. Access is expanding faster than ever before and we are seeing new levels of enthusiasm for our differentiated products. This can be seen firsthand in our broader rollout of G7 in the US.  Building upon our legacy of being the most accurate sensor G7\u2019s focus on simplicity and affordability continues to attract new customers and prescribers to our platform. Similar to last quarter, the majority of G7 customers continue to be new to Dexcom and we took yet another step forward in expanding our prescribing base.  There are now nearly 18,000 physicians writing scripts for Dexcom, they were not prescribing our products before the G7 launch. This represents a notable increase in our prescribing community in only a short period of time as more clinicians recognize G7's unique feature set, ease of use and market-leading levels of coverage.  This combination has made it incredibly easy for physicians to prescribe Dexcom CGM and drive greater levels of engagement within their patient populations. Additionally, our new G7 software platform is enhancing our value proposition across all patient types. We've implemented new software updates almost monthly since launch with improvements to features like connectivity and alarm personalization.  As one example, we have established new lines of communication in our app to simplify the process of engaging with our customers. We are constantly working behind the scenes to improve the customer experience. And we will continue to operate with this type of focus to ensure that we have the most user-friendly and engaging products on the market.  Our customers know that when you join the Dexcom ecosystem, you get all the benefits today and tomorrow associated with our leading innovation. Our latest product cycle has also coincided with the largest expansion of coverage in our company's history. With significant reimbursement now established beyond intensive insulin use, there are more people with covered access to Dexcom CGM than ever before.  As a reminder, Medicare coverage went live in mid-April for people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only, as well as certain non-insulin individuals that experience hypoglycemia. Collectively, these two populations represent nearly seven million people on the US with approximately half being at Medicare age.  Encouragingly, commercial coverage continues to build for this group. We've established market-leading levels of basal-only reimbursement as payers clearly recognize the potential for better outcomes driven by Dexcom. This further supports our industry low out-of-pocket cost for our customers. With a full quarter of broad coverage now under our belt, we continue to be very encouraged by early prescribing trends for this cohort.  We know that last quarter that we experienced an immediate uptick in new patient starts once coverage went live and we have seen a clear continuation of this trend since that time. In fact, we delivered another record Medicare new patient start quarter in Q3 as physicians have quickly adjusted their prescribing patterns to match the new reimbursement landscape.  While early basal adoption trends look very similar to those we previously experienced, once broad coverage became available for intensely managed type 2 diabetes. We view this as a very positive sign of things to come. Importantly, when you combine this broader coverage with our leading center technology, we feel incredibly confident in our market position. Since the launch of G7 we have gained share across all reimburse channels and patient segments in the US and that trend continued this quarter. Even among non-reimburse channels we are seeing more and more interest in Dexcom CGM.  We are also seeing similar dynamics across our international footprint. We have never been better positioned to compete globally from a product, access or capacity perspective and we once again, took international share this quarter as a result. Our product portfolio continues to be a key contributor to this success.  By having multiple products available, we can tailor our offerings to meet the unique needs of individual geographies and reimbursement structures. A great example of this was seen in Francis past quarter where DexCom ONE secured reimbursement for all people on intensive insulin therapy, which represents around half a million people and we have submitted our evidence to extend ad coverage to the basal population.  In addition to advancing our product offerings, we've been continuously working to build greater commercial scale and flexibility to serve each market more effectively. As we discussed at our Investor Day, one way to drive scale is through the conversion of key international markets from distributor to direct operations.  Historically, these conversions have been followed by a notable uptick in performance, as we provide greater levels of support and focus to these markets once we oversee all facets of sales and distribution. Along those lines, we recently made the strategic decision to go direct in Japan. As a reminder, Japan became one of the first countries to establish broad reimbursement for anyone taking insulin late last year, representing more than one million lives.  Despite this the market remains in its very early stages, and we will continue to work to drive much greater CGM adoption over time as we initiate direct sales in the second quarter of next year.  Finally, at EASD this month, we added to our substantial base of distinctive clinical evidence with new data around long term Dexcom CGM outcomes and inheritance the impact of Dexcom ONE for type two, diabetes and performance within the pregnancy setting. Study after study, we continue to demonstrate Dexcom's position as a cornerstone within the evolving diabetes care, and metabolic help landscape.  Across a wide range of customers and care settings our product plays a unique role in providing real-time information that can drive behavior change, greater patient accountability, and more informed therapy decisions. Like everyone else, we have also been interested to see the latest data behind new drug therapies.  We believe these drugs playing important role in the care continuum and it is encouraging to see new solutions emerging and a growing appreciation around the need for better and earlier care. Data continues to demonstrate that clinicians prefer to use CGM together with these drugs to drive the best possible outcomes.  In fact, we shared claims data this quarter that showed prescribing trends for CGM increase once someone is initiated GLP-1 therapy as clinicians favor Dexcom for both its protective features and ability to support lifestyle management. As an update, we looked at trailing 12 month data through August 2023 would suggest this dynamic is even more pronounced among the newest generation of these drugs.  The data clearly showed that CGM usage grows faster and GLP-1users, then those who are not on therapy. This further demonstrates the complementary nature of Dexcom CGM across all therapy regimes in diabetes. As we look forward, we continue to ensure that we advance our unique role within the ecosystem of care as we progress, our mission of empowering people to take control of health.  This will include launching new products such as our non-insulin product coming next summer, as well as advancing our ongoing clinical work across much broader populations. We are still very early in our story in terms of potential impact and the number of lives we can ultimately touch. Our future is incredibly bright.  With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the third quarter financials. Jereme? \nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation is to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  For the third quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $975 million compared to $770 million for the third quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27% on a reported basis and 26% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency, in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing, 12 months.  US revenue totaled $714 million for the third quarter, compared to $573 million in the third quarter of 2022, representing growth of 24%. Between the ongoing success of our G7 launch and significant expansion of coverage for Dexcom this year, our US business is really hitting its stride. This is particularly noticeable when looking at our new customer start trends which again outpaced our expectations for this quarter.  This dynamic has now played out for several quarters in a row and we are seeing the direct result of that continued momentum. In the third quarter, we saw revenue growth accelerate compared to last quarter and we delivered our fastest quarterly growth rate in over two years.  International revenue grew 33% totaling $261 million in the third quarter. International organic revenue growth was 30% for the third quarter. We continued to execute incredibly well in our international markets. Our product portfolio strategy, ongoing access work and growing commercial traction helped us again gain share this quarter.  We had a particularly strong quarter across our European footprint as we saw growth remained similar to the accelerated level we saw in the second quarter. An item of note is we did have slower growth coming from our non-CGM business as well as relatively flat performance in Japan, as we worked with our distributor partner to start the process of transitioning to direct sales.  As a reminder, when we made our distributor acquisition in 2021, we also inherited a business that distributed products outside of the diabetes space. We recently made the decision to spin off this unit to focus entirely on our CGM and diabetes technologies in this region which we think will enhance our execution in the market. We expect the deal to close in early 2024 and we want to thank our employees for their continued strong work through the transition in the space.  Our third quarter gross profit was $630 million or 64.7% of revenue, compared to 64.2% of revenue in the third quarter of 2022. We are very proud of our gross margin performance in the quarter. This is another testament to the top tier work our operations team continues to deliver this year. Despite managing through a new product launch, we have improved yields on both the G6 and G7 platforms. In addition, Q3 gross margins benefited from a stronger than expected mix of G6 customers as our pump users eagerly await G7AID integration.  When this transition starts in the coming weeks, we expect an acceleration in our base shift to G7. While G7 currently has a higher unit cost profile than G6 and will over the near term, we expect this to become our highest margin product as we drive greater volumes and economies of scale over the course of 2024 and beyond.  Operating expenses were $392 million for Q3 of 2023, compared to $333 million in Q3 of 2022. Our focus on cost management again stood out this quarter as we delivered over 300 basis points of operating expense leverage. This now marks the seventh straight quarter that we have generated at least 250 basis points of year-over-year operating expense leverage. We will continue to invest in the growth of the business while finding ways to be even more efficient.  Operating income was $238.9, million or 24.5% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023, compared to $160.8 million or 20.9% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. This margin represents a new quarterly record for Dexcom.  Adjusted EBITDA was $314.5 million or 32.3% of revenue for the third quarter, compared to $226.6 million or 29.4% of revenue for the third quarter of 2022. This margin also represents a new quarterly record for Dexcom.  Net income in the third quarter was $203 million or $0.50 per share. We remain in a very strong financial position as we closed out the quarter with greater than $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our ability to generate consistent and growing free cash flow is becoming more apparent every quarter and we delivered the highest free cash flow quarter in our company's history in Q3.  This provides us a lot of flexibility to be thoughtful and opportunistic in our capital allocation decisions. Along those lines, we are excited to announce a $500 million share repurchase program today. Given our very strong underlying fundamentals and outlook, we see, this is a great time step into the market and buyback our stock.  This program also provides the added benefit of more than offsetting any remaining dilution related to our 2023 convertible notes as the remainder of these are reaching maturity in the coming weeks.  Turning to guidance, we are raising our full year 2023 revenue guidance to a range of $3.575 billion to $3.6 billion representing growth of 23% to 24% for the year. Our updated revenue guidance reflects an increase of over $60 million at the midpoint, compared to our previous guidance. It is more than $165 million higher than where we guided to start the year.  From a margin perspective, we are raising our full year non-GAAP gross margin guidance to approximately 64%. We are also increasing our non-GAAP operating and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for the year to approximately 19% and 28% respectively.  With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. \nKevin Sayer: Thanks Jereme. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. We also have Jake Leach, our Chief Operating Officer and Terry Lauver, our Chief Commercial Officer joining us for our question, answer session. Sean? \nSean Christensen : Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then re-enter the queue if necessary. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from, Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nRobert Marcus: Oh, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on an absolutely fantastic quarter. There is a lot to talk about here but just keeping it to one question. What really showed just so much upside was the US number this quarter along with the profitability. So question really is, one, how much of that do we ascribe to the new basal indication with growth from both Medicare and commercial patients.  And we started to see this in France and Japan and I hear that a lot of European countries might over the course of \u201824 start covering for basal. So the question is really how much is basal contributing today? And how big can it be over the coming years if all of Europe starts to bring on enhanced reimbursemen something that would have been unimaginable just 12 months ago. Thanks a lot. \nJereme Sylvain: Hey, thanks, Robbie. This is Jereme. Appreciate the comments. I can take that one and we address it from there. In terms of what the contribution was this quarter from basal, obviously we had a really strong quarter this quarter, record new patients once again and obviously raised the guide on the year. Now some of that does come from basal. There's no question there as we continue to open up reimbursement. The new patients are coming along and Kevin mentioned it. We're starting to see basal follow similar patterns to type two intensive, which, when you think about coming into this year, it's about 40% to 45% adoption, but really the curve is starting to follow that. So we're very excited about the opportunity there. And so that's in the US and certainly clearly that's playing out here.  In terms of OUS, it's a great opportunity. One of the things we've seen outside the US is as access is created creates significant opportunities for growth. And you've seen our actions over the course of the past few years. We've created a lot of access for our products, and in turn our international markets have grown incredibly well and there's a large population outside the US that that this would ultimately apply it to once you have basal coverage.  So it could be an absolute - an absolute tailwind for us for years and years to come. It's something obviously we're very excited about. We don't get ahead of ourselves, right? We have to get that coverage in place. But the bullishness you hear about the US experience is what we would expect to see as more and more coverage comes and so we leave very excited about the future holds. \nRobert Marcus: Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor Andrew with William Blair. Please go ahead. \nMargaret Kaczor : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously a lot of talk in the quarter and I'm sure a lot of people get through that. But one of the things that I wanted to share, was any dialogue you may be having with clinical societies around where CGM fits within the treatment paradigm. Specifically focused on non-insulin users and I ask obviously there could be a change in guidelines with GLP's right now. And so, can you use some of those discussions to pull forward CGM use as well? And again, if it's not now when - it doesn't even matter. Thanks. \nKevin Sayer: Margaret, it\u2019s Kevin, I'll take that. We have had discussions with the societies on expanding coverage for people with type 2 diabetes not on insulin. And those discussions continue. We've seen a gradual uptick for lack of a better word in the guidelines as CGM use from all professionals societies over the last several years.  And as we gather more data, as we see more data come in from studies we\u2019re aware of over the next 12 months, we believe we can continue to build a better case. Every time we run a study or look at a study from this population in this group, people on CGM do better. It's just simple. They have better outcomes. They're more adherent to their meds. They have a feedback loop that they don't have any other way.  We're very excited about this opportunity. That's why we're going with the product where we've talked about filing before the end of the year and launching next year, our product is designed for people not on insulin. And we think it's going to be a great product offering on this front going forward. So we're looking forward to it, and I think we'll be able to write this script the same way we've written the script in our industry so far. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and reiterate my congratulations on a really strong quarter here. Jereme, I wanted to ask about the guidance and any comments on next year, the math if I'm doing it correctly it implies Q4 growth slows by about 400 basis points. You don't get the same quarter-over-quarter of lift you typically see.  And so, why is that in any - any reason why the, momentum for sales growth would slow next year and any -anything we should think about on the margins that should be implications from Japan. Thank you. \nJereme Sylvain: Yeah, so thanks for the question, Larry. So, in terms of where the guide goes, I think you're right, it does imply a tad of a d-cell. Most of that I would say is related to really comps historically over time. And Larry you've tracked us for a while. So as we move more out of commercial, DME and into pharmacy, typically we have enough uptick into Q4 in those DME environments. As more and more of our of our folks go through the retail channel, you kind of lose some of that.  So really you're playing about it's really about seasonality within the course of a year. So we're not trying to imply anything. Really what we're trying to say is, this is the trajectory we see it going with seasonality. This is our - again, our base case, as we start to look at guidance over the course of the year. And so the trends - underlying trends if there's nothing to say there. I mean the underlying trends in this business remains strong.  I don't think we're trying to imply anything other than that. We do expect you kind of referenced Japan. There could be around the fringes until we go direct a little bit of a stable as opposed to necessarily growing story around Japan. And so that is around the fringe, but that represents a really small piece of the business on the international side. Really what you're seeing is just us being mindful about seasonality in our base case and then certainly if we can outperform, we'll do what we traditionally do, which is tried to do so. \nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Please go ahead. \nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. And I will also say, congrats on a really great quarter. I was just curious, so Jereme, you alluded to the fact that basal seems to be starting to ramp similar to how the influenza census. Type 2 did when you got coverage there. What about from a utilization perspective? Any color you can give on how these basal patients are adopting technology? Is it similar to what you saw in the novel study. I know it's early, but we should have had some reorders right now. So just curious what you're seeing. Thanks so much. \nJereme Sylvain: Yeah, really appreciate the congrats. Thanks. What we see is and Terry is here. So what I can do is, I can give you kind of what we're seeing maybe numbers wise, but maybe Terry can kind of take you into the day-to-day interaction with patients. Numbers wise, we haven't seen much of a change at this point. The population does has reorders relatively in the same capacity as in the past.  And so that's a good early indicator, but maybe Terry can take you through what she's hearing and seeing in the field around the excitement around basal and who wants to use it. \nTerry Lauver: Sure. Thanks, Jeremy and thanks, Danielle. The trends as Kevin referenced that we see in basal in terms of uptake and intention to prescribe from the physicians mirror what we've seen in other segments of the marketplace And the coverage has certainly a big driver of that, We track coverage very closely for Dexcom for the industry. And in basal as with the rest of the market, Dexcom continues to be the most covered CGM with the lowest out-of-pocket copay.  We also have the benefit of being out in front of the payers and the healthcare providers with the mobile study demonstrating the benefit and the outcomes that Dexcom drives for this population. So we see a nice trajectory I think in line with what we would expect and we expect that to continue. \nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nMatt Taylor: Hey, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I guess, I just wanted to ask you, Kevin you talked a bit more here about the combination therapy or benefit that CGM\u2019s fee with GLP-1s. And I was wondering if you had thought about partnering with the pharma companies, or maybe running studies to show that over time. There is a benefit to using CGM with the drug. Things like that that might give investors even more confidence longer terms in the future of CGM in a good world. \nKevin Sayer : Well, certainly, we think about partnering with the drug companies, but they're doing so well. Right now, they're very busy. We do have relationships them and have had discussions. With respect to studies we certainly talk about some of those internally.  We saw clinical evidence over at the EASD Meeting recently where that was a large topic of discussion that the team brought back and we're very aware of studies coming out over the first half of 2024 that are going to show some of these data for the use of these combo of these new drugs and CGM in combination and how that works for people.  So we know there's evidence coming in investigator initiated studies. And we're looking at some of our own right now. I think today will continue to support it. \nMatt Taylor: Great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \nMatthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Can you maybe Jereme you mentioned this, but you talk about the G7 integration that's upcoming here in the next few weeks. Is that is that literally sometime in November we'll start to see that? And then, just talk about what that's going to do in terms of trying to access new patients but also converting existing G6 users over to G7. Any kind of disruption that that could cause in Q4 for then early next year? Thanks. \nKevin Sayer : Yeah. Hey Matt. We have Jake here right now who's familiar with. So Jake, what do you think? \nJake Leach : Yeah, sure. So, we are very excited about transitioning our G6 AID users over to G7 once those pump partners have compatibility. That\u2019s coming very rapidly. And we really think it's going to be important for those users to be able to access the benefits of G7. It's the most accurate sensor. So having that driving those AID systems, we\u2019re really looking forward to seeing that out in the marketplace.  No real disruption. Those users will basically just switch over for tandem at the firmware update to the pumps and they'll just switch over to G6 or to G7 once they get their G6 supplies are utilized, and they get the new prescription for G7. So, very much looking forward to that product be in the field. \nMatthew O'Brien: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blackman with Stifel. Please go ahead. \nMatthew Blackman: Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So we did a big CDM survey last month and one of the most interesting takeaways were very positive early expectations for the non-insulin opportunity. Docs expecting peak penetration over time so to approach the 50 plus percent range and with a pretty steep adoption curve. So it really does seems so much similar to the type 2 intensive roll out. Just hoping for any color on how that tracks versus your expectations for non-insulin assuming some reimbursement over time? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks. \nKevin Sayer : You know what? I'll take that one. And I appreciate the question and that's long been our view. And in fact, one of the things I tell the guys here frequently is, well, it took us many years to build the intensive insulin marketing and get this technology adopted rapidly. I don't believe the curve is going to be near that long in this type two world.  Once people start using this product and we gear an experience towards what will be meaningful to them, because what is meaningful to them is different than the ones meaningful to our current patients again driven by the performance of our product, and they have accurate data. But once we get an experience that enhances their lives with respect to the performance of their medications for what exercise does, what they're various nutrition does in their lives and can add other insights from other sensors we think we can create a tremendous healthcare experience in this market.  And we do think we can ultimately push towards reimbursement and possibly we encouraged to have a new product category, altogether for those individuals. We are pretty thrilled about it. I think it's going to be a great, great opportunity. \nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. And Matt it's and thank you for that study. Obviously, we saw it as well. In terms of timing, I think one of the things that our obligation as a management team is to make sure as we start to see it as we launch products that are geared to this population, we keep you in line with what we see. So we can have a collective understanding about where that market is going over time. So be assured as we start to get more line of sight into and obviously, you can tell we're very bullish on the opportunity. We'll make sure we communicate that as quarters proceed. \nMatthew Blackman: Thank you. Appreciate it everybody. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Please go ahead. \nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much for taking the question and let me also say great quarter. One of the things that really stuck out to me this quarter was margins and operating margins, of course that you were tied but even your SG&A was well contained, does this create a new - I don't know, go forward rate? Or how to how do I think about this? Because that's for, that's quite nice. \nKevin Sayer : Yeah, thanks for that question. I'll take the, the portion on gross margin and then Jereme can talk about operating margin. So, with gross margin, we're really thrilled with the results this quarter. It's really a testament to how well our operations teams are executing across both G6 and G7. Our yields on the G7 scale up were a little ahead of where we planned which is a fantastic thing to in place to be.  As we look at the transition from the AID patients from G6 to G7, one of the things that is implied in our guide there for gross margin for the year and into next year as we look in the long range, we are going to be switching those patients over G7, which G7 today is at a slightly lower gross margin just based on the where it is and its product life cycle. G6 is a higher margin product today.  Over time, as we do switch our base all over to G7 and continue to scale that product, we have a very good path to getting to lower costs than G6 on that over time. But what we're trying to be on that guidance transparent around the margin - gross margin for the product just as we do that transition. \nJereme Sylvain : Yeah. And then to your question on operating margin and how our spend profile lays out, it\u2019s certainly a great quarter and I think we're really happy with it. At the end of the day, we raised our full year guidance to 19% on the Op margin perspective and that's on the back of some of the work we're doing around it. At Investor Day we talked about a cost to execute initiative and a lot of that was around driving profitability. So I think you can expect us to continue to look at driving operating margin over time. There will be ebbs and flows as we invest in the business for growth. And so, I think it's reasonable to expect ebbs and flows, but I'll kind of rewind back to where we started the year, right? When we are JPMorgan we issued guidance of around 16.5% operating margin and now we're talking about exiting the year at 19%.  And that's just all around the work of just being highly efficient around how we deliver service, how we deliver support, how we look to acquire customers. All of the things that we try to do. You can tell we are absolutely focused on making sure we do so in an efficient manner while continuing to reinvest in the business. \nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please go ahead. \nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I will admit I missed most of the prepared comments. I jumped on right as Matt O'Brien was asking his question. But it was a G7 integration question for Matt and Jake from your answer, I just wanted to ask one follow-up question, I guess if I could. We\u2019ve started to hear just in the last week or two that maybe there's a, maybe newer version of G7 that has to come along to fully integrate with control IQ.  Just if you've been clear, if I what I'm hearing in the field or help me understand what I'm hearing in the field and that that newer version of G7 is only going to be available for the first couple months here in the DME channel and eventually in pharmacy as of January 1. So what's going on there? And is that anything at all from an investor perspective we need to think about worry about impact numbers at all?  It doesn't sound like to me, but just would love the insight there. Thanks. \nKevin Sayer : Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the question, Jeff. So, yeah, as we continually scale the G7 platform, we've actually made several enhancements to the product both on the software side. But also on the hardware side items. And so we actually recently made an update to the Bluetooth capability on the product, both increasing the frequency that it can reconnect to a device, as well as the performance of the Bluetooth radio itself. So that product is compatible with the tandem pump and is already shipping globally, both here in the US and internationally. And we don't expect there to be any issue with people being able to upgrade their tandem pumps to the G7 compatibility. \nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. And Jeff, no, Marge and concerns. No question. This is really far for the course in what we do in terms of iterations over time. A lot of times you don't necessarily hear about it. We went through this with the G6, you'll remember it, We had a transmitter swap out which ultimately came through at a lower cost higher performance.  I would expect more of these types of changes over time whether it's software, and hardware as we continue to make improvements to the platform over time as part of just continuous improvement.\nJeff Johnson: The DME is only availability through the end of this year. Is that just to control kind of access initially or just anything I'm missing there? \nKevin Sayer : No, there's nothing you're missing there. There's a product that'll be out in all channels. And so really I think what you're hearing is, is timing questions about when you burn through things. That's, I think more anecdotal than anything else. Everybody's going to be able to have access to this thing in short order. It might start through the DME, just because that's the channel that you can generally start through. But this product will be available everywhere. \nJereme Sylvain: Well, and that also accommodates a lot of our tandem pumpers because they get a lot of their products. Supplies through the DME channel to you Jeff. So, this has been well thought out. \nJeff Johnson: Perfect. Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nTravis Steed: Congrats everybody on the good quarter. Maybe just talk about the buyback, the thought process for the buyback. How much of that\u2019s related to the convert versus to seeing or stock at a attractive valuation and is buyback something we should think about - going forward now that you've got your free cash flow at a good level? \nJereme Sylvain: Yeah, so we think about the buybacks in multiple different ways. Certainly, we want to limit dilution and that's something we always think about as we launch converts. One of the other things we do, when we launch converts is obviously they come at a lower cash cost. And so when we have the opportunity to take the incremental cash that we're making through those and give that back to shareholders, we certainly do so. And then, look, at the end of the day well it's not for us to comment on share price. That\u2019s certainly for others. We are highly, highly, highly bullish on our business over the long term. And so when we see an opportunity to invest in our business, either in the form of investment and capabilities, or by purchasing stock back, we certainly want to take those opportunities,. Whether or not we, we do these all the time, look, it\u2019s been two consecutive years we've done that. So it's something we'll certainly always look at. You can tell we're not shy about it, but we'll always take a look at it and make sure that we're opportunistic around it, as well as you know, representing the bullishness we have in our business. \nTravis Steed: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Please go ahead. \nMarie Thibault: Hey. Great quarter. Thanks for taking the question. I hope you could just expand on the comment in the prepared remarks about a even more pronounced dynamic of complementarity between CGM use and the GLP-1s. Just curious to get more details on the magnitude of that and any thoughts on why that would be the more pronounced with the latest generation? Thanks. \nKevin Sayer: Well, this is Kevin. I'll have Jeremy jump into because he's more familiar with the underlying data than I am. But the underlying data as we research as much as we can indicates with the new compounds of the physicians are also prescribing CGM for the GLP-1 users as they add GLP-1 to diabetes therapies they're already existing. They want to give these patients a scoreboard to let them know how they're doing and they're seeing very good results from the GLP-1s in combination with other therapies, they're on. And then you add a sensor to it, you can see. Okay, I've taken this drug and look at my habits have changed.  Look how my average glucose has changed over the course of a week or a month versus where it was before. And so we think we're a vital tool in a very good tool and the underlying data that we're seeing in prescriptions supports that. I don\u2019t know Jereme if you have anything else to add. \nJereme Sylvain : No, that's exactly it. You're asking kind of the why the reason, Marie, I mean, we have clinicians tell us all the time to administer drugs as potent as these are and ultimately to ensure that they are effective both while they're on the drug and while they're coming off the drug and how they ultimately engage going forward.  There's a high correlation of interest in CGM and the more and more folks we speak to they're saying, why wouldn't you want to understand what's going on in the body has to how to better understand, one to titrate the drugs, but then how to change behaviors and get folks off the drugs over the long haul. So you're just seeing more and more of that and the script data proves it. \nMarie Thibault: Very good. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from William Plovanic with Cannacord. Please go ahead. \nCaitlin Cronin: Hi, this is Caitlin on for Bill Plovanic and yeah congrats on a great quarter. Just maybe I touch on the non-insulin product. I think you mentioned that it was going to come about next summer. Anymore color you can provide on the specific product features, you haven't talked about before and any updates kind of on the price corner where you are with payer conversations. Thank you. \nJake Leach: Yeah, this is Jake. I'll take the first part about the product. So, yeah, we're extremely excited about it. We've already finished the clinical trial required for that submission for the end of this year, for the product. It's 15 day meets ICGM criteria. So, really, really excited about that. And the product is all about helping people really engage with their health.  So it is a different - completely different software experience than what our G series and Dexcom ONE products are. I'm not going to get into all the specific features yet. But rest assured, our focus is to ensure that people will get the benefit of CGM and basically helping them connect the dots to their lifestyle. And it's really important tool help them learn about no matter what therapy they're on. And how their metabolic health can be improved. And so, really excited. Teams just finishing up validations on the product. We're looking forward to launching it next year. \nTerry Lauver : And Caitlin, hi, it's Terry. Thanks for the question. This product, like, all of our products starts with unique insights into the needs of our customers. So, we're really excited to bring a product to the market that is designed specifically for those who are not on insulin. This is a highly motivated group, but it has different needs, different health needs, different lifestyle needs, and different products and feature needs versus those who are on insulin.  So we've designed the product specifically for that group understanding what additional medications they might be on. And we are excited to bring this to the market probably in summer of next year, is what we're tracking to. \nKevin Sayer: And over time, we'll look for reimbursement. We've talked about this as a cash pay option to start and that's how we'll do it as far as the exact pricing that remains to be determined when we launch. We are not going to give that out yet. So we're excited as you can tell.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nJayson Bedford: Thanks and good afternoon. So, two questions that require one word answers. What's the, what's the timeline on basal coverage in France? And then, maybe for Jereme, what\u2019s the annual revenue contribution from that business they expect to sell off and looking the first half of \u201824. \nJereme Sylvain : Yeah. So, easy answers, basal expected 2024 in France. Timing exactly will depend on the government bodies, but we expect it in the first half of 2024 and the approximate contribution from the business being spun off is $30 million annual run rate. \nJayson Bedford: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nMichael Polark: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. In the prepared remark, you mentioned you believe you have gained share across all reimbursement channels and segments and then added even in non-reimbursed channels. I'm curious, I'm in clearly we know about the innovation work here and the product launch and that might be the answer.  But is there anything commercially you're doing different in the cash pay market today that\u2019s influencing that comment? \nKevin Sayer: No, we do have a cash pay program right now with G7. But we've not done anything significant. I'll go back mainly to our coverage. I mean, G7 coverage is coming to a rate much faster than anything we've done before. Not just on the basal side, but also on the intensive insulin side in every place else. So we're widely covered and people find it very easy to get and very easy to pick it up in the channel that they choose to pursue.  And we offer the cash pay program and that there are people taking advantage of it. They like G7. They liked the different form factor. The ease of use in the things that we offer. So we have seen an increase there. But it's not something we're pushing really hard. \nMichael Polark: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead. \nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. Congrats guys. Obviously a lot of focus on basal as expected, but you do of course have coverage now for non-insulin hypo at risk, which is sizable population in its own right? Can you talk about what you're hearing from physicians on the use of CGM there? And are you hearing anything in the field that changes your initial view on how big that opportunity can be in particular? \nTerry Lauver: Thanks Steve. It's Terry. We're only about six months since the implementation of that CMS decision. So it's still an evolving landscape for the problematic hypoglycemia group. But we see a real opportunity to continue to build coverage with the payers to continue to educate them.  And to build education with the HCP community keeping in mind that this is a population where historically we haven't thought a lot about CGM use and utilization. But the data that we now have that supported the CMS decision and that we will continue to build to bring to the payers is really compelling. So we see a tremendous opportunity here and one that's still quite niche \u2013 and with a lot of upside in the future. \nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. \nJosh Jennings: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I know you have a lot in front of you with type 2 basal and the cash pay product being launched next year. But you did mention that you're pursuing reimbursement, Kevin, for type two, and non-insulin using patients. I was just hoping to better understand the roadmap that the clinical development program and should the investors would be thinking two to three years for that potential reimbursement to come in or it\u2019s three to five years?  And then just on top of that, just what's giving you optimism that you can show a clinically meaningful and statistically reduction. If anyone seeing that type two non-insulin using population, I think you had some registry data and I know you had some registry data at ADA this year. But any other signals and drivers of your confidence. Thanks. \nKevin Sayer: Like, we have done numerous studies and every time we introduce CGM to this population, we see lower A1C, higher time and range and all the other vital signs of these patients get better. And so, we're confident that we have a positive impact. I'll add a couple of other things that we've heard in my own travels and travels with the group.  One of the things everybody is concerned about is adherence to meds. With CGM, we can - patients can see what happens when they adhere to their meds. And when they taken it whichever type two therapy they're on, they can see what happens if they take their metformin every morning or their SGLT two pill or even the effect of their GLP-1 injection every week, they can see what happens and that adherence the drugs leads to better, health on overall basis.  And let's be clear. It's not like diabetes growth to slow down anywhere. Diabetes still continues to grow rapidly in the constant diabetes care, as great as all of our technologies have been continues to increase. So, if we can be a cog in that wheel to whereby we add an element of cost, it's not that significant when you look at the grand scheme of things, but can reduce many other costs and could reduce complications as they spend on other things and possibly slow down the train on some of the meds people have to move to. We think we have a great role to play here.  And that's how we look at it. I don't think it's going to take five years. I think this is more of two to three year journey, but you know what, that's the gospel according to me. I don't have anything else to base that on, but you'll see data continue to pile up in this segment particularly as we launch a cash pay product to start and then get some basic reimbursement from that from others for making our case.  Obviously, building a case with CMS like we did for mobile on basal that was data produced by Dexcom. We're pretty good at that. So we'll keep pushing. \nJosh Jennings: Great. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic was Barclays. Please go ahead. \nMatt Miksic: Hey, good afternoon and congrats on the quarter and appreciate all the all the color today on the call. If I could follow up on a comment you made Kevin earlier about the number of new prescribers posts driven by the G7 launch and get some color if you could share it around, is that, that sort of getting further into the sort of simple, simplicity \u2013 simple user segment of the market? Is it linked to any way to the basal coverage? What you're assessment of what's been driving that? And, other than G7, just being great. But and then also, maybe the implications for share trends in the US if that continues? Thanks. \nJereme Sylvain: Yeah, hey, Matt this is Jereme. I can take this. And by the way, it's all intentional, right? We have a commercial team that's done an incredible job of identifying areas to go and doctors to really certainly focus on where we can come in with the products demonstrate obviously it's the most accurate, certainly, it's easy to use.  And with the coverage we have, I think it really demonstrates to the physicians and their prescribing patterns. Look, we can we have the lowest out of pockets for these patients and we can ultimately keep them on therapy and adherence for a much longer period. So, I think that in addition to obviously G7 and all the features it has inherent and it has allowed these physicians to make the change.  But it's so wonderful product, wonderful coverage and absolutely intentionality by the sales team. I mean just it's a great job by those - that team identifying who those targets are going out there and addressing it. So, it's no coincidence and that 18,000 incremental prescribers, a significant amount in the PCP space and a lot of folks are switching.  These PCPs are switching from who they prescribe today and moving over to Dexcom. So we're really proud of it and obviously it was a 1,000 in the first quarter, 8,000 in the second quarter and another 9,000 this quarter. So it is the message is getting out and its meaningful. \nMatt Miksic: That's great. Thank you for the color. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. \nMike Kratky: Yeah, hi everyone. Thanks for taking our question, Just going back to basal only, what's the latest basal only commercial coverage you have in place? And how are you thinking about what the cadence and what's needed to bridge that gap to get more full coverage? \nTerry Lauver: This is Terry. Happy to take that one. We track coverage very closely for Dexcom and for the industry and Dexcom is the most covered CGM with the lowest out of socket copay. That is true for the overall population in US commercial lives and it's also true for the basal population. That I would say, keep in mind that we were out with the mobile study in front of the payers, even before the CMS decision came through. So we continue to look into lead in the coverage for this population. \nJereme Sylvain: Yeah, and then, your question was as how much - what more do we need to go. The answer is, it's not more. A lot of commercial payers were already really covering this. Now Terry referenced we have the most wide covered - coverage on basal. It's really now just - it's time. It takes time to get in front of payers, Medicaid payers, government payers.  And so, it's, it's just canvassing, and by the way, this is not something that we didn't face with type 1, it's not something we didn't face with type 2 intensive. And so just give us time, but a majority of people walking around with using basal insulin now have access to CGM technology. It's a wonderful thing to the population. \nMike Kratky: Understood. Thanks very much. \nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session for today. I will now turn to call over to Mr. Kevin Sayer for closing remarks. \nKevin Sayer: Thank you. This was truly a banner quarter for us. This was our first quarter with over $200 million in year-over-year quarterly growth. And the second consecutive quarter of record financial performance and market share gains on all fronts. Our G7 launch remains in its early stages. There is tremendous amount of minimum left in this launch with our plan upgrades to the system and also, our upcoming AID integrations.  In addition to continuing to perform in these traditional metrics, our company\u2019s growth is a world-class organization on a number of fronts continues to be recognized. Dexcom is recognized by Forbes as one of the top five organizations to work for in the State of California. By the way, three of the top five universities, so we're one of two companies in that group. We\u2019re recognized by News Week as one of the 300 top green organizations acknowledging our great work our teams to advance our sustainability initiatives and we are considering this very thoroughly in all of our product development efforts going forward.  Finally, we've been recognized by FAST Technologies as one of the brands that matters. Great honors for our company. I want to thank everybody here at Dexcom who makes these great things happen and thank everybody for your continued support. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect  Thank you.  Next calm. Third quarter twenty conference. You may now disconnect",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today we reported another great quarter for Dexcom with third quarter organic revenue growth of 26% compared to the third quarter of 2022. This year is proving to be one of the most exciting periods in our company's history. Access is expanding faster than ever before and we are seeing new levels of enthusiasm for our differentiated products. This can be seen firsthand in our broader rollout of G7 in the US.  Building upon our legacy of being the most accurate sensor G7's focus on simplicity and affordability continues to attract new customers and prescribers to our platform. Similar to last quarter, the majority of G7 customers continue to be new to Dexcom and we took yet another step forward in expanding our prescribing base.  There are now nearly 18,000 physicians writing scripts for Dexcom, they were not prescribing our products before the G7 launch. This represents a notable increase in our prescribing community in only a short period of time as more clinicians recognize G7's unique feature set, ease of use and market-leading levels of coverage.  This combination has made it incredibly easy for physicians to prescribe Dexcom CGM and drive greater levels of engagement within their patient populations. Additionally, our new G7 software platform is enhancing our value proposition across all patient types. We've implemented new software updates almost monthly since launch with improvements to features like connectivity and alarm personalization.  As one example, we have established new lines of communication in our app to simplify the process of engaging with our customers. We are constantly working behind the scenes to improve the customer experience. And we will continue to operate with this type of focus to ensure that we have the most user-friendly and engaging products on the market.  Our customers know that when you join the Dexcom ecosystem, you get all the benefits today and tomorrow associated with our leading innovation. Our latest product cycle has also coincided with the largest expansion of coverage in our company's history. With significant reimbursement now established beyond intensive insulin use, there are more people with covered access to Dexcom CGM than ever before.  As a reminder, Medicare coverage went live in mid-April for people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only, as well as certain non-insulin individuals that experience hypoglycemia. Collectively, these two populations represent nearly seven million people on the US with approximately half being at Medicare age.  Encouragingly, commercial coverage continues to build for this group. We've established market-leading levels of basal-only reimbursement as payers clearly recognize the potential for better outcomes driven by Dexcom. This further supports our industry low out-of-pocket cost for our customers. With a full quarter of broad coverage now under our belt, we continue to be very encouraged by early prescribing trends for this cohort.  We know that last quarter that we experienced an immediate uptick in new patient starts once coverage went live and we have seen a clear continuation of this trend since that time. In fact, we delivered another record Medicare new patient start quarter in Q3 as physicians have quickly adjusted their prescribing patterns to match the new reimbursement landscape.  While early basal adoption trends look very similar to those we previously experienced, once broad coverage became available for intensely managed type 2 diabetes. We view this as a very positive sign of things to come. Importantly, when you combine this broader coverage with our leading center technology, we feel incredibly confident in our market position. Since the launch of G7 we have gained share across all reimburse channels and patient segments in the US and that trend continued this quarter. Even among non-reimburse channels we are seeing more and more interest in Dexcom CGM.  We are also seeing similar dynamics across our international footprint. We have never been better positioned to compete globally from a product, access or capacity perspective and we once again, took international share this quarter as a result. Our product portfolio continues to be a key contributor to this success.  By having multiple products available, we can tailor our offerings to meet the unique needs of individual geographies and reimbursement structures. A great example of this was seen in Francis past quarter where DexCom ONE secured reimbursement for all people on intensive insulin therapy, which represents around half a million people and we have submitted our evidence to extend ad coverage to the basal population.  In addition to advancing our product offerings, we've been continuously working to build greater commercial scale and flexibility to serve each market more effectively. As we discussed at our Investor Day, one way to drive scale is through the conversion of key international markets from distributor to direct operations.  Historically, these conversions have been followed by a notable uptick in performance, as we provide greater levels of support and focus to these markets once we oversee all facets of sales and distribution. Along those lines, we recently made the strategic decision to go direct in Japan. As a reminder, Japan became one of the first countries to establish broad reimbursement for anyone taking insulin late last year, representing more than one million lives.  Despite this the market remains in its very early stages, and we will continue to work to drive much greater CGM adoption over time as we initiate direct sales in the second quarter of next year.  Finally, at EASD this month, we added to our substantial base of distinctive clinical evidence with new data around long term Dexcom CGM outcomes and inheritance the impact of Dexcom ONE for type two, diabetes and performance within the pregnancy setting. Study after study, we continue to demonstrate Dexcom's position as a cornerstone within the evolving diabetes care, and metabolic help landscape.  Across a wide range of customers and care settings our product plays a unique role in providing real-time information that can drive behavior change, greater patient accountability, and more informed therapy decisions. Like everyone else, we have also been interested to see the latest data behind new drug therapies.  We believe these drugs playing important role in the care continuum and it is encouraging to see new solutions emerging and a growing appreciation around the need for better and earlier care. Data continues to demonstrate that clinicians prefer to use CGM together with these drugs to drive the best possible outcomes.  In fact, we shared claims data this quarter that showed prescribing trends for CGM increase once someone is initiated GLP-1 therapy as clinicians favor Dexcom for both its protective features and ability to support lifestyle management. As an update, we looked at trailing 12 month data through August 2023 would suggest this dynamic is even more pronounced among the newest generation of these drugs.  The data clearly showed that CGM usage grows faster and GLP-1users, then those who are not on therapy. This further demonstrates the complementary nature of Dexcom CGM across all therapy regimes in diabetes. As we look forward, we continue to ensure that we advance our unique role within the ecosystem of care as we progress, our mission of empowering people to take control of health.  This will include launching new products such as our non-insulin product coming next summer, as well as advancing our ongoing clinical work across much broader populations. We are still very early in our story in terms of potential impact and the number of lives we can ultimately touch. Our future is incredibly bright.  With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the third quarter financials. Jereme? Thanks Jereme. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. We also have Jake Leach, our Chief Operating Officer and Terry Lauver, our Chief Commercial Officer joining us for our question, answer session. Sean? Margaret, it's Kevin, I'll take that. We have had discussions with the societies on expanding coverage for people with type 2 diabetes not on insulin. And those discussions continue. We've seen a gradual uptick for lack of a better word in the guidelines as CGM use from all professionals societies over the last several years.  And as we gather more data, as we see more data come in from studies we're aware of over the next 12 months, we believe we can continue to build a better case. Every time we run a study or look at a study from this population in this group, people on CGM do better. It's just simple. They have better outcomes. They're more adherent to their meds. They have a feedback loop that they don't have any other way.  We're very excited about this opportunity. That's why we're going with the product where we've talked about filing before the end of the year and launching next year, our product is designed for people not on insulin. And we think it's going to be a great product offering on this front going forward. So we're looking forward to it, and I think we'll be able to write this script the same way we've written the script in our industry so far. Well, certainly, we think about partnering with the drug companies, but they're doing so well. Right now, they're very busy. We do have relationships them and have had discussions. With respect to studies we certainly talk about some of those internally.  We saw clinical evidence over at the EASD Meeting recently where that was a large topic of discussion that the team brought back and we're very aware of studies coming out over the first half of 2024 that are going to show some of these data for the use of these combo of these new drugs and CGM in combination and how that works for people.  So we know there's evidence coming in investigator initiated studies. And we're looking at some of our own right now. I think today will continue to support it. Yeah. Hey Matt. We have Jake here right now who's familiar with. So Jake, what do you think? You know what? I'll take that one. And I appreciate the question and that's long been our view. And in fact, one of the things I tell the guys here frequently is, well, it took us many years to build the intensive insulin marketing and get this technology adopted rapidly. I don't believe the curve is going to be near that long in this type two world.  Once people start using this product and we gear an experience towards what will be meaningful to them, because what is meaningful to them is different than the ones meaningful to our current patients again driven by the performance of our product, and they have accurate data. But once we get an experience that enhances their lives with respect to the performance of their medications for what exercise does, what they're various nutrition does in their lives and can add other insights from other sensors we think we can create a tremendous healthcare experience in this market.  And we do think we can ultimately push towards reimbursement and possibly we encouraged to have a new product category, altogether for those individuals. We are pretty thrilled about it. I think it's going to be a great, great opportunity. Yeah, thanks for that question. I'll take the, the portion on gross margin and then Jereme can talk about operating margin. So, with gross margin, we're really thrilled with the results this quarter. It's really a testament to how well our operations teams are executing across both G6 and G7. Our yields on the G7 scale up were a little ahead of where we planned which is a fantastic thing to in place to be.  As we look at the transition from the AID patients from G6 to G7, one of the things that is implied in our guide there for gross margin for the year and into next year as we look in the long range, we are going to be switching those patients over G7, which G7 today is at a slightly lower gross margin just based on the where it is and its product life cycle. G6 is a higher margin product today.  Over time, as we do switch our base all over to G7 and continue to scale that product, we have a very good path to getting to lower costs than G6 on that over time. But what we're trying to be on that guidance transparent around the margin - gross margin for the product just as we do that transition. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the question, Jeff. So, yeah, as we continually scale the G7 platform, we've actually made several enhancements to the product both on the software side. But also on the hardware side items. And so we actually recently made an update to the Bluetooth capability on the product, both increasing the frequency that it can reconnect to a device, as well as the performance of the Bluetooth radio itself. So that product is compatible with the tandem pump and is already shipping globally, both here in the US and internationally. And we don't expect there to be any issue with people being able to upgrade their tandem pumps to the G7 compatibility. No, there's nothing you're missing there. There's a product that'll be out in all channels. And so really I think what you're hearing is, is timing questions about when you burn through things. That's, I think more anecdotal than anything else. Everybody's going to be able to have access to this thing in short order. It might start through the DME, just because that's the channel that you can generally start through. But this product will be available everywhere. Well, this is Kevin. I'll have Jeremy jump into because he's more familiar with the underlying data than I am. But the underlying data as we research as much as we can indicates with the new compounds of the physicians are also prescribing CGM for the GLP-1 users as they add GLP-1 to diabetes therapies they're already existing. They want to give these patients a scoreboard to let them know how they're doing and they're seeing very good results from the GLP-1s in combination with other therapies, they're on. And then you add a sensor to it, you can see. Okay, I've taken this drug and look at my habits have changed.  Look how my average glucose has changed over the course of a week or a month versus where it was before. And so we think we're a vital tool in a very good tool and the underlying data that we're seeing in prescriptions supports that. I don't know Jereme if you have anything else to add. And over time, we'll look for reimbursement. We've talked about this as a cash pay option to start and that's how we'll do it as far as the exact pricing that remains to be determined when we launch. We are not going to give that out yet. So we're excited as you can tell. No, we do have a cash pay program right now with G7. But we've not done anything significant. I'll go back mainly to our coverage. I mean, G7 coverage is coming to a rate much faster than anything we've done before. Not just on the basal side, but also on the intensive insulin side in every place else. So we're widely covered and people find it very easy to get and very easy to pick it up in the channel that they choose to pursue.  And we offer the cash pay program and that there are people taking advantage of it. They like G7. They liked the different form factor. The ease of use in the things that we offer. So we have seen an increase there. But it's not something we're pushing really hard. Like, we have done numerous studies and every time we introduce CGM to this population, we see lower A1C, higher time and range and all the other vital signs of these patients get better. And so, we're confident that we have a positive impact. I'll add a couple of other things that we've heard in my own travels and travels with the group.  One of the things everybody is concerned about is adherence to meds. With CGM, we can - patients can see what happens when they adhere to their meds. And when they taken it whichever type two therapy they're on, they can see what happens if they take their metformin every morning or their SGLT two pill or even the effect of their GLP-1 injection every week, they can see what happens and that adherence the drugs leads to better, health on overall basis.  And let's be clear. It's not like diabetes growth to slow down anywhere. Diabetes still continues to grow rapidly in the constant diabetes care, as great as all of our technologies have been continues to increase. So, if we can be a cog in that wheel to whereby we add an element of cost, it's not that significant when you look at the grand scheme of things, but can reduce many other costs and could reduce complications as they spend on other things and possibly slow down the train on some of the meds people have to move to. We think we have a great role to play here.  And that's how we look at it. I don't think it's going to take five years. I think this is more of two to three year journey, but you know what, that's the gospel according to me. I don't have anything else to base that on, but you'll see data continue to pile up in this segment particularly as we launch a cash pay product to start and then get some basic reimbursement from that from others for making our case.  Obviously, building a case with CMS like we did for mobile on basal that was data produced by Dexcom. We're pretty good at that. So we'll keep pushing. Thank you. This was truly a banner quarter for us. This was our first quarter with over $200 million in year-over-year quarterly growth. And the second consecutive quarter of record financial performance and market share gains on all fronts. Our G7 launch remains in its early stages. There is tremendous amount of minimum left in this launch with our plan upgrades to the system and also, our upcoming AID integrations.  In addition to continuing to perform in these traditional metrics, our company's growth is a world-class organization on a number of fronts continues to be recognized. Dexcom is recognized by Forbes as one of the top five organizations to work for in the State of California. By the way, three of the top five universities, so we're one of two companies in that group. We're recognized by News Week as one of the 300 top green organizations acknowledging our great work our teams to advance our sustainability initiatives and we are considering this very thoroughly in all of our product development efforts going forward.  Finally, we've been recognized by FAST Technologies as one of the brands that matters. Great honors for our company. I want to thank everybody here at Dexcom who makes these great things happen and thank everybody for your continued support. Thank you."

            "name": "Jereme Sylvain",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation is to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  For the third quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $975 million compared to $770 million for the third quarter of 2022, representing growth of 27% on a reported basis and 26% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency, in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing, 12 months.  US revenue totaled $714 million for the third quarter, compared to $573 million in the third quarter of 2022, representing growth of 24%. Between the ongoing success of our G7 launch and significant expansion of coverage for Dexcom this year, our US business is really hitting its stride. This is particularly noticeable when looking at our new customer start trends which again outpaced our expectations for this quarter.  This dynamic has now played out for several quarters in a row and we are seeing the direct result of that continued momentum. In the third quarter, we saw revenue growth accelerate compared to last quarter and we delivered our fastest quarterly growth rate in over two years.  International revenue grew 33% totaling $261 million in the third quarter. International organic revenue growth was 30% for the third quarter. We continued to execute incredibly well in our international markets. Our product portfolio strategy, ongoing access work and growing commercial traction helped us again gain share this quarter.  We had a particularly strong quarter across our European footprint as we saw growth remained similar to the accelerated level we saw in the second quarter. An item of note is we did have slower growth coming from our non-CGM business as well as relatively flat performance in Japan, as we worked with our distributor partner to start the process of transitioning to direct sales.  As a reminder, when we made our distributor acquisition in 2021, we also inherited a business that distributed products outside of the diabetes space. We recently made the decision to spin off this unit to focus entirely on our CGM and diabetes technologies in this region which we think will enhance our execution in the market. We expect the deal to close in early 2024 and we want to thank our employees for their continued strong work through the transition in the space.  Our third quarter gross profit was $630 million or 64.7% of revenue, compared to 64.2% of revenue in the third quarter of 2022. We are very proud of our gross margin performance in the quarter. This is another testament to the top tier work our operations team continues to deliver this year. Despite managing through a new product launch, we have improved yields on both the G6 and G7 platforms. In addition, Q3 gross margins benefited from a stronger than expected mix of G6 customers as our pump users eagerly await G7AID integration.  When this transition starts in the coming weeks, we expect an acceleration in our base shift to G7. While G7 currently has a higher unit cost profile than G6 and will over the near term, we expect this to become our highest margin product as we drive greater volumes and economies of scale over the course of 2024 and beyond.  Operating expenses were $392 million for Q3 of 2023, compared to $333 million in Q3 of 2022. Our focus on cost management again stood out this quarter as we delivered over 300 basis points of operating expense leverage. This now marks the seventh straight quarter that we have generated at least 250 basis points of year-over-year operating expense leverage. We will continue to invest in the growth of the business while finding ways to be even more efficient.  Operating income was $238.9, million or 24.5% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023, compared to $160.8 million or 20.9% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. This margin represents a new quarterly record for Dexcom.  Adjusted EBITDA was $314.5 million or 32.3% of revenue for the third quarter, compared to $226.6 million or 29.4% of revenue for the third quarter of 2022. This margin also represents a new quarterly record for Dexcom.  Net income in the third quarter was $203 million or $0.50 per share. We remain in a very strong financial position as we closed out the quarter with greater than $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our ability to generate consistent and growing free cash flow is becoming more apparent every quarter and we delivered the highest free cash flow quarter in our company's history in Q3.  This provides us a lot of flexibility to be thoughtful and opportunistic in our capital allocation decisions. Along those lines, we are excited to announce a $500 million share repurchase program today. Given our very strong underlying fundamentals and outlook, we see, this is a great time step into the market and buyback our stock.  This program also provides the added benefit of more than offsetting any remaining dilution related to our 2023 convertible notes as the remainder of these are reaching maturity in the coming weeks.  Turning to guidance, we are raising our full year 2023 revenue guidance to a range of $3.575 billion to $3.6 billion representing growth of 23% to 24% for the year. Our updated revenue guidance reflects an increase of over $60 million at the midpoint, compared to our previous guidance. It is more than $165 million higher than where we guided to start the year.  From a margin perspective, we are raising our full year non-GAAP gross margin guidance to approximately 64%. We are also increasing our non-GAAP operating and adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for the year to approximately 19% and 28% respectively.  With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. Hey, thanks, Robbie. This is Jereme. Appreciate the comments. I can take that one and we address it from there. In terms of what the contribution was this quarter from basal, obviously we had a really strong quarter this quarter, record new patients once again and obviously raised the guide on the year. Now some of that does come from basal. There's no question there as we continue to open up reimbursement. The new patients are coming along and Kevin mentioned it. We're starting to see basal follow similar patterns to type two intensive, which, when you think about coming into this year, it's about 40% to 45% adoption, but really the curve is starting to follow that. So we're very excited about the opportunity there. And so that's in the US and certainly clearly that's playing out here.  In terms of OUS, it's a great opportunity. One of the things we've seen outside the US is as access is created creates significant opportunities for growth. And you've seen our actions over the course of the past few years. We've created a lot of access for our products, and in turn our international markets have grown incredibly well and there's a large population outside the US that that this would ultimately apply it to once you have basal coverage.  So it could be an absolute - an absolute tailwind for us for years and years to come. It's something obviously we're very excited about. We don't get ahead of ourselves, right? We have to get that coverage in place. But the bullishness you hear about the US experience is what we would expect to see as more and more coverage comes and so we leave very excited about the future holds. Yeah, so thanks for the question, Larry. So, in terms of where the guide goes, I think you're right, it does imply a tad of a d-cell. Most of that I would say is related to really comps historically over time. And Larry you've tracked us for a while. So as we move more out of commercial, DME and into pharmacy, typically we have enough uptick into Q4 in those DME environments. As more and more of our of our folks go through the retail channel, you kind of lose some of that.  So really you're playing about it's really about seasonality within the course of a year. So we're not trying to imply anything. Really what we're trying to say is, this is the trajectory we see it going with seasonality. This is our - again, our base case, as we start to look at guidance over the course of the year. And so the trends - underlying trends if there's nothing to say there. I mean the underlying trends in this business remains strong.  I don't think we're trying to imply anything other than that. We do expect you kind of referenced Japan. There could be around the fringes until we go direct a little bit of a stable as opposed to necessarily growing story around Japan. And so that is around the fringe, but that represents a really small piece of the business on the international side. Really what you're seeing is just us being mindful about seasonality in our base case and then certainly if we can outperform, we'll do what we traditionally do, which is tried to do so. Yeah, really appreciate the congrats. Thanks. What we see is and Terry is here. So what I can do is, I can give you kind of what we're seeing maybe numbers wise, but maybe Terry can kind of take you into the day-to-day interaction with patients. Numbers wise, we haven't seen much of a change at this point. The population does has reorders relatively in the same capacity as in the past.  And so that's a good early indicator, but maybe Terry can take you through what she's hearing and seeing in the field around the excitement around basal and who wants to use it. Yeah. And Matt it's and thank you for that study. Obviously, we saw it as well. In terms of timing, I think one of the things that our obligation as a management team is to make sure as we start to see it as we launch products that are geared to this population, we keep you in line with what we see. So we can have a collective understanding about where that market is going over time. So be assured as we start to get more line of sight into and obviously, you can tell we're very bullish on the opportunity. We'll make sure we communicate that as quarters proceed. Yeah. And then to your question on operating margin and how our spend profile lays out, it's certainly a great quarter and I think we're really happy with it. At the end of the day, we raised our full year guidance to 19% on the Op margin perspective and that's on the back of some of the work we're doing around it. At Investor Day we talked about a cost to execute initiative and a lot of that was around driving profitability. So I think you can expect us to continue to look at driving operating margin over time. There will be ebbs and flows as we invest in the business for growth. And so, I think it's reasonable to expect ebbs and flows, but I'll kind of rewind back to where we started the year, right? When we are JPMorgan we issued guidance of around 16.5% operating margin and now we're talking about exiting the year at 19%.  And that's just all around the work of just being highly efficient around how we deliver service, how we deliver support, how we look to acquire customers. All of the things that we try to do. You can tell we are absolutely focused on making sure we do so in an efficient manner while continuing to reinvest in the business. Yeah. And Jeff, no, Marge and concerns. No question. This is really far for the course in what we do in terms of iterations over time. A lot of times you don't necessarily hear about it. We went through this with the G6, you'll remember it, We had a transmitter swap out which ultimately came through at a lower cost higher performance.  I would expect more of these types of changes over time whether it's software, and hardware as we continue to make improvements to the platform over time as part of just continuous improvement. Well, and that also accommodates a lot of our tandem pumpers because they get a lot of their products. Supplies through the DME channel to you Jeff. So, this has been well thought out. Yeah, so we think about the buybacks in multiple different ways. Certainly, we want to limit dilution and that's something we always think about as we launch converts. One of the other things we do, when we launch converts is obviously they come at a lower cash cost. And so when we have the opportunity to take the incremental cash that we're making through those and give that back to shareholders, we certainly do so. And then, look, at the end of the day well it's not for us to comment on share price. That's certainly for others. We are highly, highly, highly bullish on our business over the long term. And so when we see an opportunity to invest in our business, either in the form of investment and capabilities, or by purchasing stock back, we certainly want to take those opportunities,. Whether or not we, we do these all the time, look, it's been two consecutive years we've done that. So it's something we'll certainly always look at. You can tell we're not shy about it, but we'll always take a look at it and make sure that we're opportunistic around it, as well as you know, representing the bullishness we have in our business. No, that's exactly it. You're asking kind of the why the reason, Marie, I mean, we have clinicians tell us all the time to administer drugs as potent as these are and ultimately to ensure that they are effective both while they're on the drug and while they're coming off the drug and how they ultimately engage going forward.  There's a high correlation of interest in CGM and the more and more folks we speak to they're saying, why wouldn't you want to understand what's going on in the body has to how to better understand, one to titrate the drugs, but then how to change behaviors and get folks off the drugs over the long haul. So you're just seeing more and more of that and the script data proves it. Yeah. So, easy answers, basal expected 2024 in France. Timing exactly will depend on the government bodies, but we expect it in the first half of 2024 and the approximate contribution from the business being spun off is $30 million annual run rate. Yeah, hey, Matt this is Jereme. I can take this. And by the way, it's all intentional, right? We have a commercial team that's done an incredible job of identifying areas to go and doctors to really certainly focus on where we can come in with the products demonstrate obviously it's the most accurate, certainly, it's easy to use.  And with the coverage we have, I think it really demonstrates to the physicians and their prescribing patterns. Look, we can we have the lowest out of pockets for these patients and we can ultimately keep them on therapy and adherence for a much longer period. So, I think that in addition to obviously G7 and all the features it has inherent and it has allowed these physicians to make the change.  But it's so wonderful product, wonderful coverage and absolutely intentionality by the sales team. I mean just it's a great job by those - that team identifying who those targets are going out there and addressing it. So, it's no coincidence and that 18,000 incremental prescribers, a significant amount in the PCP space and a lot of folks are switching.  These PCPs are switching from who they prescribe today and moving over to Dexcom. So we're really proud of it and obviously it was a 1,000 in the first quarter, 8,000 in the second quarter and another 9,000 this quarter. So it is the message is getting out and its meaningful. Yeah, and then, your question was as how much - what more do we need to go. The answer is, it's not more. A lot of commercial payers were already really covering this. Now Terry referenced we have the most wide covered - coverage on basal. It's really now just - it's time. It takes time to get in front of payers, Medicaid payers, government payers.  And so, it's, it's just canvassing, and by the way, this is not something that we didn't face with type 1, it's not something we didn't face with type 2 intensive. And so just give us time, but a majority of people walking around with using basal insulin now have access to CGM technology. It's a wonderful thing to the population."

Today we reported another great quarter for Dexcom with second quarter organic revenue growth of 26% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Demand for Dexcom's CGM continues to grow as access to our product is expanding faster than at any time in our company's history. In the first half of 2023 alone, we broadened our product portfolio strategy, extended our geographic reach and meaningfully expanded reimbursed coverage for Dexcom CGM. As we sit at the midpoint of this pivotal year for our company, we have a lot to be excited about. In the U.S., our launch of G7 continues to gain momentum. Customers and clinicians alike are sharing consistently great feedback around G7's sevens ease of use, discrete form factor, faster warm up time and redesigned software platform. With this product, we've extended our leadership position in accuracy and product performance while taking a significant step forward in terms of simplicity. It has never been easier to use or prescribe a Dexcom CGM, and we are attracting new customers and prescribers to our ecosystem as a result. Similar to last quarter, we have seen a continuation of the trend that the majority of our G7 users have been new to Dexcom. Additionally, there are now 8,000 physicians writing scripts for G7 in the U.S that were previously not prescribing Dexcom. We designed G7 to hold broad market appeal, and these early prescribing trends are validating those efforts. Behind the scenes we continue to drive reimbursement for G7. As a reminder, we established Medicare and broad commercial DME coverage during the first quarter, while rapidly progressing our commercial pharmacy contracts. We further advanced this process in the second quarter as expected, and we are excited to share that all major PBMs now cover Dexcom G7. This occurred much faster than we originally anticipated and brings our total number of G7 covered lives nearly in line with our industry leading G6 levels. This further strengthens our position as the most covered CGM brand is we prioritize keeping out of pocket costs low for our customers. As a reminder, the majority of our customers are paying less than $20 a month out of pocket in the pharmacy channel, which is significantly less than our nearest competitor where the majority of customers are paying greater than $70 per month. We are also seeing G7 play a very important role for us as we move more broadly beyond intensive insulin management. We've taken a big step in that direction this year following the recent CMS decision to significantly expand coverage beyond intensive insulin use. As of mid April, Medicare coverage officially kicked in for people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only as well as certain non-insulin using individuals who have experienced hypoglycemia. This resulted in a true step change in coverage for the industry. As we estimate, these two populations represent around 6 million to 7 million people in the U.S with roughly half being of Medicare age. It has also been encouraging to see commercial payers quickly follow suit. We have already established greater than 60% commercial coverage for the basal population, which we view as a validation of Dexcom's value proposition by payers. We are thrilled to have this level of coverage established as quickly as it provides us much greater commercial flexibility to promote this opportunity. While still early, the initial response from the clinical community has been very encouraging. Physicians have wasted no time in prescribing Dexcom to their basal patients as they recognize a clear potential for better outcomes among this population. We have also seen excitement coming directly from members of the basal community who are interested in engaging with their glucose data to make more informed lifestyle decisions. As a result, we have seen a notable uptick in demand in our Medicare business. In fact, Q2 was our highest new patient quarter within the Medicare channel in the history of our company. Considering this was only a partial quarter of expanded coverage, we view this as a very positive sign of things to come. In our international business, our share gains accelerated in the second quarter as our ongoing access initiatives and product portfolio strategy have helped us reach many more people with diabetes across the globe. We expanded our international G7 launch in the second quarter into 6 new markets. G7 is being met with a lot of enthusiasm in our initial launch countries and we are excited to bring it to additional geographies in the coming months. This will include our launch of G7 into Canada where we recently received regulatory clearance. We have plenty of inventory on hand to support this broader rollout, particularly with our Malaysia facility now producing commercial product. Another key international lever for us has been our broader rollout of DexCom ONE. DexCom ONE has proven to accelerate our entrance into new markets, broaden access within existing geographies and even serve as a catalyst for reimbursement in certain regions. Perhaps most noteworthy this past quarter is that we officially launched DexCom ONE in Argentina, which marks our initial entrance into Latin America. We expect this to only be a starting point for us in that region as we continue to expand our global reach in coming years. Finally, we came away from the American Diabetes Association's 83rd Scientific Sessions as excited as ever about our future. This year's event added to the growing body of evidence demonstrating Dexcom CGM's ability to drive greater health and economic outcomes across the diabetes care continuum, particularly, we are seeing more data suggesting a clear use beyond the intensive insulin population and even outside of insulin use all together. For example, our team presented a real world study of more than 7,000 adults with type 2 diabetes who were not using insulin. After only 3 months, this cohort saw a 40% increase in time and range and a clinically meaningful improvement in A1c levels. Perhaps just as important was the high-level of engagement demonstrated as study participants wore Dexcom CGM more than 80% of the time. This was consistent with what we have seen in other broader type 2 studies, including the MOBILE trial where we saw high levels of utilization and a clear desire to continue to our Dexcom CGM full time. During ADA weekend we hosted an Investor Day where we shared our latest vision around the future of Dexcom. As part of the day we increased our LRP, provided new detail on the size of our recent access wins and shared our plan to launch a product specifically for people not on insulin. With this product we will leverage our G7 hardware, but provide a custom software experience tailored to this broader population. We expect to launch early next year with a 15-day wear time and cash pay option. This will simplify access out of the gate for users as we build the case with payers for broader coverage. Importantly, this new product also provides a glimpse into our future where we expect to utilize software to build tailored experiences and serve much larger populations. As we said at Investor Day we're just getting started. With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the second quarter financials. Jereme?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $871 million, compared to $696 million for the second quarter of 2022, representing growth of 26% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired in the trailing 12 months. U.S revenue totaled $617 million for the second quarter, compared to $511 million in the second quarter of 2022, representing growth of 21%. We delivered another record new customer star quarter in Q2 with continued momentum in the U.S as our G7 launch gained additional traction and the recently finalized CMS coverage provided a new tailwind to our Medicare business. As Kevin mentioned, we continue to progress our commercial pharmacy coverage in G7 for the second quarter, which further reduced our need to utilize the bridge program. The impact from this program was negligible in Q2, and we expect this number to remain small going forward. With broad coverage for G7 now available across all channels, there will be fewer customers that need to leverage this program to access their product. International revenue grew 38%, totaling $255 million in the second quarter. International organic revenue growth was 40% for the second quarter. We have been executing very well in international markets as our ongoing access work and product portfolio strategy continues to broaden our reach. We have seen a robust customer response to this expanded access and have consistently taken share across our footprint in recent quarters. In fact, this marks the ninth straight quarter that we have gained international market share. The U.K continues to be a great case study for us. In the past year, we have significantly broaden our reimbursement in that market, seen new clinical recommendations around real time CGM use, and launched our newest generation product. Following these events, we have experienced an acceleration in this market. And in Q2, we posted one of our highest U.K growth rates in recent years. We also recently expanded our connectivity leadership in this market, as Insulet extended their launch of Omnipod 5, which is powered by our G6 system to United Kingdom. Given our long track record in the pump market with over 1 million patient years of cumulative experience and the forthcoming connectivity with G7, we expect to remain the clear CGM leader for the connected insulin delivery market. Our second quarter gross profit was $553.5 million or 63.5% of revenue compared to 64.6% of revenue in the second quarter of 2022. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was expected as we take a temporary step back to scale G7 production. It is worth noting that some of our expected ramp up costs extended into the third quarter, which increased Q2 gross margin relative to our expectations. It takes some time for our new manufacturing lines to fully scale, but the cost profile of G7 will gradually improve as we increased production volumes. Keep in mind, our Malaysia facility recently initiated commercial production. So you should expect to see a similar dynamic occurring in the near-term as we scale those lines. Operating expenses were $395.1 million for Q2 of 2023, compared to $347.6 million in Q2 of 2022. At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted some of our key cost initiatives, which we refer to as cost to execute. This represents our ongoing framework of how we think about operational efficiency, and how we ultimately see cost as a growth driver for our business. Our second quarter operating expense management was yet another demonstration of our commitment to this program, as we generated over 450 basis points of OpEx leverage. We are very proud of this result, as we have continued to support our ongoing investments and our global commercial efforts. We know this will ebb and flow over time based on the needs of the business, but it should serve as a reminder of this organization's ability to scale. Operating income was $158.4 million or 18.2% of revenue in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $101.9 million or 14.6% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $232.6 million or 26.7% of revenue for the second quarter, compared to $175.5 million or 25.2% of revenue for the second quarter of 2022. Net income for the second quarter was $139.4 million or $0.34 per share. We closed the quarter with greater than $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents leaving us in a very strong financial position. This significant step up relative to our Q1 cash levels primarily reflects the convertible bond offering we completed early in the second quarter. With our 2023 converts coming due later this year, we saw an opportunity to refinance at very compelling terms, which provides a significant financial flexibility. This supports our ongoing capital deployment goals, with a primary focus on extending our organic growth opportunity. As we mentioned, we reached a key milestone during this quarter as our Malaysia facility began producing commercial product. This plant will quickly scale to become our largest operation and help support our long-term cost target of $10 per sensor. Turning to guidance, we are raising our full year 2022 through revenue guidance to a range of $3.50 billion to $3.55 billion, representing growth of 20% to 22% for the year. Our updated revenue guidance reflects an increase of over $65 million at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance. This reflects our strong start to the year as well as our expectation to carry this momentum into the second half of 2023. From a margin perspective, we are updating our full year non-GAAP gross margin guidance 63%, which represents the high-end of our previous guidance range. Our operating expense management has also left us well-positioned to raise operating and EBITDA margin guidance for the year. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.5% for fiscal year 2023. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Jereme. Our results this quarter read like a highlight reel. Q2 was our highest revenue quarter ever and represented the largest year-over-year dollar growth in our company's history. We again delivered record new customer starts worldwide and gained market share in nearly every major reimbursed geography. Our G7 launch continued to be marked by excellent execution across the board. We've now introduced this product into 13 international markets and quickly built broad reimbursement in the U.S. Through our commercial efforts we are bringing new physicians into our ecosystem, and our manufacturing initiatives are driving process improvements ahead of expectations. Additionally, our R&D team has already enabled five flawless upgrades to our completely redesigned G7 app. In addition, we are growing in a disciplined and sustainable manner. We have delivered over 450 basis points of operating expense leverage, doubled our earnings per share year-over-year and posted one of the largest free cash flow quarters in our company's history. I'm incredibly proud of our team for delivering this level of progress. When you experience results like these, it makes our stated vision much more tangible. We are truly on a mission to help people control their health through continued innovation and execution. With that I would now like to open the call up for Q&A. We will also have Jake Leach, our Chief Operating Officer join us for our question-and-answer session. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time, and then reenter the queue, if necessary. Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Robbie Marcus -- I apologize, Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon. Sorry about that. I didn't realize I was lowering my hands. So apologies for that. But good afternoon, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Guys, we saw a really nice revenue acceleration across the business this quarter. But that OUS number really does stand out, looks like one of your stronger growth quarters internationally in a while. Can you provide a little bit more color on the sources of that international strength as you think about the key regions that you've entered and extending both the G7 and the Dexcom ONE launches across these different geographies. Thanks so much.\nKevin Sayer: You bet. Danielle, this is Kevin. I'll take that. And it was a great international quarter. There are three things that have driven that international business for us. The first the plan we launched several quarters ago to increase access across the board and make our product more accessible on all these markets. And we've seen results of that in all the geographies, particularly in Germany. Second of all, you can't underestimate the effect of G7 in many of these markets. We've launched in 13 countries, as I said, in our prepared remarks. G7 is going very well. The third piece is the portfolio strategy where we have Dexcom ONE supporting expansion into geographies where we haven't been before, and broadening access into countries where we already exist. Those three strategic efforts have helped us tremendously. I don\u2019t know, Jereme, if you've got anything you want to add to that?\nJereme Sylvain: No, I think the only thing I'd say is, really across the board, all the major countries we're in where there's reimbursement, we're taking share. And it's a common theme you're really seeing in our portfolio approach really allows us to do that. So wonderful quarter. And thank you for the question.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRobert Marcus: Oh, great. Thanks for the question and congrats on a really nice quarter. Looks like you guys raised guidance for basically 2x the size of the beat in the quarter. So I'd love to just hear where the confidence is coming from? How to think about U.S., U.S growth in third and fourth quarters we progressed and where that upside in guidance is coming from? And any color as it relates to type 2 basal within that guidance range? Thanks a lot.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure, Robbie. Thanks. This is Jereme, I can take that. You're right, we did raise guidance and it really comes off of the strength you're seeing outside the U.S as well as some of the coverage and access wins we've had in the U.S. Of course, all of it buoyed in the background by the launch of G7, which as you know, most accurate sensor and one that we're really happy about. If you think about kind of geography wise, think about it, the first half of the year to a little bit reflect the second half of the year. And that's how the split would work, which I think you'll see that and as you kind of think about what that means, we have a little bit of a more challenging comp in the U.S in the back half of the year, at least related to the second quarter. So we've contemplated that. And we've also contemplated outside of the U.S continuing to do well. But just being mindful the fact that growing at a faster clip than we have in recent quarters, but being mindful about growing into markets as we're expanding. If you think about where it's coming from, what the driver is in the U.S around, basal, certainly some of it is there. While we're not just like giving a number around basal, basal is really now started to with the coverage we've been able to obtain. It's really starting to fold into the core business, but you can assume basal is there. And then you may ask the question, well, gee, there's -- is there opportunity? Look, we provided the guidance as what is that base case. We've increased our confidence in that base case, I think you can see that. And then of course, we'll look to outperform as time moves on.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Johnson: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Jereme, maybe I'll follow-up on your U.S comments there on basal only. If I look back the last 4 or 5 years, you guys typically increased your U.S revenue sequentially from 1Q to 2Q, maybe 70 to 80 -- or $60 million to $70 million, I'm sorry. This quarter was a $90 million sequential improvement. So anyway to say half of that was basal or a third of that was basal. I know it was only -- not quite a full quarter contribution, but just help us maybe qualitatively how much of that sequential bigger than usual improvement might have been basal. And then just on top of that, just in France, any movement yet on basal only? I know obviously your competitor has gotten that, I think you guys were working towards that. Just any updates on basal only coverage for you in Europe. Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure, Jeff. I think what I would say is in the U.S in the quarter, a relatively nominal contribution from basal in Q2. While we did have quite a few -- quite a robust patient add quarter and this all too well with coverage really kicking in April, starting with the DME channel. It takes 3 to 4 weeks to get access to product. And so ultimately the contribution start to build over the course of the year. So yes, there was contribution in the quarter, yes, it did help. But a lot of it was driven just by taking share in existing markets. And so we're really proud of that. In terms of France, our expectation is we have G7 out in France. We're launching Dexcom ONE in France here in the near future. We expect to have a very robust coverage model. I won't speak specifically [ph] there because we are going through that process. But we do expect broad coverage to compete with that of our competitor. And I think what we're proving is in markets where we have coverage, and you've seen in our international growth over the past nine quarters taking share, we expect to do quite well and take our fair share in that country once we go live.\nJeffrey Johnson: Fair enough. Thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Jereme, let me ask on the guidance. I mean, it looks like you're guiding to about similar growth in the second half as the first half. One would think and the comps aren't too different when you look at it first half versus second half last year. And one would think that you have tailwinds, pricing coming down, the ramp of basal and G7. Is there anything you're seeing that that's concerning? Or is this conservatism and just if you could comment on just cadence, should we expect typical seasonality? Thanks for taking the question.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, sure. Larry, there's nothing that gives us pause about the back half of the year. I'll start with that. I think if we come into this quarter, record quarter and new patients, we have no lack of confidence in saying that. And so we do expect a good back half of the year. We raised the guidance at the midpoint by a little over $65 million. So I know you're kind of inferring at the top and doing the work there. Look, there's nothing that gets in the way. What we've done is we derisked the base case. You see we've done that where now the base case is 20% to 22% growth, a record patient growth quarter and in Q2, obviously bullish in the back half of the year. But again, basal is new. So we're just being prudent in how we go about that and making sure we provide that base case. Of course, if we can do better, we will do so and we will certainly pass it along to you. In terms of cadence and seasonality, I think our expectation is at least Q3 looks to operate in a similar seasonality as to last year. At least that's how we're looking at it now globally. So think about it that way on a global basis. And I would expect that to play out -- really expect that to play out for the balance of the year, relatively similar seasonality to the past 2 years.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you. Is there a way to quantify the contribution of Dexcom ONE in the quarter outside the United States? I'm trying to get my head around the international growth, how much of that is coming from Dexcom ONE? How much from G7, if you can share? And then maybe some of it is from the opportunity to partner with insulin pumps, like walk me through that, please? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: Joanne, this is Kevin. We don't break those numbers out. But our growth comes from all of the above. Certainly Dexcom has once benefactor in those countries where we've launched it, but we haven't launched it in all of our international geographies yet. Our launch, as Jereme said earlier, we're about to launch in France. We just announced we're kicking off in Latin America here in Q3. And we've launched in a few other geographies, those geographies it's doing well. G7 has been a strong contributor, particularly in the U.K and Germany, where those launches are more mature. And our pump partners, particularly as automated in some delivery reimbursement has broadened in some of the geographies. That's helped us tremendously. Our direct efforts in Australia where we acquired our distributor that distributors performed extremely well and they've taken good share in the Australian New Zealand markets, in addition to that. So I mean, it's a blend of, of all the factors we talked about on the call.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. And just to help you with the -- just to kind of triangulate some of our prior comments. We talked about a third of our new patient starts coming from Dexcom ONE. And that that's building business over the course of the year. So if that's a third of the new starts, and it's a building business over the course of the year, Joanne, you can probably then presume where most of the new patient starts come from, they come from the G series. And we don't necessarily distinguish between the two. We obviously know what the numbers are. The point is, is it's a series in a platform. And so a majority of the growth does come from that G series just based on what we've historically said and nothing's changed since that.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatthew Miksic: Hey, thanks. Thanks so much for taking the question. So just one follow-up on OUS growth and just a bit a quick question on, I just happen to see some of your -- more of your promotional efforts, sort of market development and brand awareness and ads that you're putting out in television and elsewhere. I'm just wondering, how you're thinking about the success of those -- what the duration of those campaigns run whether its U.S or internationally. And I'll just include the quick follow-up on some of the international growth questions that you're getting to try to parse out, the stricter is, if you could remind us also, if there's any stocking of new geographies that happen, or as you're really stepping into a new area, there's some elements of that, that we should also think about that may not repeat next quarter, or the quarter after. Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Hey, thanks, Matt. Thanks for the question. And I'll start with the second one first, and we can circle back. No, no significant stalking anything along those lines. This is really driven by robust patient growth. And so I think it's just taking share, deriving access and ultimately entering into these markets. In terms of your first question around promotional activities, we always look at what works. We use various versions of mixed marketing, mixed sales models to ultimately determine the effectiveness, and the return on investment of those and then how the response curves work. And Terry and the commercial leadership team, they do a wonderful job assessing that spend, looking at what makes in and then pivoting as needed. And so what you can expect to see is, there will always be mixes over time, but they will change. And so we'll have campaigns, they'll change, they'll change based on what works best and we'll continue to learn from those. And so I would expect to see continued promotional materials. I'll continue to see demonstrating why we think Dexcom is the right product for folks and making sure that they know that we are the right product for them. And so I think you are seeing good feedback, we are seeing great returns. I mean, at the end of the day, what you see is record new patient quarters. And you see that in our acceleration of growth in the quarter. So that's what we'll continue to do. That's what will invest. I don't know, Kevin, any other thoughts on promotional materials.\nKevin Sayer: So I just think our promotional materials continue to evolve. And you'll see those evolve over the course of the year as we have more to offer, and we direct that message more towards different markets. I think our commercial efforts have been very successful. But in all fairness, we're looking at everything really with a very close eye right now as we plan for next year and the year after that. It's not just -- not just a one quarter shot for us.\nMatthew Miksic: That's great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: Hey, Jereme, thanks for taking the question. I guess just wanted to clarify on the basal guidance. Before it was like 1.5% of total revenue for the year. Is that changing at all or moving? And what's a fair way to think about a full year of basal. So we think about that exit rate and multiplying it by fours, just thinking about kind of a full run rate for basal. Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So, Travis, it's interesting. So we're not going to give a specific number on basal anymore, just because it's now really folded into our business. There was a time when we said, hey, look, we have CMS coverage and we don't expect Medicare Advantage to come that fast, or we think commercial is going to take a little bit longer. And it's happened much, much faster. So now it's just really part of our core business. To your question, though, is it greater than 1.5%? Absolutely. It's part of the reason we raised the guidance. It's part of the performance in the quarter. And so you'd expect it to be higher than that. The way I would think about it is just now about any other patient really population where you ultimately want to analyze it, you'll think about attrition. So far we -- there's been no differences in terms of attrition from the basal population that started today to our core population. And I think you start to annualize that exit rate and that's the way I'd apply it and going forward. And then of course, new ads. So I think you're thinking about it the right way, Travis and then in terms of is it greater than 1.5%? Yes, it is.\nTravis Steed: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMatthew Taylor: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you one about the competitive environment. Basically ask if you are seeing anything change and in terms of share or pricing, anything else notable there that we should be aware of?\nJereme Sylvain: We\u2019ve been pretty clear about our share position. If we haven\u2019t been, let me reiterate it again. In all major geographies that are reimbursed, we\u2019ve been gaining share and we gain share across most all of them this quarter. So we are doing very well. G7 has been accepted the way we wanted to. The majority of our G7 users are new users to Dexcom. We\u2019ve seen greater increased awareness in the physician community now that they have this product with its simplicity combined with it being the best performing product on the market. So we're very clear there. Our pricing trends, you can see our margins remain strong. And our pricing is where we want it to be across channels. We're -- we've been pretty clear on all those things and there's really no other changes to report.\nMatthew Taylor: Great. Thank you, Kevin.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMargaret Kaczor: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to maybe focus a little bit longer term and talk about basal adoption trends. Historically, I think even your math just the same as coverage has expanded for intensive insulin users. We've seen like this. 1,000 basis points plus of kind of incremental market adoption, at least by our math. I know it's early at this point, so you guys are being a little bit hesitant to get ahead of yourselves. But how do you compare, I guess the early weeks or months in basal right now versus what you saw when commercial coverage had opened up for intensive insulin users? And then longer term, why shouldn't we see that same level where patient acceleration in basal? I know different market, but especially as commercial coverage is maybe come on faster than it did in those markets at that time. Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Margaret, this is Kevin. I'll take it to start. And if the other guys have more to add, they can. I think as I've travelled about and spoken with physicians and stuff, we've learned a lot about basal, just launching. Just the journey of a basal patient, they've been on other meds for quite some time and that step to call on insulin is a big step. And it's a step that they've in many cases been afraid of for a long time. So providing this group with information necessary to truly manage their condition and to see that they're getting the right dose to see that what behaviors they need to use, to try not advance their type 2 diabetes is fast, we think there is a tremendous market here. And I think the reception and all fairness has probably been even warmer than I thought it was going to be, just as I've gone and spoken with people. We're also at a different point in time as far as CJM adoption and CGM awareness in general, as CGM is much more accepted than it was when we launched in other markets. Even from a distribution perspective, when we got Medicare approval the first time, I don't want to take you all back, but a Medicare patient couldn't use the phone app. When we got Medicare approval back in 2017, if they did, we had to give all the money back to CMS, we couldn't even get distributors to take our business. So that environment is all much, much more positive than has been before. The flip side of this is, it's new, there are a lot of them and there are still education to do and quite candidly, we're with a different physician group, because these people are usually primary care. While we've done everything we can or we think we've done a good job expanding into that market, we know there's more work to do there as well. So we're cautiously optimistic. We've seen great results so far. We've heard great things from the patients who use it. But it's just going to have to build over time. We considered all these things as we've looked at that market.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I would just love to hear a little bit more about G7 specifically. Those 8,000 new prescribing clinicians here in the state, can you talk about the composition of those between PCPs and then existing endos that are higher volume folks. And then internationally, I know, Jeremy, you said historically that G7 is a product where you're actually getting patients away from your competitor. Is the trajectory changing as far as the -- that dynamic as far as getting patients away from your competitor? Just looking at that international number in the quarter. Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So --and thank you for the question. In terms of those 8,000 prescribing physicians, those are really predominantly primary care physicians. And many of them were already writing CGM in the past. And so you can probably surmise that change is obviously what we think is taking share. And that's quite frankly, what we're seeing. And so those are folks that are seeing G7. They're seeing the ease of use. They're seeing the expanded coverage that we've worked on for years and years and years and that really we've led. And so that's really driven a lot of that change. Outside the U.S., and Jake alluded, or Kevin alluded to it and Jake tracks this all the time. Over half of the patients start still remain new to CGM and a good chunk of those are switchers. They're not new to -- I say new to Dexcom, not necessarily new to CGM. And so as you see that and you see a good chunk of folks saying, well, wow, this is the product we've been waiting for. We do believe we're doing incredibly well in those international markets, both in patients that are new to CGM in all candor, but also those that have decided to make the switch. And so we're really excited about the growth. I mean, I think you can see we've been really excited about G7 for years. And I think the market feedback is following that same excitement.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMathew Blackman: Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask on the PCP channel? Are you encountering any friction points in those offices above and beyond what you may have expected with basal? And I guess conversely, is there anything you anticipated would be challenging that, that may be playing out less challenging? And also, I'm curious, is your PCP sales force finding a meaningful number of type 1s in that channel? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, this is Kevin. The challenges we're encountering and challenges we anticipated. The biggest challenge always is particularly in the Medicare environment is document -- getting the documents and getting to the proper distribution channel to serve these patients, because they pretty much all go through those who are not in Medicare, manage, go through the DME channel. And so document gathering, particularly in a PCP office where they don't see all people with diabetes all the time and the use of these documents is the biggest channel, but we anticipated that. And we've worked very closely with our distributors to streamline that process as best we can. They've done a very good job, helping us get our product out and help us continue to grow. As we talked earlier, our biggest Medicare new patient headquarter ever those folks all went through distributors. So that's a good metric for us, and shows that they're doing very well. I think it's been pretty much as planned. And we don't have a specific PCP sales force. Our reps have geographic territories, and they call on both specialty diabetes clinics and primary care physicians. So they truly have a business to run in their individual territories. And certainly we know who they call on, and where they spend the majority of their time, but it's their job to drive that business and bring those offices along. They do a really good job of that.\nOperator: We will take your next question from \u2026\nKevin Sayer: I think there was one -- you asked the question on type 1s, and we find them in the PCP offices. And the answer is yes, we do. We do and we find them as we go deeper and deeper into the primary care offices, we do find type 1s. Some of whom are not on CGM or in PCP offices where maybe CGM is a little bit less prescribed. And so there are opportunities there in those spaces to continue to drive awareness beyond Of course, the typical endocrinologist space.\nMathew Blackman: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will pick our next question from Marie Thibault with BTIG. Your line is open.\nMarie Thibault: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to ask my question here, we learned recently about a competitors DTC launch. I think in the U.K have a wearable to monitor glucose for people without diabetes, more of a lifestyle sort of tool with Dexcom device for non-insulin users coming next year, any early thoughts on how your device will be differentiated? Whether that's features pricing, how you're targeting that market?\nJake Leach: Yes, this is Jake, I'll take that one. Yes, we're really excited about this new product that we're going to introduce, specifically for non-insulin users. And what it say about it is it's specifically designed for the needs of someone who isn't on insulin, but is trying to manage their glucose and trying to improve their health condition. And so the feature set is very unique to the needs of those users. It's not -- you're not managing insulin, you're not trying to avoid hypoglycemia. It's all about connecting the dots between diet, exercise and how those things impact glucose. CGM is the only tool that can provide you that real time feedback. And so we're really excited about how it's going to play into that space. And over time, we likely will expand the patient segment for that product, but we are initially focused on the type 2 insulin, non-insulin users.\nMarie Thibault: All right.\nJereme Sylvain: In price wise and most -- and Marie price wise in those things, there's a time in place, we'll ultimately talk about that. Today, probably not the best time obviously, it's information. We want to keep a little bit close to our vest until it gets a little closer to launch date. But very -- when I say we're very excited about it, it is an incredible exciting time around here at Dexcom.\nMarie Thibault: All right, well understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJayson Bedford: Hi, good afternoon. And maybe just to follow-up on the last line of questioning, I think you mentioned that you're going to launch the non-insulin device early next year, which I think is kind of newish at least on timing in '24. Have you run a trial for the device? And I assume you'll file late this year or every file?\nKevin Sayer: Yes, thanks for the question. Yes. So it's important to note, right, that product is a 15-day product or non-insulin product. And we have completed a clinical study on the G7 platform, showing survivability out to 15 days with great performance. We met the ICG M criteria in that study. And so that study is going to be used for the submission of that product. So that's why we're confident in our ability to say we're going to launch that product next year.\nJake Leach: Okay. Thank you. And we will take our next question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Hi, everyone. I wanted to ask about basal and broader type 2 opportunity outside of the U.S., particularly in the EU, certainly another big opportunity. Are the new pieces that you were putting in place with G7 and Dexcom ONE enough to really go after penetration of that patient population, or are there additional reimbursement efforts needed there as well.\nJereme Sylvain: The access strategy is an ever evolving one. And that's why we have our product portfolio. Our portfolio approach that we've adopted, there are some geographies where Dexcom ONE will absolutely be the product. We go after that basal population with other geographies where quite candidly. If they're reimbursed adequately, we can use the G series and we break it down market by market. In some countries, it's literally state by state and region by region, where we select the right product within our portfolio to offer and gain the access and coverage that we need. We believe we have the products that we need to go do that. And we've talked a bit about this, but the Dexcom ONE platform is soon going to be -- soon going to be Dexcom ONE zooming to be on the G7 platform into next year. And when that happens, that is going to be just another step forward for us. And as we look to the future, as we extend life of our sensors, and things like that, as we talked about, in our Investor Day, we'll just have more and more opportunities internationally. So we have the portfolio to go attack those things. We still have to go through the process of filling out paperwork, making bids, meeting with the proper people and building that access team out over time. And that's infrastructure. We built from the ground up and we've been building over the past several years. And one of the things I'd say to that is remember, outside the U.S a lot of the products are available. OTC you don't really necessarily need to go get a script, now you might go to a pharmacy to pick it up. The script is required for reimbursement. And so as you think about some of these products that are coming out that are really targeted that you can already use them. And so there are ways we can work around that with the right form factor, with the right product. And as Kevin has alluded to, we think we've got the portfolio, the products, the software, the ways to iterate on that to be very effective in those markets.\nSteven Lichtman: Great, thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good afternoon. I was hoping to just better understand how you've had success kind of driving the average out of pocket costs for patients prescribed with G6, G7, down to $20. And is that something that you can market or have been marketing to patients or physicians? And is that been a driver of share gains in the US? Thanks for taking the question.\nKevin Sayer: It certainly has been a driver of share gains in the U.S because we're, again, our focus is on that customer. And as we go for the lowest cost per customer, that's what we do, we do everything we can to keep that co-pay down. In some cases, it depends on the payer, the insurance company what the arrangement is, but we also are able to maintain a premium price due to the strength of our product and due to the fact that it provides such great outcomes and such good retention. Our retention rates are better than they've ever been as far as people saying our product and using it, and we know when people stay on the product, they're healthier. There's clinical data coming over the next several months from studies. This going to show that that extended use of CGM over time leads to just much better extended health. So you combine all those factors, the fact that patients stay in our product, the fact that it produces great outcomes, the fact that those outcomes are documented. We can go and command a lower co-pay. And we can go really position ourselves to do well. Now because of that you have to go through again, the access games or the access infrastructure that various payers play. One of our key initiatives right now is working on pre-authorizations into it, we have to keep those to make sure those are electronic to take that burden off the heads of the physicians' offices who prescribe our product, that's probably our biggest hurdle as far as ease of reimbursement right now. But we're working to do that as well. And we have very aggressive goals on that front over the next year. But the product and reputation and outcomes of Dexcom when able to do enable us to do that. One of the things we've talked about over the years is our strategy was to look at ways to get covered products make the easier burden longer term, I mean, think about people impacted by diabetes, there's already a significant burden on those individuals. And now you add in a large co-pay, that's a challenging things we've really worked on coverage. It's something we've known is out there, and it's something we worked on, and you're seeing it play through where us working very hard on coverage relative to that of perhaps our competitor has really driven us to be in a position where we can help patients better, longer term, because this is a long-term challenge. We want to be there throughout that.\nJosh Jennings: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Michael Polar with Wolfe research. Your line is open.\nMichael Polark: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. My question is the non -- the product for a TOS not on insulin that's going to launch next year, the 15-day sensor. In 2024, is this largely, is the base case expectation that this is a cash pay model in '24. And then over a multi year period, there might be some uptake into traditional insurance channels or would you expect that next year? You will have kind of early at risk insurance coverage for this concept?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, sure. I'll take that one. So yes, it primarily, an initial launch, it's going to be cash pay. We do feel though, we're targeting this, this segment of customer. There's 25 million people in the U.S who fit in to this category of with type 2 diabetes that are on insulin, so we feel a real opportunity to provide them with better outcomes. And we do feel that this product is specifically designed for this group can produce an outcome that a payer will pay for over time. But we got to generate that evidence in that population. We're starting to see evidence of CGM in that population and the benefits that can provide we feel like this custom tailored product is going to do a great job at delivering the outcomes that we're going to need. So it's going to take a little time. But we do feel that this is a place that ultimately will be reimbursed.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Sayer for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&:\nKevin Sayer: Again, thanks, everybody, for participating on our call today. Just in wrapping up, I want to acknowledge all the great efforts here at our company, our commercial team around the world has had an incredibly successful G7 launch, not only in getting product out the door, but driving access, make it available, everything that we've asked them to do, we've done faster than we planned. And we're just very appreciative that our operations team has not missed a beat from supply chain and microchips and G6 manufacturing in addition to G7 along the way, our engineering team, this product is performed the way we wanted it to. It's done very, very well. They continue to work on making it better. We talked earlier about our app performance software is not just an add on, it is difficult. And those five upgrades of the app in this quarter. Seamless and delivering people better features every time. You can go through the entire organization , even the bond Offering this quarter. Kudos for that team. It is a great time to be here. And as I said earlier, in my prepared remarks, we're just getting started. And that's how we feel about things. So thanks, everybody for participating on our call today and we look forward to talking to you again soon.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today we reported another great quarter for Dexcom with second quarter organic revenue growth of 26% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Demand for Dexcom's CGM continues to grow as access to our product is expanding faster than at any time in our company's history. In the first half of 2023 alone, we broadened our product portfolio strategy, extended our geographic reach and meaningfully expanded reimbursed coverage for Dexcom CGM. As we sit at the midpoint of this pivotal year for our company, we have a lot to be excited about. In the U.S., our launch of G7 continues to gain momentum. Customers and clinicians alike are sharing consistently great feedback around G7's sevens ease of use, discrete form factor, faster warm up time and redesigned software platform. With this product, we've extended our leadership position in accuracy and product performance while taking a significant step forward in terms of simplicity. It has never been easier to use or prescribe a Dexcom CGM, and we are attracting new customers and prescribers to our ecosystem as a result. Similar to last quarter, we have seen a continuation of the trend that the majority of our G7 users have been new to Dexcom. Additionally, there are now 8,000 physicians writing scripts for G7 in the U.S that were previously not prescribing Dexcom. We designed G7 to hold broad market appeal, and these early prescribing trends are validating those efforts. Behind the scenes we continue to drive reimbursement for G7. As a reminder, we established Medicare and broad commercial DME coverage during the first quarter, while rapidly progressing our commercial pharmacy contracts. We further advanced this process in the second quarter as expected, and we are excited to share that all major PBMs now cover Dexcom G7. This occurred much faster than we originally anticipated and brings our total number of G7 covered lives nearly in line with our industry leading G6 levels. This further strengthens our position as the most covered CGM brand is we prioritize keeping out of pocket costs low for our customers. As a reminder, the majority of our customers are paying less than $20 a month out of pocket in the pharmacy channel, which is significantly less than our nearest competitor where the majority of customers are paying greater than $70 per month. We are also seeing G7 play a very important role for us as we move more broadly beyond intensive insulin management. We've taken a big step in that direction this year following the recent CMS decision to significantly expand coverage beyond intensive insulin use. As of mid April, Medicare coverage officially kicked in for people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only as well as certain non-insulin using individuals who have experienced hypoglycemia. This resulted in a true step change in coverage for the industry. As we estimate, these two populations represent around 6 million to 7 million people in the U.S with roughly half being of Medicare age. It has also been encouraging to see commercial payers quickly follow suit. We have already established greater than 60% commercial coverage for the basal population, which we view as a validation of Dexcom's value proposition by payers. We are thrilled to have this level of coverage established as quickly as it provides us much greater commercial flexibility to promote this opportunity. While still early, the initial response from the clinical community has been very encouraging. Physicians have wasted no time in prescribing Dexcom to their basal patients as they recognize a clear potential for better outcomes among this population. We have also seen excitement coming directly from members of the basal community who are interested in engaging with their glucose data to make more informed lifestyle decisions. As a result, we have seen a notable uptick in demand in our Medicare business. In fact, Q2 was our highest new patient quarter within the Medicare channel in the history of our company. Considering this was only a partial quarter of expanded coverage, we view this as a very positive sign of things to come. In our international business, our share gains accelerated in the second quarter as our ongoing access initiatives and product portfolio strategy have helped us reach many more people with diabetes across the globe. We expanded our international G7 launch in the second quarter into 6 new markets. G7 is being met with a lot of enthusiasm in our initial launch countries and we are excited to bring it to additional geographies in the coming months. This will include our launch of G7 into Canada where we recently received regulatory clearance. We have plenty of inventory on hand to support this broader rollout, particularly with our Malaysia facility now producing commercial product. Another key international lever for us has been our broader rollout of DexCom ONE. DexCom ONE has proven to accelerate our entrance into new markets, broaden access within existing geographies and even serve as a catalyst for reimbursement in certain regions. Perhaps most noteworthy this past quarter is that we officially launched DexCom ONE in Argentina, which marks our initial entrance into Latin America. We expect this to only be a starting point for us in that region as we continue to expand our global reach in coming years. Finally, we came away from the American Diabetes Association's 83rd Scientific Sessions as excited as ever about our future. This year's event added to the growing body of evidence demonstrating Dexcom CGM's ability to drive greater health and economic outcomes across the diabetes care continuum, particularly, we are seeing more data suggesting a clear use beyond the intensive insulin population and even outside of insulin use all together. For example, our team presented a real world study of more than 7,000 adults with type 2 diabetes who were not using insulin. After only 3 months, this cohort saw a 40% increase in time and range and a clinically meaningful improvement in A1c levels. Perhaps just as important was the high-level of engagement demonstrated as study participants wore Dexcom CGM more than 80% of the time. This was consistent with what we have seen in other broader type 2 studies, including the MOBILE trial where we saw high levels of utilization and a clear desire to continue to our Dexcom CGM full time. During ADA weekend we hosted an Investor Day where we shared our latest vision around the future of Dexcom. As part of the day we increased our LRP, provided new detail on the size of our recent access wins and shared our plan to launch a product specifically for people not on insulin. With this product we will leverage our G7 hardware, but provide a custom software experience tailored to this broader population. We expect to launch early next year with a 15-day wear time and cash pay option. This will simplify access out of the gate for users as we build the case with payers for broader coverage. Importantly, this new product also provides a glimpse into our future where we expect to utilize software to build tailored experiences and serve much larger populations. As we said at Investor Day we're just getting started. With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the second quarter financials. Jereme? Thanks, Jereme. Our results this quarter read like a highlight reel. Q2 was our highest revenue quarter ever and represented the largest year-over-year dollar growth in our company's history. We again delivered record new customer starts worldwide and gained market share in nearly every major reimbursed geography. Our G7 launch continued to be marked by excellent execution across the board. We've now introduced this product into 13 international markets and quickly built broad reimbursement in the U.S. Through our commercial efforts we are bringing new physicians into our ecosystem, and our manufacturing initiatives are driving process improvements ahead of expectations. Additionally, our R&D team has already enabled five flawless upgrades to our completely redesigned G7 app. In addition, we are growing in a disciplined and sustainable manner. We have delivered over 450 basis points of operating expense leverage, doubled our earnings per share year-over-year and posted one of the largest free cash flow quarters in our company's history. I'm incredibly proud of our team for delivering this level of progress. When you experience results like these, it makes our stated vision much more tangible. We are truly on a mission to help people control their health through continued innovation and execution. With that I would now like to open the call up for Q&A. We will also have Jake Leach, our Chief Operating Officer join us for our question-and-answer session. Sean? You bet. Danielle, this is Kevin. I'll take that. And it was a great international quarter. There are three things that have driven that international business for us. The first the plan we launched several quarters ago to increase access across the board and make our product more accessible on all these markets. And we've seen results of that in all the geographies, particularly in Germany. Second of all, you can't underestimate the effect of G7 in many of these markets. We've launched in 13 countries, as I said, in our prepared remarks. G7 is going very well. The third piece is the portfolio strategy where we have Dexcom ONE supporting expansion into geographies where we haven't been before, and broadening access into countries where we already exist. Those three strategic efforts have helped us tremendously. I don't know, Jereme, if you've got anything you want to add to that? Joanne, this is Kevin. We don't break those numbers out. But our growth comes from all of the above. Certainly Dexcom has once benefactor in those countries where we've launched it, but we haven't launched it in all of our international geographies yet. Our launch, as Jereme said earlier, we're about to launch in France. We just announced we're kicking off in Latin America here in Q3. And we've launched in a few other geographies, those geographies it's doing well. G7 has been a strong contributor, particularly in the U.K and Germany, where those launches are more mature. And our pump partners, particularly as automated in some delivery reimbursement has broadened in some of the geographies. That's helped us tremendously. Our direct efforts in Australia where we acquired our distributor that distributors performed extremely well and they've taken good share in the Australian New Zealand markets, in addition to that. So I mean, it's a blend of, of all the factors we talked about on the call. So I just think our promotional materials continue to evolve. And you'll see those evolve over the course of the year as we have more to offer, and we direct that message more towards different markets. I think our commercial efforts have been very successful. But in all fairness, we're looking at everything really with a very close eye right now as we plan for next year and the year after that. It's not just -- not just a one quarter shot for us. Margaret, this is Kevin. I'll take it to start. And if the other guys have more to add, they can. I think as I've travelled about and spoken with physicians and stuff, we've learned a lot about basal, just launching. Just the journey of a basal patient, they've been on other meds for quite some time and that step to call on insulin is a big step. And it's a step that they've in many cases been afraid of for a long time. So providing this group with information necessary to truly manage their condition and to see that they're getting the right dose to see that what behaviors they need to use, to try not advance their type 2 diabetes is fast, we think there is a tremendous market here. And I think the reception and all fairness has probably been even warmer than I thought it was going to be, just as I've gone and spoken with people. We're also at a different point in time as far as CJM adoption and CGM awareness in general, as CGM is much more accepted than it was when we launched in other markets. Even from a distribution perspective, when we got Medicare approval the first time, I don't want to take you all back, but a Medicare patient couldn't use the phone app. When we got Medicare approval back in 2017, if they did, we had to give all the money back to CMS, we couldn't even get distributors to take our business. So that environment is all much, much more positive than has been before. The flip side of this is, it's new, there are a lot of them and there are still education to do and quite candidly, we're with a different physician group, because these people are usually primary care. While we've done everything we can or we think we've done a good job expanding into that market, we know there's more work to do there as well. So we're cautiously optimistic. We've seen great results so far. We've heard great things from the patients who use it. But it's just going to have to build over time. We considered all these things as we've looked at that market. Yes, this is Kevin. The challenges we're encountering and challenges we anticipated. The biggest challenge always is particularly in the Medicare environment is document -- getting the documents and getting to the proper distribution channel to serve these patients, because they pretty much all go through those who are not in Medicare, manage, go through the DME channel. And so document gathering, particularly in a PCP office where they don't see all people with diabetes all the time and the use of these documents is the biggest channel, but we anticipated that. And we've worked very closely with our distributors to streamline that process as best we can. They've done a very good job, helping us get our product out and help us continue to grow. As we talked earlier, our biggest Medicare new patient headquarter ever those folks all went through distributors. So that's a good metric for us, and shows that they're doing very well. I think it's been pretty much as planned. And we don't have a specific PCP sales force. Our reps have geographic territories, and they call on both specialty diabetes clinics and primary care physicians. So they truly have a business to run in their individual territories. And certainly we know who they call on, and where they spend the majority of their time, but it's their job to drive that business and bring those offices along. They do a really good job of that. I think there was one -- you asked the question on type 1s, and we find them in the PCP offices. And the answer is yes, we do. We do and we find them as we go deeper and deeper into the primary care offices, we do find type 1s. Some of whom are not on CGM or in PCP offices where maybe CGM is a little bit less prescribed. And so there are opportunities there in those spaces to continue to drive awareness beyond Of course, the typical endocrinologist space. Yes, thanks for the question. Yes. So it's important to note, right, that product is a 15-day product or non-insulin product. And we have completed a clinical study on the G7 platform, showing survivability out to 15 days with great performance. We met the ICG M criteria in that study. And so that study is going to be used for the submission of that product. So that's why we're confident in our ability to say we're going to launch that product next year.

Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $871 million, compared to $696 million for the second quarter of 2022, representing growth of 26% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired in the trailing 12 months. U.S revenue totaled $617 million for the second quarter, compared to $511 million in the second quarter of 2022, representing growth of 21%. We delivered another record new customer star quarter in Q2 with continued momentum in the U.S as our G7 launch gained additional traction and the recently finalized CMS coverage provided a new tailwind to our Medicare business. As Kevin mentioned, we continue to progress our commercial pharmacy coverage in G7 for the second quarter, which further reduced our need to utilize the bridge program. The impact from this program was negligible in Q2, and we expect this number to remain small going forward. With broad coverage for G7 now available across all channels, there will be fewer customers that need to leverage this program to access their product. International revenue grew 38%, totaling $255 million in the second quarter. International organic revenue growth was 40% for the second quarter. We have been executing very well in international markets as our ongoing access work and product portfolio strategy continues to broaden our reach. We have seen a robust customer response to this expanded access and have consistently taken share across our footprint in recent quarters. In fact, this marks the ninth straight quarter that we have gained international market share. The U.K continues to be a great case study for us. In the past year, we have significantly broaden our reimbursement in that market, seen new clinical recommendations around real time CGM use, and launched our newest generation product. Following these events, we have experienced an acceleration in this market. And in Q2, we posted one of our highest U.K growth rates in recent years. We also recently expanded our connectivity leadership in this market, as Insulet extended their launch of Omnipod 5, which is powered by our G6 system to United Kingdom. Given our long track record in the pump market with over 1 million patient years of cumulative experience and the forthcoming connectivity with G7, we expect to remain the clear CGM leader for the connected insulin delivery market. Our second quarter gross profit was $553.5 million or 63.5% of revenue compared to 64.6% of revenue in the second quarter of 2022. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was expected as we take a temporary step back to scale G7 production. It is worth noting that some of our expected ramp up costs extended into the third quarter, which increased Q2 gross margin relative to our expectations. It takes some time for our new manufacturing lines to fully scale, but the cost profile of G7 will gradually improve as we increased production volumes. Keep in mind, our Malaysia facility recently initiated commercial production. So you should expect to see a similar dynamic occurring in the near-term as we scale those lines. Operating expenses were $395.1 million for Q2 of 2023, compared to $347.6 million in Q2 of 2022. At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted some of our key cost initiatives, which we refer to as cost to execute. This represents our ongoing framework of how we think about operational efficiency, and how we ultimately see cost as a growth driver for our business. Our second quarter operating expense management was yet another demonstration of our commitment to this program, as we generated over 450 basis points of OpEx leverage. We are very proud of this result, as we have continued to support our ongoing investments and our global commercial efforts. We know this will ebb and flow over time based on the needs of the business, but it should serve as a reminder of this organization's ability to scale. Operating income was $158.4 million or 18.2% of revenue in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $101.9 million or 14.6% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $232.6 million or 26.7% of revenue for the second quarter, compared to $175.5 million or 25.2% of revenue for the second quarter of 2022. Net income for the second quarter was $139.4 million or $0.34 per share. We closed the quarter with greater than $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents leaving us in a very strong financial position. This significant step up relative to our Q1 cash levels primarily reflects the convertible bond offering we completed early in the second quarter. With our 2023 converts coming due later this year, we saw an opportunity to refinance at very compelling terms, which provides a significant financial flexibility. This supports our ongoing capital deployment goals, with a primary focus on extending our organic growth opportunity. As we mentioned, we reached a key milestone during this quarter as our Malaysia facility began producing commercial product. This plant will quickly scale to become our largest operation and help support our long-term cost target of $10 per sensor. Turning to guidance, we are raising our full year 2022 through revenue guidance to a range of $3.50 billion to $3.55 billion, representing growth of 20% to 22% for the year. Our updated revenue guidance reflects an increase of over $65 million at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance. This reflects our strong start to the year as well as our expectation to carry this momentum into the second half of 2023. From a margin perspective, we are updating our full year non-GAAP gross margin guidance 63%, which represents the high-end of our previous guidance range. Our operating expense management has also left us well-positioned to raise operating and EBITDA margin guidance for the year. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.5% for fiscal year 2023. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. No, I think the only thing I'd say is, really across the board, all the major countries we're in where there's reimbursement, we're taking share. And it's a common theme you're really seeing in our portfolio approach really allows us to do that. So wonderful quarter. And thank you for the question. Sure, Robbie. Thanks. This is Jereme, I can take that. You're right, we did raise guidance and it really comes off of the strength you're seeing outside the U.S as well as some of the coverage and access wins we've had in the U.S. Of course, all of it buoyed in the background by the launch of G7, which as you know, most accurate sensor and one that we're really happy about. If you think about kind of geography wise, think about it, the first half of the year to a little bit reflect the second half of the year. And that's how the split would work, which I think you'll see that and as you kind of think about what that means, we have a little bit of a more challenging comp in the U.S in the back half of the year, at least related to the second quarter. So we've contemplated that. And we've also contemplated outside of the U.S continuing to do well. But just being mindful the fact that growing at a faster clip than we have in recent quarters, but being mindful about growing into markets as we're expanding. If you think about where it's coming from, what the driver is in the U.S around, basal, certainly some of it is there. While we're not just like giving a number around basal, basal is really now started to with the coverage we've been able to obtain. It's really starting to fold into the core business, but you can assume basal is there. And then you may ask the question, well, gee, there's -- is there opportunity? Look, we provided the guidance as what is that base case. We've increased our confidence in that base case, I think you can see that. And then of course, we'll look to outperform as time moves on. Sure, Jeff. I think what I would say is in the U.S in the quarter, a relatively nominal contribution from basal in Q2. While we did have quite a few -- quite a robust patient add quarter and this all too well with coverage really kicking in April, starting with the DME channel. It takes 3 to 4 weeks to get access to product. And so ultimately the contribution start to build over the course of the year. So yes, there was contribution in the quarter, yes, it did help. But a lot of it was driven just by taking share in existing markets. And so we're really proud of that. In terms of France, our expectation is we have G7 out in France. We're launching Dexcom ONE in France here in the near future. We expect to have a very robust coverage model. I won't speak specifically [ph] there because we are going through that process. But we do expect broad coverage to compete with that of our competitor. And I think what we're proving is in markets where we have coverage, and you've seen in our international growth over the past nine quarters taking share, we expect to do quite well and take our fair share in that country once we go live. Yes, sure. Larry, there's nothing that gives us pause about the back half of the year. I'll start with that. I think if we come into this quarter, record quarter and new patients, we have no lack of confidence in saying that. And so we do expect a good back half of the year. We raised the guidance at the midpoint by a little over $65 million. So I know you're kind of inferring at the top and doing the work there. Look, there's nothing that gets in the way. What we've done is we derisked the base case. You see we've done that where now the base case is 20% to 22% growth, a record patient growth quarter and in Q2, obviously bullish in the back half of the year. But again, basal is new. So we're just being prudent in how we go about that and making sure we provide that base case. Of course, if we can do better, we will do so and we will certainly pass it along to you. In terms of cadence and seasonality, I think our expectation is at least Q3 looks to operate in a similar seasonality as to last year. At least that's how we're looking at it now globally. So think about it that way on a global basis. And I would expect that to play out -- really expect that to play out for the balance of the year, relatively similar seasonality to the past 2 years. Yes. And just to help you with the -- just to kind of triangulate some of our prior comments. We talked about a third of our new patient starts coming from Dexcom ONE. And that that's building business over the course of the year. So if that's a third of the new starts, and it's a building business over the course of the year, Joanne, you can probably then presume where most of the new patient starts come from, they come from the G series. And we don't necessarily distinguish between the two. We obviously know what the numbers are. The point is, is it's a series in a platform. And so a majority of the growth does come from that G series just based on what we've historically said and nothing's changed since that. Hey, thanks, Matt. Thanks for the question. And I'll start with the second one first, and we can circle back. No, no significant stalking anything along those lines. This is really driven by robust patient growth. And so I think it's just taking share, deriving access and ultimately entering into these markets. In terms of your first question around promotional activities, we always look at what works. We use various versions of mixed marketing, mixed sales models to ultimately determine the effectiveness, and the return on investment of those and then how the response curves work. And Terry and the commercial leadership team, they do a wonderful job assessing that spend, looking at what makes in and then pivoting as needed. And so what you can expect to see is, there will always be mixes over time, but they will change. And so we'll have campaigns, they'll change, they'll change based on what works best and we'll continue to learn from those. And so I would expect to see continued promotional materials. I'll continue to see demonstrating why we think Dexcom is the right product for folks and making sure that they know that we are the right product for them. And so I think you are seeing good feedback, we are seeing great returns. I mean, at the end of the day, what you see is record new patient quarters. And you see that in our acceleration of growth in the quarter. So that's what we'll continue to do. That's what will invest. I don't know, Kevin, any other thoughts on promotional materials. Yes. So, Travis, it's interesting. So we're not going to give a specific number on basal anymore, just because it's now really folded into our business. There was a time when we said, hey, look, we have CMS coverage and we don't expect Medicare Advantage to come that fast, or we think commercial is going to take a little bit longer. And it's happened much, much faster. So now it's just really part of our core business. To your question, though, is it greater than 1.5%? Absolutely. It's part of the reason we raised the guidance. It's part of the performance in the quarter. And so you'd expect it to be higher than that. The way I would think about it is just now about any other patient really population where you ultimately want to analyze it, you'll think about attrition. So far we -- there's been no differences in terms of attrition from the basal population that started today to our core population. And I think you start to annualize that exit rate and that's the way I'd apply it and going forward. And then of course, new ads. So I think you're thinking about it the right way, Travis and then in terms of is it greater than 1.5%? Yes, it is. We've been pretty clear about our share position. If we haven't been, let me reiterate it again. In all major geographies that are reimbursed, we've been gaining share and we gain share across most all of them this quarter. So we are doing very well. G7 has been accepted the way we wanted to. The majority of our G7 users are new users to Dexcom. We've seen greater increased awareness in the physician community now that they have this product with its simplicity combined with it being the best performing product on the market. So we're very clear there. Our pricing trends, you can see our margins remain strong. And our pricing is where we want it to be across channels. We're -- we've been pretty clear on all those things and there's really no other changes to report. Yes. So --and thank you for the question. In terms of those 8,000 prescribing physicians, those are really predominantly primary care physicians. And many of them were already writing CGM in the past. And so you can probably surmise that change is obviously what we think is taking share. And that's quite frankly, what we're seeing. And so those are folks that are seeing G7. They're seeing the ease of use. They're seeing the expanded coverage that we've worked on for years and years and years and that really we've led. And so that's really driven a lot of that change. Outside the U.S., and Jake alluded, or Kevin alluded to it and Jake tracks this all the time. Over half of the patients start still remain new to CGM and a good chunk of those are switchers. They're not new to -- I say new to Dexcom, not necessarily new to CGM. And so as you see that and you see a good chunk of folks saying, well, wow, this is the product we've been waiting for. We do believe we're doing incredibly well in those international markets, both in patients that are new to CGM in all candor, but also those that have decided to make the switch. And so we're really excited about the growth. I mean, I think you can see we've been really excited about G7 for years. And I think the market feedback is following that same excitement. In price wise and most -- and Marie price wise in those things, there's a time in place, we'll ultimately talk about that. Today, probably not the best time obviously, it's information. We want to keep a little bit close to our vest until it gets a little closer to launch date. But very -- when I say we're very excited about it, it is an incredible exciting time around here at Dexcom. The access strategy is an ever evolving one. And that's why we have our product portfolio. Our portfolio approach that we've adopted, there are some geographies where Dexcom ONE will absolutely be the product. We go after that basal population with other geographies where quite candidly. If they're reimbursed adequately, we can use the G series and we break it down market by market. In some countries, it's literally state by state and region by region, where we select the right product within our portfolio to offer and gain the access and coverage that we need. We believe we have the products that we need to go do that. And we've talked a bit about this, but the Dexcom ONE platform is soon going to be -- soon going to be Dexcom ONE zooming to be on the G7 platform into next year. And when that happens, that is going to be just another step forward for us. And as we look to the future, as we extend life of our sensors, and things like that, as we talked about, in our Investor Day, we'll just have more and more opportunities internationally. So we have the portfolio to go attack those things. We still have to go through the process of filling out paperwork, making bids, meeting with the proper people and building that access team out over time. And that's infrastructure. We built from the ground up and we've been building over the past several years. And one of the things I'd say to that is remember, outside the U.S a lot of the products are available. OTC you don't really necessarily need to go get a script, now you might go to a pharmacy to pick it up. The script is required for reimbursement. And so as you think about some of these products that are coming out that are really targeted that you can already use them. And so there are ways we can work around that with the right form factor, with the right product. And as Kevin has alluded to, we think we've got the portfolio, the products, the software, the ways to iterate on that to be very effective in those markets. Yes, sure. I'll take that one. So yes, it primarily, an initial launch, it's going to be cash pay. We do feel though, we're targeting this, this segment of customer. There's 25 million people in the U.S who fit in to this category of with type 2 diabetes that are on insulin, so we feel a real opportunity to provide them with better outcomes. And we do feel that this product is specifically designed for this group can produce an outcome that a payer will pay for over time. But we got to generate that evidence in that population. We're starting to see evidence of CGM in that population and the benefits that can provide we feel like this custom tailored product is going to do a great job at delivering the outcomes that we're going to need. So it's going to take a little time. But we do feel that this is a place that ultimately will be reimbursed."

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we reported another excellent quarter for DexCom with first quarter organic revenue growth of 19% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Momentum for global CGM adoption remains very high. and we continue to see a growing appreciation for the differentiated experience that DexCom provides. It has been an exciting start to 2023. Our teams advanced some of our most important strategic initiatives in the first quarter that will continue to build on our foundation for growth in the years ahead. There is growing momentum behind the rollout of our G7 system as we initiated our full launch of G7 in the U.S. This launch represents years of hard work to bring to market a product based on feedback from our customers that meets their specific needs. . G7 is the most accurate CGM on the market. It is simple to use and is supported by the most covered CGM brand. We expect this differentiated feature set will add to our leading customer satisfaction metrics. We were thrilled with the opportunity to announce this launch on the biggest stage with our second ever Super Bowl commercial. Over 100 million people were watching the game on our commercial air and the customer clinician outreach that filled was incredibly encouraging as we expected it would be. The ad generated 3x as many impressions for DexCom as our 2021 Super Bowl commercial, exceeding our initial expectations on engagement and awareness.  We also heard from members of the diabetes community who shared their DexCom magic moments and pride in feeling represent on a platform of this size. Awareness remains a critical element to driving broader access and adoption for CGM, and we designed this campaign to demonstrate the life-changing potential of our system and a G7 product is incredibly simple to use. Millions of people with diabetes to not use CGM, and this provided us an opportunity to both connect with them and advocate on their behalf. While we are still early in our U.S. launch of G7, we have been very encouraged by the initial response. We have seen a steady ramp of new users and the initial feedback from both customers and clinicians has been consistently great.  We have also seen this product attracting new prescribers altogether. Already in the early weeks of this rollout, nearly 1,000 health care providers have prescribed G7 who previously were not prescribing DexCom CGM. Perhaps most encouraging is the progress we have made in building reimbursement for G7 in only a short period of time. Medicare coverage was established for G7 only days after our Super Bowl commercial, which coincided well with the timing of our launch and came in about a month earlier than anticipated.  We also finalized our commercial DME contracts relatively quickly and G7 commercial DME coverage is now already on par with G6 levels. Commercial pharmacy coverage has also progressed rapidly. In our reimbursement discussions, payers are clearly recognizing the value proposition that exists with DexCom G7. As a result, we already have more commercial pharmacy coverage established for G7 today than our competitor does for their sensor platform. Payers continue to value our premium feature set, leading customer engagement metrics, best-in-class performance and proven outcomes backed by robust clinical edits. Overall, we have advanced coverage more quickly than anticipated, and we expect G7 to be covered by all major PBMs by the end of the second quarter. These coverage decisions for G7 also position us well as our industry takes a significant step forward in terms of access for CGM.  In early March, CMS finalized their proposal to expand access to include people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only as well as certain noninsulin-using individuals that experience hypoglycemia. With coverage officially kicking in last week, this decision represented the largest single expansion of access to CGM in our industry's history. As a reminder, we size the basal-only type 2 population alone at around 3 million people in the U.S. with around half being of Medicare age. We are incredibly excited to start serving this population more broadly going forward as we see a significant opportunity to help these individuals live healthier lives.  Our mobile trial demonstrated meaningful improvements in timing range, A1c levels and hypoglycemic events among this population wearing DexCom sensors, as sensor engagement proved to produce behavior changes within this cohort that supported greater glycemic control. We are in a great position to compete as this market develops as accuracy, performance and customer engagement will continue to be the defining features of delivering outcomes.  Customers and clinicians have historically indicated a preference for a differentiated product where reimbursement exists, and we expect this dynamic to endures access continues to expand. Along those lines, we will continue to leverage our mobile data as well as the updated ADA standards of care to build broader coverage. We are in active discussions with private payers in the U.S. to establish basal reimbursement and will similarly advocate for broader coverage in international markets.  Our international G7 roll at also continues to go well with good initial uptake and high customer satisfaction rates. Majority of our international G7 customers continue to be new to DexCom altogether, suggesting the new form factor and feature set is attracting both people new to CGM as well as those using competitive systems. We view this as a very positive sign as we broaden our rollout in the coming months.  In the second quarter, we will be launching G7 in 8 new international markets as part of our strategic effort to get this product to as many peel as possible. From a capacity perspective, we remain in great shape to support this broader rollout. We are ramping up production quickly and have plenty of G7 inventory on hand to support our growth ambitions.  Additionally, we expect our Malaysia plant to start producing commercial product around midyear, which will further support our G7 scale up. Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you in June at the American Diabetes Association's 83rd Annual Scientific Sessions in our hometown of San Diego, California. We are always excited to connect with thought leaders across the industry at this event, as we collectively work to map out the future of DexCom CGM technology in Diabetes Care & Beyond.  In conjunction with the conference, we are planning an investor event where we will provide our latest vision around the future of DexCom and share incremental detail on many of our key strategic initiatives. We hope to see you there.  With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the first quarter financials. Jereme?\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will discuss on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as our IR website.  For the first quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $741 million compared to $629 million for the first quarter of 2022, representing growth of 19% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $526 million for the first quarter compared to $451 million for the first quarter of 2022, representing growth of 17%. We experienced another quarter of strong new customer starts in Q1, as we saw a continuation of steady demand for our G6 as well as an encouraging initial uptake of G7 with our launch in the final weeks of the quarter.  As Kevin mentioned, we'll be able to progress our commercial pharmacy coverage for G7 faster than anticipated in the quarter. This caused the impact of our bridge program to be around half of the $15 million level we expected as more customers were able to access G7 through reimbursed channels.  Accordingly, the impact on revenue from this program should continue to shrink going forward given our established commercial coverage for G7. International revenue grew 21%, totaling $216 million in the first quarter. International organic revenue growth was 27% for the first quarter. For another quarter, we continued to gain share in international markets in Q1 as customers have been responding well to our broad access initiatives and new product launches. As anticipated, DexCom ONE is having a growing impact on our results as this product has enabled us to enter new markets and compete much more broadly within existing markets. In the U.K. access to DexCom ONE was recently simplified with the addition of the products transmitter to the national formulary with the entire system now covered by the drug tariff, this reduces the administrative steps for clinicians in a market where we already have considerable underlying momentum. We will continue to work on delivering these types of wins, making it easier and simpler for customers to get reimbursed access to DexCom products.  Our first quarter gross profit was $469.8 million or 63.4% of revenue compared to 63.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2022. Our first quarter gross margin reflects the traditional step down relative to what we see in the fourth quarter as we serve a greater mix of pharmacy customers and less contribution from our DME users with high deductible health plans. This was a better-than-expected Q1 result for gross margin as we delivered incremental efficiencies in our G6 lines while managing production for our G7 launch. However, we continue to anticipate gross margins for the full year in line with our original guidance as we scale our global G7 production.  Operating expenses were $391.2 million for Q1 of 2023 compared to $347.8 million in Q1 of 2022. Operating expense management continues to be an ongoing point of emphasis for our team as part of our broader cost efforts, and it continues to be on display this quarter. In line with our expectations, we generated over 250 basis points of OpEx leverage in the first quarter even as we allocated greater commercial investment to support our G7 launch. We are very proud of the efforts our team has made and continue to make on these efficiency initiatives. Operating income was $78.6 million or 10.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $50.3 million or 8% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $145.9 million or 19.7% of revenue for the first quarter compared to $112.4 million or 17.9% of revenue for the first quarter of 2022. Net income for the first quarter was $68.5 million or $0.17 per share. We closed the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents remaining in a great financial position.  Our balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to organically support our ongoing growth investments, including the build-out of our Malaysia manufacturing facility and continually assess our strategic uses of capital. As Kevin mentioned, we are expecting our Malaysia facility to start producing commercial product around midyear, which we view as a pivotal moment in our global manufacturing journey. This plant will provide a significant new capacity and be a key element of our long-term growth and cost reduction plans.  Turning to guidance. We are raising our full year 2023 revenue guidance to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.515 billion. For margins, we are reaffirming our prior full year guidance of gross profit margins in the range of 62% to 63%, operating margins of approximately 16.5% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 26%. The increase of approximately $38 million at the midpoint of revenue guidance reflects our increased confidence in the business and the underlying market. This factors in our strong first quarter results as well as a benefit from CMS finalizing type 2 basal coverage earlier than originally anticipated.  With that, I will turn it back to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Jereme. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Kevin. [Operator Instructions]. Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a great quarter. Maybe to start, the focus is all on the type 2 basal expansion that just started at the beginning of last week. Maybe speak to the expectations and cadence of what's in guidance here what the initial -- what do you think the initial reception and awareness is and how much you and your other CGM competitor have to do to educate the market. And then maybe on the back of the Super Bowl ad, what you think is the patient awareness and also acceptance to wearing a CGM full time is for type 2 basal.\nJereme Sylvain: Thanks, Robbie. This is Jereme. Appreciate that. In terms of guidance, maybe I'll start there and then I can turn it over to Kevin in terms of thought process around wear times. In terms of guidance, we had talked about basal prior to approval if it started in the middle of the year being about 1%. And our updated guidance has us higher than 1%, certainly more in that 1.5-ish percent range, but not necessarily changing integer. So hopefully, that gives you some context to where that's going. Certainly, we expect it to be a market change in terms of what I would say is reimbursement for the longer term. In terms of adoption, we're obviously just getting in those approvals and just getting in the reimbursement. So it's going to take a little bit of time for us to ultimately see how that cadence of adoption is. But you've got our expectations. And over the long term, we expect adoption to be, quite frankly, very, very positive. Maybe I can turn it to Kevin in terms of awareness in the channel and in kind of where times longer term.\nKevin Sayer: Yes. Thanks, Jereme. With respect to wartime our best plan of reference is our mobile study that provided the really most important data in securing this approval. Over 90% of the individuals who were sensors during the study they want to give them up. They felt the information was very valuable, very useful and provided them very much a scoreboard and how they can manage their diabetes going forward. So it doesn't progress and they could have much better outcomes. And so we're very confident with the full-time were. From an educational perspective, we do have some work to do in the PCP community. We did a big sales force expansion last year in anticipation of going more broadly, we continue to evaluate our marketing and our full on direct distribution efforts to see what adjustments need to be made to create more awareness. We work very hard with our channel partners and believe we are in a very good position with them to go take on this front. So it's about creating awareness. It's about making it easier for patients to get their product and use it. I've been out in the field a few times.  And the one thing I'm definitely hearing as I speak with a lot of the primary care physicians who are going to serve this market is G7 is so much easier to use and so easy to use versus G6, they view this as a very real and a very strong opportunity for their patients to achieve better outcomes. So we know we have the right product. We'll just work on creating awareness at the proper places to get it out there. But we're comfortable that people will wear it all the time once they get started.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeffrey Johnson: So Kevin, I heard you talk about or Jereme, I guess, probably it was you who talked about the Bridge program and kind of half the impact of that you thought originally in 1Q. You didn't hear anything on the cash pay program, we're starting to see on GoodRx and Amazon Pharmacy and that some of these price points roll out in the $170, $180 range per month for your product. Just any updated thinking what are the initial responses you're seeing to that cash pay program, how additive do you think that could be to revenue this year? And how to think about the margin implications at those discounted prices?\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes. Thanks for asking the question. So you obviously updated the Bridge program. The Bridge program is where a significant amount of folks are taking advantage of it. That price point is a little bit lower at this point. And great news, of course, is the coverage has come in a little bit earlier. And so certainly, we haven't had to have folks take as much advantage of it. In terms of those cash pay programs, we have seen some encouraging initial adoption, but it is relatively initial. So as you see those start to come through, longer term, we think it can be additive, and we believe it will be. In the shorter term, it's really not a material contributor, but longer term, again, Jeff, we're very excited about what this opportunity offers to folks. Longer-term margins perspective, we feel good about the pricing in those cash pay programs. We don't expect it to have a long-term drag on margins. . As you've seen in the quarter, we continue to do really, really well on designing cost out of our product, and we'll continue to work on doing that both with G6 and G7 to where these programs won't necessarily be dilutive to our long-term gross margin.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Congrats on a nice start to the year here. Jereme, 2 parts for me. I mean, the first quarter was about 20% if you back out the bridging program the guidance, 17% to 21%. Can you talk about the cadence through the year? And is there any reason why growth wouldn't accelerate from Q1 with G7 and the basal launches -- and just separately, what was volume in the U.S. volume growth? People are going to compare and contrast your, call it, 18% growth in the U.S. adjusted for the bridging versus Abbott's 50%? Just any color on what you think is going on there.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes, I'll start with the volume question first. Well, we're not necessarily disclosing volume specifically in quarters going forward. What we can say is our patient base, if you look at where we were exiting 2022. Our patient base grew in the mid-30%. And so as we've talked about what that patient base looks like when we disclose patients, and we'll do that every year, so folks have an understanding. That continues to play through. To give you some context to the first quarter, the first quarter was a record for new patients. And so our unit volume growth continues to be very strong. So as you compare the 2, we feel very good about our unit volume growth relative to competitors, and we'll continue to feel good about that for the balance of the year.  In terms of how to think about the cadence of the year, I do think the cadence of the year will be a little bit heavier weighted into the back half relative to prior years. That's just given the timing of the basal approval and as that starts to get going. But as you think about Q2, we are -- we do recognize where The Street is today, and we realize that number will have to go up a little bit. And so as the overperformance you see in Q1, certainly record new patients, that will play through into Q2. And so you'll see some of the increase in guidance that is specifically related to some increase in expectations in Q2 performance. So hopefully, that covers your questions.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nMatthew Taylor: So I wanted to ask you one about just how quickly the coverage has been established in the DME and the pharmacy channel. I thought it was an interesting comment that you made that you think you have more coverage in pharmacy than your competitor. Maybe you could compare that and talk about what that means for ultimately how much of the basal opportunity you think you can garner?\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that, and Jereme can add a bit afterwards. On the basal opportunity, remember, Medicare sales process is durable medical equipment, and we have very good relationships with our distributors and in that channel, and we worked very hard to position them to be successful with the basal patients. And so we're very comfortable there.  With respect to our coverage, I think it's important to note our approach here. Our goal is to minimize the out-of-pocket cost of our customers. And by getting all this coverage, we've repeated the statistics several times, 30% of Dexcom users -- commercial users to go the pharmacy have 0 co-pay, and 70% have lower or at least equal to co-pay as our major competitor. Our goal is to get them through and to get them covered rather than rely on the bridging program forever. And our team is very successful and getting us through that. The bridging program is still out there, and it's still open, but many of the customers go to the drug store and don't need it. We've got that pharmacy coverage in place, which creates an opportunity then for them to spend less on a monthly basis, and it's very important to our users. That's why we've approached this coverage very aggressively. In all fairness, we've talked about G7 long enough, the payers were ready to have discussions. We were met with open arms. They're very excited at the opportunity to have this new product and in front of them again.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.\nMargaret Kaczor: Kevin, I don't want to get too far away from basal which clearly a huge driver in the short term and where a lot of focus is. But I guess, can you give us some of the context on the steps that you're taking today to drive adoption and to even earlier stage type 2 patients, whether GLP-1s or orals and -- is this going to require a clinical data? Are you guys working on that? Or are the partnership programs, I guess, at this point, sufficient upscale where coverage can broaden, I guess, without something like a mobile study?\nKevin Sayer: We are working on all fronts there, Margaret. Thank you for the question. We see tremendous benefit to as type 2 diabetes treating gets more sophisticated. It's -- I was with the physician recently, and he talked about CGM being the scorecard. How do you do this? And how do you aggressively treat type 2 diabetes without knowing the scorecard and what's going on GM offers a tremendous opportunity. It offers an opportunity to reduce or increase medications for individuals who aren't succeeding and bring A1Cs down significantly in combination with therapies. We think it will become a vital part. We'll continue to gather data from programs like we have done in the past. We're contemplating studies but nothing we're ready to publish or announce. We don't announce our studies early on. We like to wait till we get done. But we are contemplating and seeing study proposals that could provide great data. The question is, do we want to go do 100,000 type 2 patient study and it takes 3 years, not right now. We don't think we need that type of evidence, but there is a very strong body of evidence in all of the individuals that we've seen that are on insulin that show CGM, again, provides a great benefit when you're using a DexCom sensor where you can rely on the acre information, and you can use it. So stay tuned on that market. We'll talk more about it in the future. But it is coming. We believe we play a vital role there in spite of all these advances that we're reading about.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: Jereme, can you talk a little bit more about the pricing commentary that you just made? I think you said volumes up in the first quarter in the 30s, but yet overall, and this is a domestic question. overall, up 17%, 18% in total. So that would mean pricing came down quite a bit. Is that a trend we should anticipate? And then with your competitor take pricing up, are you really just trying to close the gap entirely here and just be done with this pricing delta between the 2 of you?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. I appreciate the question. And that's not what I was necessarily trying to and I was talking about is our underlying patient base is up in the mid-30s. And that was based on the patient base we gave you as part of our kind of pegs we give you once a year. I wasn't necessarily coming on specific volume within the quarter. But what I would say is the volume in the quarter was relatively -- it was robust. It was another good quarter for us, and it was on the backs of a record new patient add. So I didn't want to get into specifics on volumes. What I can tell you, just in generalities around price. Price and volumes do tend -- are continuing to converge over time. That is us moving less from pharmacy -- I'm sorry, from DME to pharmacy, that channel has started to stabilize quite a bit. There is still some annualization going on. So make no mistake, we are still going through that annualization plus we have the -- what we talked about earlier, which is the bridge program playing through. albeit to a lesser extent. So the prices up is moving how we would have expected. So I won't really trying to insinuate that there was an increasing delta between the 2. I was just trying to give some context around a strong, robust underlying patient base for the quarter. So I didn't want to read too much into that, and I apologize if you gave you the wrong impression.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS.\nDanielle Antalffy: Congratulations on a good start to the year. Just that -- I'm going to try to ask this question qualitatively, Kevin, because I appreciate you guys are going to give us an update in 2 months here at ADA. But as we look at the basal opportunity, we were kind of thinking of looking at insulin intensive type 2 as a proxy there. And I guess my question for you is, it looks like insulin-intensive type 2 is ramping to 50%-plus penetration around 5 years after securing Medicare coverage I mean, is there any reason to think that could be true as well for basal and arguably could basal ramp even faster given that we are significantly ahead of where we were in 2018 from a technology, from an awareness perspective. Anything you could say around that without front-running the Analyst Day?\nKevin Sayer: No, it's a good question, and it's one we discuss a lot internally. Remember, to start reimbursement with Medicare patients only, and that's about half the population. It has always been our experience that we've got to drive reimbursement from the private payers as well and then through the Medicaid programs also to get extensive penetration and with type 2 intensive insulin therapy. We're now pretty much there across most of the payer landscape. A bit of work to do on the Medicaid side still, but we're there with Medicare and the private payers. So you'll see reimbursement evolve early on, and we get more coverage. And then I think we've got to generate these experiences with these users over time. Danielle, but in a 5-year period, I can definitely see that. And maybe it does go faster because we have such a large group of end users who are going to have reimbursement on the Medicare side. At the same time, they're not all seeing endocrinologists. So we've got a broader base of education with respect to their health care providers that we have to cover as well. So we'll factor all that in as we go, and we'll talk more about it later. But those are all the factors we consider as we look at it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Just two quick questions that require short answers. Jereme, you mentioned I think 1Q was a record for new users. Just a little clarification there. That was for -- it was a 1Q record? Or are you saying that you added more new users in 1Q than you did in 4Q?\nJereme Sylvain: We've added more users in 1Q than we ever have in any quarter in DexCom's history.\nJayson Bedford: Very clear. And then, Kevin, I was intrigued by your comment around actively talking to payers in Europe around basal reimbursement. I'm just kind of curious, is this something that you would expect in '23? And if not, is this something that could happen in '24?\nKevin Sayer: It will take time. It's not going to happen overnight. Our outcomes data that we provided with the mobile study gives us a good first pass. I think as we see success with users in the United States and we see outcomes and possibly gather more economic data as we work some of these patients. It's going to require that type of evidence. So we don't have -- I don't think we have enough yet personally, the team may disagree with me, but I think we need to develop more. But certainly, it's on the table. And it's certainly something we can now discuss because when CMS approves the policy of this nature, the world takes note. And so we are now getting audiences to discuss that internationally, and we'll continue to push.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: Nice start to the year. I want to make sure I understood this new user comment. I'm going to assume that, that also includes DexCom ONE patients that are in there. that might be adding to the difference between the dollar growth and the user group. And then I'm curious in how many countries DexCom ONE is in currently?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, sure. It does include DexCom ONE user. So this is the entire group. DexCom ONE is now, and I want to say it's about 12 countries, 10 to 12 countries. I'm trying to do the math in my head across all. It's about 10 to 12. We're starting to really see some uptick in some of those smaller countries that we initially launched. And then, of course, some of the bigger countries where we have coverage like the U.K., we're also seeing some nice uptick as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley.\nCecilia Furlong: Just a quick follow-up on DexCom as well. I know you talked about entering the year, thinking about 1/3 of new patient starts, OUS, stemming from DexCom ONE. Just curious if you could talk about where you are right now in 1Q? And then as you think about geographic expansion contributions to that going forward through the year, just your expectations there as well?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, sure. So I can answer that. The expectation still is 1/3 of new patients. And as you can see, some of the encouraging things, for example, with the U.K. formulary decision to include transmitters, on there just makes it easier. And so the way easier we can make it, the easier it's going to be. So that's still our expectations. And right now, a majority of the DexCom ONE product is sitting in the EU region. So when you think of geographies, think of the European region, including the U.K. in that as well, where I think you'll expect to see most of the growth associated with DexCom ONE and really most of the growth for the foreseeable future until we can launch in other jurisdictions meaningfully across the world.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Matthew Blackman with Stifel.\nMathew Blackman: Another international one for me, just curious for an update on Japan now that you've got a broader reimbursement with G6. Can you really just give us a sense of how much that business is annualizing at and how important a component it is in your 2023 outlook?\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take it. It's still a relatively small component in our 2023 outlook. We are working with our partner, Terumo, there and with the broadened coverage we'll obviously see an increase, but it is not a material part of our plan this year. We're looking forward over time to getting G7 launched over there. We think G7 provides us a quite candidly a stronger opportunity in the Japanese market with all of its great features. We've grown a bit in Japan, not as much as we'd like. And so as we look at the year, we're looking at ways to go faster. G7 will be one of those. And be a bigger part of our '24 plan than it is '23 substantially.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Marie Kibble with BTIG.\nMarie Thibault: You started the call by describing how much prescribers seem to like the G7 format and that you had new prescribers coming on to DexCom. I just want to clarify, are these competitive wins are these prescribers coming completely new to CGM. And then how much of the launch or the intro is complete as and how many of the potential prescribers have you been able to get G7 in front of?\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that. We have a lot of prescribers to go for G7 because it's going to be a very broadly used product, particularly as you look at the basal opportunity we have. ahead of us. We know we have new prescribers we have to gain and we structured our sales force and designed their workflow and goals for the year to, in fact, go after and to go educate those that we need to go to. A lot of the prescribers who are prescribing G7 could, in fact, be new to CGM. What we do know is they're new to DexCom and that's what's most important to us. So if they're new to DexCom, it's 1 of 2 things. Either they're new to CGM in general or they've come after using competitors' products, both of which we view are good. And with G7, again, the excitement in the doctor's office is the ease of use. It is just so easy to use and so easy for somebody to get started on G7 with a 0.5 hour warm up with the easy insertion with a small form factor that we have. If a patient chooses to use a receiver, that receiver experience is much better than what they've had before. We really are getting great feedback on the new receiver and the accuracy of the system. The system, what we're hearing back performs extremely well, and people are very happy with what they're seeing. So word of mouth has been very strong on this product. Our campaigns have obviously been aggressive, but the strength of the product has supported what we've said.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: I guess, I wanted to touch on margins. Gross margin in Q1 was actually above the full year guidance. So I want to understand the bridge on gross margin? And then maybe talk a little bit about OpEx leverage while we're on the margin topic and maybe the potential to see upside longer term above that long-term margin guide.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. You're right, Q1 came ahead of expectations. And what we saw was we really saw continued efficiencies on our G6 lines that really played through in the quarter. which certainly is favorable. And given there's a large portion of our base, of course, that sits on those G6 lines that played through. So it was ahead of the full year. We do expect, as more and more folks move to over the course of the year as we're turning on Malaysia, ultimately ramping up our G7 launch and therefore, the throughputs on those lines. We will go through a bit of a margin dip as we make that transition. And so I still expect that over the course of the year, we still do expect the year to fall in line with the 62% to 63% gross margin. But you are right, Q1 came in strong. And I think it just -- just shows the capabilities of our teams. When you give them time what they can do in terms of designing cost out of product on manufacturing lines. We expect something similar to like that to happen on G7 into those future years.  In terms of margin profile, operating motion profile we gave the long-term guide certainly of getting to 20% margins by 2025. If you assume the year was at 65% gross margin, we're starting to get pretty close to there even in 2023. And that just goes to show you the leverage we're building into the business. While we're not in a position to change our long-term guide.  To your question, do we think that there's opportunities to lever this business over the long haul -- we do. And we're putting the levers in place in right now that's part of what we're doing as an organization. So we're very excited about that opportunity. I'm glad you pointed it out. We do believe there's opportunity in this business longer term to continue to generate more profits and we'll continue to work on doing so.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research.\nChristopher Pasquale: I want to ask a couple of questions about the middle of the income statement. SG&A grew quite a bit faster than sales this quarter. Just was there anything specific that drove that. And then R&D spending has been down year-over-year now four quarters in a row. Should we expect that trend to continue? Or does it start to ramp back up as we go through this year?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, it's a good question. It's really a function of timing. So I'll start with R&D. R&D, if you think about this time last year, we were wrapping up a lot of the work around G7 as well as wrapping up a lot of the work on prototype lines for development. And so what you saw running through the P&L was an elevated period of spend. And as you saw it go through the rest of the year, you saw R&D kind of come back down as those G7 costs started to either dissipate or move up into different areas of lines because you validate those lines as much anymore. And so you saw that change happening. Over the course of the year, I would not expect that type of leverage on R&D. We'll still continue to leverage it as a percentage of sales, but it won't be what you saw in this quarter. It's just the inverse for SG&A. So we -- obviously, last year, we did not have a Super Bowl commercial or a G7 launch in the first quarter. This year, we did in the U.S. And so you saw an elevated level of spend associated with that, which we expected in coming out with our long-term guide. It was all expected, but that's why you saw the change.  The other part is you do see the Malaysia costs as we're building up that factory, we're getting closer to go-live and so we're ramping up costs. But until we go live, those costs sit in G&A. So what you'll see is the -- we'll start to actually leverage SG&A a little bit more as the year goes on. And conversely, we'll leverage R&D a little bit less, but it still ultimately leads to leverage by the end of the year across both of those lines.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatthew Miksic: Some follow-up here on the basal opportunity. So clinicians we speak to describe something like a fair amount of pent-up demand in this community of Medicare patients on -- basal patients. If you -- just wondering if you have any sense of how long -- that's the way you are also seeing the set up? Like how long do you think it will take to work through that pent-up interest in the community? And then just if I could also on pricing and margin for this category, given that we're talking about sort of mix factor for all these different types of channels that you manage. What is this -- how does this compare to your sort of core business or maybe some of your other channels in terms of margins and pricing and mix?\nKevin Sayer: Yes, I'll start, and then I'll let Jereme go from there. We do see pent-up demand, and we do see people very excited for this opportunity. We've got to get as I said earlier, we worked very hard with our channel partners to prepare and so we're ready for that with our DME distributors to handle the influx of users that will come through that. With respect to pricing in models, Jereme can go a little more specific, again, this is the same Medicare pricing that we have in our Medicare business for those who are on intensive insulin therapy. So the only thing that would change is a larger portion of our patients could become Medicare patients and subject to Medicare reimbursement. And on an overall basis, Medicare is very favorable for us. So we're in a very good position there. with these patients. We're very excited to serve them. Jereme, do you want to add to that?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, I think that's exactly. I mean, at the end of the day, it depends on what the reimbursement would come through at that will ultimately determine margins. Thus far, the reimbursement has come in generally in line in a favorable manner. Over the long term, we'll keep an eye on what that reimbursement looks like. And then we'll have that conversation to make sure you guys understand where this is going. But all throughout this process, we'll be looking at -- we'll be looking at reimbursed, and we'll also be looking at how we deliver our products at what we to be a lower cost. And so that will be our way of helping manage through that as well.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Great. Good evening, everyone. I guess I'll be the guy that asks what's next when you're in the early stages of a new product launch. But just wondered if you could set some expectations with respect to extending the days of use as well as adding back some of those software features that you pulled at the request of the FDA in the second half of last year, just help level set expectations for R&D on a go-forward basis here.\nKevin Sayer: Why don't I start on the software side. We've made significant investments in software. We'll be adding back, for example, the -- we shut the alarms off feature for up to 6 hours in the U.S., certainly before the end of the year. That feature will be added back to the app. And we're looking for a steady stream of upgrades to the app over the course of time. What you're going to see from our software team is continual upgrades and launches on a much more regular basis than we have in the past. Part of G7's engineering was to create a software platform that we could do more with and that we can upgrade much easier than we have done in the past. So that feature will be back before the end of the year, and we're excited for that as our -- as our users.  As far as what comes next, the #1 initiative in our R&D group is to get those extra days of sensor wear out there. As we've talked about this publicly, we've got some work to do on the patch. We have a new patch that we're going to put into manufacturing and it's a new manufacturing processes there, and we have a couple of other programs that we know can extend the life and make it better.  What we struggle with and the reason we started 10 days is we want the appropriate reliability experience for our users and what they expect. By upgrading the patch and a couple of other changes, we're quite confident we can be there. And you'll see that life extended here in the not-too-distant future. It is our #1 priority, and our team is making very good progress.\nOperator: We will take our final question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteven Lichtman: Guys I was wondering on -- as we think about the LCD, obviously, a lot of focus understandably on basal-only I was wondering how you're thinking about the opportunity within the noninsulin-using patients. I understand it's going to be a subset based on the LCD and hypoglycemia risk. But the overall numbers are very high. So just curious how you're thinking about that? And are you approaching commercial pay there as well?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, it's a good question. Maybe I can start, and then certainly, Kevin can fill in. Obviously, massive market. And within that market, there's different use cases as you kind of go through the acuity, even the subacute within that market. So we are thinking about it from multiple different levels. from a combination of a few different areas. One, is it an area where we want to reimburse were we worried about hypo? Is there a software change we need to make to target maybe a hyperglycemic approach. So we're thinking about how to either fit form software and product feature and/or does the existing product makes sense, which, again, in many cases, we think it does. So we are working with payers and thinking about how we go after that market. In terms of price point and use cases, I think that's the 1 we're still working on because the acuity level may be different. There may be someone who's kind of moving more on the acute side that's going to want to use it very similar to a basal or an intensive user, where it's going to help maybe reverse the progression of the disease as opposed to someone that's maybe more diagnostic on the front end to help maybe curb changes earlier on. That's something we are working through. I think there's going to be a bunch of different use cases. So it's hard to model that price out because I think it's going to be different based on who exactly is using it and what stage of the disease state they're in. Kevin, any other thoughts?\nKevin Sayer: No, Jereme, I think you've hit it very well. It is a different market, and it will be a different use case. And it's up to us to determine the proper value equation for that somebody is getting what they expect to be paying for. And the problem isn't as severe as somebody is integrated with an AID system.  On the other hand, the results can save the system as much, if not more, money over time. So we're looking at that balance and looking at how best to position our technology in that market. But we're very excited to address it in the future.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Sayer for closing remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Listen, I want to thank everybody for listening today. This was a great quarter for us, record new patients, a great beat on the top line, continued leverage on our -- on the operating expense line in general, based on what we know, given the fact that it's the first quarter of the year, we couldn't be happier here, and it's going to be a great year for DexCom. Thanks for listening. Have a great day.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we reported another excellent quarter for DexCom with first quarter organic revenue growth of 19% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Momentum for global CGM adoption remains very high. and we continue to see a growing appreciation for the differentiated experience that DexCom provides. It has been an exciting start to 2023. Our teams advanced some of our most important strategic initiatives in the first quarter that will continue to build on our foundation for growth in the years ahead. There is growing momentum behind the rollout of our G7 system as we initiated our full launch of G7 in the U.S. This launch represents years of hard work to bring to market a product based on feedback from our customers that meets their specific needs. . G7 is the most accurate CGM on the market. It is simple to use and is supported by the most covered CGM brand. We expect this differentiated feature set will add to our leading customer satisfaction metrics. We were thrilled with the opportunity to announce this launch on the biggest stage with our second ever Super Bowl commercial. Over 100 million people were watching the game on our commercial air and the customer clinician outreach that filled was incredibly encouraging as we expected it would be. The ad generated 3x as many impressions for DexCom as our 2021 Super Bowl commercial, exceeding our initial expectations on engagement and awareness.  We also heard from members of the diabetes community who shared their DexCom magic moments and pride in feeling represent on a platform of this size. Awareness remains a critical element to driving broader access and adoption for CGM, and we designed this campaign to demonstrate the life-changing potential of our system and a G7 product is incredibly simple to use. Millions of people with diabetes to not use CGM, and this provided us an opportunity to both connect with them and advocate on their behalf. While we are still early in our U.S. launch of G7, we have been very encouraged by the initial response. We have seen a steady ramp of new users and the initial feedback from both customers and clinicians has been consistently great.  We have also seen this product attracting new prescribers altogether. Already in the early weeks of this rollout, nearly 1,000 health care providers have prescribed G7 who previously were not prescribing DexCom CGM. Perhaps most encouraging is the progress we have made in building reimbursement for G7 in only a short period of time. Medicare coverage was established for G7 only days after our Super Bowl commercial, which coincided well with the timing of our launch and came in about a month earlier than anticipated.  We also finalized our commercial DME contracts relatively quickly and G7 commercial DME coverage is now already on par with G6 levels. Commercial pharmacy coverage has also progressed rapidly. In our reimbursement discussions, payers are clearly recognizing the value proposition that exists with DexCom G7. As a result, we already have more commercial pharmacy coverage established for G7 today than our competitor does for their sensor platform. Payers continue to value our premium feature set, leading customer engagement metrics, best-in-class performance and proven outcomes backed by robust clinical edits. Overall, we have advanced coverage more quickly than anticipated, and we expect G7 to be covered by all major PBMs by the end of the second quarter. These coverage decisions for G7 also position us well as our industry takes a significant step forward in terms of access for CGM.  In early March, CMS finalized their proposal to expand access to include people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin only as well as certain noninsulin-using individuals that experience hypoglycemia. With coverage officially kicking in last week, this decision represented the largest single expansion of access to CGM in our industry's history. As a reminder, we size the basal-only type 2 population alone at around 3 million people in the U.S. with around half being of Medicare age. We are incredibly excited to start serving this population more broadly going forward as we see a significant opportunity to help these individuals live healthier lives.  Our mobile trial demonstrated meaningful improvements in timing range, A1c levels and hypoglycemic events among this population wearing DexCom sensors, as sensor engagement proved to produce behavior changes within this cohort that supported greater glycemic control. We are in a great position to compete as this market develops as accuracy, performance and customer engagement will continue to be the defining features of delivering outcomes.  Customers and clinicians have historically indicated a preference for a differentiated product where reimbursement exists, and we expect this dynamic to endures access continues to expand. Along those lines, we will continue to leverage our mobile data as well as the updated ADA standards of care to build broader coverage. We are in active discussions with private payers in the U.S. to establish basal reimbursement and will similarly advocate for broader coverage in international markets.  Our international G7 roll at also continues to go well with good initial uptake and high customer satisfaction rates. Majority of our international G7 customers continue to be new to DexCom altogether, suggesting the new form factor and feature set is attracting both people new to CGM as well as those using competitive systems. We view this as a very positive sign as we broaden our rollout in the coming months.  In the second quarter, we will be launching G7 in 8 new international markets as part of our strategic effort to get this product to as many peel as possible. From a capacity perspective, we remain in great shape to support this broader rollout. We are ramping up production quickly and have plenty of G7 inventory on hand to support our growth ambitions.  Additionally, we expect our Malaysia plant to start producing commercial product around midyear, which will further support our G7 scale up. Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you in June at the American Diabetes Association's 83rd Annual Scientific Sessions in our hometown of San Diego, California. We are always excited to connect with thought leaders across the industry at this event, as we collectively work to map out the future of DexCom CGM technology in Diabetes Care & Beyond.  In conjunction with the conference, we are planning an investor event where we will provide our latest vision around the future of DexCom and share incremental detail on many of our key strategic initiatives. We hope to see you there.  With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the first quarter financials. Jereme? Thanks, Jereme. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Yes. Thanks, Jereme. With respect to wartime our best plan of reference is our mobile study that provided the really most important data in securing this approval. Over 90% of the individuals who were sensors during the study they want to give them up. They felt the information was very valuable, very useful and provided them very much a scoreboard and how they can manage their diabetes going forward. So it doesn't progress and they could have much better outcomes. And so we're very confident with the full-time were. From an educational perspective, we do have some work to do in the PCP community. We did a big sales force expansion last year in anticipation of going more broadly, we continue to evaluate our marketing and our full on direct distribution efforts to see what adjustments need to be made to create more awareness. We work very hard with our channel partners and believe we are in a very good position with them to go take on this front. So it's about creating awareness. It's about making it easier for patients to get their product and use it. I've been out in the field a few times.  And the one thing I'm definitely hearing as I speak with a lot of the primary care physicians who are going to serve this market is G7 is so much easier to use and so easy to use versus G6, they view this as a very real and a very strong opportunity for their patients to achieve better outcomes. So we know we have the right product. We'll just work on creating awareness at the proper places to get it out there. But we're comfortable that people will wear it all the time once they get started. Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that, and Jereme can add a bit afterwards. On the basal opportunity, remember, Medicare sales process is durable medical equipment, and we have very good relationships with our distributors and in that channel, and we worked very hard to position them to be successful with the basal patients. And so we're very comfortable there.  With respect to our coverage, I think it's important to note our approach here. Our goal is to minimize the out-of-pocket cost of our customers. And by getting all this coverage, we've repeated the statistics several times, 30% of Dexcom users -- commercial users to go the pharmacy have 0 co-pay, and 70% have lower or at least equal to co-pay as our major competitor. Our goal is to get them through and to get them covered rather than rely on the bridging program forever. And our team is very successful and getting us through that. The bridging program is still out there, and it's still open, but many of the customers go to the drug store and don't need it. We've got that pharmacy coverage in place, which creates an opportunity then for them to spend less on a monthly basis, and it's very important to our users. That's why we've approached this coverage very aggressively. In all fairness, we've talked about G7 long enough, the payers were ready to have discussions. We were met with open arms. They're very excited at the opportunity to have this new product and in front of them again. We are working on all fronts there, Margaret. Thank you for the question. We see tremendous benefit to as type 2 diabetes treating gets more sophisticated. It's -- I was with the physician recently, and he talked about CGM being the scorecard. How do you do this? And how do you aggressively treat type 2 diabetes without knowing the scorecard and what's going on GM offers a tremendous opportunity. It offers an opportunity to reduce or increase medications for individuals who aren't succeeding and bring A1Cs down significantly in combination with therapies. We think it will become a vital part. We'll continue to gather data from programs like we have done in the past. We're contemplating studies but nothing we're ready to publish or announce. We don't announce our studies early on. We like to wait till we get done. But we are contemplating and seeing study proposals that could provide great data. The question is, do we want to go do 100,000 type 2 patient study and it takes 3 years, not right now. We don't think we need that type of evidence, but there is a very strong body of evidence in all of the individuals that we've seen that are on insulin that show CGM, again, provides a great benefit when you're using a DexCom sensor where you can rely on the acre information, and you can use it. So stay tuned on that market. We'll talk more about it in the future. But it is coming. We believe we play a vital role there in spite of all these advances that we're reading about. No, it's a good question, and it's one we discuss a lot internally. Remember, to start reimbursement with Medicare patients only, and that's about half the population. It has always been our experience that we've got to drive reimbursement from the private payers as well and then through the Medicaid programs also to get extensive penetration and with type 2 intensive insulin therapy. We're now pretty much there across most of the payer landscape. A bit of work to do on the Medicaid side still, but we're there with Medicare and the private payers. So you'll see reimbursement evolve early on, and we get more coverage. And then I think we've got to generate these experiences with these users over time. Danielle, but in a 5-year period, I can definitely see that. And maybe it does go faster because we have such a large group of end users who are going to have reimbursement on the Medicare side. At the same time, they're not all seeing endocrinologists. So we've got a broader base of education with respect to their health care providers that we have to cover as well. So we'll factor all that in as we go, and we'll talk more about it later. But those are all the factors we consider as we look at it. It will take time. It's not going to happen overnight. Our outcomes data that we provided with the mobile study gives us a good first pass. I think as we see success with users in the United States and we see outcomes and possibly gather more economic data as we work some of these patients. It's going to require that type of evidence. So we don't have -- I don't think we have enough yet personally, the team may disagree with me, but I think we need to develop more. But certainly, it's on the table. And it's certainly something we can now discuss because when CMS approves the policy of this nature, the world takes note. And so we are now getting audiences to discuss that internationally, and we'll continue to push. Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take it. It's still a relatively small component in our 2023 outlook. We are working with our partner, Terumo, there and with the broadened coverage we'll obviously see an increase, but it is not a material part of our plan this year. We're looking forward over time to getting G7 launched over there. We think G7 provides us a quite candidly a stronger opportunity in the Japanese market with all of its great features. We've grown a bit in Japan, not as much as we'd like. And so as we look at the year, we're looking at ways to go faster. G7 will be one of those. And be a bigger part of our '24 plan than it is '23 substantially. Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that. We have a lot of prescribers to go for G7 because it's going to be a very broadly used product, particularly as you look at the basal opportunity we have. ahead of us. We know we have new prescribers we have to gain and we structured our sales force and designed their workflow and goals for the year to, in fact, go after and to go educate those that we need to go to. A lot of the prescribers who are prescribing G7 could, in fact, be new to CGM. What we do know is they're new to DexCom and that's what's most important to us. So if they're new to DexCom, it's 1 of 2 things. Either they're new to CGM in general or they've come after using competitors' products, both of which we view are good. And with G7, again, the excitement in the doctor's office is the ease of use. It is just so easy to use and so easy for somebody to get started on G7 with a 0.5 hour warm up with the easy insertion with a small form factor that we have. If a patient chooses to use a receiver, that receiver experience is much better than what they've had before. We really are getting great feedback on the new receiver and the accuracy of the system. The system, what we're hearing back performs extremely well, and people are very happy with what they're seeing. So word of mouth has been very strong on this product. Our campaigns have obviously been aggressive, but the strength of the product has supported what we've said. Yes, I'll start, and then I'll let Jereme go from there. We do see pent-up demand, and we do see people very excited for this opportunity. We've got to get as I said earlier, we worked very hard with our channel partners to prepare and so we're ready for that with our DME distributors to handle the influx of users that will come through that. With respect to pricing in models, Jereme can go a little more specific, again, this is the same Medicare pricing that we have in our Medicare business for those who are on intensive insulin therapy. So the only thing that would change is a larger portion of our patients could become Medicare patients and subject to Medicare reimbursement. And on an overall basis, Medicare is very favorable for us. So we're in a very good position there. with these patients. We're very excited to serve them. Jereme, do you want to add to that? Why don't I start on the software side. We've made significant investments in software. We'll be adding back, for example, the -- we shut the alarms off feature for up to 6 hours in the U.S., certainly before the end of the year. That feature will be added back to the app. And we're looking for a steady stream of upgrades to the app over the course of time. What you're going to see from our software team is continual upgrades and launches on a much more regular basis than we have in the past. Part of G7's engineering was to create a software platform that we could do more with and that we can upgrade much easier than we have done in the past. So that feature will be back before the end of the year, and we're excited for that as our -- as our users.  As far as what comes next, the #1 initiative in our R&D group is to get those extra days of sensor wear out there. As we've talked about this publicly, we've got some work to do on the patch. We have a new patch that we're going to put into manufacturing and it's a new manufacturing processes there, and we have a couple of other programs that we know can extend the life and make it better.  What we struggle with and the reason we started 10 days is we want the appropriate reliability experience for our users and what they expect. By upgrading the patch and a couple of other changes, we're quite confident we can be there. And you'll see that life extended here in the not-too-distant future. It is our #1 priority, and our team is making very good progress. No, Jereme, I think you've hit it very well. It is a different market, and it will be a different use case. And it's up to us to determine the proper value equation for that somebody is getting what they expect to be paying for. And the problem isn't as severe as somebody is integrated with an AID system.  On the other hand, the results can save the system as much, if not more, money over time. So we're looking at that balance and looking at how best to position our technology in that market. But we're very excited to address it in the future. Listen, I want to thank everybody for listening today. This was a great quarter for us, record new patients, a great beat on the top line, continued leverage on our -- on the operating expense line in general, based on what we know, given the fact that it's the first quarter of the year, we couldn't be happier here, and it's going to be a great year for DexCom. Thanks for listening. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will discuss on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as our IR website.  For the first quarter of 2023, we reported worldwide revenue of $741 million compared to $629 million for the first quarter of 2022, representing growth of 19% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes currency in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $526 million for the first quarter compared to $451 million for the first quarter of 2022, representing growth of 17%. We experienced another quarter of strong new customer starts in Q1, as we saw a continuation of steady demand for our G6 as well as an encouraging initial uptake of G7 with our launch in the final weeks of the quarter.  As Kevin mentioned, we'll be able to progress our commercial pharmacy coverage for G7 faster than anticipated in the quarter. This caused the impact of our bridge program to be around half of the $15 million level we expected as more customers were able to access G7 through reimbursed channels.  Accordingly, the impact on revenue from this program should continue to shrink going forward given our established commercial coverage for G7. International revenue grew 21%, totaling $216 million in the first quarter. International organic revenue growth was 27% for the first quarter. For another quarter, we continued to gain share in international markets in Q1 as customers have been responding well to our broad access initiatives and new product launches. As anticipated, DexCom ONE is having a growing impact on our results as this product has enabled us to enter new markets and compete much more broadly within existing markets. In the U.K. access to DexCom ONE was recently simplified with the addition of the products transmitter to the national formulary with the entire system now covered by the drug tariff, this reduces the administrative steps for clinicians in a market where we already have considerable underlying momentum. We will continue to work on delivering these types of wins, making it easier and simpler for customers to get reimbursed access to DexCom products.  Our first quarter gross profit was $469.8 million or 63.4% of revenue compared to 63.3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2022. Our first quarter gross margin reflects the traditional step down relative to what we see in the fourth quarter as we serve a greater mix of pharmacy customers and less contribution from our DME users with high deductible health plans. This was a better-than-expected Q1 result for gross margin as we delivered incremental efficiencies in our G6 lines while managing production for our G7 launch. However, we continue to anticipate gross margins for the full year in line with our original guidance as we scale our global G7 production.  Operating expenses were $391.2 million for Q1 of 2023 compared to $347.8 million in Q1 of 2022. Operating expense management continues to be an ongoing point of emphasis for our team as part of our broader cost efforts, and it continues to be on display this quarter. In line with our expectations, we generated over 250 basis points of OpEx leverage in the first quarter even as we allocated greater commercial investment to support our G7 launch. We are very proud of the efforts our team has made and continue to make on these efficiency initiatives. Operating income was $78.6 million or 10.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $50.3 million or 8% of revenue in the same quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $145.9 million or 19.7% of revenue for the first quarter compared to $112.4 million or 17.9% of revenue for the first quarter of 2022. Net income for the first quarter was $68.5 million or $0.17 per share. We closed the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion worth of cash and cash equivalents remaining in a great financial position.  Our balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to organically support our ongoing growth investments, including the build-out of our Malaysia manufacturing facility and continually assess our strategic uses of capital. As Kevin mentioned, we are expecting our Malaysia facility to start producing commercial product around midyear, which we view as a pivotal moment in our global manufacturing journey. This plant will provide a significant new capacity and be a key element of our long-term growth and cost reduction plans.  Turning to guidance. We are raising our full year 2023 revenue guidance to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.515 billion. For margins, we are reaffirming our prior full year guidance of gross profit margins in the range of 62% to 63%, operating margins of approximately 16.5% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 26%. The increase of approximately $38 million at the midpoint of revenue guidance reflects our increased confidence in the business and the underlying market. This factors in our strong first quarter results as well as a benefit from CMS finalizing type 2 basal coverage earlier than originally anticipated.  With that, I will turn it back to Kevin. Thanks, Robbie. This is Jereme. Appreciate that. In terms of guidance, maybe I'll start there and then I can turn it over to Kevin in terms of thought process around wear times. In terms of guidance, we had talked about basal prior to approval if it started in the middle of the year being about 1%. And our updated guidance has us higher than 1%, certainly more in that 1.5-ish percent range, but not necessarily changing integer. So hopefully, that gives you some context to where that's going. Certainly, we expect it to be a market change in terms of what I would say is reimbursement for the longer term. In terms of adoption, we're obviously just getting in those approvals and just getting in the reimbursement. So it's going to take a little bit of time for us to ultimately see how that cadence of adoption is. But you've got our expectations. And over the long term, we expect adoption to be, quite frankly, very, very positive. Maybe I can turn it to Kevin in terms of awareness in the channel and in kind of where times longer term. Sure. Yes. Thanks for asking the question. So you obviously updated the Bridge program. The Bridge program is where a significant amount of folks are taking advantage of it. That price point is a little bit lower at this point. And great news, of course, is the coverage has come in a little bit earlier. And so certainly, we haven't had to have folks take as much advantage of it. In terms of those cash pay programs, we have seen some encouraging initial adoption, but it is relatively initial. So as you see those start to come through, longer term, we think it can be additive, and we believe it will be. In the shorter term, it's really not a material contributor, but longer term, again, Jeff, we're very excited about what this opportunity offers to folks. Longer-term margins perspective, we feel good about the pricing in those cash pay programs. We don't expect it to have a long-term drag on margins. . As you've seen in the quarter, we continue to do really, really well on designing cost out of our product, and we'll continue to work on doing that both with G6 and G7 to where these programs won't necessarily be dilutive to our long-term gross margin. Sure. Yes, I'll start with the volume question first. Well, we're not necessarily disclosing volume specifically in quarters going forward. What we can say is our patient base, if you look at where we were exiting 2022. Our patient base grew in the mid-30%. And so as we've talked about what that patient base looks like when we disclose patients, and we'll do that every year, so folks have an understanding. That continues to play through. To give you some context to the first quarter, the first quarter was a record for new patients. And so our unit volume growth continues to be very strong. So as you compare the 2, we feel very good about our unit volume growth relative to competitors, and we'll continue to feel good about that for the balance of the year.  In terms of how to think about the cadence of the year, I do think the cadence of the year will be a little bit heavier weighted into the back half relative to prior years. That's just given the timing of the basal approval and as that starts to get going. But as you think about Q2, we are -- we do recognize where The Street is today, and we realize that number will have to go up a little bit. And so as the overperformance you see in Q1, certainly record new patients, that will play through into Q2. And so you'll see some of the increase in guidance that is specifically related to some increase in expectations in Q2 performance. So hopefully, that covers your questions. Yes. I appreciate the question. And that's not what I was necessarily trying to and I was talking about is our underlying patient base is up in the mid-30s. And that was based on the patient base we gave you as part of our kind of pegs we give you once a year. I wasn't necessarily coming on specific volume within the quarter. But what I would say is the volume in the quarter was relatively -- it was robust. It was another good quarter for us, and it was on the backs of a record new patient add. So I didn't want to get into specifics on volumes. What I can tell you, just in generalities around price. Price and volumes do tend -- are continuing to converge over time. That is us moving less from pharmacy -- I'm sorry, from DME to pharmacy, that channel has started to stabilize quite a bit. There is still some annualization going on. So make no mistake, we are still going through that annualization plus we have the -- what we talked about earlier, which is the bridge program playing through. albeit to a lesser extent. So the prices up is moving how we would have expected. So I won't really trying to insinuate that there was an increasing delta between the 2. I was just trying to give some context around a strong, robust underlying patient base for the quarter. So I didn't want to read too much into that, and I apologize if you gave you the wrong impression. We've added more users in 1Q than we ever have in any quarter in DexCom's history. Yes, sure. It does include DexCom ONE user. So this is the entire group. DexCom ONE is now, and I want to say it's about 12 countries, 10 to 12 countries. I'm trying to do the math in my head across all. It's about 10 to 12. We're starting to really see some uptick in some of those smaller countries that we initially launched. And then, of course, some of the bigger countries where we have coverage like the U.K., we're also seeing some nice uptick as well. Yes, sure. So I can answer that. The expectation still is 1/3 of new patients. And as you can see, some of the encouraging things, for example, with the U.K. formulary decision to include transmitters, on there just makes it easier. And so the way easier we can make it, the easier it's going to be. So that's still our expectations. And right now, a majority of the DexCom ONE product is sitting in the EU region. So when you think of geographies, think of the European region, including the U.K. in that as well, where I think you'll expect to see most of the growth associated with DexCom ONE and really most of the growth for the foreseeable future until we can launch in other jurisdictions meaningfully across the world. Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. You're right, Q1 came ahead of expectations. And what we saw was we really saw continued efficiencies on our G6 lines that really played through in the quarter. which certainly is favorable. And given there's a large portion of our base, of course, that sits on those G6 lines that played through. So it was ahead of the full year. We do expect, as more and more folks move to over the course of the year as we're turning on Malaysia, ultimately ramping up our G7 launch and therefore, the throughputs on those lines. We will go through a bit of a margin dip as we make that transition. And so I still expect that over the course of the year, we still do expect the year to fall in line with the 62% to 63% gross margin. But you are right, Q1 came in strong. And I think it just -- just shows the capabilities of our teams. When you give them time what they can do in terms of designing cost out of product on manufacturing lines. We expect something similar to like that to happen on G7 into those future years.  In terms of margin profile, operating motion profile we gave the long-term guide certainly of getting to 20% margins by 2025. If you assume the year was at 65% gross margin, we're starting to get pretty close to there even in 2023. And that just goes to show you the leverage we're building into the business. While we're not in a position to change our long-term guide.  To your question, do we think that there's opportunities to lever this business over the long haul -- we do. And we're putting the levers in place in right now that's part of what we're doing as an organization. So we're very excited about that opportunity. I'm glad you pointed it out. We do believe there's opportunity in this business longer term to continue to generate more profits and we'll continue to work on doing so. Yes, it's a good question. It's really a function of timing. So I'll start with R&D. R&D, if you think about this time last year, we were wrapping up a lot of the work around G7 as well as wrapping up a lot of the work on prototype lines for development. And so what you saw running through the P&L was an elevated period of spend. And as you saw it go through the rest of the year, you saw R&D kind of come back down as those G7 costs started to either dissipate or move up into different areas of lines because you validate those lines as much anymore. And so you saw that change happening. Over the course of the year, I would not expect that type of leverage on R&D. We'll still continue to leverage it as a percentage of sales, but it won't be what you saw in this quarter. It's just the inverse for SG&A. So we -- obviously, last year, we did not have a Super Bowl commercial or a G7 launch in the first quarter. This year, we did in the U.S. And so you saw an elevated level of spend associated with that, which we expected in coming out with our long-term guide. It was all expected, but that's why you saw the change.  The other part is you do see the Malaysia costs as we're building up that factory, we're getting closer to go-live and so we're ramping up costs. But until we go live, those costs sit in G&A. So what you'll see is the -- we'll start to actually leverage SG&A a little bit more as the year goes on. And conversely, we'll leverage R&D a little bit less, but it still ultimately leads to leverage by the end of the year across both of those lines. Yes, I think that's exactly. I mean, at the end of the day, it depends on what the reimbursement would come through at that will ultimately determine margins. Thus far, the reimbursement has come in generally in line in a favorable manner. Over the long term, we'll keep an eye on what that reimbursement looks like. And then we'll have that conversation to make sure you guys understand where this is going. But all throughout this process, we'll be looking at -- we'll be looking at reimbursed, and we'll also be looking at how we deliver our products at what we to be a lower cost. And so that will be our way of helping manage through that as well. Yes, it's a good question. Maybe I can start, and then certainly, Kevin can fill in. Obviously, massive market. And within that market, there's different use cases as you kind of go through the acuity, even the subacute within that market. So we are thinking about it from multiple different levels. from a combination of a few different areas. One, is it an area where we want to reimburse were we worried about hypo? Is there a software change we need to make to target maybe a hyperglycemic approach. So we're thinking about how to either fit form software and product feature and/or does the existing product makes sense, which, again, in many cases, we think it does. So we are working with payers and thinking about how we go after that market. In terms of price point and use cases, I think that's the 1 we're still working on because the acuity level may be different. There may be someone who's kind of moving more on the acute side that's going to want to use it very similar to a basal or an intensive user, where it's going to help maybe reverse the progression of the disease as opposed to someone that's maybe more diagnostic on the front end to help maybe curb changes earlier on. That's something we are working through. I think there's going to be a bunch of different use cases. So it's hard to model that price out because I think it's going to be different based on who exactly is using it and what stage of the disease state they're in. Kevin, any other thoughts?"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Sean Christensen, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Mr. Christensen, you may begin.\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Abby, and welcome to DexCom's third quarter 2024 earnings call.

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Before we dive in, I want to take this opportunity to share an important update. As many of you saw in today's press release, our Chief Commercial Officer, Teri Lawver has expressed her plan to retire from DexCom. Teri, is a great leader who has advanced our commercial organization in several areas in the past two years, including the launches of our G7 system and Stelo, which I will touch on shortly. I am thankful for her strong leadership and dedication to DexCom and she will continue to work with me as a Special Advisor and Consultant through early next year as we navigate the transition and our search for a new Chief Commercial Officer. I will assume leadership of the team and having managed this team before, I can speak to their quality and look forward to leading them again. There are three primary takeaways I want to convey today, reinforced by what I've observed since our last quarter call. First, CGM remains a premier global growth category and the excitement and uptake we've seen with the Stelo launch has further reinforced my conviction about the long-term potential of this market. Second, I feel good about the execution progress that our team is making, both in terms of our commercial effectiveness and our product pipeline and we'll walk through some of those steps today. And finally, I feel confident in our pathway back to higher growth and continued margin expansion, which Jereme will discuss in more detail later. With those points as a framework for discussion, let's turn to the highlights from the quarter. Today, we reported third quarter organic revenue growth of 3% compared to the third quarter of 2023, which came in at the high end of our third-quarter guidance. Our team continues to build upon our foundation for long-term growth by delivering new products and customer experiences, while swiftly working through the temporary challenges to get us back on track. I want to touch on the action items we implemented in the third quarter and the strong progress we've made on the core issues identified. Together, these updates demonstrate that we are rebuilding momentum to solidify our growth as we head into 2025. Beginning with our US sales force expansion, we are pleased to report progress and positive momentum as we move to apply learnings from the initial rollout and improve our commercial execution. As we anticipated, our productivity metrics improved over the course of the third quarter as we implemented several changes to strengthen our sales effectiveness. Importantly, new customer starts returned to record levels in the third quarter as we gained greater traction in new and existing physician offices. We are now encouraged to report that since the expansion of the sales force in April, we have seen our prescriber base expand by nearly 35,000 clinicians. While the impact of these new relationships is not fully reflected in our third-quarter results, they represent a meaningful expansion in a few short months and set us up very well as we work to build on this momentum in Q4 and into 2025. Regarding our DME partnerships, we have worked quickly to refocus on those partnerships and ensure that our teams are aligned to the strategic importance of all channels in the US. Our leadership connected with our counterparts at the DME distributors in the last quarter to listen and collaborate on strategies that are mutually beneficial. Through this process, we found opportunities to better partner with these teams in the field as we collectively simplify workflows and provide a greater customer experience for all. While we still have work to do, we're in a far better position today than we were three months ago. These partnerships are a core part of our strategy and we are confident in our ability to drive meaningful growth that accrues to both us and these channel partners. We've also executed at a high level within our international markets. We saw third quarter revenue growth accelerate from the second quarter levels in nearly all of our direct markets driven by stronger new patient performance and the expanded availability of our G7 and DexCom ONE+ product platforms. This included the launch of G7 in Australia at the end of September, bringing our latest G-Series technology to our customers who have been eagerly awaiting its arrival. And we continued the expansion of our DexCom ONE+ system, which leverages our G7 hardware platform with a differentiated app experience. We've now introduced this technology in 19 countries with France being the latest addition in the third quarter in advance of the start of national reimbursement, including basal coverage in early October. This provides reimbursed access to more than 600,000 people in this important market. We also saw Japan return to growth in the third quarter, with our new sales organization gaining momentum in this critical market. While it is not yet a large component of our international revenue, our team is making strong inroads with the clinical community and building awareness among the more than one million potential customers who have access to DexCom CGM. In fact, we recently delivered our highest new customer start month since entering Japan in 2019 and we build on this progress in the coming quarters and years ahead. During the quarter, we were also thrilled to launch our newest product, Stelo in the US market. Stelo's launch represented a pivotal moment in the diabetes care and metabolic health landscape as now any adult in the US can access a DexCom Biosensor. It also provides a glimpse into the future of the broader care paradigm as more personalized solutions can encourage better lifestyle management and enable clinicians to make more informed therapy decisions. We are already hearing this exact feedback from our earliest adopters. Many of these individuals are engaging with their glucose data for the first time and sharing stories of how Stelo has changed their behavior and provided greater accountability in their lives. They are also sharing positive feedback on all stages of the product experience, everything from ordering through our e-commerce platform, the speed of delivery by Amazon Fulfillment, engagement with the software interface, and a seamless reordering process through our subscription model. And in DexCom tradition, we are listening to customers and are already working to innovate the Stelo experience and meet the distinct needs of people with pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin. Even with the product being targeted to those populations, we've seen plenty of inbound interest for people looking to take advantage of the OTC opportunity early in their metabolic health journey. Across these cohorts, currently around half of our customers have signed up for Stelo subscription, which is encouraging to see this early in a product launch. We have historically found that greater CGM usage can lead to improved health outcomes and we'll be tracking this closely as the market further develops. In October, we also began our initial expansion of distribution options for Stelo. To start, we've broadened our sales presence and increased our partnerships by providing several of our core DME partners access to Stelo on their platforms. This gives them yet another great product to engage and more fully broadly serve the diabetes community. We've also initiated our first B2B sales of Stelo. This includes direct sales to certain clinicians as one of the first requests that we heard at the outset of Stelo's launch was the desire from clinicians to have Stelo available for sale within their practices. We've been very encouraged by Stelo's launch thus far, and this is only the beginning. Stelo will continue to adapt and evolve as we incorporate functionality that personalizes the experience for our customers. Finally, our team is always working to enhance customer experience across our platforms and we recently took another exciting step forward on this journey. Following the completion of the necessary clinical work, we submitted our DexCom G7 15-day CGM system to the FDA for review. This has been a top priority across the organization and we're looking forward to bringing this product to market as soon as possible. We will have more to discuss around this product and its commercial rollout in the months ahead. In summary, the team has worked tirelessly to respond to the dynamics that emerged earlier this year. We're moving quickly and putting in place the pieces to help us return to the growth levels we expect from ourselves. And just as important, even as we work through these near-term dynamics, we continue to manage this business for the long-term. With that, I'll turn it over to Jereme.\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial measures presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as the slide deck on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2024, we reported worldwide revenue of $994 million compared to $975 million for the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 2% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. US revenue totaled $702 million for the third quarter compared to $714 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a decline of 2%. This reflected the compounding effect of slower new customer starts from Q2, along with a decline in our revenue per customer due to shifting channel dynamics and higher rebate eligibility compared to a year ago. This eligibility component alone created a year-over-year negative impact of approximately 6 points of growth in the US. With rebate eligibility now near 100%, we expect this impact peaked in Q3 and we'll moderate over the next couple of quarters. In the DME channel, we experienced some incremental share loss during the quarter as we had contemplated in our previous guidance. However, we were encouraged to see these trends stabilize late in the quarter as our team worked quickly to better align with these partners in the field. As Kevin mentioned, the DME channel is a core part of our strategy and we are working collaboratively with our distributors to unlock meaningful growth. International revenue grew 12%, totaling $292 million in the third quarter. International organic revenue growth was 16% for the third quarter. We saw an acceleration in many of our core international markets in Q3 as we expanded availability of G7 and DexCom ONE+ across our footprint. With our leading product portfolio and the growing evidence of health outcomes driven by DexCom CGM, we continue to see significant opportunity to expand reimbursed access to our CGM systems in international markets, particularly in the Type 2 intensive and Type 2 Basal categories. Our third quarter gross profit was $625.9 million or 63% of revenue compared to $64.7 of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we incurred a $24.6 million non-cash charge on inventory related to some build configurations that we determined were not appropriate for commercial launch. We excluded this from our non-GAAP results for the quarter. We've made significant progress in transitioning our installed base to the G7 form factor with new pump integrations and the continued rollout of DexCom ONE+. This has enabled us to further scale our high-volume manufacturing facilities, which positions us well as we work towards our long-term cost targets. Additionally, Kevin noted that we recently filed our 15-day G7 sensor with the FDA for review. This potential clearance will provide us yet another compelling cost lever into 2025 and beyond. Operating expenses were $413.9 million for Q3 2024 compared to $391.5 million in Q3 2023. Operating income was $212 million, or 21.3% of revenue in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $238.9, or 24.5% of revenue in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $300.1 million, or 30.2% of revenue for the third quarter compared to $314.5 million, or 32.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2023. Net income for the third quarter was $179.9 million or $0.45 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. This cash position, along with our growing free cash flow profile, provides us a lot of financial flexibility. We took advantage of this during the third quarter as we quickly executed our previously announced $750 million share repurchase program during the quarter. Turning to guidance. We are maintaining our 2024 guidance in the range of $4.00 billion to $4.05 billion, representing organic growth of 11% to 13% for the year. With the third quarter playing out as expected, our guidance reflects a continued ramp in our US sales force productivity, while we continue to work through some of the channel and rebate dynamics discussed above. Through this ongoing execution, inclusive of record new patient starts in the third quarter and our continued rollout of Stelo, we are building momentum as we enter 2025. For margins, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of non-GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 63%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 29%. With a full quarter now under our belt since resetting our 2024 guidance, we remain on track to achieve the $4.6 billion revenue and corresponding margin targets embedded in our 2025 long-range plan. With that, we can open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Jereme. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then re-enter the queue if necessary. Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on the filing of the 15-day and the progress in the quarter. It does sound like you feel confident in the progress you have made. US did though come in a little bit below consensus. I'm sure there are some modeling dynamics there that we just got wrong. But I was just curious if you could give any more color on the progress made as we move through the quarter in August and September. And maybe anything you can say about the run rate exiting the quarter or what you can say about sort of where you are with DMEs from a share perspective, any other color you can add would be great. Thanks so much.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Danielle. This is Kevin. I'll take that one. We knew that this quarter was going to be a tad rocky. That's why we guided where we did and we overachieved on -- came in at the top-end of that range. So we feel good about that. As we exited the quarter, there's a lot of good things that we saw. First of all, the growth and development of the sales organization really took a turn up over the course of this quarter as people got more familiar with their territories, their relationships with their physicians, and all those other factors required when you make the changes like we made. You see that in the new patient adds being at record level and that really was happening over the course of the last part of this quarter. So it was very strong in latter half of August and in September. On top of that, we talk about the 35,000 new prescribers that have been added through the course of this quarter. And while when you add a new one, it's not 10 new users at the same time, it's certainly one. And we now have the prescriber base sized out to where we hoped it would be when we did this field expansion to whereby we can begin to go deeper and we believe that's going to be very helpful. On the DME side, we talked about things stabilizing. Things did stabilize. We had estimated and Jereme said earlier in his remarks that we continue to lose a bit of share. The first two months of the quarter, we saw things start to stabilize in September. And that was a positive note. The other thing that's very positive for us going forward for the sales team is the Stelo message because as they're calling on more primary care physicians and those who see people with Type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, who are on insulin that Stelo message rings loud and clear and offers these physicians a great opportunity to enhance the care model for their patients. It also enables those physicians to see if in fact it's a more severe patient that they have access to the G-Series. At the end of that, with this momentum, we feel real good about the implied sequential growth into the fourth quarter in the US, like it's higher than what we've had in the past. And that's even without a Stelo contribution. So we feel very good going forward, Danielle, to the rest of this year and rolling into '25 based on what we saw as the quarter finished.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, when we aggregate your Q3 results with Abbott, it looks like the US CGM market slowed to about 10% from over 20% in the first half of this year and high 20s before that. So there's still concerns that the CGM market is slowing. Is the 10% or so market growth in Q3 a good number going forward? Or are there one-time items in the third quarter that you think depressed the market? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: I believe in general, again, our numbers, we had to deal with the factors we pointed out on the last call with channel mix shifting and things of that nature. So we believe that our numbers are lower, like we said, based on our execution that we needed to make better and the things we disclosed last time. We're still very bullish on the category, Larry. We believe the market can grow faster than that going forward and we want to get back in. Basal coverage is still early on and we have many other people on intensive insulin, who still don't use CGM. So there's plenty of market to go after. We don't believe it's just a 10% grower. Again, when you add the two of us together, that's where we are, but we believe our performance will pick up going forward.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could help us understand or benchmark your progress a little better versus some of the things that you said in Q2, like, do you still expect to get the same new starts in Q4 that you did before? And can you talk about whether you think the low-end of the long-range plan is still in play in 2025?\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Matt. I can answer those. When we talked last time, we talked about a few things that we expected to play out. One was we saw that we were a little bit behind in terms of the productivity in the sales force, and we were a bit behind where our new patients were. And we said we were going to be about three months behind, and I think you're seeing that play out. And so when you look at the performance this quarter, record new patients in the third quarter, I think you're seeing us perform that way and we expect obviously to do better in the fourth quarter as we get more and more effective over time. Now we said we were about three months behind, and so we won't necessarily be where we initially thought starting the year, but we are in line with the guidance we gave last time we spoke, and we're making progress as we said. In terms of the long-term guide, I think you heard it in my comments. We're on track to hit our long-term guide. We said basically, we are on track to hit our $4.6 billion in the same margin targets we gave based on what we're seeing in the business today, which is obviously record patients this quarter, stability in the DME channel some of the productivity, of course, in the sales force. Certainly outside the US, you saw our international results accelerate a little bit and we have more opportunities opening up over the course of this year and into next year. We feel good about where we're going and we haven't even really talked about Stelo. Stelo is going to be a real interesting opportunity for us going forward. We've got a couple of months under our belt. Great progress to date. And looking forward to sharing more and more as time moves on with Stelo.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe two follower -- or two-parter if I could. Just, first question, just as you talk about the record new starts in the US, is that with or without Stelo? I'd appreciate understanding that. And then as kind of a tie-in to that, with the volatility in the last quarter or two, I'm sure my patient model is off a little bit. But when I look at least what my model spits out, it says that your patient volumes in the US -- your installed-base, I'm sorry, in the US is probably up somewhere around 27%, 28% year-over-year this quarter, you did the negative 2% US revenue growth. So I guess I'm -- is there any way to help us bucket kind of that 25 to 30 point spread between what I think your installed base grew in the US and what your revenue grew? I know you talked about the 6 points of headwind from rebates, is there anything else to help us kind of bridge that 25 to 30 point gap? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yeah, I can take that. So first off, record new patients does not include Stelo. So we're excluding Stelo. This is really our G-Series/T-Series, call it, our insulin product base. So like-for-like apples-for-apples record quarter. So hopefully, that gives you some context there. In terms of where we're going, while we're not necessarily giving our patient base, I think we gave a patient base last quarter and that really implied mid-20% growth in terms of that patient base. Now in the current quarter, Jeff, we are seeing a little bit of the kind of the Q2 performance rolling through in the third quarter. And so as you know, as you think about patient starts, the big kind of tie-in between both patients and unit volume, you really feel it in the subsequent quarter. So if you think 25% last point we gave it, it's a little bit tighter than I think your model is implying. So it's not too, too far off, but it's tighter than that. In terms of then the year-over-year delta, certainly you pointed out rebates. The biggest piece that remains between the two is where folks are getting their product. And we talked about losing share in the DME in the second quarter and to a lesser extent, some here in the third quarter, while the majority of the new patient starts were going through the pharmacy. As that delta takes place over time, it creates a widening based on the channel that we've historically seen. Now as that stabilizes, we expect that to start coming closer over time. But that's the reason why you see that. Our unit volumes are still strong as an organization. We're still excited about this over the longer term, but we needed to navigate through the stabilization of those and I think you saw it in the third quarter. So hopefully, that gives you some context on the model. Big piece of it's going to be that channel shift in addition to rebates, but predominantly channel shift.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions -- I guess, question. I wanted to ask in the DME channel, it sounded like you've stabilized your position there. I was just hoping you could give us a more detailed look as to what exactly you're doing there? Is price a factor? How are you changing the relationships? And is it unreasonable to think that you could get back to where you were two, three, four years ago with your standing with DMEs or should we think about just gradual improvements? Thanks a lot.\nKevin Sayer: Yeah, this is Kevin, I'll take that. Some of the actions we put in place, first of all, we obviously met with the leadership of all those companies and listened to them and heard what they had to say. By and large, these partners have served us well. And as far as getting along day-to-day, we do very well. Where we disrupted the apple cart, Robbie, again, is relationships in the field, where we changed literally every single sales territory, the DME rep relationships were lost frequently between our rep in their territory and the DME rep in the corresponding territory. In addition to that, with respect to channel balance, one of the things we learned and one of the perceptions of our DME partners is that we were not balanced that if we had an opportunity to send somebody to the drugstore, we sent them to the pharmacy immediately without checking the DME channel. So we've now encouraged our team to be a lot more channel-agnostic. And if there's an opportunity to go to DME, and it looks like that's going to be a very good alternative for a lot of our patients, we'll pursue that opportunity for those patients and put more business into that channel. These partners and these companies, as I've spoken with them, my conversations have not centered around price, they centered around volume. What these guys want is more patients. We need to get more prescriptions. We need to get more prescriptions sent through that channel. We need to get more prescriptions referred to us through that channel. As we send more their way, we're confident we'll get more back the other way. As we said last call and I'll say again, while we think we stabilized, this is going to take a while to build back up, it's not going to happen overnight. And so we -- but we needed presence in the Type 2 market as well because many of these patients are Medicare Type 2 patients and we haven't been calling out a lot of the physicians in that primary-care community who serve them. Add all those pieces back up, we think we've taken very good steps to shift it in the other direction. We've taken very good steps to get more referrals to put into the pipeline and serve more customers and we believe we're on the right track. One of the other things we've done, by the way, with our DME partners, as we talked about in the call, we've offered them Stelo. They serve a lot of Type 2 patients who may or may not be on insulin, who have other medical conditions. By offering Stelo to these guys, they have an opportunity to market and sell to their very large patient bases even outside of typical diabetes therapies with respect to their help. So we're looking forward to them being a great additional Stelo distribution channel for us as well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Congratulations on submitting the 15-day G7 to the FDA. Could you please give us a little bit of an update on your thinking of, number one, the timing of when that might be approved? And number two, what you think the financial impact will be as we think about our 2025 numbers? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: You know what, I'll start with approval timeframe. We've submitted and we think it's a very good filing, but we won't go too far as far as speculating on when they're going to approve our filing. Conversely, we did submit a Stelo filing with a 15-day product that was very clean with very good data and got it approved very quickly. We would love a fast approval here. And as far as 2025 impact, a lot of that will depend on launch timing and how long it takes us to roll through the customer base and we'll give you more color on that as we go. I'll let Jereme talk about the financial impact.\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah, obviously, Joanne, you know this one really, really well as we start to go into some of these contracts where it's a monthly fee, that's going to be a big opportunity for us. As of right now, we talk about our long-range plan guide in 2025 and at 65%, and that's where we are. That all being said, we know this is an interesting lever. And so we'll give you more clarity as we start to roll out commercial plans on when we expect those levers to be in the business, but nothing more exciting, as you could imagine, at least in my world of having this opportunity to lever through the business and we're really excited about it as well. So I think the thing we talk about as investors is gross margin, but there's also customers who are really looking forward to the longer extended wear period. And that's another great thing that we're going to offer through this product. A lot of good things coming here really soon.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Polark: Good afternoon. My question is on opening Stelo to DMEs and doctors directly. I've been working under the assumption Stelo in the US would kind of go for your lowest price point yet, $100 a patient a month, $1,200 a year. And now if you're introducing a channel in theory, these folks have to earn margins. So can you help me just understand how you're going to price it with DMEs and doctors? In two, three years from now, how much of Stelo are you doing direct versus through these partners in your mind? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: Yeah. It's a fair question. We've always -- and first-off, really appreciate your note on Stelo earlier. I thought it was -- I'm glad you're wearing it and really appreciate you going through and doing the comparison there. In terms of how we're thinking about partners, we always have thought about partners, and whether those partners are DME providers or bulk purchases or other forms in other different distribution channels, which you can imagine we're looking at, they've all been part of the long-term contemplation. In terms of how we then think about that and how that runs through the financials, remember, on stelo.com, we obviously bear a lot of the commercial work, the shipping work, all the work takes place associated with that. When you go through partners and some of that OpEx goes -- and some of those shipping costs ultimately accrue to the partner as part of the fulfillment and part of their work going on. So when you think about it, we will be pricing. Obviously, they have to get a margin on it. And so we will be pricing it accordingly. At the same time, the cost to us is incredibly low and we ship in bulk and we go from there. It's not too dissimilar from the economies of scales that we saw going through the pharmacy channel, where we knew that it can be it's a very efficient model. So I think you can expect to see that over time. You'd expect to see it as we look at other channels even beyond those, which we're working on as we speak. So it's always part of the plan, but stelo.com will always also be part of the plan. And so I think you can imagine we'll have a few different opportunities, all of which accrue, I think down to the bottom-line operating margin in a very similar manner.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMathew Blackman: Good afternoon, everybody. Can you hear me okay?\nKevin Sayer: Yep.\nMathew Blackman: Okay. I'm curious just how you're thinking about competition in your Type 1 sort of pump integrated segment, particularly next year when there's going to be more competition. And look, I appreciate you probably don't want to be too explicit, but how are you going to defend your position there considering doing head-to-head studies? I'm really just trying to understand what the messaging is going to be to physicians and patients when there's another sensor option out there probably sometime next year. Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Well, I'll start. Every study in these AID systems has been done with the DexCom sensor. So there aren't any head-to-head studies. They've all been run with DexCom, at least with our pump partners, and that's the data they publish for their time in range. Look, we serve, several hundred thousand AID system users right now and the results of those AID systems with our partners have been incredibly good. We work very closely with them on a regular basis to talk about the new features we're about to bring on Board. We update our hardware and our app experience, our interfaces with them on a regular basis to enrich the experiences of their customers, and we believe we do that better than anybody else. Over time, our reputation in this market and one of the places we've been always strong is in this Type 1 market because that has been where we have had the largest market share advantage for a very long time and we intend to maintain that through the higher quality of our product. And at the end of the day, it matters. The accuracy of DexCom is tried and trude and proven to these patients. I've been to several -- it's kind of diabetes fundraiser season. I've been to a few fundraiser things that I've seen numerous Omnipod and Tandem users, who are now using G7, certainly the Tandem ones and the Omnipods were starting to switch. Their belief in DexCom and our sensors is incredibly heartwarming. And it's very important to see that is a great customer base for us. And we'll continue to serve it the same way we always have.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the 2025, how you're thinking about the US recovery in that '25. I don't know if the US is back to double-digits. I don't know if there's any first half, second half comments you'd like to throw in. And any rebate eligibility in 2025. And I don't know if it includes Stelo or not, just curious if -- I don't know if you reiterated the Stelo guide for '24. I would just love some color on that.\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I'll give you some of the commentary. So certainly, it assumes a stable market moving into 2025, so stable adoption, stable penetration trends moving from '24 into '25. It also assumes stable, not necessarily winning share back, but stable trends to the DME share and then certainly us continuing to do well in the retail channel, which we've seen over the past quarter, and we expect to see for the rest of the year. It does include Stelo. And we've considered a bunch of different ranges and opportunities. You can probably imagine, given we're only a couple of months into launch, there's multiple different opportunities and ranges. Kevin alluded to two different channels we're launching right now across both DME and Bulk. And you can imagine there's a few more channels we'll be launching here over the coming months, which we're all really excited about and going into a holiday season. This will be a first ever US OTC holiday season with the Stelo out there. So there's a lot of things we're going to learn over the course of the coming weeks before we give it. We've taken in contemplation all of those range stability in terms of what those numbers are and felt good about the $4.6 billion number. And so it includes all of that. And so, hopefully, that answers the question, of course, we'll give you some more clarity by quarter as we get into the end of the year. But you can probably imagine just given comps what you can do the math on what comps would look like. And we obviously have a little bit more challenging comps in the first half, a little bit easier comps in the back half, certainly, as we're talking about Q3, but nothing funky there, just naturally lapping comps. The rebate question, you got -- you're 100% correct, 100% rebate is assumed and so you won't necessarily have that headwind.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG. Your line is open.\nMarie Thibault: Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I want to follow up on the rebate issue. I think I heard -- maybe I missed it, but I think I heard it was 6 points of impact to growth in Q3. What's being assumed in the Q4 guide for points of impact from the rebate issue?\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah, it's less than that. And so I think that number was going up as we moved into Q4 of last year. We don't have an exact number to give in that guide. Obviously, we generally don't guide specific items like that, but it won't be 6 points. It obviously peaked into Q3. It's going to be less in Q4. And so, I think you can safely assume that. Again, haven't given a specific number yet, but again, if the models are -- you'd expect that the ASPs will be pretty consistent moving in from Q3 to Q4 because we do have them at 100% rebate rate.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. And maybe just a follow-up on the '25 outlook, Jereme, $4.6 billion, that's about, I don't know, something like $500 million of growth absolute year-over-year. You've done that before. You would have done that this year without the mix headwinds. But this time around, you're going to be trying to do that kind of growth with patients that maybe aren't going to use products as much Basal, Stelo, et cetera. So how do you kind of deconstruct getting that kind of absolute growth next year on top of the fact that you're going to have some competition on the pump side of things, and then maybe a little bit of price on the DME side of things? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. Sure. And, look, I think and appreciate the comments. Certainly, Stelo -- and we've always assumed that in our modeling is you're not necessarily going to have the same retention utilization in Stelo. But Stelo is a brand new category for us. So you got to remember the comps relative to next year to this year are certainly different. As you step back and you think about a record new patient quarter this quarter, and obviously, as our sales force continues to get more and more productive, you're going to expect to add more patients next year. So when you think about it in terms of just net absolute dollars, when you say, well, gee, there are new patients added -- record new patients in our core insulin business, as that rolls forward and more access opens up, you're going to have more opportunity there. And so, I would expect that as we moved into 2025. On top of that, you're going to have a new product launch in Stelo in the US that can also contribute as well. So when you think about both of those, you're not wrong in the sense that Stelo utilization and retention should be lower, but it's going to be against the backdrop of really no revenue in the first half of the year and only partial revenue here in the third quarter of the year. So hopefully, that gives you some context towards it -- in terms of growth of the overall business. And that's why we -- as we've gone through it, we felt good about reiterating that LRP.\nKevin Sayer: I guess the other thing I'd add, Jereme, we have a 15-day product to launch in 2025 as well, which we believe will a great -- will be a great revenue enhancer for us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nBill Plovanic: Great. Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Stelo, I think the original guide was $40 million this year. Just commentary on that. And then are you seeing with initial usage, can I -- I think this as a potential as a kind of a gateway product for you. Have you seen any Stelo be diagnosed pre-diabetes or Type 2, and transfer into the G7 product? And if so, kind of what are your kind of expectations for that as well? Thanks.\nKevin Sayer: Yeah, this is Kevin. I'll take all of those. I don't know that we've necessarily seen a lot. And I mean, we've heard some anecdotal stories, but we haven't seen a massive trend of people diagnosed. But what we have seen is as our reps have gone into primary care offices, with the Stelo message, we then find out they have people with diabetes who actually have coverage for G7 and they can get one that's reimbursed and insured. So that has led to much better and much more positive conversations with our sales force as they go into new offices. We believe that's a trend that actually could play out very well over the course of the year. That's why we designed this app and this experience for those with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes non-insulin rather than a straight health and wellness play. We felt that was the most lucrative market for us to go after first because we could migrate those patients to a reimbursed solution over time, if in fact, they do have diabetes. With respect to our revenues for the year, we projected 1% of revenues and we can extrapolate that to $40 million. Our goal in launching Stelo this year is to learn, whether that's $30 million or $40 million, the most important thing is that we learn what to do. Our learnings have been spectacular. Amazon fulfillment was the first big learning as several people I talked to ordered the first day we put it on the market, got it the next morning. We've never experienced anything like that at DexCom. At the same time, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've had positive feedback on the app, we've had positive feedback on the website. We've also had some things that we've been told we can do better with respect to our customer service model as a lot of these people have never interfaced with a product like this. We will learn as we go to more distribution channels and we get again to a more diverse group of people over and over again. We've got a base right now of over 70,000 users on our product we launched a couple of months ago. That's a huge success for us as far as we're concerned. We've given our guidance for the quarter. We've reaffirmed it. Stelo right now for us is a huge success and we are really looking at things we can do to enhance the experience of those users going forward to make it more sticky and to add more. So far, so good with Stelo we're very pleased.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJayson Bedford: Good afternoon. I have a few questions that require short answers. I just wanted to come back to the new user add commentary. Just for clarification, this was a record for 3Q, or any quarter? Did the comment apply to both US and international? And have you seen any notable change in attrition? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah, so it's a record for any quarter, Jason. We generally don't break out US, OUS, but it's a record for any quarter, not 3Q, but any quarter. In terms of attrition, we haven't seen many changes in attrition by category. So we've generally talked about the bands where you have insulin-intensive users have traditionally stayed in a band, you have the basal user that traditionally stays relatively close and they're kind of clustered in there into that same band. And then we all know that the non-insulin user tends to be in a band of its own. Those continue to remain very similar categorically.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Joshua Jennings with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJoshua Jennings: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just was hoping you could help us think through the risk of persistent channel mix-shift from DME to pharma with two pump players looking to access the pharmacy channel for their own products. I guess the two-part question is, one, I mean, is the Omnipod 5 share gains and that access to the pharmacy channel driving some of the mix-shift you're seeing? And do you think it's a risk that these other two players are going to be accessing the pharmacy channel over the next 12, 18, 24 months? Thanks a lot.\nKevin Sayer: This is Kevin. I'll take that. Jereme, you can add to my comments when I'm done. We've seen such a major shift of our volumes to that pharmacy channel, particularly on the commercial side where many of these pumpers reside that the DME commercial channel is not near as large a segment for us as it used to be. The majority of our DME business certainly is in Medicare and in the government channel. And so if -- as others seek reimbursement and others seek distribution in the pharmacy channel, we're well-positioned to serve that. If we can get -- again as long as we're channel agnostic and our users can get their product where they want to and get it in a manner that's efficacious for them and have a great experience, we will remain channel neutral on that front.\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. And just as a reminder, the Medicare fee-for-service channel, i.e. the non-Medicare Advantage channel is reimbursed via Part B, i.e, DME. And so it won't necessarily shift to the pharmacy anytime soon. So there's a certain limitation on what you could expect even within the DME channels because of the reimbursement schemes as they exist today. So hopefully, that's helpful at least in thinking about the persistence of any sort of change there.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nShagun Singh: Great. Thank you so much. So just given the leadership transition in the US, can you talk about your confidence in the commercial strategy getting into 2025? And then more specifically on Stelo, what's your plan for accelerating this launch in 2025? And then on the G15 -- G7 15-day sensor, how are you preparing ahead of the launch including with respect to supply? Thank you for taking the question.\nKevin Sayer: Okay. Let me start with the 15-day product. Again, this will be manufactured on our current manufacturing lines and put together the same way the current 10-day product is manufactured. We already manufacture a 15-day product in our Stelo product. So we're not concerned about having capacity to build a 15-day sensor. It's a question of when we turn it on and how much inventory we build in advance and what markets we serve with that product. With respect to Stelo and expansion, a couple of things going on there. Number one, we have a number of scheduled enhancements to the Stelo app over the course of 2025 and even through the course of 2024 to make this a much richer experience for those who use it. So you'll see a steady stream of things come with Stelo. And also again, Jereme and I both have talked about additional distribution channels where that product can be very well-positioned and sold to potential Stelo seller end-users. So you see distribution channel expansion. Remember, our US sales force has only had one sales cycle to talk about stelo end offices yet. They will continue to talk about that in offices and we'll get more and more coverage there with respect to knowledge on the physician's part over the course of 2025. Familiarity will breed growth and we've got to get that message in front of people more than once to get them to go there. With respect to the commercial change, look, we'll miss Teri. She's done a great job here. At the same time, we have a lot of good leaders in this organization. As I said earlier, I've spent quite a bit of time with the Head of Sales and Marketing reported me directly for a while before Teri came. So I'm familiar with this and we have a great team of leadership with the company. We will quickly find a new Chief Commercial Officer to head this group. At the same time, I'm not concerned about the leadership of my US team. They're very, very good and very strong and very experienced in the industry. We will work very hard not to disappoint. We're fine.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. I want to ask a couple of questions about the 15-day sensor. Jereme, are there any incremental costs associated with that product or at scale should have the same cost profile as the current version? And then I know you guys took your time moving that forward because you really wanted to optimize durability. Do you expect the survival to full wear time to be similar to what patients are experiencing today?\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. So I'll start with the second one. We expect the durability to 15-day to be solid. And when I say solid, obviously, any additional days you wear a sensor, you always run into more risk and chance. But we got it to a point where we believe the survivability is going to be very well-received by the community. And so that's the work -- that's the expectation as it launches. In terms of the product itself, the standard cost really doesn't change at all. Certainly, we will be mindful of some of the changes we're making across the board in terms of just adhesives and things that you're already seeing starting to play through our product, but the standard cost doesn't change. To the extent that we add a little bit there for warranty here and there just because what can go wrong over five more days, whether it knocks off an arm or you just sweat it out. We'll always be mindful of those types of things, but the standard cost shouldn't change too much. So there's real opportunity here for us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nMike Kratky: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking our question. To what extent did you benefit from competitor CGM shortages towards the end of the quarter in the US? Can you help quantify how much of an impact this may have had on your US growth in 3Q, if any? And does your current revenue guidance assume any potential contribution from that dynamic in 4Q?\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. We had heard about some of the disruptions here and there. And at the end of the day, everybody goes through these types of things. What we ultimately expect at the end of the day is, you have to write a script. When you write a script, it has to be branded. And when you write that script, you ultimately go fulfill it. And so we didn't necessarily expect it. We didn't see anything necessarily change. Or what we really saw was our sales force getting out there and getting more interest in DexCom. Obviously, folks go through these challenges and they come and they go, I don't know that it changed all that much. I don't know that changed our trajectory. I think what you really saw was and we're seeing it in our metrics is our sales force has done a really nice job bringing in new physicians and really getting the message in front of them in conjunction with both our G7 as well as Stelo. That's what you saw.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is open. And, Matt, please check your mute button. And hearing no response, we will move to our next question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. Hi guys. You talked about part of the improved international performance in the quarter coming from the turn in Japan as you guys took over. Looking into 2025, can you talk about what you see as the biggest drivers internationally?\nKevin Sayer: Yeah. This is Kevin. I'll start. We've opened up a tremendous amount of access across the world over the past several months. I said in my prepared remarks, for example, we just launched DexCom ONE in France in October, where reimbursement is now opened up and we have access to 600,000 more individuals. In Japan, there's access to a million individuals. Both of these markets include Basal insulin as well. We're seeing access wins in several of the EU markets that are more mature on the intensive insulin side particularly with respect to Type 1, opening up access slowly to Basal patients and having this Basal opportunity come forward. Additionally, a lot of these markets don't even access intensive insulin use for Type 2 patients, and access is coming there as well. So access will be a big driver in the markets that we serve more than anything else over 2025.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nPatrick Wood: Brilliant. Thank you for taking the question. Just curious for the record new starts and just what you've seen in the business overall. If you could give any qualitative commentary between what you've seen within Type 1 versus Type 2? I know Stelo mix is not up a little bit, but just the kind of the sources of growth and how those markets split the health of them? Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Yeah, we can answer that. And what the record new patient starts exclude Stelo. So I think it's helpful to know that when Kevin alluded to 70,000 folks using Stelo, that's not in the numbers we're quoting around record new patients. And I think what -- so I think what you're seeing now is you're continuing to see a pretty robust adoption really in all categories. Your intensive insulin continues to lead the way across T1 and T2 intensive insulin. And we expected that coming into the year, but basal continues to also be relatively strong. And what you're seeing more and more of as we deeper dive into these physicians where a lot of basal patients are seen. That's where a lot of our work was taking place over the course of the third quarter in terms of getting back to productivity, and you're starting to see more and more of that. So it's really broad-based across the insulin-using population. You are seeing a lot of nice uptake in the non-insulin and health and wellness population in Stelo, but that's not included in our record new patient number.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Issie Kirby with Redburn-Atlantic. Your line is open.\nIssie Kirby: Hi, guys. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it is only a couple of months since the launch with Stelo, but would love to hear any early insights you have around reordering, retention rate, and also any sort of color you can give on returns and reliability of the product. Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: Yeah, this is Kevin. I'll start with that. With respect -- I said earlier, 50% -- at least 50% of our individuals signed up on the subscription model. And reordering has just begun. We're happy with reordering rates right now. So that's going very well. But it's early. We have more to learn there. With respect to retention and with respect to reliability and customer interface, this has been great for us. We have a completely different service model with Stelo with what we call Stelo bought online and we've learned a lot through that. We've learned that there are some things we can do better that we've learned that there are some things that worked very well. We're trying to develop a much more efficient, easy service model for these customers just given the nature of this business and things we can learn and apply to our core business later on. As we hear from these users, we are learning also that a consumer market has different expectations for a glucose sensor than somebody who has intensive insulin therapy. Somebody on intensive insulin therapy knows that physiology comes into effect from time to time and the sensor may turn off it seven days. Just say this doesn't work anymore. But they depend on that sensor for their life. So they, okay, this turned off at seven days. I can deal with that. Well, when you're a consumer and you buy a Stelo and turned off it seven days, hey, I just paid for this. Why is this turning off it seven days? So we are learning how to deal with that patient and that individual, that customer to create the proper experience. That's why I said earlier, the most important thing of the Stelo launch is that we learn that we learn a model that will delight our customers when they use this product. And if they choose to use this product three or four times a year, then let's make sure we create an experience that is delightful three or four times a year. If we do a good job, hopefully, we can keep on the product all the time and have continuous use. It's still early to tell how usage and retention and all that's going to be because we're just a couple of months into the launch now. But we're seeing reorders, we're seeing people sign back up on subscriptions to get more at a rate that it's very, very good with respect to our expectations.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMacauley Kilbane: Hi, everyone. This is Macauley on for Margaret. Thanks for taking our question. Just a follow-up on some of the earlier questions on the LRP. You previously mentioned, call it, 70%, 30% US OUS sales split. Does that imply a larger OUS contribution now in order to hit the low end at the $4.6 billion? And maybe just a follow-up on the 15-day durability. Stelo, I think achieved the roughly 80% in the studies, but how does that compare to what you've seen in the first couple of months of the launch? And any commentary on if the 15-day G7 was able to exceed that?\nJereme Sylvain: Yeah. So I think in terms of the LRP, as you're thinking about the splits, the splits are roughly that. I mean, there's a lot that goes on in terms of what those numbers are, including now the new Stelo product. And so, we'll -- what I would say is, as you're thinking about growth rates, I'd expect the international business to continue to grow based on the trajectory you're seeing today and the additional wins to continue to do well, and obviously, the US to do well as well as we stabilize our core markets and obviously, Stelo jumps in. So in the general 70% to 30% ballpark, I wouldn't draw necessarily 0.0 lines and get overly stuck up on that. But in general, that's the splits we expect. In terms of how you're thinking about Stelo, it's lasting. How long it last? What we are seeing is quite a few sensors, most sensors lasting the 15 days. We're seeing the performance in the field mirror that of which we've seen obviously in our submissions. It's interesting as more and more people learn how to use the product and it becomes more and more familiar, you see those numbers go up. So you might have seen in the first couple of days, folks unsure of how to use the product, maybe apply it inappropriately, apply it to the wrong place. And we ultimately had to make sure we navigated through some of that education. But we're looking at sensor life and we're seeing sensor life lasting out to those 15 days, and seeing so at a pretty common clip. So we're very excited about that. Obviously, with the G7 15-day, we got to a survival rate we felt good with. And so you could imagine as we're submitting that, it's a number that we feel good with, just like we feel good with the Stelo number. We'll wait to give more data on that as that data becomes available through our submission and hopefully approval here in the near future. You guys will see it. But we are comfortable with what we had in terms of survivability in that submission.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Sayer, for closing remarks.\nKevin Sayer: I would just like to thank everybody for participating today and we'll talk to you again at the first of the year on when we start providing guidance for 2025 officially. Have a great winter, everybody, and we'll talk again soon.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Before we dive in, I want to take this opportunity to share an important update. As many of you saw in today's press release, our Chief Commercial Officer, Teri Lawver has expressed her plan to retire from DexCom. Teri, is a great leader who has advanced our commercial organization in several areas in the past two years, including the launches of our G7 system and Stelo, which I will touch on shortly. I am thankful for her strong leadership and dedication to DexCom and she will continue to work with me as a Special Advisor and Consultant through early next year as we navigate the transition and our search for a new Chief Commercial Officer. I will assume leadership of the team and having managed this team before, I can speak to their quality and look forward to leading them again. There are three primary takeaways I want to convey today, reinforced by what I've observed since our last quarter call. First, CGM remains a premier global growth category and the excitement and uptake we've seen with the Stelo launch has further reinforced my conviction about the long-term potential of this market. Second, I feel good about the execution progress that our team is making, both in terms of our commercial effectiveness and our product pipeline and we'll walk through some of those steps today. And finally, I feel confident in our pathway back to higher growth and continued margin expansion, which Jereme will discuss in more detail later. With those points as a framework for discussion, let's turn to the highlights from the quarter. Today, we reported third quarter organic revenue growth of 3% compared to the third quarter of 2023, which came in at the high end of our third-quarter guidance. Our team continues to build upon our foundation for long-term growth by delivering new products and customer experiences, while swiftly working through the temporary challenges to get us back on track. I want to touch on the action items we implemented in the third quarter and the strong progress we've made on the core issues identified. Together, these updates demonstrate that we are rebuilding momentum to solidify our growth as we head into 2025. Beginning with our US sales force expansion, we are pleased to report progress and positive momentum as we move to apply learnings from the initial rollout and improve our commercial execution. As we anticipated, our productivity metrics improved over the course of the third quarter as we implemented several changes to strengthen our sales effectiveness. Importantly, new customer starts returned to record levels in the third quarter as we gained greater traction in new and existing physician offices. We are now encouraged to report that since the expansion of the sales force in April, we have seen our prescriber base expand by nearly 35,000 clinicians. While the impact of these new relationships is not fully reflected in our third-quarter results, they represent a meaningful expansion in a few short months and set us up very well as we work to build on this momentum in Q4 and into 2025. Regarding our DME partnerships, we have worked quickly to refocus on those partnerships and ensure that our teams are aligned to the strategic importance of all channels in the US. Our leadership connected with our counterparts at the DME distributors in the last quarter to listen and collaborate on strategies that are mutually beneficial. Through this process, we found opportunities to better partner with these teams in the field as we collectively simplify workflows and provide a greater customer experience for all. While we still have work to do, we're in a far better position today than we were three months ago. These partnerships are a core part of our strategy and we are confident in our ability to drive meaningful growth that accrues to both us and these channel partners. We've also executed at a high level within our international markets. We saw third quarter revenue growth accelerate from the second quarter levels in nearly all of our direct markets driven by stronger new patient performance and the expanded availability of our G7 and DexCom ONE+ product platforms. This included the launch of G7 in Australia at the end of September, bringing our latest G-Series technology to our customers who have been eagerly awaiting its arrival. And we continued the expansion of our DexCom ONE+ system, which leverages our G7 hardware platform with a differentiated app experience. We've now introduced this technology in 19 countries with France being the latest addition in the third quarter in advance of the start of national reimbursement, including basal coverage in early October. This provides reimbursed access to more than 600,000 people in this important market. We also saw Japan return to growth in the third quarter, with our new sales organization gaining momentum in this critical market. While it is not yet a large component of our international revenue, our team is making strong inroads with the clinical community and building awareness among the more than one million potential customers who have access to DexCom CGM. In fact, we recently delivered our highest new customer start month since entering Japan in 2019 and we build on this progress in the coming quarters and years ahead. During the quarter, we were also thrilled to launch our newest product, Stelo in the US market. Stelo's launch represented a pivotal moment in the diabetes care and metabolic health landscape as now any adult in the US can access a DexCom Biosensor. It also provides a glimpse into the future of the broader care paradigm as more personalized solutions can encourage better lifestyle management and enable clinicians to make more informed therapy decisions. We are already hearing this exact feedback from our earliest adopters. Many of these individuals are engaging with their glucose data for the first time and sharing stories of how Stelo has changed their behavior and provided greater accountability in their lives. They are also sharing positive feedback on all stages of the product experience, everything from ordering through our e-commerce platform, the speed of delivery by Amazon Fulfillment, engagement with the software interface, and a seamless reordering process through our subscription model. And in DexCom tradition, we are listening to customers and are already working to innovate the Stelo experience and meet the distinct needs of people with pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin. Even with the product being targeted to those populations, we've seen plenty of inbound interest for people looking to take advantage of the OTC opportunity early in their metabolic health journey. Across these cohorts, currently around half of our customers have signed up for Stelo subscription, which is encouraging to see this early in a product launch. We have historically found that greater CGM usage can lead to improved health outcomes and we'll be tracking this closely as the market further develops. In October, we also began our initial expansion of distribution options for Stelo. To start, we've broadened our sales presence and increased our partnerships by providing several of our core DME partners access to Stelo on their platforms. This gives them yet another great product to engage and more fully broadly serve the diabetes community. We've also initiated our first B2B sales of Stelo. This includes direct sales to certain clinicians as one of the first requests that we heard at the outset of Stelo's launch was the desire from clinicians to have Stelo available for sale within their practices. We've been very encouraged by Stelo's launch thus far, and this is only the beginning. Stelo will continue to adapt and evolve as we incorporate functionality that personalizes the experience for our customers. Finally, our team is always working to enhance customer experience across our platforms and we recently took another exciting step forward on this journey. Following the completion of the necessary clinical work, we submitted our DexCom G7 15-day CGM system to the FDA for review. This has been a top priority across the organization and we're looking forward to bringing this product to market as soon as possible. We will have more to discuss around this product and its commercial rollout in the months ahead. In summary, the team has worked tirelessly to respond to the dynamics that emerged earlier this year. We're moving quickly and putting in place the pieces to help us return to the growth levels we expect from ourselves. And just as important, even as we work through these near-term dynamics, we continue to manage this business for the long-term. With that, I'll turn it over to Jereme. Thanks, Danielle. This is Kevin. I'll take that one. We knew that this quarter was going to be a tad rocky. That's why we guided where we did and we overachieved on -- came in at the top-end of that range. So we feel good about that. As we exited the quarter, there's a lot of good things that we saw. First of all, the growth and development of the sales organization really took a turn up over the course of this quarter as people got more familiar with their territories, their relationships with their physicians, and all those other factors required when you make the changes like we made. You see that in the new patient adds being at record level and that really was happening over the course of the last part of this quarter. So it was very strong in latter half of August and in September. On top of that, we talk about the 35,000 new prescribers that have been added through the course of this quarter. And while when you add a new one, it's not 10 new users at the same time, it's certainly one. And we now have the prescriber base sized out to where we hoped it would be when we did this field expansion to whereby we can begin to go deeper and we believe that's going to be very helpful. On the DME side, we talked about things stabilizing. Things did stabilize. We had estimated and Jereme said earlier in his remarks that we continue to lose a bit of share. The first two months of the quarter, we saw things start to stabilize in September. And that was a positive note. The other thing that's very positive for us going forward for the sales team is the Stelo message because as they're calling on more primary care physicians and those who see people with Type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, who are on insulin that Stelo message rings loud and clear and offers these physicians a great opportunity to enhance the care model for their patients. It also enables those physicians to see if in fact it's a more severe patient that they have access to the G-Series. At the end of that, with this momentum, we feel real good about the implied sequential growth into the fourth quarter in the US, like it's higher than what we've had in the past. And that's even without a Stelo contribution. So we feel very good going forward, Danielle, to the rest of this year and rolling into '25 based on what we saw as the quarter finished. I believe in general, again, our numbers, we had to deal with the factors we pointed out on the last call with channel mix shifting and things of that nature. So we believe that our numbers are lower, like we said, based on our execution that we needed to make better and the things we disclosed last time. We're still very bullish on the category, Larry. We believe the market can grow faster than that going forward and we want to get back in. Basal coverage is still early on and we have many other people on intensive insulin, who still don't use CGM. So there's plenty of market to go after. We don't believe it's just a 10% grower. Again, when you add the two of us together, that's where we are, but we believe our performance will pick up going forward. Yeah, I can take that. So first off, record new patients does not include Stelo. So we're excluding Stelo. This is really our G-Series/T-Series, call it, our insulin product base. So like-for-like apples-for-apples record quarter. So hopefully, that gives you some context there. In terms of where we're going, while we're not necessarily giving our patient base, I think we gave a patient base last quarter and that really implied mid-20% growth in terms of that patient base. Now in the current quarter, Jeff, we are seeing a little bit of the kind of the Q2 performance rolling through in the third quarter. And so as you know, as you think about patient starts, the big kind of tie-in between both patients and unit volume, you really feel it in the subsequent quarter. So if you think 25% last point we gave it, it's a little bit tighter than I think your model is implying. So it's not too, too far off, but it's tighter than that. In terms of then the year-over-year delta, certainly you pointed out rebates. The biggest piece that remains between the two is where folks are getting their product. And we talked about losing share in the DME in the second quarter and to a lesser extent, some here in the third quarter, while the majority of the new patient starts were going through the pharmacy. As that delta takes place over time, it creates a widening based on the channel that we've historically seen. Now as that stabilizes, we expect that to start coming closer over time. But that's the reason why you see that. Our unit volumes are still strong as an organization. We're still excited about this over the longer term, but we needed to navigate through the stabilization of those and I think you saw it in the third quarter. So hopefully, that gives you some context on the model. Big piece of it's going to be that channel shift in addition to rebates, but predominantly channel shift. Yeah, this is Kevin, I'll take that. Some of the actions we put in place, first of all, we obviously met with the leadership of all those companies and listened to them and heard what they had to say. By and large, these partners have served us well. And as far as getting along day-to-day, we do very well. Where we disrupted the apple cart, Robbie, again, is relationships in the field, where we changed literally every single sales territory, the DME rep relationships were lost frequently between our rep in their territory and the DME rep in the corresponding territory. In addition to that, with respect to channel balance, one of the things we learned and one of the perceptions of our DME partners is that we were not balanced that if we had an opportunity to send somebody to the drugstore, we sent them to the pharmacy immediately without checking the DME channel. So we've now encouraged our team to be a lot more channel-agnostic. And if there's an opportunity to go to DME, and it looks like that's going to be a very good alternative for a lot of our patients, we'll pursue that opportunity for those patients and put more business into that channel. These partners and these companies, as I've spoken with them, my conversations have not centered around price, they centered around volume. What these guys want is more patients. We need to get more prescriptions. We need to get more prescriptions sent through that channel. We need to get more prescriptions referred to us through that channel. As we send more their way, we're confident we'll get more back the other way. As we said last call and I'll say again, while we think we stabilized, this is going to take a while to build back up, it's not going to happen overnight. And so we -- but we needed presence in the Type 2 market as well because many of these patients are Medicare Type 2 patients and we haven't been calling out a lot of the physicians in that primary-care community who serve them. Add all those pieces back up, we think we've taken very good steps to shift it in the other direction. We've taken very good steps to get more referrals to put into the pipeline and serve more customers and we believe we're on the right track. One of the other things we've done, by the way, with our DME partners, as we talked about in the call, we've offered them Stelo. They serve a lot of Type 2 patients who may or may not be on insulin, who have other medical conditions. By offering Stelo to these guys, they have an opportunity to market and sell to their very large patient bases even outside of typical diabetes therapies with respect to their help. So we're looking forward to them being a great additional Stelo distribution channel for us as well. You know what, I'll start with approval timeframe. We've submitted and we think it's a very good filing, but we won't go too far as far as speculating on when they're going to approve our filing. Conversely, we did submit a Stelo filing with a 15-day product that was very clean with very good data and got it approved very quickly. We would love a fast approval here. And as far as 2025 impact, a lot of that will depend on launch timing and how long it takes us to roll through the customer base and we'll give you more color on that as we go. I'll let Jereme talk about the financial impact. Yeah. It's a fair question. We've always -- and first-off, really appreciate your note on Stelo earlier. I thought it was -- I'm glad you're wearing it and really appreciate you going through and doing the comparison there. In terms of how we're thinking about partners, we always have thought about partners, and whether those partners are DME providers or bulk purchases or other forms in other different distribution channels, which you can imagine we're looking at, they've all been part of the long-term contemplation. In terms of how we then think about that and how that runs through the financials, remember, on stelo.com, we obviously bear a lot of the commercial work, the shipping work, all the work takes place associated with that. When you go through partners and some of that OpEx goes -- and some of those shipping costs ultimately accrue to the partner as part of the fulfillment and part of their work going on. So when you think about it, we will be pricing. Obviously, they have to get a margin on it. And so we will be pricing it accordingly. At the same time, the cost to us is incredibly low and we ship in bulk and we go from there. It's not too dissimilar from the economies of scales that we saw going through the pharmacy channel, where we knew that it can be it's a very efficient model. So I think you can expect to see that over time. You'd expect to see it as we look at other channels even beyond those, which we're working on as we speak. So it's always part of the plan, but stelo.com will always also be part of the plan. And so I think you can imagine we'll have a few different opportunities, all of which accrue, I think down to the bottom-line operating margin in a very similar manner. Yep. Well, I'll start. Every study in these AID systems has been done with the DexCom sensor. So there aren't any head-to-head studies. They've all been run with DexCom, at least with our pump partners, and that's the data they publish for their time in range. Look, we serve, several hundred thousand AID system users right now and the results of those AID systems with our partners have been incredibly good. We work very closely with them on a regular basis to talk about the new features we're about to bring on Board. We update our hardware and our app experience, our interfaces with them on a regular basis to enrich the experiences of their customers, and we believe we do that better than anybody else. Over time, our reputation in this market and one of the places we've been always strong is in this Type 1 market because that has been where we have had the largest market share advantage for a very long time and we intend to maintain that through the higher quality of our product. And at the end of the day, it matters. The accuracy of DexCom is tried and trude and proven to these patients. I've been to several -- it's kind of diabetes fundraiser season. I've been to a few fundraiser things that I've seen numerous Omnipod and Tandem users, who are now using G7, certainly the Tandem ones and the Omnipods were starting to switch. Their belief in DexCom and our sensors is incredibly heartwarming. And it's very important to see that is a great customer base for us. And we'll continue to serve it the same way we always have. I guess the other thing I'd add, Jereme, we have a 15-day product to launch in 2025 as well, which we believe will a great -- will be a great revenue enhancer for us. Yeah, this is Kevin. I'll take all of those. I don't know that we've necessarily seen a lot. And I mean, we've heard some anecdotal stories, but we haven't seen a massive trend of people diagnosed. But what we have seen is as our reps have gone into primary care offices, with the Stelo message, we then find out they have people with diabetes who actually have coverage for G7 and they can get one that's reimbursed and insured. So that has led to much better and much more positive conversations with our sales force as they go into new offices. We believe that's a trend that actually could play out very well over the course of the year. That's why we designed this app and this experience for those with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes non-insulin rather than a straight health and wellness play. We felt that was the most lucrative market for us to go after first because we could migrate those patients to a reimbursed solution over time, if in fact, they do have diabetes. With respect to our revenues for the year, we projected 1% of revenues and we can extrapolate that to $40 million. Our goal in launching Stelo this year is to learn, whether that's $30 million or $40 million, the most important thing is that we learn what to do. Our learnings have been spectacular. Amazon fulfillment was the first big learning as several people I talked to ordered the first day we put it on the market, got it the next morning. We've never experienced anything like that at DexCom. At the same time, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've had positive feedback on the app, we've had positive feedback on the website. We've also had some things that we've been told we can do better with respect to our customer service model as a lot of these people have never interfaced with a product like this. We will learn as we go to more distribution channels and we get again to a more diverse group of people over and over again. We've got a base right now of over 70,000 users on our product we launched a couple of months ago. That's a huge success for us as far as we're concerned. We've given our guidance for the quarter. We've reaffirmed it. Stelo right now for us is a huge success and we are really looking at things we can do to enhance the experience of those users going forward to make it more sticky and to add more. So far, so good with Stelo we're very pleased. This is Kevin. I'll take that. Jereme, you can add to my comments when I'm done. We've seen such a major shift of our volumes to that pharmacy channel, particularly on the commercial side where many of these pumpers reside that the DME commercial channel is not near as large a segment for us as it used to be. The majority of our DME business certainly is in Medicare and in the government channel. And so if -- as others seek reimbursement and others seek distribution in the pharmacy channel, we're well-positioned to serve that. If we can get -- again as long as we're channel agnostic and our users can get their product where they want to and get it in a manner that's efficacious for them and have a great experience, we will remain channel neutral on that front. Okay. Let me start with the 15-day product. Again, this will be manufactured on our current manufacturing lines and put together the same way the current 10-day product is manufactured. We already manufacture a 15-day product in our Stelo product. So we're not concerned about having capacity to build a 15-day sensor. It's a question of when we turn it on and how much inventory we build in advance and what markets we serve with that product. With respect to Stelo and expansion, a couple of things going on there. Number one, we have a number of scheduled enhancements to the Stelo app over the course of 2025 and even through the course of 2024 to make this a much richer experience for those who use it. So you'll see a steady stream of things come with Stelo. And also again, Jereme and I both have talked about additional distribution channels where that product can be very well-positioned and sold to potential Stelo seller end-users. So you see distribution channel expansion. Remember, our US sales force has only had one sales cycle to talk about stelo end offices yet. They will continue to talk about that in offices and we'll get more and more coverage there with respect to knowledge on the physician's part over the course of 2025. Familiarity will breed growth and we've got to get that message in front of people more than once to get them to go there. With respect to the commercial change, look, we'll miss Teri. She's done a great job here. At the same time, we have a lot of good leaders in this organization. As I said earlier, I've spent quite a bit of time with the Head of Sales and Marketing reported me directly for a while before Teri came. So I'm familiar with this and we have a great team of leadership with the company. We will quickly find a new Chief Commercial Officer to head this group. At the same time, I'm not concerned about the leadership of my US team. They're very, very good and very strong and very experienced in the industry. We will work very hard not to disappoint. We're fine. Yeah. This is Kevin. I'll start. We've opened up a tremendous amount of access across the world over the past several months. I said in my prepared remarks, for example, we just launched DexCom ONE in France in October, where reimbursement is now opened up and we have access to 600,000 more individuals. In Japan, there's access to a million individuals. Both of these markets include Basal insulin as well. We're seeing access wins in several of the EU markets that are more mature on the intensive insulin side particularly with respect to Type 1, opening up access slowly to Basal patients and having this Basal opportunity come forward. Additionally, a lot of these markets don't even access intensive insulin use for Type 2 patients, and access is coming there as well. So access will be a big driver in the markets that we serve more than anything else over 2025. Yeah, this is Kevin. I'll start with that. With respect -- I said earlier, 50% -- at least 50% of our individuals signed up on the subscription model. And reordering has just begun. We're happy with reordering rates right now. So that's going very well. But it's early. We have more to learn there. With respect to retention and with respect to reliability and customer interface, this has been great for us. We have a completely different service model with Stelo with what we call Stelo bought online and we've learned a lot through that. We've learned that there are some things we can do better that we've learned that there are some things that worked very well. We're trying to develop a much more efficient, easy service model for these customers just given the nature of this business and things we can learn and apply to our core business later on. As we hear from these users, we are learning also that a consumer market has different expectations for a glucose sensor than somebody who has intensive insulin therapy. Somebody on intensive insulin therapy knows that physiology comes into effect from time to time and the sensor may turn off it seven days. Just say this doesn't work anymore. But they depend on that sensor for their life. So they, okay, this turned off at seven days. I can deal with that. Well, when you're a consumer and you buy a Stelo and turned off it seven days, hey, I just paid for this. Why is this turning off it seven days? So we are learning how to deal with that patient and that individual, that customer to create the proper experience. That's why I said earlier, the most important thing of the Stelo launch is that we learn that we learn a model that will delight our customers when they use this product. And if they choose to use this product three or four times a year, then let's make sure we create an experience that is delightful three or four times a year. If we do a good job, hopefully, we can keep on the product all the time and have continuous use. It's still early to tell how usage and retention and all that's going to be because we're just a couple of months into the launch now. But we're seeing reorders, we're seeing people sign back up on subscriptions to get more at a rate that it's very, very good with respect to our expectations. I would just like to thank everybody for participating today and we'll talk to you again at the first of the year on when we start providing guidance for 2025 officially. Have a great winter, everybody, and we'll talk again soon."

            "name": "Jereme Sylvain",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial measures presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as the slide deck on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2024, we reported worldwide revenue of $994 million compared to $975 million for the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 2% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. US revenue totaled $702 million for the third quarter compared to $714 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a decline of 2%. This reflected the compounding effect of slower new customer starts from Q2, along with a decline in our revenue per customer due to shifting channel dynamics and higher rebate eligibility compared to a year ago. This eligibility component alone created a year-over-year negative impact of approximately 6 points of growth in the US. With rebate eligibility now near 100%, we expect this impact peaked in Q3 and we'll moderate over the next couple of quarters. In the DME channel, we experienced some incremental share loss during the quarter as we had contemplated in our previous guidance. However, we were encouraged to see these trends stabilize late in the quarter as our team worked quickly to better align with these partners in the field. As Kevin mentioned, the DME channel is a core part of our strategy and we are working collaboratively with our distributors to unlock meaningful growth. International revenue grew 12%, totaling $292 million in the third quarter. International organic revenue growth was 16% for the third quarter. We saw an acceleration in many of our core international markets in Q3 as we expanded availability of G7 and DexCom ONE+ across our footprint. With our leading product portfolio and the growing evidence of health outcomes driven by DexCom CGM, we continue to see significant opportunity to expand reimbursed access to our CGM systems in international markets, particularly in the Type 2 intensive and Type 2 Basal categories. Our third quarter gross profit was $625.9 million or 63% of revenue compared to $64.7 of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we incurred a $24.6 million non-cash charge on inventory related to some build configurations that we determined were not appropriate for commercial launch. We excluded this from our non-GAAP results for the quarter. We've made significant progress in transitioning our installed base to the G7 form factor with new pump integrations and the continued rollout of DexCom ONE+. This has enabled us to further scale our high-volume manufacturing facilities, which positions us well as we work towards our long-term cost targets. Additionally, Kevin noted that we recently filed our 15-day G7 sensor with the FDA for review. This potential clearance will provide us yet another compelling cost lever into 2025 and beyond. Operating expenses were $413.9 million for Q3 2024 compared to $391.5 million in Q3 2023. Operating income was $212 million, or 21.3% of revenue in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $238.9, or 24.5% of revenue in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $300.1 million, or 30.2% of revenue for the third quarter compared to $314.5 million, or 32.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2023. Net income for the third quarter was $179.9 million or $0.45 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. This cash position, along with our growing free cash flow profile, provides us a lot of financial flexibility. We took advantage of this during the third quarter as we quickly executed our previously announced $750 million share repurchase program during the quarter. Turning to guidance. We are maintaining our 2024 guidance in the range of $4.00 billion to $4.05 billion, representing organic growth of 11% to 13% for the year. With the third quarter playing out as expected, our guidance reflects a continued ramp in our US sales force productivity, while we continue to work through some of the channel and rebate dynamics discussed above. Through this ongoing execution, inclusive of record new patient starts in the third quarter and our continued rollout of Stelo, we are building momentum as we enter 2025. For margins, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of non-GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 63%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 29%. With a full quarter now under our belt since resetting our 2024 guidance, we remain on track to achieve the $4.6 billion revenue and corresponding margin targets embedded in our 2025 long-range plan. With that, we can open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Yeah, sure. Thanks, Matt. I can answer those. When we talked last time, we talked about a few things that we expected to play out. One was we saw that we were a little bit behind in terms of the productivity in the sales force, and we were a bit behind where our new patients were. And we said we were going to be about three months behind, and I think you're seeing that play out. And so when you look at the performance this quarter, record new patients in the third quarter, I think you're seeing us perform that way and we expect obviously to do better in the fourth quarter as we get more and more effective over time. Now we said we were about three months behind, and so we won't necessarily be where we initially thought starting the year, but we are in line with the guidance we gave last time we spoke, and we're making progress as we said. In terms of the long-term guide, I think you heard it in my comments. We're on track to hit our long-term guide. We said basically, we are on track to hit our $4.6 billion in the same margin targets we gave based on what we're seeing in the business today, which is obviously record patients this quarter, stability in the DME channel some of the productivity, of course, in the sales force. Certainly outside the US, you saw our international results accelerate a little bit and we have more opportunities opening up over the course of this year and into next year. We feel good about where we're going and we haven't even really talked about Stelo. Stelo is going to be a real interesting opportunity for us going forward. We've got a couple of months under our belt. Great progress to date. And looking forward to sharing more and more as time moves on with Stelo. Yeah, obviously, Joanne, you know this one really, really well as we start to go into some of these contracts where it's a monthly fee, that's going to be a big opportunity for us. As of right now, we talk about our long-range plan guide in 2025 and at 65%, and that's where we are. That all being said, we know this is an interesting lever. And so we'll give you more clarity as we start to roll out commercial plans on when we expect those levers to be in the business, but nothing more exciting, as you could imagine, at least in my world of having this opportunity to lever through the business and we're really excited about it as well. So I think the thing we talk about as investors is gross margin, but there's also customers who are really looking forward to the longer extended wear period. And that's another great thing that we're going to offer through this product. A lot of good things coming here really soon. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I'll give you some of the commentary. So certainly, it assumes a stable market moving into 2025, so stable adoption, stable penetration trends moving from '24 into '25. It also assumes stable, not necessarily winning share back, but stable trends to the DME share and then certainly us continuing to do well in the retail channel, which we've seen over the past quarter, and we expect to see for the rest of the year. It does include Stelo. And we've considered a bunch of different ranges and opportunities. You can probably imagine, given we're only a couple of months into launch, there's multiple different opportunities and ranges. Kevin alluded to two different channels we're launching right now across both DME and Bulk. And you can imagine there's a few more channels we'll be launching here over the coming months, which we're all really excited about and going into a holiday season. This will be a first ever US OTC holiday season with the Stelo out there. So there's a lot of things we're going to learn over the course of the coming weeks before we give it. We've taken in contemplation all of those range stability in terms of what those numbers are and felt good about the $4.6 billion number. And so it includes all of that. And so, hopefully, that answers the question, of course, we'll give you some more clarity by quarter as we get into the end of the year. But you can probably imagine just given comps what you can do the math on what comps would look like. And we obviously have a little bit more challenging comps in the first half, a little bit easier comps in the back half, certainly, as we're talking about Q3, but nothing funky there, just naturally lapping comps. The rebate question, you got -- you're 100% correct, 100% rebate is assumed and so you won't necessarily have that headwind. Yeah, it's less than that. And so I think that number was going up as we moved into Q4 of last year. We don't have an exact number to give in that guide. Obviously, we generally don't guide specific items like that, but it won't be 6 points. It obviously peaked into Q3. It's going to be less in Q4. And so, I think you can safely assume that. Again, haven't given a specific number yet, but again, if the models are -- you'd expect that the ASPs will be pretty consistent moving in from Q3 to Q4 because we do have them at 100% rebate rate. Yeah. Sure. And, look, I think and appreciate the comments. Certainly, Stelo -- and we've always assumed that in our modeling is you're not necessarily going to have the same retention utilization in Stelo. But Stelo is a brand new category for us. So you got to remember the comps relative to next year to this year are certainly different. As you step back and you think about a record new patient quarter this quarter, and obviously, as our sales force continues to get more and more productive, you're going to expect to add more patients next year. So when you think about it in terms of just net absolute dollars, when you say, well, gee, there are new patients added -- record new patients in our core insulin business, as that rolls forward and more access opens up, you're going to have more opportunity there. And so, I would expect that as we moved into 2025. On top of that, you're going to have a new product launch in Stelo in the US that can also contribute as well. So when you think about both of those, you're not wrong in the sense that Stelo utilization and retention should be lower, but it's going to be against the backdrop of really no revenue in the first half of the year and only partial revenue here in the third quarter of the year. So hopefully, that gives you some context towards it -- in terms of growth of the overall business. And that's why we -- as we've gone through it, we felt good about reiterating that LRP. Yeah, so it's a record for any quarter, Jason. We generally don't break out US, OUS, but it's a record for any quarter, not 3Q, but any quarter. In terms of attrition, we haven't seen many changes in attrition by category. So we've generally talked about the bands where you have insulin-intensive users have traditionally stayed in a band, you have the basal user that traditionally stays relatively close and they're kind of clustered in there into that same band. And then we all know that the non-insulin user tends to be in a band of its own. Those continue to remain very similar categorically. Yeah. And just as a reminder, the Medicare fee-for-service channel, i.e. the non-Medicare Advantage channel is reimbursed via Part B, i.e, DME. And so it won't necessarily shift to the pharmacy anytime soon. So there's a certain limitation on what you could expect even within the DME channels because of the reimbursement schemes as they exist today. So hopefully, that's helpful at least in thinking about the persistence of any sort of change there. Yeah. So I'll start with the second one. We expect the durability to 15-day to be solid. And when I say solid, obviously, any additional days you wear a sensor, you always run into more risk and chance. But we got it to a point where we believe the survivability is going to be very well-received by the community. And so that's the work -- that's the expectation as it launches. In terms of the product itself, the standard cost really doesn't change at all. Certainly, we will be mindful of some of the changes we're making across the board in terms of just adhesives and things that you're already seeing starting to play through our product, but the standard cost doesn't change. To the extent that we add a little bit there for warranty here and there just because what can go wrong over five more days, whether it knocks off an arm or you just sweat it out. We'll always be mindful of those types of things, but the standard cost shouldn't change too much. So there's real opportunity here for us. Yeah. We had heard about some of the disruptions here and there. And at the end of the day, everybody goes through these types of things. What we ultimately expect at the end of the day is, you have to write a script. When you write a script, it has to be branded. And when you write that script, you ultimately go fulfill it. And so we didn't necessarily expect it. We didn't see anything necessarily change. Or what we really saw was our sales force getting out there and getting more interest in DexCom. Obviously, folks go through these challenges and they come and they go, I don't know that it changed all that much. I don't know that changed our trajectory. I think what you really saw was and we're seeing it in our metrics is our sales force has done a really nice job bringing in new physicians and really getting the message in front of them in conjunction with both our G7 as well as Stelo. That's what you saw. Sure. Yeah, we can answer that. And what the record new patient starts exclude Stelo. So I think it's helpful to know that when Kevin alluded to 70,000 folks using Stelo, that's not in the numbers we're quoting around record new patients. And I think what -- so I think what you're seeing now is you're continuing to see a pretty robust adoption really in all categories. Your intensive insulin continues to lead the way across T1 and T2 intensive insulin. And we expected that coming into the year, but basal continues to also be relatively strong. And what you're seeing more and more of as we deeper dive into these physicians where a lot of basal patients are seen. That's where a lot of our work was taking place over the course of the third quarter in terms of getting back to productivity, and you're starting to see more and more of that. So it's really broad-based across the insulin-using population. You are seeing a lot of nice uptake in the non-insulin and health and wellness population in Stelo, but that's not included in our record new patient number. Yeah. So I think in terms of the LRP, as you're thinking about the splits, the splits are roughly that. I mean, there's a lot that goes on in terms of what those numbers are, including now the new Stelo product. And so, we'll -- what I would say is, as you're thinking about growth rates, I'd expect the international business to continue to grow based on the trajectory you're seeing today and the additional wins to continue to do well, and obviously, the US to do well as well as we stabilize our core markets and obviously, Stelo jumps in. So in the general 70% to 30% ballpark, I wouldn't draw necessarily 0.0 lines and get overly stuck up on that. But in general, that's the splits we expect. In terms of how you're thinking about Stelo, it's lasting. How long it last? What we are seeing is quite a few sensors, most sensors lasting the 15 days. We're seeing the performance in the field mirror that of which we've seen obviously in our submissions. It's interesting as more and more people learn how to use the product and it becomes more and more familiar, you see those numbers go up. So you might have seen in the first couple of days, folks unsure of how to use the product, maybe apply it inappropriately, apply it to the wrong place. And we ultimately had to make sure we navigated through some of that education. But we're looking at sensor life and we're seeing sensor life lasting out to those 15 days, and seeing so at a pretty common clip. So we're very excited about that. Obviously, with the G7 15-day, we got to a survival rate we felt good with. And so you could imagine as we're submitting that, it's a number that we feel good with, just like we feel good with the Stelo number. We'll wait to give more data on that as that data becomes available through our submission and hopefully approval here in the near future. You guys will see it. But we are comfortable with what we had in terms of survivability in that submission."

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.\nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Before we begin discussing Q2 results, let me state that overall category demand remains strong, and awareness of the value of CGM across the metabolic health spectrum continues to accelerate. This trend was evident at the recent American Diabetes Association Conference, which featured Dexcom's largest evidence to- date in the non-insulin type 2 space. Dexcom research demonstrated significant A1C reduction in multiple studies, as well as real-world evidence showing a time and range increase of greater than four hours per day for nearly 4,000 customers using Dexcom CGM at one year. We are leveraging several pathways of evidence generation to ensure that we are maximizing our market opportunity into the future, as our CGM systems become increasingly tailored to the unique needs of each customer. Despite the positive progress on these fronts, we saw three near-term trends emerge over the course of the second quarter that drove results below our expectations. First, as we have worked through our U.S. salesforce realignment expansion, we have seen our share of new customers fall short of our expectations, despite still strong absolute customer additions. Second, our U.S. revenue per customer has stepped down faster than expected based on two primary drivers, rebate eligibility and channel mix. With G7 coverage emerging faster than expected, we realized greater rebate eligibility relative to initial expectations and compared to 2023 levels. While we believe this enhanced G7 coverage has helped facilitate new customer starts as mentioned above, the pace of these starts did not allow us to offset the temporary impact from this rebate eligibility. We expect the impact of this rebate eligibility dynamic will reach its peak in the third quarter, and Jereme will provide specific color on the Q3 expectations shortly. Beyond the transitory G7 eligibility dynamic, we also saw revenue per customer impacted by U.S. channel mix dynamics. U.S. customer growth has remained strong in our pharmacy business as we expand our reach into primary care and type 2 diabetes more broadly. However, our growth in the DME channel has trailed our plan. The DME distributors remain important partners for us in our business, and we've not executed well this quarter against these partnerships. We need to refocus on those relationships. Finally, our international performance was also lighter than expectations in the quarter. While we delivered strong performance in some of our core markets, such as the U.K. and France, we saw category growth soften in certain geographies as type 1 penetration advances in these regions. We continue to see a significant runway ahead across our international footprint, particularly as we drive greater access for people with type 2 diabetes. To account for these trends and appropriately reflect our base assumption, we've lowered our full-year revenue guidance to 11% to 13% organic growth. We have higher expectations for our business than what we experienced this quarter. We believe we have an incredible product, an incredible future pipeline, and an unparalleled market opportunity. We also have a great team capable of leading this market. But I expect more from myself and more from my team going forward. So, what are we doing to enhance our competitive position and reestablish momentum? It starts with our product portfolio, which we continue to strengthen to put our field sales team in a great position with clinicians. In the second quarter, we expanded our direct-to-Apple Watch connectivity with G7, launching in the U.S. and several additional international markets with this feature that has been among our most requested for several years. We expanded the international launch of the Dexcom ONE+ system, now reaching 18 international markets with our smaller G7 form factor for our Dexcom ONE users. We've built upon the performance of G7, making it even better. This includes a continuation of our monthly cadence of software updates, which included the second-quarter additions of medication logging and the ability to ingest activity data into our G7 app. We've introduced a stronger adhesive to support our customers into the summer months, and we expanded the G7 Bluetooth connectivity range by more than 65%. We advanced Dexcom CGM leadership in the ID space with the launches of G7 integrations with Tandem's Mobi system and Insulet's Omnipod 5. We've strengthened our existing products while preparing for the most expansive product launch in our company's history with the upcoming August launch of Stelo. We are seeing the demand for CGM build in the non-insulin space and consumer use and believe that we've created a unique and engaging system to drive people to better metabolic health outcomes. Our team has worked hard to build a scalable service model for Stelo that will be great for our customers, including the e-commerce experience, seamless delivery through Amazon fulfillment, insightful product features, digital support options, and much more to come. We'll offer both single purchase opportunities as well as discounted subscriptions that bring the monthly cost below $100. Stelo will be a full launch on stelo.com, and we continue to expect approximately 1% of revenue contribution in 2024. We are committed to personalized approaches to metabolic health management through updates like these. This is what will enable us to capture greater share and maintain high rates of retention and utilization across our customer base. We feel that our expanded U.S. sales force positions us very well to reignite our growth opportunity now and well into the future. We have the ability to dive deep into the technological leadership that Dexcom provides for diabetes specialty practices. We have also expanded our reach and ability to highlight the simplicity of our platform and how it fits into a busy primary care practice. We have the advantage of better coverage and the lowest out-of-pocket cost for the insulin population, and soon to be enhanced by the simplicity of the Stelo OTC platform. As we take significant steps to broaden our addressable market well into the future with Stelo and our expanded U.S. sales force, we are also working hard to ensure simplified access to our systems in the markets we serve. In the second quarter, our team worked with the CDC to create new ICD-10 diagnostic codes for problematic hypoglycemia. These codes, which were published in May and go into effect in October, can simplify the process of documenting hypoglycemic events that qualify non-insulin users for CGM coverage. Our international market expansion efforts also progressed into the second quarter as we received coverage in France for people with Type 2 diabetes on basal insulin and began serving these customers in June. We also transitioned to direct sales in Japan at the outset of the quarter and look forward to taking control of our commercial efforts in that crucial market. To summarize, our second quarter performance and 2024 outlook are not up to our standards, and we look forward to better capitalizing on our opportunity as we move forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Jereme\nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as the slide deck on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2024, we reported worldwide revenue of $1.004 billion, compared to $871.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, representing growth of 15% on a reported basis and 16% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $732 million for the second quarter, compared to $617 million in the second quarter of 2023, representing growth of 19%. As Kevin mentioned, we experienced lower than expected new customer starts in conjunction with our sales force expansion and realignment, particularly in the DME channel, as well as near-term impact from pharmacy eligibility changes, which lowered our revenue per customer relative to our expectation. Together, these dynamics adversely impacted our revenue this quarter by approximately $40 million as compared to our internal estimate. Based on the compounding effect of these lower second quarter new customer starts, we also expect our growth rates in the back half of the year to be impacted. To offset this, our team is working aggressively to improve our execution and deliver the higher market share levels that we believe our product deserves. International revenue grew 7%, totaling $272 million in the second quarter. International organic revenue growth was 10% for the second quarter. While we anticipated our international growth to slow this quarter as we lapped our very strong performance from Q2 2023, our results came in lighter than expected. Our miss on new customers impacted us by approximately $10 million on the quarter. Our international performance can often ebb and flow based on coverage decision and distributor purchases, but as Kevin mentioned, there remains a long runway ahead for Dexcom CGM globally. We continue to invest in infrastructure to expand our geographical presence, provide compelling evidence to expand market access in new segments of key markets, and leverage our product portfolio to meet the unique needs of various customers and health systems. Our second quarter gross profit was $638.1 million, or 63.5% of revenue, which was in line with the 63.5% of revenue we delivered in the second quarter of 2023. We continue to see further migration of our customer base from G6 to G7 in the second quarter as we finalize new pump integrations and transition Dexcom ONE to the G7 form factor. Between this ongoing customer transition and continued ramp up of our high-volume manufacturing facilities in Mesa and Malaysia, we are making steady progress towards our long-term cost targets. Operating expenses were $442.7 million for Q2 of 2024, compared to $395.1 million in Q2 of 2023. Operating income was $195.4 million, or 19.5% of revenue, in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $158.4 million, or 18.2% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $283.9 million, or 28.3% of revenue, for the second quarter, compared to $232.6 million, or 26.7% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2023. Net income for the second quarter was $174.3 million, or $0.43 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with greater than $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. And based on our strong cash position, consistent free cash flow generation, and ongoing growth opportunities, we are announcing an authorization for a share repurchase program of up to $750 million. Turning to guidance. Starting with full year 2024, we are decreasing our revenue guidance to a range of $4.00 billion to $4.05 billion, representing organic growth of 11% to 13% for the year. As mentioned earlier, the compounding effect of our slower-than-expected new customer growth in the U.S. DME channel and international business, as well as increased pharmacy eligibility, resulted in the need to recalibrate the guide. Our updated guidance reflects these dynamics and assumes a longer ramp in productivity in our U.S. sales force. For margins, we are reducing our non-GAAP gross profit margin guidance to approximately 63%, while maintaining our prior guidance on non-GAAP operating margin and adjusted EBITDA at approximately 20% and 29%, respectively. In addition to our annual guidance, we are providing two additional data points to help investors and analysts understand some of the unique elements impacting our revised guidance in 2024. First, the impact to new patients from our sales force initiative, combined with our revenue per customer trends that Kevin detailed, will change the historical seasonality pattern that we have typically experienced. These impacts are expected to reach their peak in the third quarter, with total revenue expected to be between $975 million and $1 billion. In conjunction with this revenue outlook, we thought it would be helpful to provide a mid-year update on our global active customer base, which we now estimate to be between $2.5 million and $2.6 million. This represents strong growth over where we finished 2023, though the growth percentage has decelerated slightly. Our hope is these updates will provide additional visibility as our team works to implement several of the areas of focus that we have aligned on over the past month, and as our sales force continues to ramp their efficiency. With that, we can open up the call for Q&A. Sean?\nSean Christensen: Thank you, Jereme. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then re-enter the queue if necessary. Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan is on the line with a question. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Thanks. I have a lot more than one, but I'll keep it to one. Guidance moving down about $400 million, so I appreciate a few million here or there, but, I mean, this is such a step change in the business and the outlook and the trends. You know, medtech companies split sales forces all the time and grow them. You've done it multiple times. I'm just kind of in shock at how big of a disruption and a downward guide it is on a sales force expansion. I feel like there has to be more going on. Maybe you could give us more color into, are basal patients using it less? Are you seeing GLP-1 fears pop up and Type 2 patients not starting on therapy as much? Are you seeing, Abbott and Medtronic take a lot more share? I feel like there's just, we need more explanation for the third and fourth quarter guidance cut behind it. Thanks a lot.\nKevin Sayer: Thanks, Robbie. I appreciate the question and understand your position. Let me start with, let's go back to the numbers and the things we talked about in our script. We're short a large number of new patients as to where we thought we would be at this point in time, and Jeremy can provide you with the numbers as to what the new patient constitutes. There is a combination of things as far as the new patient shortage. Obviously, disruption on the sales force expansion side. This was a different expansion for us than other ones. In other ones we've done, we literally took territories and just divided them geographically. In this time, we changed roles. We changed positions people called on. It was a much more disruptive expansion we've had in the past, and that did lead to a lot of disruption, particularly at the beginning of the quarter. We saw things getting better towards the end. With respect to the other factors, as far as market share, we said we've lost market share in the DME channel. While we've done well in the pharmacy channel, as you can all see by scripts and scripts that are filled in the pharmacy on the DME side, we've lost share, and that has hurt us. And, again, that is patients, it's including new patients, but it's also, as we're losing in that category, we're also losing the customers who have the highest annual revenue per year as a patient. So you're losing those. And then some of those patients, even though we've lost share in the DME channel, have shifted the pharmacy, but that is at a lower revenue per year number. The last piece of this is rebate eligibility. And again, we expected G7 to have rebate eligibility over schedule that was literally twice as fast as G6. It's been 3x faster. G7 got the full rebate very quickly, quicker than we had planned. So all those things added together, while they had somewhat of an effect on Q2, they have a longer range effect on the rest of the year. So we added all those things together, and that's how we came up with our guide. I'll let Jereme come up with more, if you want to add to that.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So to give some context to the numbers, you're right, Robbie. At the top end of guidance, about a $300 million decline. In Kevin's prepared remarks, we talked about $50 million really impacting the second quarter. Those end up playing out to be a little bit larger as you expand those over the course of the year. So to give you some context, the new patient missing Q2, which we expected to drag out into Q3 as we kind of navigate through those changes, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. We had some new patient misses there. That's about $125 million on the year of that impact. The channel mix and really the loss of share in DME, that's a big one for us, and that's about $100 million over the course of the year. Certainly impacted Q2, but we expect it to impact the rest of the year as well, as those essentially work into full quarters. And then the rebate eligibility happened, again, quicker than we would have expected. Again, eventually you get there. It happened quicker than we expected. That's about $75 million. So we have those up. That's about the $300 million that you see. Certainly not something we're happy about, but in full transparency, we needed to make sure what we saw as we closed out the second quarter, we're transparent about what the impact is for the balance of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. That was a super helpful review of the issues. Maybe, Kevin, if you could go through kind of what you're doing to address each of those issues, when you think they'll be resolved. It's not clear to me, for example, losing share in the DME channel, why that's happening and how you reverse that. Just lastly, you have an LRP out there for '25. Is that still valid? Thanks for taking the question.\nKevin Sayer: Yes. Let me start with the LRP for '25. Yes, we believe our LRP for '25 is valid, but our revenue will probably come in closer to the lower end of the range rather than the upper end of the range, as we sit here today. But we've achieved incredible progress on the P&L side, our burning margin and EBITDA side, our gross profit side on that LRP. So from a P&L perspective, we're definitely hitting all our goals on the LRP side. As far as fixing all these things and what fixes we have in place, obviously, it's going to be a bit of a process. On the rebate eligibility front, we believe that caps out in Q3, and we plan for this to cap out in Q4. It just happened a couple quarters earlier than we'd planned. So that is very much a temporary thing and accelerated. With respect to DME market share, one of the factors that has actually happened that created part of this is several of the Medicare Advantage programs went to pharmacy reimbursement. So patients who were being served by the DME channel shifted to the pharmacy, and that is a piece of our lost DME share. I can't quantify exactly how much, but that's some of it. Adding to that, we need to refocus on those relationships. We need to do better, and we will talk with them. We have some plans and some things in place to start off there. But it's early. We have to implement them. And again, DME data is really the last piece of the puzzle as far as our revenues. As far as where we get by the end of the year, just given the data sources that we all look at, it's not as simple as the scripts on the pharmacy side. So we're addressing that. We will put more emphasis and time there. We'll send more customers through that channel and do better by those guys. So we'll keep looking. On the international front, another piece to remember, we've got a few things going on there. Timing of some of the tenders affects the numbers. There are some tenders that kick in July 1st that will help on the international growth, and that will be helpful there. We're also looking for Type 2 expansion, as I said on the call. We just got basal coverage in France. That's kicking in. We know some of the other countries are moving towards basal coverage very quickly, and we can play there with our Dexcom ONE+ product. Dexcom ONE+ is still early in the game, and we're seeing that begin to pick up. So there are a number of levers to pull and a number of things we're working on, Larry. I can't quantify each one of them, but suffice to say we're not just sitting here. All right, Jeremy, you want to add to that?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. And then maybe below the hood a little bit in terms of how we allocate the investment dollars, Larry. We are reprioritizing and reallocating investments to where we know that it ultimately drives the most bang. So the team is working on that diligently in terms of refocusing where those dollars and those efforts go. So not given the specifics, just given the competitive nature of it, but rest assured there are changes being made underlying the business to ensure that we get back on top of our new patients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Kevin, maybe following up on your DME comments, you say you need to maybe work on some relationships there. Any color you can give there, and not to air dirty laundry, but I guess in one of our DME checks here recently, we kind of won off the conversation, but it heard that, maybe some of the comments you made about CMS changes and who would bear the brunt of any kind of reimbursement change in 2026 or 2027 would maybe be borne more by DME than you guys. Is it things like that that kind of strain some relationships? What else might have strained relationships? And have there been any kind of formulary changes or anything in DME where they have just wholeheartedly moved patients to Abbott, and it's going to be harder for you to get those patients back going forward? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: I don't think it's been anything formulary or systematic along those lines. I think I need to take... I'll let Jereme take some more details, but let me move you guys back a little bit in time. When we started this journey down pharmacy coverage, we had as a company zero relationships in the pharmacy channel. We worked very hard to develop those relationships because, as you can all see by our numbers and our largest competitors' numbers, that is where a large portion of the business has moved at this point in time. We put a tremendous amount of effort there because we'd never been there before. We didn't have any infrastructure. We didn't have other products there. We didn't have relationships there. I think in creating and building those relationships, we ignored other relationships that were very important to us more than we should have. And so we need to balance that a little better and make sure that our customers get their product through a source that's easy, efficient, and economical for them. We felt, to a large extent, we were doing that, but we think we need to do more. Jeremy, you want to take some more on that?\nJereme Sylvain: No, that's it. And, Jeff, to your comment on if there's any CMS changes in terms of reimbursement down there, we certainly did not say that. I think that was maybe a competitor that said that. What we had said was we're partners, and so if there's any changes in CMS reimbursement as partners, we would look at it as partners. And that would be our expectation going forward. So that was not how we positioned it. But nevertheless, to the extent that those have caused frayed relationships, as Kevin alluded to, we would pay more attention to it irrespective.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMargaret Andrew: I guess I just wanted to follow up and be clear on the dynamics on the guidance increase. The way you describe it maybe wasn't super clear, at least for me. Are you assuming and continuing to assume lower new patient ads for the rest of the year? Or was that kind of new patient missing Q2 alone driving $125 million of decrease for the year? And then, continuing on that thread, are you seeing any change in some of those new patient ad dynamics or rep productivity on a month-by-month basis that would maybe give you that confidence in recovery? If that is what you're assuming. Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, it's a good question. Let me start on that. So, Margaret, the answer is we do expect to see disruption continue into the third quarter. And that's one of the reasons why you're seeing the impact. It's really a bit of a cumulative impact. Obviously, Q2 was a big impact. You know, we've sized it in terms of patients. It was a pretty sizable disruption relative to expectation. It was around 70,000 patients. So it was a pretty big number. Obviously, that rolls through to the rest of the year. But we do expect it to take a little bit of time to recover that. And so there will be there. We have lowered new patient expectations into Q3. And then into Q4, our expectation is we start to get back to where we were. But think about it as a quarter delay, effectively, as a result of some of this disruption on our longer-term plans. And so when you run those numbers, plus you run some expected numbers here in Q3 in disruption relative to expectation, that's ultimately how you get to the figures. In terms of improvement over the course of time, ultimately, you do expect to see that. And we've seen some of that over time. Now, we always expected perhaps a little bit of disruption and some recovery. I would say the disruption is bigger than we would have anticipated. And the recovery is there. But when the disruption is bigger than anticipated, even as you have some of that recovery, again, you're a quarter behind where you'd expect to be. And I expect that to play out as we come next year. So we revised that. We've included that in the guidance. High-level, Kevin, I don't know if you have anything to add.\nKevin Sayer: No, I think that's good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: I guess maybe could you just kind of explain what is the rebate eligibility, what it is, what it means, kind of why it's temporary, why it happened? I think a lot of confusion on that aspect. And I don't know if something happened kind of late in the quarter. It was like you guys, I think, were comfortable with the consensus in June. So I just wanted to ask, does this all kind of come up late in the quarter?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, I can take that. So, when you think about rebate eligibility, over time, you kind of get closer and closer to this 100% eligibility. And it takes a little bit of time. So plans, as they opt into coverage, opt in. So we saw this take place over G6, to a lesser extent G5. We weren't really in the pharmacy then. We saw it take place over the course of G6. And when we launched G7, we assumed it happened about twice as fast as G6. So the assumption is, is more and more folks get access. Therefore, more and more folks are moving through that program. Therefore, you're subject to more and more rebates. And then the offset, of course, is by having more access, you have more volumes. As you can tell by our new patient numbers, we didn't have the volumes, but also the existing patient base was also subject to rebates. And so effectively, it's timing of price as you run through this. It's temporal, meaning you can only rebate up to your entire population, and eventually it gets there. But that's why it's a timing thing. And it just happened, like Kevin was alluding to, three times as fast as G6, not two times as fast as G6. So that's the big piece there. In terms of the understanding of how the quarter was rolling up, you are correct. It did roll up later into the second quarter. You can see our results in the second quarter, while not up to expectations, did not impact the quarter as much as it impacted the full year. And obviously, that was driven by what you saw, the dynamics that played through, really, the second quarter. Kevin was alluding to DME, where there's a big change in, let's say, his share, and where we certainly missed. And that data comes in a little delayed. That was about a four- to six-week delay before we said. So as we've tallied that data, as we're moving into, really, the close of the quarter and into the weeks leading into the call, not only did it make us aware of, certainly, the impact on the quarter, but it was really important for us then to reflect that in the guidance on the year. And so a lot of that data, you're right. It obviously took place over the course of the quarter. We became aware of it, really, as we closed out the quarter. But that's why it's really important to get it in front of it for the guidance for the full year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMatt Taylor: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess I wanted to ask if you could give us a little more color, at least qualitatively, on when you expect these issues to begin to heal, to rebound. I don't know if you want to address them separately or together. You've given the back-up guidance. But conceptually, what kind of impact is this going to have on the first half of 2025, when you're comping more normal periods? And when do you think you're going to see the sales force really find its footing, the rebates kind of flush through? Maybe you could flush that out a little bit more to help us model the future.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, I'll start. And again, Jereme, you can add more color. With respect to the rebates, this really caps in Q3. We'd estimated in our own models that we would have full rebate eligibility by the fourth quarter of this year. It just happened, again, a couple of quarters faster than we had planned. With respect to our field sales team and the disruption there, we believe we'll work through that in Q3 and early Q4. And by the time we start 2025, this group should be clicking on all cylinders. And things should go very well there. Another thing that Jereme talked about is reallocation and really examining where we're going to spend the dollars that we spend and the investments we're going to make to maximize the commercial effect of those. Those programs and those decisions are being made now. We'll roll into Q3 and into Q4. And we believe it'll set us up nicely for 2025. We're obviously not given 2025 guidance today. But we feel by the end of the year, the things that we've talked about today, we should have worked through, and we should have a very good idea as to where we're going in the future.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. And Kevin alluded to it earlier. We talked about, the question was, is how do you feel about the 2025 LRP and is it still valid? And again, we said, look, we feel it's still valid, albeit at the lower end of it, Matt. So I think that gives you some context. Obviously this year is going to be impacted by these factors. As we work out of those and we work into them next year, Kevin alluded to it, rebates shouldn't be an impact next year. So as we work out of it, as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll give 2025 guidance. But that hopefully gives you some context to our confidence as we move out of this year into next year and getting these things behind us. It shouldn't go unnoticed. Obviously, we're bullish on the business longer term, clearly not happy with the quarter and certainly not happy with the revised guide. So don't mistake it for that. But we do our bullish on the business longer term, hence the $750 million share repurchase authorization. So hopefully that helps square up how we're at least thinking about 2025.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy of UBS. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Just a question on this pharmacy component. And one of the sort of long-term risks here has always been that this becomes a more commoditized market. You look at finger sticks and blood glucose meters, and they're commoditized at this point. And when we hear things like rebates and pressure in the pharmacy, I just want to make sure I understand, is this a competitive dynamic in the pharmacy as well? What's going on there? And why is Q3 the peak? Where's the bottom, I guess, from a pharmacy rebate perspective as you do broaden coverage? Because if this is going to be standard of care, which I still think it is, does that mean at what price? And how should we be thinking about this over the long-term? Sorry if that didn't make a ton of sense.\nKevin Sayer: No, it made perfect sense to me. With respect to our overall pricing, our pricing within channels, when you look at the prices, remains relatively consistent. What has happened in this quarter and what has happened now is more and more people have become eligible for rebates, hence bringing our value per customer down. This was the price that we assumed we would be targeting at the end of the fourth quarter, and we'd be rolling into '25 with. In other periods, we haven't had anything as severe as we have today, obviously, but our new patient growth number would be so high and our volumes would be so high. If something like this happened, we grew through it. And so if a plan like this accelerated, our new patient numbers are so big, Danielle, that we managed through it. In this quarter, you combine the two of them, the increase in the rebates, which gets, again, to a net price very near what we'd expected and modeled. That doesn't mean the bottom of the price is falling out on an overall basis in the channel. It just means more people were subject to rebates than we had before, and we shifted patients from a more profitable DME channel over to that pharmacy. Through some, again, as I talked earlier, the three largest Medicare Advantage plans adopted pharmacy coverage this year. A lot of the Medicaid plans have gone to pharmacy coverage as well. So those plans moving there, necessitated a bit of that move and a bit of those rebates going up. So no, we don't believe we have a price falling out. We believe what we do continues to provide tremendous value to people and does a lot to improve health, save their lives, and all the things we've talked about forever. So this is still a very valuable component in somebody's health, and we'll continue to treat it as such.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wench with Citibank. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: I'm going to pivot a little bit to Stelo. It was 1% of your '24 revenue at one level, and it's still 1% of your '24 revenue, which has been lowered by a couple hundred million. Does this indicate a change in your expectations for the year or anything that we should read into it? I'm just sort of a little curious about that and anything else that you can share as you think about that as building revenue. Thanks.\nJereme Sylvain: No, it's an integer, and so the whole point there is yes, while the top has come down, 1%, 43 versus 40, at the end of the day, it was all that kind of general contribution. So there was nothing insinuated by that, Joanne. It was just rounded to that integer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Brien: And it is one question, but it's long enough, and I'll tie it all together. I promise. Just clearly, Kevin, your comment about next year's LRP, do you mean the 15% growth, or do you mean 4.6 billion at the low end? Because if it's 4.6 off of 4.57, that's 12% growth. And then within there, the low end of the range, 15% off of even a 12% number this year is an easier comp, so there is a deceleration still factored in there. So what has changed to get us from that kind of 17.5% growth we expect from you guys, typical growth rate guidance, to now this more like 15% or even lower? What's the difference there that we can really anchor onto? Because that's, I think, the biggest challenge for the stock as we think about how it will trade tomorrow. Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Sure. Maybe I can start with maybe the next year question. I don't think we've necessarily guided to a number. What we really tried to do is say, here's our LRP. It's still in play. And when I say to the lower end, it's not necessarily the low end or a point estimate within there. It's really to give some context to, as we've already made plans and are looking at next year, we have some, there's confidence in meeting that low end number. And so really, that's really what the goal here is, rather than to set a guide number. Now, your question then coming back to, which is this year's growth, which the organic growth number, obviously 11% to 13% is lower than we've historically seen. Kevin's alluded to it a little bit in the script. This year, a little bit of what I would say is execution, where I think we need to execute better on new patients and execute better in various channels. And so that's something as a team, we have to get our arms around. This year was impacted by a quicker, as we mentioned, a quicker rebate dynamic than we expected. And that's a part of it. Obviously, we lapped that next year. And you can only rebate 100% of your units. So obviously, it stops at some point. And so that piece of it will be transitory. But I think the big key then is getting back to execution and execution on new patients and executing in the DME channel and making sure we have good partnerships there and executing on our channel mix. So that's really the work we have to do. And back to that point, that's one of the reasons we had a little bit of a lapse here. And to the extent that we can get back to it, that allows us to get back to what we hope is what our traditional performance has been.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG. Your line is open.\nSam Eiber: Hey, good afternoon. This is Sam on for Marie. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe I can ask on the DME channel. I recall when you guys were making that shift a few years ago, that volume mix would peak around 20%. I guess is the right way to think about it, closer to 15% now. And then as we think about more M.A. plans shifting to pharmacy, I mean, is there any risk that that could go even lower? Thanks for taking the questions.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. We'd always kind of got, at least in the commercial channels, and we talked, this is really more about the commercial channels. We had always assumed it'd be about 75-25. That was kind of our crystal ball. And as we got there, it started to skew a little bit more. But it didn't drift off of that 75-25 all that much. However, this quarter, as we started to see really what I would say is loss of share, which for us in that channel is a bit unique and something we got to get our arms around. The split in our business was a little more. It doesn't necessarily mean that the overall market split ultimately ends up that way. But it does mean that the shift of our business certainly shifted that way. And so does that number shift down to 85-15? Well, if we take share, no. And that's really on us. So that gets back to the execution question. We need to execute in that channel. And that channel, it's a very important channel for us. And these are very important partners. And they serve a very, very important partnership to our customers. And so we've got to get back into that channel and make sure that we're getting our fair share there. That's really the big driver.\nKevin Sayer: I'd also add, though, there has been a shift in government payer activity from the DME channel to the pharmacy. That actually has happened. And we have to figure out how much that has impacted, our DME mix versus pharmacy mix as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMathew Blackman: Jeremy, I think I heard you mention that the new patient shortfall was something in the neighborhood of 70,000. Is there any way to tease that out? I'm sure it's challenging by indication. I mean, the DME share, while it sounds like it may be skewed more to basal patients, potentially, is that fair? And then what about on the sales force dislocation? Just any help on sort of the different pieces of the business?\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So the 70,000, the way I think about it is there's a good chunk of that that is OUS. And so there's a portion that's outside the United States. There's a portion that's inside the United States. And it's usually reflective of our patient base in total. So you kind of have our split there. In the US, really, a lot of it is driven by the Salesforce. Now, one of the challenges, of course, is the Salesforce services all different indications. And so as you service all in different indications, you could probably imagine if we're not doing well in the DME, it gets back to your point. We're not doing wonderful in the basal space. That's a big piece of the DME, certainly DME Medicare and the patient base that they service. So that's the way, it's really hard to parse out by category. But when we look into it and we say, gee, we're not doing, we're not taking share in the DME space, you can presume that a lot of that is in that Medicare space. And I think it is fair to say that really across the board disruption, you can assume there's a little bit really across the board, but the biggest piece there by the best way to put it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nJason Bedford: Just two quick ones. Appreciate the color on the installed base, but can we assume there's been no real notable change in attrition? And then just on the 3Q guidance, is there not a healthy contribution from Stelo in 3Q or is the 40 million more fourth quarter weighted?\nKevin Sayer: Yes. This is Kevin. The Stelo guidance, the Q3 contribution is not overly large. Most of the Stelo revenue is fourth quarter weighted as we, again, plan to launch Stelo in later August. So that's how that one works. With respect to attrition, our retention and attrition by patient category remains similar to what we had in our plans. We know that our Type 1 patient with an automated insulin delivery system is certainly our stickiest and patient with the highest utilization factors as we go down the acuity curve to people on MDI or basal users or even those who are non-insulin users. Utilization goes down, but our retention numbers are still industry standard by a very large margin. And so we're still doing very well there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nSteve Lichtman: Guys, I wanted to ask again about the sales force integration and just where you are today. Are you seeing signs of stabilization now? And what are you assuming on that front for the guide? And then can you remind us what opportunities you see with this larger sales force that obviously can turn this into a positive ultimately?\nKevin Sayer: We are seeing things beginning to stabilize, but we're also seeing things slower than we'd projected in our own internal models at the start of the year. And as we developed our guidance earlier, hence as Jeremy said, the guidance coming down a bit. So we are seeing things begin to stabilize and they're stabilizing across different categories and geographies. I think the biggest thing to anticipate for us and one of the things class we missed in our plans, we sent a whole bunch of new reps into offices we've never called on before. And there's a get to know you period that we probably didn't estimate being long enough. And so we're taking steps to assist our team and better interactions with those physicians and getting to know them and getting them to trust and use Dexcom. Somebody hasn't prescribed Dexcom, they've got to prescribe one to see how it goes. And we've been going through that cycle during this quarter, and we should be able to increase the prescription patterns of those new physicians a lot more going forward. But there was a lot of getting to know you, for lack of a better word, going on here in the second quarter as this group got out there. We'll have a lot more data at the end of the third quarter. We saw better interactions in May and June, and we'll see how things go from here on out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Polark with Wolf Research. Your line is open.\nMike Polark: I want to ask on your relationship with distributors and the concept of stocking. Last year obviously was a big year with the G7 launch and the basal coverage expansion and there's always a lot of stuff going on OUS. As you look back at '23 as the baseline for building '24, would you frame any of kind of this setback as stocking last year that kind of caused a snafu in your modeling or this year? If you can comment on inventory levels with key partners, are you observing a drawdown of inventory? If there's anything to frame around that, I'd appreciate the color.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes, if anything, usually you have these challenges when you launch a product given inventory levels of the old and inventory levels of the new. In all fairness to our partners last year, they did a pretty good job of balancing G6 and G7 inventory levels as they went through their transition. So we didn't have a whole lot in the prior year. This year it's pretty normal and we have inventory levels that generally range in between pretty normal levels. We keep an eye on what's in the channel and they always stay within this really relatively tight band, and we keep it in that band intentionally. And so we've been in that band now and we generally stay in that band. I don't recall a time we've been outside of that band, quite frankly. And so nothing to call out specifically. The bigger issue, and I get what you're getting at, the bigger issue would have been say last year during a window when you had a launch of G7, and folks were gearing up given not sure how much demand would come in. We didn't really have that last year. And again, kudos to everybody that was holding inventory. They did a nice job.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nShagun Singh: Just to follow up on the sales force disruption here, you said it was more disruptive than historically because you changed roles. So can you elaborate on that? And then you talked about physicians, changed physicians people are calling on. So is this, are you referring to the PCP channel? And then you also refer to longer time to productivity. Can you give us a sense of how long does it take to get fully productive? It sounds like about two quarters or so because you said you expect them to be fully productive getting into 2025. So is that the case? And then just finally, can you give us an update on the extended wear? Thank you.\nKevin Sayer: I was waiting for a science question. So I'll start with extended wear. We've been committed to launching a 15-day product in 2025. And we intend to. Things are progressing well on that front. Stelo will be a 15-day product as well. We will learn a great deal from Stelo with our launch and how that goes. With respect to the sales team, again, that reorganization is much different than what we've done in the past. What we've done in the past is we would look at an area and the total sales volume in an area and the physicians there and kind of just divide it up geographically and make various sub areas. So the reps in those areas would call an endocrinologist and primary care physicians. And primarily their efforts were focused on those that were the highest prescribers in the territory. What we did this time is, we took our territories and we said, okay, we are going to have specialty reps. And one force who calls primarily on the high prescribing physicians, endocrinologists and high prescribing primary care doctors who are very familiar with the product and service them more in that type of a role. And that's one group of our sales force. Then we have more people who are prospecting, who are going down and talking to more of PCPs who don't prescribe as much product, places where we have not been before. Because what we've noted in our data is we obviously don't win in offices we don't call on. And so we needed to get into those offices and develop relationships. A lot of the time that has been spent in the first, in this first quarter and going forward in Q3 is beginning to develop and cultivate those relationships so we can get prescriptions from those healthcare professionals. They need to learn to trust us, and they need to learn to, and have some experiences with our products. So that is how that is going and that is why this is different. So we really did things differently than we've done in the past. We believe over the long term it's absolutely the right thing to do and we have confidence in this team that they'll work through this. We believe it will start to turn, near the end, starting into Q4 and be in a very good position by 2025. And that is the timeframe that we are looking at if things go fast or great, but that's how we model our business. As Jereme said earlier, we've decelerated our new patient number from what we had in our original models for Q3 as to what we have now. And we see things picking back up in Q4. As the group gets more involved. So that's where it is.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nBill Plovanic: Just wanted to ask, so the pharmacy is good. DME is slowing. Do you think this is potentially a slowdown in penetration into the Type 1 and Type 2 markets? You're hitting about 60% Type 1, 40% Type 2 in the U.S. I mean, are you just starting to get a saturation point where each incremental market share or market penetration is that much tougher to come by? Or do you think this, you know, so it's a broader challenge or is this purely specific to sales force and DME and what have you? Thank you.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. It's a good question. In the U.S., we don't think so. There's still quite a bit of one way and we're still seeing the growth patterns relatively steady there. If you look at the overall total market growth in the second quarter, I think what you can see is, if you add up all the various players, it's still a very robust growth. I think in our case, certainly in the DME channel, it was a share loss. And I think we just held our own in the retail channel this quarter. And so I don't necessarily know that I would say that. I think it's more about us getting in charge of really our go-to-market and making sure with our leading technology, we're getting our fair share there. As you zoom outside the U.S., as Kevin alluded to a little bit in his script, outside the U.S., it's really chunks of coverage and chunks of approval. And while we got a bit of a chunk here in France, Basel, there are some chunks we are waiting on. And so, it can slow a bit as an overall market. I think you see it when you compare, when you combine results globally, there is a bit of a slowdown outside the U.S. We don't think that it's a long-term issue because as chunks of approvals come in, you find that there's still certainly pent up demand. So really it's about coverage. And we are working on coverage in various different areas, both Type 2 intensive, certainly in Basel. And there's even some countries where we're still working on Type 1 coverage in some of the more emerging markets. So maybe outside the U.S. you see a temporal slowdown, but not in the U.S. I think the US is still a very robust market. We're still seeing Basel grow at the same rates that we expected as a total category. Still seeing the intensive insulin categories still growing well. And obviously with, non-insulin opportunities with Stelo and the OTC products, I think it's a market that can continue to grow for some time.\nKevin Sayer: Yes, I'll add to that. You know, you talked about a 60% penetration. I said several years ago, 80% per Type 1 insulin users. And I believe the same with Type 2 intensive insulin users. There is no reason somebody shouldn't be on a CGM. It's up to us to create the experience and the access structure whereby everybody can get to it. And those are the things we have to take on, Bill. And I agree with Jereme's comments. Our efforts this quarter focus on our execution a lot more than a market slowdown. It's up to us to be better.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron. Your line is open.\nChris Pasquale: I wanted to just clarify two points. One on the rebate issue. Do you need to anniversary that before revenue per patient becomes less of a drag? In other words, is that a period impact or is it a resetting the bar that then you have to lap before you get back to normal? And Jeremy, you touched on international briefly in the last question. Most of the focus thus far has been on U.S., but OUS also disappointed. Am I right in interpreting, you think that the slower growth there is more normal until you get some of these new coverages to come through. That's really going to be the catalyst for a reacceleration.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So in terms of your rebate dynamic, I think we talked about it coming faster because it's come faster, certainly here in the Q2 and to a lesser extent in Q1. You'll lap it pretty darn early next year. So we're going to lap it pretty darn quick. Obviously, it's going to impact us at a more acute number. We expected it to be gradual over the course of this year into next year, which still would have been faster than G6. So to that point, it does it does help for next year's comps because we will lap it pretty darn quick. In terms of the question on OUS, one of the things we've done historically there is it's a market where we've taken share and obviously it's been growing. In this quarter, I would say we didn't take share and that's the best part of it. The other part then is in the chunks. And so there's two opportunities there. Certainly there's chunks of reimbursement, which would help accelerate it. But our expectation with the product launches we've had and the quality of product that we have is to take share. And so I think there's two opportunities. One's within our control, which is taking share. And then the other is within the industry's control, which is coverage. And we're going to execute on that, which we can control and certainly aid in helping the industry coverage as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatt Miksic: So there's a couple of things that I think investors are trying to pin down here and understand, given the announcement and the display changing trajectory here in the back half. The first is around the channel mix, indication mix, and their impact on pricing, maybe given that you're building out a field force that's growing into areas where you haven't traditionally called, as you talked about, potentially maybe the margin impact of that. But is that something where channel mixes and these pricing factors have sort of set off on a new trajectory that we now have to think about an equation of patient growth and price mix. What does that translate into growth over the next couple of years? Should we be thinking differently about that? And then I guess the other, just to cross it off the list, it doesn't sound like it's a factor is, it's just around competition. Is there any shift, given the places where you're going into new accounts and the PCP channel or elsewhere? Are you feeling like you're breaking into slightly tougher competitive challenges? It doesn't sound like it, but just if you could cross that off the list and provide any color on the first, that'd be terrific.\nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So I'll maybe go with the crossing off the list. There's always competition. And certainly, as we go into all of these categories, you're always going to have that. We've always had competition. So this is an area that's been, we've been competing for some time. So I don't think that's necessarily a new dynamic. When you expand to sales force, clearly your first call points, you've got to go through that. But this was no different than what we had in 2021 last time we expanded to sales force. We went into new locations. It's building familiarity. And yes, there's always competition, but that's not a new thing. So I think you can cross that off the list. To your question then on mix, I'd say that in the U.S., I don't think the market has moved all that much. I think it gets back to our performance within that market. And we have to perform in those areas. And so when you talk about, you know, is this a new price, year-over-year, pure price, it hasn't really changed all that much. Certainly in the DME channel, it hasn't changed all that much. And we talk about that often. But when you have less performance in your highest reimbursed channels and better performance in a lower reimbursed channel, we've always talked about DME being higher than pharmacy. And then you don't outperform on new patients. You kind of combine all those up. That's what you really saw. So the opportunity is for us to get out there and get the new patients and get the new patients in all of the channels and the channels that we've been in and get our fair share in those channels. So I think that's the best way to think about it is, we can do it. It's within our purview to go do so as opposed to necessarily shifting in the market itself.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call to Kevin Sayer for closing remarks.\nKevin Sayer: Well, thanks everybody for participating today. This is a tough call for us. I know it's a tough call for all of you who supported us. We've provided the best view that we have going forward. We obviously will work hard to do better and provide you with more color and more things going forward. We are extremely excited for our Stelo launch later this quarter. And we certainly expect to hear from you as we do that. Just want to also point out, we've talked a lot about our commercial team today. They're fabulous. They've done very well and they will rebound from this. I have every confidence they will. When you have something like this, it's on everybody in a company. It's not just on those guys. We're all going to put our heads down and focus more. So you can count on that. Thank you very much for being with us today. And we'll see you all soon.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Speakers, please stand by for your debrief.",

            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Before we begin discussing Q2 results, let me state that overall category demand remains strong, and awareness of the value of CGM across the metabolic health spectrum continues to accelerate. This trend was evident at the recent American Diabetes Association Conference, which featured Dexcom's largest evidence to- date in the non-insulin type 2 space. Dexcom research demonstrated significant A1C reduction in multiple studies, as well as real-world evidence showing a time and range increase of greater than four hours per day for nearly 4,000 customers using Dexcom CGM at one year. We are leveraging several pathways of evidence generation to ensure that we are maximizing our market opportunity into the future, as our CGM systems become increasingly tailored to the unique needs of each customer. Despite the positive progress on these fronts, we saw three near-term trends emerge over the course of the second quarter that drove results below our expectations. First, as we have worked through our U.S. salesforce realignment expansion, we have seen our share of new customers fall short of our expectations, despite still strong absolute customer additions. Second, our U.S. revenue per customer has stepped down faster than expected based on two primary drivers, rebate eligibility and channel mix. With G7 coverage emerging faster than expected, we realized greater rebate eligibility relative to initial expectations and compared to 2023 levels. While we believe this enhanced G7 coverage has helped facilitate new customer starts as mentioned above, the pace of these starts did not allow us to offset the temporary impact from this rebate eligibility. We expect the impact of this rebate eligibility dynamic will reach its peak in the third quarter, and Jereme will provide specific color on the Q3 expectations shortly. Beyond the transitory G7 eligibility dynamic, we also saw revenue per customer impacted by U.S. channel mix dynamics. U.S. customer growth has remained strong in our pharmacy business as we expand our reach into primary care and type 2 diabetes more broadly. However, our growth in the DME channel has trailed our plan. The DME distributors remain important partners for us in our business, and we've not executed well this quarter against these partnerships. We need to refocus on those relationships. Finally, our international performance was also lighter than expectations in the quarter. While we delivered strong performance in some of our core markets, such as the U.K. and France, we saw category growth soften in certain geographies as type 1 penetration advances in these regions. We continue to see a significant runway ahead across our international footprint, particularly as we drive greater access for people with type 2 diabetes. To account for these trends and appropriately reflect our base assumption, we've lowered our full-year revenue guidance to 11% to 13% organic growth. We have higher expectations for our business than what we experienced this quarter. We believe we have an incredible product, an incredible future pipeline, and an unparalleled market opportunity. We also have a great team capable of leading this market. But I expect more from myself and more from my team going forward. So, what are we doing to enhance our competitive position and reestablish momentum? It starts with our product portfolio, which we continue to strengthen to put our field sales team in a great position with clinicians. In the second quarter, we expanded our direct-to-Apple Watch connectivity with G7, launching in the U.S. and several additional international markets with this feature that has been among our most requested for several years. We expanded the international launch of the Dexcom ONE+ system, now reaching 18 international markets with our smaller G7 form factor for our Dexcom ONE users. We've built upon the performance of G7, making it even better. This includes a continuation of our monthly cadence of software updates, which included the second-quarter additions of medication logging and the ability to ingest activity data into our G7 app. We've introduced a stronger adhesive to support our customers into the summer months, and we expanded the G7 Bluetooth connectivity range by more than 65%. We advanced Dexcom CGM leadership in the ID space with the launches of G7 integrations with Tandem's Mobi system and Insulet's Omnipod 5. We've strengthened our existing products while preparing for the most expansive product launch in our company's history with the upcoming August launch of Stelo. We are seeing the demand for CGM build in the non-insulin space and consumer use and believe that we've created a unique and engaging system to drive people to better metabolic health outcomes. Our team has worked hard to build a scalable service model for Stelo that will be great for our customers, including the e-commerce experience, seamless delivery through Amazon fulfillment, insightful product features, digital support options, and much more to come. We'll offer both single purchase opportunities as well as discounted subscriptions that bring the monthly cost below $100. Stelo will be a full launch on stelo.com, and we continue to expect approximately 1% of revenue contribution in 2024. We are committed to personalized approaches to metabolic health management through updates like these. This is what will enable us to capture greater share and maintain high rates of retention and utilization across our customer base. We feel that our expanded U.S. sales force positions us very well to reignite our growth opportunity now and well into the future. We have the ability to dive deep into the technological leadership that Dexcom provides for diabetes specialty practices. We have also expanded our reach and ability to highlight the simplicity of our platform and how it fits into a busy primary care practice. We have the advantage of better coverage and the lowest out-of-pocket cost for the insulin population, and soon to be enhanced by the simplicity of the Stelo OTC platform. As we take significant steps to broaden our addressable market well into the future with Stelo and our expanded U.S. sales force, we are also working hard to ensure simplified access to our systems in the markets we serve. In the second quarter, our team worked with the CDC to create new ICD-10 diagnostic codes for problematic hypoglycemia. These codes, which were published in May and go into effect in October, can simplify the process of documenting hypoglycemic events that qualify non-insulin users for CGM coverage. Our international market expansion efforts also progressed into the second quarter as we received coverage in France for people with Type 2 diabetes on basal insulin and began serving these customers in June. We also transitioned to direct sales in Japan at the outset of the quarter and look forward to taking control of our commercial efforts in that crucial market. To summarize, our second quarter performance and 2024 outlook are not up to our standards, and we look forward to better capitalizing on our opportunity as we move forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Jereme Thanks, Robbie. I appreciate the question and understand your position. Let me start with, let's go back to the numbers and the things we talked about in our script. We're short a large number of new patients as to where we thought we would be at this point in time, and Jeremy can provide you with the numbers as to what the new patient constitutes. There is a combination of things as far as the new patient shortage. Obviously, disruption on the sales force expansion side. This was a different expansion for us than other ones. In other ones we've done, we literally took territories and just divided them geographically. In this time, we changed roles. We changed positions people called on. It was a much more disruptive expansion we've had in the past, and that did lead to a lot of disruption, particularly at the beginning of the quarter. We saw things getting better towards the end. With respect to the other factors, as far as market share, we said we've lost market share in the DME channel. While we've done well in the pharmacy channel, as you can all see by scripts and scripts that are filled in the pharmacy on the DME side, we've lost share, and that has hurt us. And, again, that is patients, it's including new patients, but it's also, as we're losing in that category, we're also losing the customers who have the highest annual revenue per year as a patient. So you're losing those. And then some of those patients, even though we've lost share in the DME channel, have shifted the pharmacy, but that is at a lower revenue per year number. The last piece of this is rebate eligibility. And again, we expected G7 to have rebate eligibility over schedule that was literally twice as fast as G6. It's been 3x faster. G7 got the full rebate very quickly, quicker than we had planned. So all those things added together, while they had somewhat of an effect on Q2, they have a longer range effect on the rest of the year. So we added all those things together, and that's how we came up with our guide. I'll let Jereme come up with more, if you want to add to that. Yes. Let me start with the LRP for '25. Yes, we believe our LRP for '25 is valid, but our revenue will probably come in closer to the lower end of the range rather than the upper end of the range, as we sit here today. But we've achieved incredible progress on the P&L side, our burning margin and EBITDA side, our gross profit side on that LRP. So from a P&L perspective, we're definitely hitting all our goals on the LRP side. As far as fixing all these things and what fixes we have in place, obviously, it's going to be a bit of a process. On the rebate eligibility front, we believe that caps out in Q3, and we plan for this to cap out in Q4. It just happened a couple quarters earlier than we'd planned. So that is very much a temporary thing and accelerated. With respect to DME market share, one of the factors that has actually happened that created part of this is several of the Medicare Advantage programs went to pharmacy reimbursement. So patients who were being served by the DME channel shifted to the pharmacy, and that is a piece of our lost DME share. I can't quantify exactly how much, but that's some of it. Adding to that, we need to refocus on those relationships. We need to do better, and we will talk with them. We have some plans and some things in place to start off there. But it's early. We have to implement them. And again, DME data is really the last piece of the puzzle as far as our revenues. As far as where we get by the end of the year, just given the data sources that we all look at, it's not as simple as the scripts on the pharmacy side. So we're addressing that. We will put more emphasis and time there. We'll send more customers through that channel and do better by those guys. So we'll keep looking. On the international front, another piece to remember, we've got a few things going on there. Timing of some of the tenders affects the numbers. There are some tenders that kick in July 1st that will help on the international growth, and that will be helpful there. We're also looking for Type 2 expansion, as I said on the call. We just got basal coverage in France. That's kicking in. We know some of the other countries are moving towards basal coverage very quickly, and we can play there with our Dexcom ONE+ product. Dexcom ONE+ is still early in the game, and we're seeing that begin to pick up. So there are a number of levers to pull and a number of things we're working on, Larry. I can't quantify each one of them, but suffice to say we're not just sitting here. All right, Jeremy, you want to add to that? I don't think it's been anything formulary or systematic along those lines. I think I need to take... I'll let Jereme take some more details, but let me move you guys back a little bit in time. When we started this journey down pharmacy coverage, we had as a company zero relationships in the pharmacy channel. We worked very hard to develop those relationships because, as you can all see by our numbers and our largest competitors' numbers, that is where a large portion of the business has moved at this point in time. We put a tremendous amount of effort there because we'd never been there before. We didn't have any infrastructure. We didn't have other products there. We didn't have relationships there. I think in creating and building those relationships, we ignored other relationships that were very important to us more than we should have. And so we need to balance that a little better and make sure that our customers get their product through a source that's easy, efficient, and economical for them. We felt, to a large extent, we were doing that, but we think we need to do more. Jeremy, you want to take some more on that? No, I think that's good. Yes, I'll start. And again, Jereme, you can add more color. With respect to the rebates, this really caps in Q3. We'd estimated in our own models that we would have full rebate eligibility by the fourth quarter of this year. It just happened, again, a couple of quarters faster than we had planned. With respect to our field sales team and the disruption there, we believe we'll work through that in Q3 and early Q4. And by the time we start 2025, this group should be clicking on all cylinders. And things should go very well there. Another thing that Jereme talked about is reallocation and really examining where we're going to spend the dollars that we spend and the investments we're going to make to maximize the commercial effect of those. Those programs and those decisions are being made now. We'll roll into Q3 and into Q4. And we believe it'll set us up nicely for 2025. We're obviously not given 2025 guidance today. But we feel by the end of the year, the things that we've talked about today, we should have worked through, and we should have a very good idea as to where we're going in the future. No, it made perfect sense to me. With respect to our overall pricing, our pricing within channels, when you look at the prices, remains relatively consistent. What has happened in this quarter and what has happened now is more and more people have become eligible for rebates, hence bringing our value per customer down. This was the price that we assumed we would be targeting at the end of the fourth quarter, and we'd be rolling into '25 with. In other periods, we haven't had anything as severe as we have today, obviously, but our new patient growth number would be so high and our volumes would be so high. If something like this happened, we grew through it. And so if a plan like this accelerated, our new patient numbers are so big, Danielle, that we managed through it. In this quarter, you combine the two of them, the increase in the rebates, which gets, again, to a net price very near what we'd expected and modeled. That doesn't mean the bottom of the price is falling out on an overall basis in the channel. It just means more people were subject to rebates than we had before, and we shifted patients from a more profitable DME channel over to that pharmacy. Through some, again, as I talked earlier, the three largest Medicare Advantage plans adopted pharmacy coverage this year. A lot of the Medicaid plans have gone to pharmacy coverage as well. So those plans moving there, necessitated a bit of that move and a bit of those rebates going up. So no, we don't believe we have a price falling out. We believe what we do continues to provide tremendous value to people and does a lot to improve health, save their lives, and all the things we've talked about forever. So this is still a very valuable component in somebody's health, and we'll continue to treat it as such. I'd also add, though, there has been a shift in government payer activity from the DME channel to the pharmacy. That actually has happened. And we have to figure out how much that has impacted, our DME mix versus pharmacy mix as well. Yes. This is Kevin. The Stelo guidance, the Q3 contribution is not overly large. Most of the Stelo revenue is fourth quarter weighted as we, again, plan to launch Stelo in later August. So that's how that one works. With respect to attrition, our retention and attrition by patient category remains similar to what we had in our plans. We know that our Type 1 patient with an automated insulin delivery system is certainly our stickiest and patient with the highest utilization factors as we go down the acuity curve to people on MDI or basal users or even those who are non-insulin users. Utilization goes down, but our retention numbers are still industry standard by a very large margin. And so we're still doing very well there. We are seeing things beginning to stabilize, but we're also seeing things slower than we'd projected in our own internal models at the start of the year. And as we developed our guidance earlier, hence as Jeremy said, the guidance coming down a bit. So we are seeing things begin to stabilize and they're stabilizing across different categories and geographies. I think the biggest thing to anticipate for us and one of the things class we missed in our plans, we sent a whole bunch of new reps into offices we've never called on before. And there's a get to know you period that we probably didn't estimate being long enough. And so we're taking steps to assist our team and better interactions with those physicians and getting to know them and getting them to trust and use Dexcom. Somebody hasn't prescribed Dexcom, they've got to prescribe one to see how it goes. And we've been going through that cycle during this quarter, and we should be able to increase the prescription patterns of those new physicians a lot more going forward. But there was a lot of getting to know you, for lack of a better word, going on here in the second quarter as this group got out there. We'll have a lot more data at the end of the third quarter. We saw better interactions in May and June, and we'll see how things go from here on out. I was waiting for a science question. So I'll start with extended wear. We've been committed to launching a 15-day product in 2025. And we intend to. Things are progressing well on that front. Stelo will be a 15-day product as well. We will learn a great deal from Stelo with our launch and how that goes. With respect to the sales team, again, that reorganization is much different than what we've done in the past. What we've done in the past is we would look at an area and the total sales volume in an area and the physicians there and kind of just divide it up geographically and make various sub areas. So the reps in those areas would call an endocrinologist and primary care physicians. And primarily their efforts were focused on those that were the highest prescribers in the territory. What we did this time is, we took our territories and we said, okay, we are going to have specialty reps. And one force who calls primarily on the high prescribing physicians, endocrinologists and high prescribing primary care doctors who are very familiar with the product and service them more in that type of a role. And that's one group of our sales force. Then we have more people who are prospecting, who are going down and talking to more of PCPs who don't prescribe as much product, places where we have not been before. Because what we've noted in our data is we obviously don't win in offices we don't call on. And so we needed to get into those offices and develop relationships. A lot of the time that has been spent in the first, in this first quarter and going forward in Q3 is beginning to develop and cultivate those relationships so we can get prescriptions from those healthcare professionals. They need to learn to trust us, and they need to learn to, and have some experiences with our products. So that is how that is going and that is why this is different. So we really did things differently than we've done in the past. We believe over the long term it's absolutely the right thing to do and we have confidence in this team that they'll work through this. We believe it will start to turn, near the end, starting into Q4 and be in a very good position by 2025. And that is the timeframe that we are looking at if things go fast or great, but that's how we model our business. As Jereme said earlier, we've decelerated our new patient number from what we had in our original models for Q3 as to what we have now. And we see things picking back up in Q4. As the group gets more involved. So that's where it is. Yes, I'll add to that. You know, you talked about a 60% penetration. I said several years ago, 80% per Type 1 insulin users. And I believe the same with Type 2 intensive insulin users. There is no reason somebody shouldn't be on a CGM. It's up to us to create the experience and the access structure whereby everybody can get to it. And those are the things we have to take on, Bill. And I agree with Jereme's comments. Our efforts this quarter focus on our execution a lot more than a market slowdown. It's up to us to be better. Well, thanks everybody for participating today. This is a tough call for us. I know it's a tough call for all of you who supported us. We've provided the best view that we have going forward. We obviously will work hard to do better and provide you with more color and more things going forward. We are extremely excited for our Stelo launch later this quarter. And we certainly expect to hear from you as we do that. Just want to also point out, we've talked a lot about our commercial team today. They're fabulous. They've done very well and they will rebound from this. I have every confidence they will. When you have something like this, it's on everybody in a company. It's not just on those guys. We're all going to put our heads down and focus more. So you can count on that. Thank you very much for being with us today. And we'll see you all soon."

            "name": "Jereme Sylvain",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as the slide deck on our IR website. For the second quarter of 2024, we reported worldwide revenue of $1.004 billion, compared to $871.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, representing growth of 15% on a reported basis and 16% on an organic basis. As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $732 million for the second quarter, compared to $617 million in the second quarter of 2023, representing growth of 19%. As Kevin mentioned, we experienced lower than expected new customer starts in conjunction with our sales force expansion and realignment, particularly in the DME channel, as well as near-term impact from pharmacy eligibility changes, which lowered our revenue per customer relative to our expectation. Together, these dynamics adversely impacted our revenue this quarter by approximately $40 million as compared to our internal estimate. Based on the compounding effect of these lower second quarter new customer starts, we also expect our growth rates in the back half of the year to be impacted. To offset this, our team is working aggressively to improve our execution and deliver the higher market share levels that we believe our product deserves. International revenue grew 7%, totaling $272 million in the second quarter. International organic revenue growth was 10% for the second quarter. While we anticipated our international growth to slow this quarter as we lapped our very strong performance from Q2 2023, our results came in lighter than expected. Our miss on new customers impacted us by approximately $10 million on the quarter. Our international performance can often ebb and flow based on coverage decision and distributor purchases, but as Kevin mentioned, there remains a long runway ahead for Dexcom CGM globally. We continue to invest in infrastructure to expand our geographical presence, provide compelling evidence to expand market access in new segments of key markets, and leverage our product portfolio to meet the unique needs of various customers and health systems. Our second quarter gross profit was $638.1 million, or 63.5% of revenue, which was in line with the 63.5% of revenue we delivered in the second quarter of 2023. We continue to see further migration of our customer base from G6 to G7 in the second quarter as we finalize new pump integrations and transition Dexcom ONE to the G7 form factor. Between this ongoing customer transition and continued ramp up of our high-volume manufacturing facilities in Mesa and Malaysia, we are making steady progress towards our long-term cost targets. Operating expenses were $442.7 million for Q2 of 2024, compared to $395.1 million in Q2 of 2023. Operating income was $195.4 million, or 19.5% of revenue, in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $158.4 million, or 18.2% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $283.9 million, or 28.3% of revenue, for the second quarter, compared to $232.6 million, or 26.7% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2023. Net income for the second quarter was $174.3 million, or $0.43 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with greater than $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. And based on our strong cash position, consistent free cash flow generation, and ongoing growth opportunities, we are announcing an authorization for a share repurchase program of up to $750 million. Turning to guidance. Starting with full year 2024, we are decreasing our revenue guidance to a range of $4.00 billion to $4.05 billion, representing organic growth of 11% to 13% for the year. As mentioned earlier, the compounding effect of our slower-than-expected new customer growth in the U.S. DME channel and international business, as well as increased pharmacy eligibility, resulted in the need to recalibrate the guide. Our updated guidance reflects these dynamics and assumes a longer ramp in productivity in our U.S. sales force. For margins, we are reducing our non-GAAP gross profit margin guidance to approximately 63%, while maintaining our prior guidance on non-GAAP operating margin and adjusted EBITDA at approximately 20% and 29%, respectively. In addition to our annual guidance, we are providing two additional data points to help investors and analysts understand some of the unique elements impacting our revised guidance in 2024. First, the impact to new patients from our sales force initiative, combined with our revenue per customer trends that Kevin detailed, will change the historical seasonality pattern that we have typically experienced. These impacts are expected to reach their peak in the third quarter, with total revenue expected to be between $975 million and $1 billion. In conjunction with this revenue outlook, we thought it would be helpful to provide a mid-year update on our global active customer base, which we now estimate to be between $2.5 million and $2.6 million. This represents strong growth over where we finished 2023, though the growth percentage has decelerated slightly. Our hope is these updates will provide additional visibility as our team works to implement several of the areas of focus that we have aligned on over the past month, and as our sales force continues to ramp their efficiency. With that, we can open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Yes. So to give some context to the numbers, you're right, Robbie. At the top end of guidance, about a $300 million decline. In Kevin's prepared remarks, we talked about $50 million really impacting the second quarter. Those end up playing out to be a little bit larger as you expand those over the course of the year. So to give you some context, the new patient missing Q2, which we expected to drag out into Q3 as we kind of navigate through those changes, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. We had some new patient misses there. That's about $125 million on the year of that impact. The channel mix and really the loss of share in DME, that's a big one for us, and that's about $100 million over the course of the year. Certainly impacted Q2, but we expect it to impact the rest of the year as well, as those essentially work into full quarters. And then the rebate eligibility happened, again, quicker than we would have expected. Again, eventually you get there. It happened quicker than we expected. That's about $75 million. So we have those up. That's about the $300 million that you see. Certainly not something we're happy about, but in full transparency, we needed to make sure what we saw as we closed out the second quarter, we're transparent about what the impact is for the balance of the year. Yes. And then maybe below the hood a little bit in terms of how we allocate the investment dollars, Larry. We are reprioritizing and reallocating investments to where we know that it ultimately drives the most bang. So the team is working on that diligently in terms of refocusing where those dollars and those efforts go. So not given the specifics, just given the competitive nature of it, but rest assured there are changes being made underlying the business to ensure that we get back on top of our new patients. No, that's it. And, Jeff, to your comment on if there's any CMS changes in terms of reimbursement down there, we certainly did not say that. I think that was maybe a competitor that said that. What we had said was we're partners, and so if there's any changes in CMS reimbursement as partners, we would look at it as partners. And that would be our expectation going forward. So that was not how we positioned it. But nevertheless, to the extent that those have caused frayed relationships, as Kevin alluded to, we would pay more attention to it irrespective. Yes, it's a good question. Let me start on that. So, Margaret, the answer is we do expect to see disruption continue into the third quarter. And that's one of the reasons why you're seeing the impact. It's really a bit of a cumulative impact. Obviously, Q2 was a big impact. You know, we've sized it in terms of patients. It was a pretty sizable disruption relative to expectation. It was around 70,000 patients. So it was a pretty big number. Obviously, that rolls through to the rest of the year. But we do expect it to take a little bit of time to recover that. And so there will be there. We have lowered new patient expectations into Q3. And then into Q4, our expectation is we start to get back to where we were. But think about it as a quarter delay, effectively, as a result of some of this disruption on our longer-term plans. And so when you run those numbers, plus you run some expected numbers here in Q3 in disruption relative to expectation, that's ultimately how you get to the figures. In terms of improvement over the course of time, ultimately, you do expect to see that. And we've seen some of that over time. Now, we always expected perhaps a little bit of disruption and some recovery. I would say the disruption is bigger than we would have anticipated. And the recovery is there. But when the disruption is bigger than anticipated, even as you have some of that recovery, again, you're a quarter behind where you'd expect to be. And I expect that to play out as we come next year. So we revised that. We've included that in the guidance. High-level, Kevin, I don't know if you have anything to add. Yes, I can take that. So, when you think about rebate eligibility, over time, you kind of get closer and closer to this 100% eligibility. And it takes a little bit of time. So plans, as they opt into coverage, opt in. So we saw this take place over G6, to a lesser extent G5. We weren't really in the pharmacy then. We saw it take place over the course of G6. And when we launched G7, we assumed it happened about twice as fast as G6. So the assumption is, is more and more folks get access. Therefore, more and more folks are moving through that program. Therefore, you're subject to more and more rebates. And then the offset, of course, is by having more access, you have more volumes. As you can tell by our new patient numbers, we didn't have the volumes, but also the existing patient base was also subject to rebates. And so effectively, it's timing of price as you run through this. It's temporal, meaning you can only rebate up to your entire population, and eventually it gets there. But that's why it's a timing thing. And it just happened, like Kevin was alluding to, three times as fast as G6, not two times as fast as G6. So that's the big piece there. In terms of the understanding of how the quarter was rolling up, you are correct. It did roll up later into the second quarter. You can see our results in the second quarter, while not up to expectations, did not impact the quarter as much as it impacted the full year. And obviously, that was driven by what you saw, the dynamics that played through, really, the second quarter. Kevin was alluding to DME, where there's a big change in, let's say, his share, and where we certainly missed. And that data comes in a little delayed. That was about a four- to six-week delay before we said. So as we've tallied that data, as we're moving into, really, the close of the quarter and into the weeks leading into the call, not only did it make us aware of, certainly, the impact on the quarter, but it was really important for us then to reflect that in the guidance on the year. And so a lot of that data, you're right. It obviously took place over the course of the quarter. We became aware of it, really, as we closed out the quarter. But that's why it's really important to get it in front of it for the guidance for the full year. Yes. And Kevin alluded to it earlier. We talked about, the question was, is how do you feel about the 2025 LRP and is it still valid? And again, we said, look, we feel it's still valid, albeit at the lower end of it, Matt. So I think that gives you some context. Obviously this year is going to be impacted by these factors. As we work out of those and we work into them next year, Kevin alluded to it, rebates shouldn't be an impact next year. So as we work out of it, as we get closer to the end of the year, we'll give 2025 guidance. But that hopefully gives you some context to our confidence as we move out of this year into next year and getting these things behind us. It shouldn't go unnoticed. Obviously, we're bullish on the business longer term, clearly not happy with the quarter and certainly not happy with the revised guide. So don't mistake it for that. But we do our bullish on the business longer term, hence the $750 million share repurchase authorization. So hopefully that helps square up how we're at least thinking about 2025. No, it's an integer, and so the whole point there is yes, while the top has come down, 1%, 43 versus 40, at the end of the day, it was all that kind of general contribution. So there was nothing insinuated by that, Joanne. It was just rounded to that integer. Sure. Maybe I can start with maybe the next year question. I don't think we've necessarily guided to a number. What we really tried to do is say, here's our LRP. It's still in play. And when I say to the lower end, it's not necessarily the low end or a point estimate within there. It's really to give some context to, as we've already made plans and are looking at next year, we have some, there's confidence in meeting that low end number. And so really, that's really what the goal here is, rather than to set a guide number. Now, your question then coming back to, which is this year's growth, which the organic growth number, obviously 11% to 13% is lower than we've historically seen. Kevin's alluded to it a little bit in the script. This year, a little bit of what I would say is execution, where I think we need to execute better on new patients and execute better in various channels. And so that's something as a team, we have to get our arms around. This year was impacted by a quicker, as we mentioned, a quicker rebate dynamic than we expected. And that's a part of it. Obviously, we lapped that next year. And you can only rebate 100% of your units. So obviously, it stops at some point. And so that piece of it will be transitory. But I think the big key then is getting back to execution and execution on new patients and executing in the DME channel and making sure we have good partnerships there and executing on our channel mix. So that's really the work we have to do. And back to that point, that's one of the reasons we had a little bit of a lapse here. And to the extent that we can get back to it, that allows us to get back to what we hope is what our traditional performance has been. Yes. We'd always kind of got, at least in the commercial channels, and we talked, this is really more about the commercial channels. We had always assumed it'd be about 75-25. That was kind of our crystal ball. And as we got there, it started to skew a little bit more. But it didn't drift off of that 75-25 all that much. However, this quarter, as we started to see really what I would say is loss of share, which for us in that channel is a bit unique and something we got to get our arms around. The split in our business was a little more. It doesn't necessarily mean that the overall market split ultimately ends up that way. But it does mean that the shift of our business certainly shifted that way. And so does that number shift down to 85-15? Well, if we take share, no. And that's really on us. So that gets back to the execution question. We need to execute in that channel. And that channel, it's a very important channel for us. And these are very important partners. And they serve a very, very important partnership to our customers. And so we've got to get back into that channel and make sure that we're getting our fair share there. That's really the big driver. Yes. So the 70,000, the way I think about it is there's a good chunk of that that is OUS. And so there's a portion that's outside the United States. There's a portion that's inside the United States. And it's usually reflective of our patient base in total. So you kind of have our split there. In the US, really, a lot of it is driven by the Salesforce. Now, one of the challenges, of course, is the Salesforce services all different indications. And so as you service all in different indications, you could probably imagine if we're not doing well in the DME, it gets back to your point. We're not doing wonderful in the basal space. That's a big piece of the DME, certainly DME Medicare and the patient base that they service. So that's the way, it's really hard to parse out by category. But when we look into it and we say, gee, we're not doing, we're not taking share in the DME space, you can presume that a lot of that is in that Medicare space. And I think it is fair to say that really across the board disruption, you can assume there's a little bit really across the board, but the biggest piece there by the best way to put it. Yes, if anything, usually you have these challenges when you launch a product given inventory levels of the old and inventory levels of the new. In all fairness to our partners last year, they did a pretty good job of balancing G6 and G7 inventory levels as they went through their transition. So we didn't have a whole lot in the prior year. This year it's pretty normal and we have inventory levels that generally range in between pretty normal levels. We keep an eye on what's in the channel and they always stay within this really relatively tight band, and we keep it in that band intentionally. And so we've been in that band now and we generally stay in that band. I don't recall a time we've been outside of that band, quite frankly. And so nothing to call out specifically. The bigger issue, and I get what you're getting at, the bigger issue would have been say last year during a window when you had a launch of G7, and folks were gearing up given not sure how much demand would come in. We didn't really have that last year. And again, kudos to everybody that was holding inventory. They did a nice job. Yes. It's a good question. In the U.S., we don't think so. There's still quite a bit of one way and we're still seeing the growth patterns relatively steady there. If you look at the overall total market growth in the second quarter, I think what you can see is, if you add up all the various players, it's still a very robust growth. I think in our case, certainly in the DME channel, it was a share loss. And I think we just held our own in the retail channel this quarter. And so I don't necessarily know that I would say that. I think it's more about us getting in charge of really our go-to-market and making sure with our leading technology, we're getting our fair share there. As you zoom outside the U.S., as Kevin alluded to a little bit in his script, outside the U.S., it's really chunks of coverage and chunks of approval. And while we got a bit of a chunk here in France, Basel, there are some chunks we are waiting on. And so, it can slow a bit as an overall market. I think you see it when you compare, when you combine results globally, there is a bit of a slowdown outside the U.S. We don't think that it's a long-term issue because as chunks of approvals come in, you find that there's still certainly pent up demand. So really it's about coverage. And we are working on coverage in various different areas, both Type 2 intensive, certainly in Basel. And there's even some countries where we're still working on Type 1 coverage in some of the more emerging markets. So maybe outside the U.S. you see a temporal slowdown, but not in the U.S. I think the US is still a very robust market. We're still seeing Basel grow at the same rates that we expected as a total category. Still seeing the intensive insulin categories still growing well. And obviously with, non-insulin opportunities with Stelo and the OTC products, I think it's a market that can continue to grow for some time. Yes. So in terms of your rebate dynamic, I think we talked about it coming faster because it's come faster, certainly here in the Q2 and to a lesser extent in Q1. You'll lap it pretty darn early next year. So we're going to lap it pretty darn quick. Obviously, it's going to impact us at a more acute number. We expected it to be gradual over the course of this year into next year, which still would have been faster than G6. So to that point, it does it does help for next year's comps because we will lap it pretty darn quick. In terms of the question on OUS, one of the things we've done historically there is it's a market where we've taken share and obviously it's been growing. In this quarter, I would say we didn't take share and that's the best part of it. The other part then is in the chunks. And so there's two opportunities there. Certainly there's chunks of reimbursement, which would help accelerate it. But our expectation with the product launches we've had and the quality of product that we have is to take share. And so I think there's two opportunities. One's within our control, which is taking share. And then the other is within the industry's control, which is coverage. And we're going to execute on that, which we can control and certainly aid in helping the industry coverage as well. Yes. So I'll maybe go with the crossing off the list. There's always competition. And certainly, as we go into all of these categories, you're always going to have that. We've always had competition. So this is an area that's been, we've been competing for some time. So I don't think that's necessarily a new dynamic. When you expand to sales force, clearly your first call points, you've got to go through that. But this was no different than what we had in 2021 last time we expanded to sales force. We went into new locations. It's building familiarity. And yes, there's always competition, but that's not a new thing. So I think you can cross that off the list. To your question then on mix, I'd say that in the U.S., I don't think the market has moved all that much. I think it gets back to our performance within that market. And we have to perform in those areas. And so when you talk about, you know, is this a new price, year-over-year, pure price, it hasn't really changed all that much. Certainly in the DME channel, it hasn't changed all that much. And we talk about that often. But when you have less performance in your highest reimbursed channels and better performance in a lower reimbursed channel, we've always talked about DME being higher than pharmacy. And then you don't outperform on new patients. You kind of combine all those up. That's what you really saw. So the opportunity is for us to get out there and get the new patients and get the new patients in all of the channels and the channels that we've been in and get our fair share in those channels. So I think that's the best way to think about it is, we can do it. It's within our purview to go do so as opposed to necessarily shifting in the market itself."

[Operator Instructions]  \n As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Sean Christensen, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Mr. Christensen, you may begin. \nSean Christensen: Thank you, Abby, and welcome to Dexcom's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Our agenda begins with Kevin Sayer, Dexcom's Chairman, President and CEO, who will summarize our recent highlights and ongoing strategic initiatives, followed by a financial review and outlook from Jereme Sylvain, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for your questions.  \n At that time, we ask analysts to limit themselves to 1 question so we can provide an opportunity for everyone participating today. Please note that there are also slides available related to our first quarter 2024 performance on the Dexcom Investor Relations website on the Events and Presentations page. With that, let's review our safe harbor statement.  \n Some of the statements we will make in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements.

Now I will turn it over to Kevin. \nKevin Sayer: Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we reported another great quarter for Dexcom with first quarter organic revenue growth of 25% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Demand for Dexcom CGM remains very high as customers continue to recognize and value our leading product performance and differentiated user experience.  \n While it has only been a year since the launch of G7 in the U.S., we have seen a significant shift in the landscape over that time. We have attracted tens of thousands of new prescribers to our ecosystem, meaningfully improved our presence within primary care and experienced growing demand from people with diabetes who are benefiting from significant expansions and coverage over the last year. Much of this momentum can be directly attributed to our product performance and innovative features.  \n With the launch of G7, we extended our leadership in sensor accuracy and took a significant step forward in ease of use. We also introduced a new software ecosystem, which was designed to improve our user experience and drive high levels of customer engagement and retention. Importantly, we have continued to enhance the G7 experience with ongoing improvements to both the hardware and software platforms. In fact, we have completed software updates almost monthly since the launch of G7, introducing new features, upgrading performance and connectivity and most recently establishing the ability to integrate insulin data into our app.  \n These are great examples of how our new software architecture enables much faster innovation. We are constantly working to advance the customer experience and reinforce Dexcom as the technology leader in this space. Along those lines, we were very excited to receive clearance by the FDA for our direct-to-watch feature for G7 in the first quarter. This approval will allow our customers to use their Apple Watch as a primary display rather than connecting through their mobile phone, providing even greater flexibility in how and where they interact with their glucose data.  \n This added to our long list of industry first as G7 is the first FDA-cleared CGM that can communicate directly from sensor to watch. To enable this, we built a robust connectivity infrastructure into the design of G7 with the ability to connect to 3 different Bluetooth devices at the same time, our customers can simultaneously connect to a phone, a pump or receiver and a watch. Dexcom is the only CGM system that gives customers these options.  \n We have received great feedback since we launched our direct-to-watch software in the U.K. and Ireland and look forward to extending it to additional markets shortly. Features like these add to our standing as the innovator in the CGM industry, strengthening our sensor platform as global access and awareness continue to expand.  \n As a reminder, we recently crossed the 1-year mark since the Landmark CMS decision to expand coverage for all people using insulin and certain non-insulin using individuals that struggle with hypoglycemia. This decision paved the way for greater commercial coverage for these populations, further strengthening our position as the most covered CGM in the U.S. It also served to broaden our conversations with payers. While payers have long recognized Dexcom's ability to help titrate insulin, there is now a growing appreciation for our ability to drive better outcomes through behavior change and customer engagement.  \n There is also a growing awareness of these benefits in the clinical community with much broader coverage now available, many physicians have started incorporating Dexcom CGM earlier into their customer care plans. They recognize lifestyle management as a cornerstone of the diabetes care and metabolic health landscapes and see CGM as a core tool to drive behavior alongside new drug therapies like GLP-1s. To that point, in the second quarter, we will be launching a medication logging module and activity integration tool within the G7 app to help those using Dexcom CGM with these therapies.  \n While this has helped us significantly expand our prescriber base over the past year, we are still only scratching the surface of this sizable opportunity. There are over 200,000 primary care physicians in the U.S. who treat tens of millions of people with diabetes. There remains a clear opportunity for us to deepen our presence within this channel as we work to drive even greater care for their patients. As a result, we announced an expansion of our sales force this past quarter. We were blown away by the level of interest and the quality of talent that we were able to attract for these roles.  \n By the end of the first quarter, we had already completed our hiring and trained these new reps. This team is excited to hit the ground running, and we look forward to seeing them build momentum over the course of the year. As part of this initiative, beginning in the second quarter, we are also taking steps to optimize the structure of our sales team to be most effective with our call points across endocrinologists and primary care physicians as well as leading practitioners in maternal-fetal medicine.  \n We expect our new team in this upgraded structure to help us better capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead. Along those lines, we hit another significant milestone in our company's history with the FDA's clearance of our newest product, Stelo, the first glucose biosensor approved for use without a prescription in the U.S., recognizing a significant unmet need for the 25 million people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin or at risk of severe hypoglycemia, we developed Stelo as a more tailored solution for this population and work closely with the FDA to simplify access to this product.  \n By removing the burden of a prescription, we expect Stelo to drive broad interest from both the clinical community and directly from members of the diabetes community who want to better understand their blood sugar. In our dialogue with the FDA, it became clear that iCGM accuracy remain critically important in establishing this new sensor category, both as a safety measure and to ensure that our customers are receiving reliable, actionable information. Stelo will leverage the industry-leading accuracy of our G7 sensor hardware while providing a custom software experience to more directly meet the needs of those not taking insulin.  \n We're on track to launch Stelo this summer as a 15-day cash pay product. We'll continue to build our case with payers for broader coverage. Stelo will be fulfilled initially via a brand-new e-commerce website and available in onetime purchases or subscription models. We look forward to providing greater detail on Stelo features, including pricing, immediately before launch, and we'll share further updates on our go-to-market strategy and ordering process at ADA and on our second quarter earnings call.  \n In our international business, we also advanced some key strategic initiatives this past quarter. In February, we officially launched Dexcom ONE+ into 8 European markets. which is our first step in moving our entire Dexcom ONE product line into the G7 form factor. This transition brings several of the G7 technological benefits to this customer base, such as the smaller form factor, shorter warm-up time and improved accuracy and further simplifies the prescribing process for physicians.  \n Moving to a shared hardware platform also benefits our cost structure over time as it allows us to drive greater volume to our G7 lines and more quickly reach scale. We also completed our transition to a direct sales model in Japan, enabling us to begin commercial operations at the start of the second quarter. As a reminder, this is one of the only markets in the world with coverage for all people using insulin, which represents over 1 million people.  \n Despite this, market penetration remains in its early stages and we see a significant opportunity to drive greater uptake in Dexcom's CGM share. As a result, we believe Japan could become a key growth driver for us over time as we strengthen our presence in this market in the coming quarters. This is an incredibly exciting time for us. There will be a lot to learn with the launch of Stelo and we are thrilled to once again pioneer the CGM industry with a new subset of users. We look forward to sharing more updates with you as we begin this journey.  \n With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the first quarter financials. Jereme? \nJereme Sylvain: Thank you, Kevin.  As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the first quarter of 2024, we reported worldwide revenue of $921 million compared to $741 million for the first quarter of 2023, representing growth of 24% on a reported basis and 25% on an organic basis.\n As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange in addition to our non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $653 million for the first quarter compared to $526 million in the first quarter of 2023, representing growth of 24%. Our recent momentum in the U.S. continued this quarter as we again benefited from the largest expansion of reimbursed coverage in our company's history.  \n This led to another quarter of significant new customer demand in the U.S. and contributed to our record new start quarter globally. As Kevin mentioned, we are excited to build on this momentum with our expanded sales force and look forward to seeing the new team ramp up in the months ahead. International revenue grew 24%, totaling $268 million in the first quarter. International organic revenue growth was 26% for the first quarter. We executed very well across our international footprint and again took market share this quarter, benefiting from our targeted access expansion and product portfolio strategy.  \n We delivered a particularly strong quarter in our core European markets, which more than offset the pause in growth from Japan as we finalized its transition to direct sales. Our first quarter gross profit was $569 million or 61.8% of revenue compared to 63.4% of revenue in the first quarter of 2023. \n This gross margin result was in line with our expectations as G7 continues to become a larger part of our product mix. As a reminder, G7 carries a lower margin than G6 today. So we expect this to change in the coming quarters as we drive more volume through our G7 lines in the U.S. and Malaysia.  \n Between continued G7 demand, our pump integrations and moving Dexcom ONE to the G7 platform, we continue to see more of our base moving to the G7 form factor. Operating expenses were $428.9 million for Q1 of 2024 compared to $391.2 million in Q1 of 2023. This quarter was another demonstration of our ability to generate significant operating leverage as we grow. In fact, we grew our revenue at more than double the rate of operating expenses in the first quarter, resulting in more than 600 basis points of OpEx leverage compared to the first quarter of 2023.  \n Operating income was $140.2 million or 15.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2024 and compared to $78.6 million or 10.6% of revenue in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $220.9 million or 24% of revenue for the first quarter compared to $145.9 million or 19.7% of revenue for the first quarter of 2023. Net income for the first quarter was $128.2 million or $0.32 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the back of nearly doubling our free cash flow year-over-year.  \n This provides us significant flexibility to both support our organic growth opportunities and assess any strategic uses of capital. From a capacity perspective, we remain in a great position with Malaysia quickly scaling and we are further diversifying our footprint with the build-out of our Ireland facility. This leaves us well positioned to support our near-term growth opportunities, including the highly anticipated launch of Stelo this summer. \n Turning to guidance. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance with an updated range of $4.20 billion to $4.35 billion, representing organic growth of 17% to 21% for the year. For margins, we are reaffirming our prior full year guidance of non-GAAP gross profit margin in a range of 63% to 64%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 29%.  \n With that, we can open up the call for Q&A. Sean? \nSean Christensen: Thank you, Jereme. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only 1 question at this time and then reenter the queue if necessary. Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Danielle Antalffy with UBS. \nDanielle Antalffy: Congrats on a strong start to the year. Kevin, so the Stelo over-the-counter clearance was obviously one of the most exciting things that we saw happen in the first quarter. Can you help us understand how you think the OTC label expands your addressable market? And how you're aligning the new sales team to capitalize on it? \nKevin Sayer: Well, thank you for the question. And it's been every bit as exciting for us as has been -- as you can imagine, Danielle, we have had more media impressions and inquiries and buzz about Stelo from the outside than really anything we've ever done. It's been spectacular. We're very excited for it. \n The way it expands our access as we thought through this, there's 25 million people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin or who don't suffer from severe hypoglycemia. We wanted to get that product out quickly and make it very accessible to them. We studied this. We spent a lot of time thinking about it. The best way to do that is to eliminate the prescription process and not to have them in the middle of that for physicians. And that's also helpful for the health care providers because they don't have to call the pharmacy and do prescriptions as well.  \n So the key to this and particularly in getting to a lot of people is to make this very easy to obtain. And that's why we went over-the-counter with it. At the same time, as I said in my remarks, we're thrilled with the labeling and the fact that we still have iCGM controls around this sensor by going over-the-counter, we didn't just open the floodgates for everybody to come in. You still have to have an incredibly good product to go do something like this. So we think we have a very, very good advantage there.  \n With respect to our sales expansion, I made a couple of comments about the expansion and positioning of the sales force. We know for a fact that when we have coverage in the physician arena when we call on doctors, we do extremely well. And so as we repositioned our sales force, I talked about repositioning between endocrinology, primary care and also the maternal and fetal medicine markets as well. \n We've repositioned our group to whereby our -- we have specialists who spend more time in the endocrinology offices and with high prescribers, not so much with those who don't prescribe a lot. And a lot of the new adds, a lot of the expansion relates to primary care, where they will talk about Stelo with primary care doctors who see almost all of the type 2 patients who aren't on insulin.  \n So by expanding this way, we believe we'll be able to have more coverage with physicians as well. And so they will take that message out and talk with the doctors as well. But this will also be a message driven direct-to-consumer in the same way that you see all the other type 2 products. Go on, Jereme, you might have a bit to add to that, too. \nJereme Sylvain: Yes. You asked the question about the sales force. And Kevin certainly pointed to Stelo as a big part of the sales force and expanding the TAM. And so one of the reasons to expand is exactly, as Kevin said, there's a massive opportunity there. However, there's also a massive opportunity in our existing markets. G7 is a wonderful product. G6 is a wonderful product. There's coverage continuing to expand as well in those categories. And so expanding the sales force also allows us to cover more in that category.  \n And that code of category continues to do incredibly well. We had a record new patient quarter this quarter. And so you can expect to see really growth on both ends of that as a result of the expansion of that sales force. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to talk about the leverage we saw down the P&L. It was pretty impressive. It will be by like 150 bps on operating margin. So just wanted to see how we should think about gross margin progression, operating margin progression throughout the year, I saw the reiterated guidance but just trying to think about cadence, especially in light of the Stelo launch and the key drivers of that upside in the quarter and how we should think about that moving through the year? \nJereme Sylvain: Yes. Sure, Robbie. Thanks for the question. The way to think about gross margin and is that of course over the course of the year, we talked -- when we set guidance that this was going to look a little bit like a more typical year. And in a more typical year, you generally see 300 to 400 basis points of expansion over the course of the year. And that's what I'd expect to see over the course of this year.\n A lot happened last year with the transition from G6 to G7. It's not a typical year. We had a new manufacturing facility coming online. But as you kind of go back into years prior to that, you see that sort of cadence. That's how we're thinking about it, at least over the course of the year right now. And so that gives you some context for that cadence from an op margin perspective or at least an OpEx spend perspective, we've already made the investment in the sales force. And so that you see playing through in the first quarter. And to your point, you saw some nice leverage in the first quarter.  \n We will be making investments, further investments in Japan here as we go live in the second quarter, and that will play out over the course of the year. And then obviously, associated with the launch of Stelo over the course of the summer, we'll be making investments there. So while we won't get the same leverage that you ultimately saw in the first quarter over the balance of the year. You should expect some leverage over the course of the year, and that ultimately contributes down to what you'd see as an expansion of op margin despite a gross margin guide, that's about a bit of a click back from the prior year. So that's the way to think about it.  \n In terms of the over performance in the Q1, I think you're alluding to the beat in terms of op margin. I think the takeaway here is it's an encouraging sign for us. We've demonstrated over the past few years, we can drive leverage into this business. This year is no exception. All of the efforts that we've been talking about in prior years continue. However, it's a little early to change how we're thinking about the full year first quarter. And as you mentioned, a nice start to the first quarter, and we'll keep you updated on progress as the year progresses. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Kevin, I'd love to ask about Stelo. So I heard your comments about the e-commerce website. Why an e-commerce website as opposed to pharmacies and retail. Maybe talk about how you see utilization playing out. And I know the indication is only for type 2 oral patients, but do you see an opportunity beyond type 2 oral patients such as prediabetes and health-conscious people maybe down the road? \nKevin Sayer: I'll start with the end and go back to the website. That product is labeled for people not on insulin. It's not necessarily labeled just for people with diabetes. We designed the experience to focus more on those with type 2 diabetes because we believe there's a very, very strong unmet need and a product tailored to that solution, we think can do very well.\n We believe people will be interested who don't have diabetes and will, in fact, use it and will purchase it. But the focus out of the gate is in this marketplace where people have a direct need. Over time, we definitely see this platform and features in our software, migrating towards those other markets. We just wanted to get started here first. With respect to the website and the reason we've gone with this direct distribution model, we've had great success with it launching products in some of the international markets as we've rolled Dexcom ONE out. So we do know how to do this.  \n Second of all, we want a little bit of control when the launch when we start. We want to understand what's going on. We want to track utilization patterns. We want to see how this goes, and we felt this was the most efficient way to do it. And as you go back to my comments, I said initially, we will launch in this program. I think as this gets bigger, we'll seek other distribution channels, if it's more efficient to get more product to people.  \n We are very well positioned, and we've done a lot of work setting this website up and then the distribution process will be extremely efficient. So we're not concerned about being overrun right now, we're in a really good position to get this product to the people that want it through the website that we've set up. \nJereme Sylvain: Yes. And then to your question on utilization, Larry. It's going to be a little bit of everything. I think there's going to be some users that do use it full time. I think some folks will use it intermittently. That's based on our market research. Our market research is basically has -- for the most part, indicated, once folks are on this product, they want to use it. And I think we've run studies where there was a high either utilization while in study and a high request to continue utilization post study. That all being said, as we think about modeling, we want to make sure we're prudent in doing so. And so we have a variety of utilization patterns that we'll ultimately put out there.  \n So I think expect a little bit of everything. That population is so big, you'll get, I think, a grab bag of everything. Fortunately, we always are surprised to the positive on how often folks want to wear these things. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Congrats on the quarter. With a 15-day Stelo out in the market, what are the steps to bringing a 15-day sensor onto the G6 or G7 platform? And what are the economics of moving to that time frame? \nKevin Sayer: Yes. First of all, there won't be any G6 15-day. We're not going to spend any more money on G6. I can assure you of that. One of the reasons we're launching Stelo with 15 days and our current G7 platform is to learn its performance in this type of environment. As we've talked earlier, we have a level of performance reliability and expectations of our customers. We wanted to make sure we delivered those, and we felt more comfortable at 10 days to start.  \n We have numerous clinical efforts in R&D efforts to move the platform to 15 days for all the G7 product and including Dexcom ONE+ in our international markets at some point in time. As we've said in our guidance and what we've done that's not anticipated for 2024, but it's certainly anticipated not long after that. So you'll hear and see more about that over time. \n The economics are quite simple. You're selling 2 sensors over a 30-day period rather than 3. So we can see a significant margin pickup as long as we have the proper reliability on the other side because if you're shipping a sensor in a FedEx box, replace one that doesn't work, you've lost all your economies of scale anyway. So we're not only looking at 15 days, making it reliable.  \n We're looking very hard at offering the maximum most efficient customer experience for individuals when we go to 15-day. So they're ready. And so this delivers what we've always delivered because one of our -- and our CSAT scores and as we survey our customers, one of the things that we always hear about is how much people value that experience and the support that we give them. So it's a combination of all those things. But scientifically, we're well down the road to having a 15-day product. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird. \nJeffrey Johnson: So wanted to ask on basal. Just any visibility you can give on how that's been scaling. Obviously, a record new start quarter this quarter. I would assume basal's contributing nicely to that. But what are the sequential patterns the last few quarters? Is it still sequentially growing at a pretty healthy rate, I'd assume, but any color you can provide there? And also, there's been some debate, obviously, on market share within the basal population here in the U.S. Just would love kind of any insight you can provide on that front as well. \nKevin Sayer: Yes. So, I take that one. Thanks, Jeff. I think when we talked about what we expected this year, we really talked about it in the context of basal adoption across the entire population. And we talked about exiting the year right around that 15% adoption across the basal population in the U.S. and the year moving over the course of the year to 23%. So about 8 points of penetration.  \n So far through the first quarter, things are growing as we expected. Record new patients, I think, helps enforce that. And you are correct, a good chunk of our new patients are coming through that basal channel, and we continue to see really well performance in that category. \n So qualitatively, the things we talked about, the excitement in that channel, those still remain. In terms of share taking and how we look at that category, we get script data, we look at script data based on pathology. The debate -- there's no debate internally to us. We know we're taking share and we see that data. And I think a lot of you guys see that data. So for what it's worth, that data is out there, you can see the scripts continuing to come our way.  \n For the for the purpose we talked about, when we have coverage and when we compete head-to-head, we've typically won. So I think we maybe disagree with some comments out there. But I think the data is clear. When you look at the script data, I think it will continue to demonstrate where this is going over time. I hope that helps. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. \nJayson Bedford: Just on Stelo. Kevin, you mentioned getting it out quickly, but you're not launching it until the summer and certainly don't mean to be impatient, but just outside of the sales force training, maybe the e-commerce setup. What else are you doing to prep for the launch? And then just does the FDA need to approve anything else? I'm thinking of an app or the like before you launch? \nKevin Sayer: No, we have full FDA approval for launch. It has been our experience over time at Dexcom. When we get a very rapid approval, we tend to become very impatient and we launch very quickly. And we've -- from time to time, actually put ourselves in a bind by going out as quickly as we have. We had a launch plan for this product anticipating an FDA approval when it was going to come, and we're going to stick to the launch plan that we have. \n We have manufacturing schedule. We have lines set up. We have both. We have everything, packaging, everything that we need ready to go, but we're going to stick to the plan that we have. We believe our timing is good, and there's no need to rush anything. And so we're sticking to what we have, and we're comfortable with it. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Margaret Andrew with William Blair. \nMargaret Kaczor: I wanted to hit something, Kevin, I think you had said earlier in your commentary that you're seeing growing coverage in plans for patients earlier in their care. So I just wanted to know if you're referencing basal, which obviously, we've heard about, is it not insulin prediabetics, nondiabetics, maybe things that are less traditional, these 3 things about that. And then why -- and then as it relates to Stelo, obviously [indiscernible]. But just any sense of the number of people that have proactively reached out on your website right now to buy the product from the launch. \nKevin Sayer: Well, we haven't anybody reached out to buy it because we haven't offered it for sale, but we certainly have a lot of inquiries. And again, as you go to media impressions, articles, interviews and solicit things like that Stelo has been the biggest offering that we've had as far as news. And as our reps walk into primary care doctor offices, I just spent a bunch of time with several of our field team members. That's the question in the minute they walk in the door, when am I going to see Stelo.  \n And when I was in -- at ATTD, it was interesting, many of the physicians came up to me and said, how does Stelo affect me in my practice. So there is a lot of interest and there is a lot of buzz on that. As far as using CGM earlier in treatment, we're certainly seeing that with basal. We're seeing that as somebody goes on basal insulin, like you go on basal insulin, you just as well use a sensor to know how this is affecting your body so you can learn and so we can titrate your basal insulin the way it needs to be, and we're looking at product offerings and software enhancements to make that experience better.  \n But even in the type 1 population, Margaret, you now see kids leave the hospital with their Dexcom. They get diagnosed. They go to the hospital. And again, I talked with someone this morning even, the 6-year-old was diagnosed and left the hospital wearing at Dexcom because there's no way they were told they can manage this disease without it. So we have definitely become a product and an offering that comes into play very, very quickly.  \n I also think we see, particularly if there's coverage with somebody with type 2 diabetes, who is not using insulin. Physicians knows that patient can get it, they'll et it to them and use this as a teaching aid, as tool to help these people manage their conditions. Across the board, CGM is becoming used earlier in treatment over and over again. \nJereme Sylvain: Yes. And Margaret, this is one of the reasons why when we -- last year, we think we talked a little bit about this, is we introduced a cash pay option on our G-Series. One of the reasons in doing so is, as Kevin alluded to, really across the spectrum of managing your diabetes. There's been more interest. And so those plans that do have pockets that do cover everybody with diabetes and the cash pay option have -- there has been some uptake there, certainly not a majority of our uptake and certainly not the materiality of our customer base, but the interest is there.  \n And so you continue to see that taking place. It's why we're so bullish on Stelo. Back to Kevin's point, why there's so much inbound interest in that product. So hopefully, that gives you some context. There's a groundswell of attention to this and rightfully so it can help a lot of people. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Matt Taylor with Jefferies. \nMatthew Taylor: I wanted to ask you kind of a combined question when you were talking about moving earlier in the treatment paradigms and also with Stelo coming on. And obviously, you've got plans to try to broaden coverage and having these conversations with payers about how that may benefit patients. So the question is really, are you seeing signs from the payers that you could actually get coverage for the G-Series and/or for Stelo in some other format this year, basically earlier in the treatment paradigm than basal. And how long do you think it will take to get any kind of coverage [ officially for Stelo ]? \nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So it's a fair question. There are some plans out there that actually do cover really all folks with diabetes -- it's not a majority of plans, but these plans have seen early on the value of CGM as a lifestyle change, a preventative tool and something that ultimately yields results back to the system. And it's the same economics we've talked to you about before. And so some plans have done that. Again, it's not the majority. \n In terms of your question, though, more broad coverage or how do we introduce that earlier. I don't think we expect that to expand significantly this year. Certainly plan by plan, you get wins here and there. But those aren't the majority of the national formularies at this point. And so I think the work has to continue to take place. \n I think one of the reasons why we did want to get Stelo out there is because the data that's going to come off in addition to all the clinical trials that are underway, the clinical work that's underway that we consistently do along with our partner organizations having that real-world data, I think, will be really helpful and then demonstrating to payers and employers, why this is a good tool to ultimately improve health and reduce costs at the end of the day. \n So I don't expect it in 2024. If you asked us for the time line, Kevin has been very clear the 2- to 3-year window, we think it takes to do so. We're highly incentivized to go quickly. Nevertheless, it's something we'll continue to work on and keep you posted on our progress as we make progress. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Mathew Blackman with Stifel. \nMathew Blackman: Can you here me okay? \nKevin Sayer: Yes. \nMathew Blackman: Okay, great. Maybe, Jereme, this question's for you. I know you're not going to give me a precision here, but I'll ask anyway. Just on G7, where are we even in the roughest sense in terms of the mix of the installed base? And I guess the more important question is what's the tipping point for gross margin accretion in terms of G7 mix. Is that something we hit this year? Is that part of the quarter-over-quarter potential improvement to get you to the full year guide? Or is that something that happens further out and is AID integration a key component of that ramp? \nJereme Sylvain: Yes. So it's -- here's my expectations. The way we're tracking, and again, it's going to depend on how things play out over the course of the year. But we are tracking to a point where G7 as a percentage of our overall sales will eventually move ahead of G6. And I expect that here over the coming quarters in 2024. So that is moving. \n And it's really started to -- it started moving obviously at the back half of last year and having someone to your point, the AID integration was very helpful for the base. So that is happening, and it is the reason for some of the leverage in the back half of the year. As G7 starts to be the primary product, the economies of scale start to kick in, and that's where you start to see the cost come below G6. \n And so that could happen this year and it very well could happen as we move over. It's going to depend on what at the velocity at which we move. I will tell you, Q1 was a very strong velocity in movement. In terms of new patients coming in, and I think you guys can see it in the scripts, a majority of new patients are already moving to G7. So the great news, it's not a matter of if, it's when. And so it's really on converting that base. So I think the long way to answer, yes, some of the leverage this year in gross margin is because we do expect G7 to be the majority of product. When it gets lower, it's going to be kind of a timing thing. We don't have an exact date. But at the velocity we're going, it's happening very quickly, and it should be a good guide. And AID will play a large part of it. \n It's already started with our Tandem base. I know we're talking about Insulet coming up here pretty soon. Excited about both of those opportunities and converting that base. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Shagun Singh with RBC. \nShagun Singh Chadha: So U.S. growth was pretty strong at 24% year-over-year, but it was roughly in line with expectations. And so I'm wondering if you can elaborate on pricing. And I know that's been a big for you guys. What were trends year-over-year and sequentially? And then on Stelo pricing, is it fair to assume more in line with cash pay similar to what your competitor has indicated. \nKevin Sayer: Stelo pricing, I'll start with, and then Jereme can jump into the other. Stelo pricing is going to be competitive. We've got a number of models we're considering. We said we'd bring you more information on that on the next call at ADA and that's when you'll hear more of it. But we'll be very competitive with other cash offerings when we launch Stelo. \nJereme Sylvain: Yes. And then to your question on Q1 in terms of pricing dynamics, the pricing dynamics are stable. We don't have a lot of contracts year-over-year that are changing and when we do have those contracts, in general, the pricing headwinds, we do have that typical medical device headwind that's continued to play out. So that is stable. \n The one thing you do see as you get into the start of the year and benefits reset is we do see a lot of our new patients coming through the pharmacy channel. \n We still have a very strong DME business, and certainly, the DME business continues to be supported by our partners very, very well. But what we find is as we call on more and more primary care physicians who are seeing where basal patients are seen, there is a bit of a heavier tilt towards the pharmacy channel for new patients. Again, the base is pretty stable. \n So what you do find is as you think about the mix, you do get a little bit more running through that channel given where the predominance of our new patients are coming from. I don't -- we don't call that price. It's pretty consistent year-over-year. but it is helpful to understand those dynamics. It's not anything new, but it's something just to continue to be mindful of as we move into a new year. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. \nMatthew O'Brien: Jereme, it sounds like you have a little bit of a cold, so hope you feel better. When I look at the stock in the aftermarket, it's down about 8%. You just had your easiest top of the quarter -- or of the year, sorry. And then the rest of the year just assumes a pretty nice acceleration throughout the course of the year off of tougher comps. Even when you do it on a 2 year stack basis, it's still more than you just put up in Q1. I know Japan is going to be a little bit of a tailwind. You've got a broader sales force now, but those guys take time to kick in. \n Stelo is not going to really kick in until Q3, probably more like Q4. So just why the confidence in being able to hit kind of the midpoint of the guidance range for the remainder of the year, just given some of these dynamics? \nJereme Sylvain: Yes, sure. I'm happy to provide that, Matt, and thanks for the wishes on the cold. I was trying to impress you with my deep voice, I guess that didn't work. In terms of how the confidence on the year. One of the things that, as we go into a quarter, we try to set a base case. And the base case has risking around things like competitors, things like adoption in the basal base, things like what we would do in terms of channel mix and pricing internationally expansion. And while we said Japan was going to launch, you have to be mindful of that, talking about basal coverage and adoption outside the U.S. \n All of those go into as you set ranges for base cases. And as some of those get knocked down, we feel much more confident about raising the base case. And so that's the reason why we ultimately did it. We feel more confident in the base case as a floor. And so we certainly felt good there. \n We haven't talked about it yet, but I think one of the things we are really excited about is in France, we've submitted our final paperwork for Dexcom ONE+ to launch with what we expect is basal coverage in the coming months. And so we talked about it. It was something we thought was coming. \n We knew it was coming, but it was one of those things that we needed to make sure we did the appropriate steps. And so as we start to derisk it, that's one thing. In Germany, we have wonderful basal coverage there, or shouldn't say wonderful, for the small population that's agreed to it. But that's a wonderful start for us. In terms of now saying, well, there is a pocket of payers in Germany, albeit small that do have basal coverage. It's a wonderful progression for us. And we are the leader in terms of basal coverage in Germany right now. \n And so these are the things that help derisk the year that hopefully give you guys a little bit more confidence in that base case, certainly, it gives us confidence in that base case. And that's why when we come out and feel comfortable moving that up. it's that confidence that we have in that base case. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Marie Thibault with BTIG. \nMarie Thibault: I wanted to ask a question here on Japan. It certainly sounds like you have really broad favorable coverage for all people with using insulin. So I want to understand where was penetration into that market with your distributor partner and what have been the barriers? What have really been the hurdles? And what are you going to do to -- try to attack those? \nKevin Sayer: Our penetration with our partner was next to very small. Japan has not been a big market for us in spite of the great coverage that has just come out, which is why we've gone direct and our distributor partner and us have gone our separate ways. \n We've had this experience in several geographies over the years. In those geographies where we acquire a distributor and existing infrastructure like we did in Australia, like we did many years ago in Germany, we get out of the gate very quickly, and we can grow a market very fast because we have an infrastructure already in place. \n With respect to Japan, it's like some of the other geographies, we're starting from scratch, similar to how we -- like we're doing in France, for example, we're starting from scratch in France on our own.  It will take us a while to build that growth engine and build that dynamic in Japan. I think what held us back more than anything else is we just didn't have enough infrastructure and in all fairness, our distributor did well is most important for their business in their own minds. And there wasn't that commitment and that drive there. \n There will be that commitment and drive going forward, but it's going to take a while to build it. It's not going to happen overnight. We're very confident. We've hired a team that can develop the relationships necessary. Japan is very much a market driven by physician and hospital decisions. We think what we've got, certainly, from a leadership perspective, a team that can build those relationships and do the things that they need to do, but it can take a little while. \n As I'm talking to you -- as we're talking to you years from now, I have every expectation that's going to be a very large market for us, but we'll be very successful there. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Bill  Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. \nWilliam Plovanic: Just I was wondering if you could just comment on attrition rates, reorder rates. What have you seen with the transition to G7 from G6. And then how do we think about this in the different patient populations as we get out of the IIT patients and into the basal hypo than eventually in non using. \nJereme Sylvain: Yes, it's a question we've asked ourselves quite a bit. So I'm happy to give you our thoughts on it. From G6 to G7, we've seen a relatively consistent rate. There hasn't been much of a change in terms of retention utilization across those 2 products. And that's as expected as we upgrade folks from one to the other. Obviously, we think the G7 experience is wonderful, but so is the G6 experience, and we pride ourselves on the experiences that we offer. So that's been relatively consistent. \n What we've also found to date, and I think it's important to start to date, is that there isn't really as much of a difference in the populations we've served across our -- across those folks on our products today. We find that there's only really one category where retention and utilization is markedly different, and it's those on AID systems. Everybody else seems to follow a pretty similar pattern of retention and utilization. And I say that to date because we are moving into new populations, we are moving more into basal. We are moving it more into non-insulin-using population, albeit still a smaller part of our user base. \n And the hypothesis has always been we expect a high utilization in those spaces. We've always been positively surprised, but we are aware that as you move down the acuity curve, there is the potential opportunity for folks to use it, maybe a little bit less. That being said, we haven't seen it to date, but we'll keep you posted as we're moving through what we're seeing. To help you guys kind of get your arms around it, Kevin? \nKevin Sayer: Yes. And I would add, as we head into nonintensive insulin therapy, we think there could be a number of outcomes here. And there could be a number of use cases for people. One of the reasons to maintain our distribution on our own website to start with is to begin to understand those patterns and to understand what the purchasing patterns, how many people prefer the subscription model versus individual onetime purchases. And how often do they come back and then use our tools to find out what the experience is like, what they like and what they didn't. \n The other thing I would add with respect to retention and attrition, one of our biggest barriers, particularly back in the day, was the copays of the first quarter when everybody was in the DME world now that we have pharmacy coverage, that barrier has been eliminated a bit. And that's not as big a reason as to why we lose a customer at this point in time. It used to be in the past. We've been very successful in working that dynamic. The flip side is our DME patients have very strong retention rates and very strong utilization patterns because of the attention our fine distributors pay to them. So it's a mix of everything, Bill, but I think we're in a good spot. \n We will learn in the nonintensive insulin therapy world and figure out how to build product offerings to maximize our experience with those users. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. \nMichael Polark: I wanted to ask on one of your sales force comments, Kevin. I heard about the expansion faster and higher quality talent than expected. Those folks are hitting street in 2Q. I got that. I also heard about a new team upgraded structure, and it didn't quite follow what you're doing there and why it's impactful. So if you could unpack that update for me, I'd appreciate it. \nKevin Sayer: Yes. As we look out over what we need to accomplish and where we needed more emphasis in the field, there are a couple of things happen. Number one, we realized as we had our reps who are calling on high prescribers also calling on a number of people who weren't prescribers are doing a bunch of -- going and finding new prescribers that we may not be paying enough attention to our high prescribers. And so as we've set things up, we do have a set of folks who spend more time in the endocrinology and high-prescribing diabetologists world than with primary care. \n At the same time, we needed people to call on more primary care physicians. Consistently, we have learned over and over again that what we call on people, we win. And so we need to call on more folks get more people out there. We've been much more aggressive with our sampling program over the past several months. We need to get samples to more individuals. We need to knock on more doors and have more relationships. \n A third element of that is education. As we get to some of these offices where we have somebody who's only written 2 or 3 CGM scripts, we've always had certainly some account managers who are regional people use to help train patients if they don't have [ doctor ] training in the office. We made a little more investment there. \n And then last, there are many doctors, particularly as we get to sell and as we get more into the primary care world who may not even see a rep. And so we do have more of an internal sales force, and again, on a regional basis to do more of that work. So we're trying to go broader and deeper at the same time, deeper with our high prescribers in the endocrinology world and then broader across all aspects of primary care, including training and supporting patients. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. \nSteven Lichtman: I wanted to ask about the non-insulin [ hypoglyic ] risk group, which obviously does have coverage now and I think you've estimated before is about the same size as basal. Are the sales force expansion and moves you're making that you just alluded to, Kevin, in the commercial organization, helping with those education efforts? Any updates overall you could provide on sort of where you're at sort of tapping this opportunity would be great. \nKevin Sayer: Yes. And thanks for the question. You're right. It's a big opportunity for us, but it is one that has taken a little bit more time. Obviously, the focus is on basal with a known quantity, but the hypoglycemia unawareness or the severe hypoglycemia event, I should say, those are harder to educate folks. And so to your point, One of the things that we've done and Teri and her team have really focused on is really creating the educational materials and then arming the sales force accordingly to get out there. \n And so if you have a situation where we are expanding our sales force and reaching broader and touch points, where a lot of these folks are seeing, right? \n They're seen really across the gamut of the health care spectrum. That expansion does allow us to get out there and educate more. But the biggest challenge is the education. It doesn't come to top of mind for individuals and prescribers that when this event takes place, I qualify. And that's just some more work we're going to have to continue to do on education. Again, more touch points, a good thing and the team is working hard at that. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Kevin, you mentioned that you'll have numerous iterations of Stelo over the course of the first 24 months of launch. And I wanted to just see if there's any other color you can provide on those iterations and the mostly are going to be on the software side? Or is one of the iterations going to be an increase in the rate of sensors lasting the full 15 days? And how important is that expansion to the success of Stelo. \nKevin Sayer: Well, we always work on sensor performance optimization, and we have a very, very strong program on that across the board. And Stelo on the G7 platform. So anything we do with G7 certainly can apply to Stelo. With respect to changes that we make, I think I can go back to what I said about G7. We literally had a software iteration every month since we launched G7 and we brought several new features into G7. \n We expect a similar ramp with Stelo once we launch it, and we have a number of features on a road map over the next 12 months that we would add to it from a software perspective, particularly as we learn what engages people as we start. \n But we've been very vague and we'll remain vague about the features we're going to have at launch and those that we're going to add for competitive reasons. We're just not going to give everybody else a road map. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Matt Miksic with Barclays. \nMatthew Miksic: Kevin, I just wanted to maybe go back also to some of the comments you made earlier in the call on the Stelo approval and kind of maintaining the time line for the launch. If you could just talk -- you said things like I want to make sure our manufacturing capacity is there and don't want to sort of rush the launch post approval. \n It would be also great to understand just given the excitement about what this product could mean outside of the diabetes community, how you're thinking about prioritizing like supply and resources and business development, market development between those 2 opportunities going forward? \nKevin Sayer: Well, again, I appreciate that. And again, we're going to stick to our launch timing here. We have made great investments. We are ready to go. We're on our schedule. We're on our plan. And we're ready to launch to ready when we launch it. Our approval timing was very rapid. We gave the FDA tremendous credit for working through us with that. And our team, great credit for doing a wonderful submission. They did a great job to be able to get where we got so quickly.\n But we're going to stick to that time frame. And we think one of the reasons this will be successful is we will have everything lined up and ready to go the way it's supposed to be when we launch it. In all fairness, I've lived through many product launches here. And every time we go too early, I end up dealing with 3 day -- I'm saying I because everybody is in my office with 3 days inventory and what are you going to do? \n We are devoting the proper resources. We have several G7 manufacturing lines in Malaysia. That factory just came up this summer. We manufacture G7 here in Arizona as well. So we've got plenty of G7 capacity, and we will be running those lines and we have lines dedicated to Stelo and we'll go there. But we're going to stick to our plan. We're very comfortable with it. We'll be ready to go when it's time. \nJereme Sylvain: Yes. We think about resource allocation. There's obviously a combination of resources, which is what Kevin referred to as supply. And that's absolutely something we have the capacity to go after it. But in terms of resource allocation, then on the support, right? \n And what do we do from a sales and marketing and where do the resources go, we're making the decision that really, quite frankly, are in the best interest of returns to the company and then serving the unmet need. So expect us to continue to look at that accordingly. One of the things we are doing this year, and I think you can see we've made it a priority is as we go through the organization and drive efficiencies, it allows us to reinvest in the business. \n And all those efficiencies we've been able to get and working through leverage in the business, has allowed us to do all the work we're doing around Stelo, which includes all of our launch plans. So we'll continue to do the robust work that we do around resource allocation, really important. It's really important for us to do so in order to continue to scale, but also to scale efficiently and appropriately. \nOperator: And we will take our final question from Mike Kratky with Leerink Partners. \nMichael Kratky: How are you thinking about the possibility of seeing additional pricing pressure for G7 as one of your competitors start to [ seeing ] AID integration, which has historically been part of your value proposition for payers. \nKevin Sayer: Well, again, that's also on a geographical basis in the U.S., we're very comfortable with our pricing, our pricing contracts. That's been very consistent over the course of several years. When you look at the product offerings in AID world and if you compare what we have to offer, we offer a number of features that make our offering much superior to anything else that's going to be out there.\n With Dexcom patients can connect to 3 devices at the same time. They have the share follow system. They connect to the phone, they can connect to a pump. They can now connect directly to Apple Watch. We're very comfortable with our pricing position here over time. And our pricing is set up in our U.S. contracts regardless of whether it's AID or people who use sensors without it. \n Certainly, if we go to the tender system in Europe, there's a 2-tiered system in many countries. We offer the Dexcom ONE product at a lower price point to be able to address those who aren't on AID systems. And our AID pricing in those countries, we have prices set for G7 that are set in the tender process. So we're very comfortable with where we are in those as well. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Sayer for closing remarks. \nKevin Sayer: Thanks, everybody, for participating on our call today. This really was a great quarter for Dexcom, and we continue to drive the most important innovations in our industry. We're continuing to widen the gap between Dexcom and our competitors by driving more firsts in our CGM user experience, particularly in the G7 platform. Direct-to-watch has been the most requested addition to our experience ever since we launched G5 many years ago and now it's here. \n Our users are going to be able to, as I just articulated, have an incredibly discrete experience with CGM on an Apple Watch only, and that will include all of our shared follow system as well. So imagine, again, a parent who wants to send their kid to school without a phone, they will be able to do everything on a watch, what they used to be able to do on their phone. Access to CGM on a global basis continues to expand. We're very well positioned with our product portfolio to win these opportunities. \n And last, I'll just talk a bit about Stelo. We went from a December filing with the FDA on Stelo to a March approval for the first over-the-counter CGM product platform in the United States. This is going to greatly enhance the lives of many, many people, and we'll learn so much about it during this launch in 2024, we will be very well positioned in '25 in years going forward. \n And let's not forget the theme of this call, we continue to deliver outstanding worldwide top line growth, continued strong operating margin expansion. At the same time, we have not at all skimped on investing in our future products in R&D, and we have a very strong commitment to creating the scale necessary to drive this business where it needs to get and pursue all of our opportunities. Thanks, everybody, and we appreciate your support on the call today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin Sayer",
            "content": "Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we reported another great quarter for Dexcom with first quarter organic revenue growth of 25% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Demand for Dexcom CGM remains very high as customers continue to recognize and value our leading product performance and differentiated user experience.  \n While it has only been a year since the launch of G7 in the U.S., we have seen a significant shift in the landscape over that time. We have attracted tens of thousands of new prescribers to our ecosystem, meaningfully improved our presence within primary care and experienced growing demand from people with diabetes who are benefiting from significant expansions and coverage over the last year. Much of this momentum can be directly attributed to our product performance and innovative features.  \n With the launch of G7, we extended our leadership in sensor accuracy and took a significant step forward in ease of use. We also introduced a new software ecosystem, which was designed to improve our user experience and drive high levels of customer engagement and retention. Importantly, we have continued to enhance the G7 experience with ongoing improvements to both the hardware and software platforms. In fact, we have completed software updates almost monthly since the launch of G7, introducing new features, upgrading performance and connectivity and most recently establishing the ability to integrate insulin data into our app.  \n These are great examples of how our new software architecture enables much faster innovation. We are constantly working to advance the customer experience and reinforce Dexcom as the technology leader in this space. Along those lines, we were very excited to receive clearance by the FDA for our direct-to-watch feature for G7 in the first quarter. This approval will allow our customers to use their Apple Watch as a primary display rather than connecting through their mobile phone, providing even greater flexibility in how and where they interact with their glucose data.  \n This added to our long list of industry first as G7 is the first FDA-cleared CGM that can communicate directly from sensor to watch. To enable this, we built a robust connectivity infrastructure into the design of G7 with the ability to connect to 3 different Bluetooth devices at the same time, our customers can simultaneously connect to a phone, a pump or receiver and a watch. Dexcom is the only CGM system that gives customers these options.  \n We have received great feedback since we launched our direct-to-watch software in the U.K. and Ireland and look forward to extending it to additional markets shortly. Features like these add to our standing as the innovator in the CGM industry, strengthening our sensor platform as global access and awareness continue to expand.  \n As a reminder, we recently crossed the 1-year mark since the Landmark CMS decision to expand coverage for all people using insulin and certain non-insulin using individuals that struggle with hypoglycemia. This decision paved the way for greater commercial coverage for these populations, further strengthening our position as the most covered CGM in the U.S. It also served to broaden our conversations with payers. While payers have long recognized Dexcom's ability to help titrate insulin, there is now a growing appreciation for our ability to drive better outcomes through behavior change and customer engagement.  \n There is also a growing awareness of these benefits in the clinical community with much broader coverage now available, many physicians have started incorporating Dexcom CGM earlier into their customer care plans. They recognize lifestyle management as a cornerstone of the diabetes care and metabolic health landscapes and see CGM as a core tool to drive behavior alongside new drug therapies like GLP-1s. To that point, in the second quarter, we will be launching a medication logging module and activity integration tool within the G7 app to help those using Dexcom CGM with these therapies.  \n While this has helped us significantly expand our prescriber base over the past year, we are still only scratching the surface of this sizable opportunity. There are over 200,000 primary care physicians in the U.S. who treat tens of millions of people with diabetes. There remains a clear opportunity for us to deepen our presence within this channel as we work to drive even greater care for their patients. As a result, we announced an expansion of our sales force this past quarter. We were blown away by the level of interest and the quality of talent that we were able to attract for these roles.  \n By the end of the first quarter, we had already completed our hiring and trained these new reps. This team is excited to hit the ground running, and we look forward to seeing them build momentum over the course of the year. As part of this initiative, beginning in the second quarter, we are also taking steps to optimize the structure of our sales team to be most effective with our call points across endocrinologists and primary care physicians as well as leading practitioners in maternal-fetal medicine.  \n We expect our new team in this upgraded structure to help us better capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead. Along those lines, we hit another significant milestone in our company's history with the FDA's clearance of our newest product, Stelo, the first glucose biosensor approved for use without a prescription in the U.S., recognizing a significant unmet need for the 25 million people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin or at risk of severe hypoglycemia, we developed Stelo as a more tailored solution for this population and work closely with the FDA to simplify access to this product.  \n By removing the burden of a prescription, we expect Stelo to drive broad interest from both the clinical community and directly from members of the diabetes community who want to better understand their blood sugar. In our dialogue with the FDA, it became clear that iCGM accuracy remain critically important in establishing this new sensor category, both as a safety measure and to ensure that our customers are receiving reliable, actionable information. Stelo will leverage the industry-leading accuracy of our G7 sensor hardware while providing a custom software experience to more directly meet the needs of those not taking insulin.  \n We're on track to launch Stelo this summer as a 15-day cash pay product. We'll continue to build our case with payers for broader coverage. Stelo will be fulfilled initially via a brand-new e-commerce website and available in onetime purchases or subscription models. We look forward to providing greater detail on Stelo features, including pricing, immediately before launch, and we'll share further updates on our go-to-market strategy and ordering process at ADA and on our second quarter earnings call.  \n In our international business, we also advanced some key strategic initiatives this past quarter. In February, we officially launched Dexcom ONE+ into 8 European markets. which is our first step in moving our entire Dexcom ONE product line into the G7 form factor. This transition brings several of the G7 technological benefits to this customer base, such as the smaller form factor, shorter warm-up time and improved accuracy and further simplifies the prescribing process for physicians.  \n Moving to a shared hardware platform also benefits our cost structure over time as it allows us to drive greater volume to our G7 lines and more quickly reach scale. We also completed our transition to a direct sales model in Japan, enabling us to begin commercial operations at the start of the second quarter. As a reminder, this is one of the only markets in the world with coverage for all people using insulin, which represents over 1 million people.  \n Despite this, market penetration remains in its early stages and we see a significant opportunity to drive greater uptake in Dexcom's CGM share. As a result, we believe Japan could become a key growth driver for us over time as we strengthen our presence in this market in the coming quarters. This is an incredibly exciting time for us. There will be a lot to learn with the launch of Stelo and we are thrilled to once again pioneer the CGM industry with a new subset of users. We look forward to sharing more updates with you as we begin this journey.  \n With that, I will turn it over to Jereme for a review of the first quarter financials. Jereme? Well, thank you for the question. And it's been every bit as exciting for us as has been -- as you can imagine, Danielle, we have had more media impressions and inquiries and buzz about Stelo from the outside than really anything we've ever done. It's been spectacular. We're very excited for it. \n The way it expands our access as we thought through this, there's 25 million people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin or who don't suffer from severe hypoglycemia. We wanted to get that product out quickly and make it very accessible to them. We studied this. We spent a lot of time thinking about it. The best way to do that is to eliminate the prescription process and not to have them in the middle of that for physicians. And that's also helpful for the health care providers because they don't have to call the pharmacy and do prescriptions as well.  \n So the key to this and particularly in getting to a lot of people is to make this very easy to obtain. And that's why we went over-the-counter with it. At the same time, as I said in my remarks, we're thrilled with the labeling and the fact that we still have iCGM controls around this sensor by going over-the-counter, we didn't just open the floodgates for everybody to come in. You still have to have an incredibly good product to go do something like this. So we think we have a very, very good advantage there.  \n With respect to our sales expansion, I made a couple of comments about the expansion and positioning of the sales force. We know for a fact that when we have coverage in the physician arena when we call on doctors, we do extremely well. And so as we repositioned our sales force, I talked about repositioning between endocrinology, primary care and also the maternal and fetal medicine markets as well. \n We've repositioned our group to whereby our -- we have specialists who spend more time in the endocrinology offices and with high prescribers, not so much with those who don't prescribe a lot. And a lot of the new adds, a lot of the expansion relates to primary care, where they will talk about Stelo with primary care doctors who see almost all of the type 2 patients who aren't on insulin.  \n So by expanding this way, we believe we'll be able to have more coverage with physicians as well. And so they will take that message out and talk with the doctors as well. But this will also be a message driven direct-to-consumer in the same way that you see all the other type 2 products. Go on, Jereme, you might have a bit to add to that, too. I'll start with the end and go back to the website. That product is labeled for people not on insulin. It's not necessarily labeled just for people with diabetes. We designed the experience to focus more on those with type 2 diabetes because we believe there's a very, very strong unmet need and a product tailored to that solution, we think can do very well.\n We believe people will be interested who don't have diabetes and will, in fact, use it and will purchase it. But the focus out of the gate is in this marketplace where people have a direct need. Over time, we definitely see this platform and features in our software, migrating towards those other markets. We just wanted to get started here first. With respect to the website and the reason we've gone with this direct distribution model, we've had great success with it launching products in some of the international markets as we've rolled Dexcom ONE out. So we do know how to do this.  \n Second of all, we want a little bit of control when the launch when we start. We want to understand what's going on. We want to track utilization patterns. We want to see how this goes, and we felt this was the most efficient way to do it. And as you go back to my comments, I said initially, we will launch in this program. I think as this gets bigger, we'll seek other distribution channels, if it's more efficient to get more product to people.  \n We are very well positioned, and we've done a lot of work setting this website up and then the distribution process will be extremely efficient. So we're not concerned about being overrun right now, we're in a really good position to get this product to the people that want it through the website that we've set up. Yes. First of all, there won't be any G6 15-day. We're not going to spend any more money on G6. I can assure you of that. One of the reasons we're launching Stelo with 15 days and our current G7 platform is to learn its performance in this type of environment. As we've talked earlier, we have a level of performance reliability and expectations of our customers. We wanted to make sure we delivered those, and we felt more comfortable at 10 days to start.  \n We have numerous clinical efforts in R&D efforts to move the platform to 15 days for all the G7 product and including Dexcom ONE+ in our international markets at some point in time. As we've said in our guidance and what we've done that's not anticipated for 2024, but it's certainly anticipated not long after that. So you'll hear and see more about that over time. \n The economics are quite simple. You're selling 2 sensors over a 30-day period rather than 3. So we can see a significant margin pickup as long as we have the proper reliability on the other side because if you're shipping a sensor in a FedEx box, replace one that doesn't work, you've lost all your economies of scale anyway. So we're not only looking at 15 days, making it reliable.  \n We're looking very hard at offering the maximum most efficient customer experience for individuals when we go to 15-day. So they're ready. And so this delivers what we've always delivered because one of our -- and our CSAT scores and as we survey our customers, one of the things that we always hear about is how much people value that experience and the support that we give them. So it's a combination of all those things. But scientifically, we're well down the road to having a 15-day product. Yes. So, I take that one. Thanks, Jeff. I think when we talked about what we expected this year, we really talked about it in the context of basal adoption across the entire population. And we talked about exiting the year right around that 15% adoption across the basal population in the U.S. and the year moving over the course of the year to 23%. So about 8 points of penetration.  \n So far through the first quarter, things are growing as we expected. Record new patients, I think, helps enforce that. And you are correct, a good chunk of our new patients are coming through that basal channel, and we continue to see really well performance in that category. \n So qualitatively, the things we talked about, the excitement in that channel, those still remain. In terms of share taking and how we look at that category, we get script data, we look at script data based on pathology. The debate -- there's no debate internally to us. We know we're taking share and we see that data. And I think a lot of you guys see that data. So for what it's worth, that data is out there, you can see the scripts continuing to come our way.  \n For the for the purpose we talked about, when we have coverage and when we compete head-to-head, we've typically won. So I think we maybe disagree with some comments out there. But I think the data is clear. When you look at the script data, I think it will continue to demonstrate where this is going over time. I hope that helps. No, we have full FDA approval for launch. It has been our experience over time at Dexcom. When we get a very rapid approval, we tend to become very impatient and we launch very quickly. And we've -- from time to time, actually put ourselves in a bind by going out as quickly as we have. We had a launch plan for this product anticipating an FDA approval when it was going to come, and we're going to stick to the launch plan that we have. \n We have manufacturing schedule. We have lines set up. We have both. We have everything, packaging, everything that we need ready to go, but we're going to stick to the plan that we have. We believe our timing is good, and there's no need to rush anything. And so we're sticking to what we have, and we're comfortable with it. Well, we haven't anybody reached out to buy it because we haven't offered it for sale, but we certainly have a lot of inquiries. And again, as you go to media impressions, articles, interviews and solicit things like that Stelo has been the biggest offering that we've had as far as news. And as our reps walk into primary care doctor offices, I just spent a bunch of time with several of our field team members. That's the question in the minute they walk in the door, when am I going to see Stelo.  \n And when I was in -- at ATTD, it was interesting, many of the physicians came up to me and said, how does Stelo affect me in my practice. So there is a lot of interest and there is a lot of buzz on that. As far as using CGM earlier in treatment, we're certainly seeing that with basal. We're seeing that as somebody goes on basal insulin, like you go on basal insulin, you just as well use a sensor to know how this is affecting your body so you can learn and so we can titrate your basal insulin the way it needs to be, and we're looking at product offerings and software enhancements to make that experience better.  \n But even in the type 1 population, Margaret, you now see kids leave the hospital with their Dexcom. They get diagnosed. They go to the hospital. And again, I talked with someone this morning even, the 6-year-old was diagnosed and left the hospital wearing at Dexcom because there's no way they were told they can manage this disease without it. So we have definitely become a product and an offering that comes into play very, very quickly.  \n I also think we see, particularly if there's coverage with somebody with type 2 diabetes, who is not using insulin. Physicians knows that patient can get it, they'll et it to them and use this as a teaching aid, as tool to help these people manage their conditions. Across the board, CGM is becoming used earlier in treatment over and over again. Yes. Stelo pricing, I'll start with, and then Jereme can jump into the other. Stelo pricing is going to be competitive. We've got a number of models we're considering. We said we'd bring you more information on that on the next call at ADA and that's when you'll hear more of it. But we'll be very competitive with other cash offerings when we launch Stelo. Our penetration with our partner was next to very small. Japan has not been a big market for us in spite of the great coverage that has just come out, which is why we've gone direct and our distributor partner and us have gone our separate ways. \n We've had this experience in several geographies over the years. In those geographies where we acquire a distributor and existing infrastructure like we did in Australia, like we did many years ago in Germany, we get out of the gate very quickly, and we can grow a market very fast because we have an infrastructure already in place. \n With respect to Japan, it's like some of the other geographies, we're starting from scratch, similar to how we -- like we're doing in France, for example, we're starting from scratch in France on our own.  It will take us a while to build that growth engine and build that dynamic in Japan. I think what held us back more than anything else is we just didn't have enough infrastructure and in all fairness, our distributor did well is most important for their business in their own minds. And there wasn't that commitment and that drive there. \n There will be that commitment and drive going forward, but it's going to take a while to build it. It's not going to happen overnight. We're very confident. We've hired a team that can develop the relationships necessary. Japan is very much a market driven by physician and hospital decisions. We think what we've got, certainly, from a leadership perspective, a team that can build those relationships and do the things that they need to do, but it can take a little while. \n As I'm talking to you -- as we're talking to you years from now, I have every expectation that's going to be a very large market for us, but we'll be very successful there. Yes. And I would add, as we head into nonintensive insulin therapy, we think there could be a number of outcomes here. And there could be a number of use cases for people. One of the reasons to maintain our distribution on our own website to start with is to begin to understand those patterns and to understand what the purchasing patterns, how many people prefer the subscription model versus individual onetime purchases. And how often do they come back and then use our tools to find out what the experience is like, what they like and what they didn't. \n The other thing I would add with respect to retention and attrition, one of our biggest barriers, particularly back in the day, was the copays of the first quarter when everybody was in the DME world now that we have pharmacy coverage, that barrier has been eliminated a bit. And that's not as big a reason as to why we lose a customer at this point in time. It used to be in the past. We've been very successful in working that dynamic. The flip side is our DME patients have very strong retention rates and very strong utilization patterns because of the attention our fine distributors pay to them. So it's a mix of everything, Bill, but I think we're in a good spot. \n We will learn in the nonintensive insulin therapy world and figure out how to build product offerings to maximize our experience with those users. Yes. As we look out over what we need to accomplish and where we needed more emphasis in the field, there are a couple of things happen. Number one, we realized as we had our reps who are calling on high prescribers also calling on a number of people who weren't prescribers are doing a bunch of -- going and finding new prescribers that we may not be paying enough attention to our high prescribers. And so as we've set things up, we do have a set of folks who spend more time in the endocrinology and high-prescribing diabetologists world than with primary care. \n At the same time, we needed people to call on more primary care physicians. Consistently, we have learned over and over again that what we call on people, we win. And so we need to call on more folks get more people out there. We've been much more aggressive with our sampling program over the past several months. We need to get samples to more individuals. We need to knock on more doors and have more relationships. \n A third element of that is education. As we get to some of these offices where we have somebody who's only written 2 or 3 CGM scripts, we've always had certainly some account managers who are regional people use to help train patients if they don't have [ doctor ] training in the office. We made a little more investment there. \n And then last, there are many doctors, particularly as we get to sell and as we get more into the primary care world who may not even see a rep. And so we do have more of an internal sales force, and again, on a regional basis to do more of that work. So we're trying to go broader and deeper at the same time, deeper with our high prescribers in the endocrinology world and then broader across all aspects of primary care, including training and supporting patients. Yes. And thanks for the question. You're right. It's a big opportunity for us, but it is one that has taken a little bit more time. Obviously, the focus is on basal with a known quantity, but the hypoglycemia unawareness or the severe hypoglycemia event, I should say, those are harder to educate folks. And so to your point, One of the things that we've done and Teri and her team have really focused on is really creating the educational materials and then arming the sales force accordingly to get out there. \n And so if you have a situation where we are expanding our sales force and reaching broader and touch points, where a lot of these folks are seeing, right? \n They're seen really across the gamut of the health care spectrum. That expansion does allow us to get out there and educate more. But the biggest challenge is the education. It doesn't come to top of mind for individuals and prescribers that when this event takes place, I qualify. And that's just some more work we're going to have to continue to do on education. Again, more touch points, a good thing and the team is working hard at that. Well, we always work on sensor performance optimization, and we have a very, very strong program on that across the board. And Stelo on the G7 platform. So anything we do with G7 certainly can apply to Stelo. With respect to changes that we make, I think I can go back to what I said about G7. We literally had a software iteration every month since we launched G7 and we brought several new features into G7. \n We expect a similar ramp with Stelo once we launch it, and we have a number of features on a road map over the next 12 months that we would add to it from a software perspective, particularly as we learn what engages people as we start. \n But we've been very vague and we'll remain vague about the features we're going to have at launch and those that we're going to add for competitive reasons. We're just not going to give everybody else a road map. Well, again, I appreciate that. And again, we're going to stick to our launch timing here. We have made great investments. We are ready to go. We're on our schedule. We're on our plan. And we're ready to launch to ready when we launch it. Our approval timing was very rapid. We gave the FDA tremendous credit for working through us with that. And our team, great credit for doing a wonderful submission. They did a great job to be able to get where we got so quickly.\n But we're going to stick to that time frame. And we think one of the reasons this will be successful is we will have everything lined up and ready to go the way it's supposed to be when we launch it. In all fairness, I've lived through many product launches here. And every time we go too early, I end up dealing with 3 day -- I'm saying I because everybody is in my office with 3 days inventory and what are you going to do? \n We are devoting the proper resources. We have several G7 manufacturing lines in Malaysia. That factory just came up this summer. We manufacture G7 here in Arizona as well. So we've got plenty of G7 capacity, and we will be running those lines and we have lines dedicated to Stelo and we'll go there. But we're going to stick to our plan. We're very comfortable with it. We'll be ready to go when it's time. Well, again, that's also on a geographical basis in the U.S., we're very comfortable with our pricing, our pricing contracts. That's been very consistent over the course of several years. When you look at the product offerings in AID world and if you compare what we have to offer, we offer a number of features that make our offering much superior to anything else that's going to be out there.\n With Dexcom patients can connect to 3 devices at the same time. They have the share follow system. They connect to the phone, they can connect to a pump. They can now connect directly to Apple Watch. We're very comfortable with our pricing position here over time. And our pricing is set up in our U.S. contracts regardless of whether it's AID or people who use sensors without it. \n Certainly, if we go to the tender system in Europe, there's a 2-tiered system in many countries. We offer the Dexcom ONE product at a lower price point to be able to address those who aren't on AID systems. And our AID pricing in those countries, we have prices set for G7 that are set in the tender process. So we're very comfortable with where we are in those as well. Thanks, everybody, for participating on our call today. This really was a great quarter for Dexcom, and we continue to drive the most important innovations in our industry. We're continuing to widen the gap between Dexcom and our competitors by driving more firsts in our CGM user experience, particularly in the G7 platform. Direct-to-watch has been the most requested addition to our experience ever since we launched G5 many years ago and now it's here. \n Our users are going to be able to, as I just articulated, have an incredibly discrete experience with CGM on an Apple Watch only, and that will include all of our shared follow system as well. So imagine, again, a parent who wants to send their kid to school without a phone, they will be able to do everything on a watch, what they used to be able to do on their phone. Access to CGM on a global basis continues to expand. We're very well positioned with our product portfolio to win these opportunities. \n And last, I'll just talk a bit about Stelo. We went from a December filing with the FDA on Stelo to a March approval for the first over-the-counter CGM product platform in the United States. This is going to greatly enhance the lives of many, many people, and we'll learn so much about it during this launch in 2024, we will be very well positioned in '25 in years going forward. \n And let's not forget the theme of this call, we continue to deliver outstanding worldwide top line growth, continued strong operating margin expansion. At the same time, we have not at all skimped on investing in our future products in R&D, and we have a very strong commitment to creating the scale necessary to drive this business where it needs to get and pursue all of our opportunities. Thanks, everybody, and we appreciate your support on the call today."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin.  As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the first quarter of 2024, we reported worldwide revenue of $921 million compared to $741 million for the first quarter of 2023, representing growth of 24% on a reported basis and 25% on an organic basis.\n As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange in addition to our non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $653 million for the first quarter compared to $526 million in the first quarter of 2023, representing growth of 24%. Our recent momentum in the U.S. continued this quarter as we again benefited from the largest expansion of reimbursed coverage in our company's history.  \n This led to another quarter of significant new customer demand in the U.S. and contributed to our record new start quarter globally. As Kevin mentioned, we are excited to build on this momentum with our expanded sales force and look forward to seeing the new team ramp up in the months ahead. International revenue grew 24%, totaling $268 million in the first quarter. International organic revenue growth was 26% for the first quarter. We executed very well across our international footprint and again took market share this quarter, benefiting from our targeted access expansion and product portfolio strategy.  \n We delivered a particularly strong quarter in our core European markets, which more than offset the pause in growth from Japan as we finalized its transition to direct sales. Our first quarter gross profit was $569 million or 61.8% of revenue compared to 63.4% of revenue in the first quarter of 2023. \n This gross margin result was in line with our expectations as G7 continues to become a larger part of our product mix. As a reminder, G7 carries a lower margin than G6 today. So we expect this to change in the coming quarters as we drive more volume through our G7 lines in the U.S. and Malaysia.  \n Between continued G7 demand, our pump integrations and moving Dexcom ONE to the G7 platform, we continue to see more of our base moving to the G7 form factor. Operating expenses were $428.9 million for Q1 of 2024 compared to $391.2 million in Q1 of 2023. This quarter was another demonstration of our ability to generate significant operating leverage as we grow. In fact, we grew our revenue at more than double the rate of operating expenses in the first quarter, resulting in more than 600 basis points of OpEx leverage compared to the first quarter of 2023.  \n Operating income was $140.2 million or 15.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2024 and compared to $78.6 million or 10.6% of revenue in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $220.9 million or 24% of revenue for the first quarter compared to $145.9 million or 19.7% of revenue for the first quarter of 2023. Net income for the first quarter was $128.2 million or $0.32 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the back of nearly doubling our free cash flow year-over-year.  \n This provides us significant flexibility to both support our organic growth opportunities and assess any strategic uses of capital. From a capacity perspective, we remain in a great position with Malaysia quickly scaling and we are further diversifying our footprint with the build-out of our Ireland facility. This leaves us well positioned to support our near-term growth opportunities, including the highly anticipated launch of Stelo this summer. \n Turning to guidance. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance with an updated range of $4.20 billion to $4.35 billion, representing organic growth of 17% to 21% for the year. For margins, we are reaffirming our prior full year guidance of non-GAAP gross profit margin in a range of 63% to 64%, non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 29%.  \n With that, we can open up the call for Q&A. Sean? Yes. You asked the question about the sales force. And Kevin certainly pointed to Stelo as a big part of the sales force and expanding the TAM. And so one of the reasons to expand is exactly, as Kevin said, there's a massive opportunity there. However, there's also a massive opportunity in our existing markets. G7 is a wonderful product. G6 is a wonderful product. There's coverage continuing to expand as well in those categories. And so expanding the sales force also allows us to cover more in that category.  \n And that code of category continues to do incredibly well. We had a record new patient quarter this quarter. And so you can expect to see really growth on both ends of that as a result of the expansion of that sales force. Yes. Sure, Robbie. Thanks for the question. The way to think about gross margin and is that of course over the course of the year, we talked -- when we set guidance that this was going to look a little bit like a more typical year. And in a more typical year, you generally see 300 to 400 basis points of expansion over the course of the year. And that's what I'd expect to see over the course of this year.\n A lot happened last year with the transition from G6 to G7. It's not a typical year. We had a new manufacturing facility coming online. But as you kind of go back into years prior to that, you see that sort of cadence. That's how we're thinking about it, at least over the course of the year right now. And so that gives you some context for that cadence from an op margin perspective or at least an OpEx spend perspective, we've already made the investment in the sales force. And so that you see playing through in the first quarter. And to your point, you saw some nice leverage in the first quarter.  \n We will be making investments, further investments in Japan here as we go live in the second quarter, and that will play out over the course of the year. And then obviously, associated with the launch of Stelo over the course of the summer, we'll be making investments there. So while we won't get the same leverage that you ultimately saw in the first quarter over the balance of the year. You should expect some leverage over the course of the year, and that ultimately contributes down to what you'd see as an expansion of op margin despite a gross margin guide, that's about a bit of a click back from the prior year. So that's the way to think about it.  \n In terms of the over performance in the Q1, I think you're alluding to the beat in terms of op margin. I think the takeaway here is it's an encouraging sign for us. We've demonstrated over the past few years, we can drive leverage into this business. This year is no exception. All of the efforts that we've been talking about in prior years continue. However, it's a little early to change how we're thinking about the full year first quarter. And as you mentioned, a nice start to the first quarter, and we'll keep you updated on progress as the year progresses. Yes. And then to your question on utilization, Larry. It's going to be a little bit of everything. I think there's going to be some users that do use it full time. I think some folks will use it intermittently. That's based on our market research. Our market research is basically has -- for the most part, indicated, once folks are on this product, they want to use it. And I think we've run studies where there was a high either utilization while in study and a high request to continue utilization post study. That all being said, as we think about modeling, we want to make sure we're prudent in doing so. And so we have a variety of utilization patterns that we'll ultimately put out there.  \n So I think expect a little bit of everything. That population is so big, you'll get, I think, a grab bag of everything. Fortunately, we always are surprised to the positive on how often folks want to wear these things. Yes. And Margaret, this is one of the reasons why when we -- last year, we think we talked a little bit about this, is we introduced a cash pay option on our G-Series. One of the reasons in doing so is, as Kevin alluded to, really across the spectrum of managing your diabetes. There's been more interest. And so those plans that do have pockets that do cover everybody with diabetes and the cash pay option have -- there has been some uptake there, certainly not a majority of our uptake and certainly not the materiality of our customer base, but the interest is there.  \n And so you continue to see that taking place. It's why we're so bullish on Stelo. Back to Kevin's point, why there's so much inbound interest in that product. So hopefully, that gives you some context. There's a groundswell of attention to this and rightfully so it can help a lot of people. Yes. So it's a fair question. There are some plans out there that actually do cover really all folks with diabetes -- it's not a majority of plans, but these plans have seen early on the value of CGM as a lifestyle change, a preventative tool and something that ultimately yields results back to the system. And it's the same economics we've talked to you about before. And so some plans have done that. Again, it's not the majority. \n In terms of your question, though, more broad coverage or how do we introduce that earlier. I don't think we expect that to expand significantly this year. Certainly plan by plan, you get wins here and there. But those aren't the majority of the national formularies at this point. And so I think the work has to continue to take place. \n I think one of the reasons why we did want to get Stelo out there is because the data that's going to come off in addition to all the clinical trials that are underway, the clinical work that's underway that we consistently do along with our partner organizations having that real-world data, I think, will be really helpful and then demonstrating to payers and employers, why this is a good tool to ultimately improve health and reduce costs at the end of the day. \n So I don't expect it in 2024. If you asked us for the time line, Kevin has been very clear the 2- to 3-year window, we think it takes to do so. We're highly incentivized to go quickly. Nevertheless, it's something we'll continue to work on and keep you posted on our progress as we make progress. Yes. So it's -- here's my expectations. The way we're tracking, and again, it's going to depend on how things play out over the course of the year. But we are tracking to a point where G7 as a percentage of our overall sales will eventually move ahead of G6. And I expect that here over the coming quarters in 2024. So that is moving. \n And it's really started to -- it started moving obviously at the back half of last year and having someone to your point, the AID integration was very helpful for the base. So that is happening, and it is the reason for some of the leverage in the back half of the year. As G7 starts to be the primary product, the economies of scale start to kick in, and that's where you start to see the cost come below G6. \n And so that could happen this year and it very well could happen as we move over. It's going to depend on what at the velocity at which we move. I will tell you, Q1 was a very strong velocity in movement. In terms of new patients coming in, and I think you guys can see it in the scripts, a majority of new patients are already moving to G7. So the great news, it's not a matter of if, it's when. And so it's really on converting that base. So I think the long way to answer, yes, some of the leverage this year in gross margin is because we do expect G7 to be the majority of product. When it gets lower, it's going to be kind of a timing thing. We don't have an exact date. But at the velocity we're going, it's happening very quickly, and it should be a good guide. And AID will play a large part of it. \n It's already started with our Tandem base. I know we're talking about Insulet coming up here pretty soon. Excited about both of those opportunities and converting that base. Yes. And then to your question on Q1 in terms of pricing dynamics, the pricing dynamics are stable. We don't have a lot of contracts year-over-year that are changing and when we do have those contracts, in general, the pricing headwinds, we do have that typical medical device headwind that's continued to play out. So that is stable. \n The one thing you do see as you get into the start of the year and benefits reset is we do see a lot of our new patients coming through the pharmacy channel. \n We still have a very strong DME business, and certainly, the DME business continues to be supported by our partners very, very well. But what we find is as we call on more and more primary care physicians who are seeing where basal patients are seen, there is a bit of a heavier tilt towards the pharmacy channel for new patients. Again, the base is pretty stable. \n So what you do find is as you think about the mix, you do get a little bit more running through that channel given where the predominance of our new patients are coming from. I don't -- we don't call that price. It's pretty consistent year-over-year. but it is helpful to understand those dynamics. It's not anything new, but it's something just to continue to be mindful of as we move into a new year. Yes, sure. I'm happy to provide that, Matt, and thanks for the wishes on the cold. I was trying to impress you with my deep voice, I guess that didn't work. In terms of how the confidence on the year. One of the things that, as we go into a quarter, we try to set a base case. And the base case has risking around things like competitors, things like adoption in the basal base, things like what we would do in terms of channel mix and pricing internationally expansion. And while we said Japan was going to launch, you have to be mindful of that, talking about basal coverage and adoption outside the U.S. \n All of those go into as you set ranges for base cases. And as some of those get knocked down, we feel much more confident about raising the base case. And so that's the reason why we ultimately did it. We feel more confident in the base case as a floor. And so we certainly felt good there. \n We haven't talked about it yet, but I think one of the things we are really excited about is in France, we've submitted our final paperwork for Dexcom ONE+ to launch with what we expect is basal coverage in the coming months. And so we talked about it. It was something we thought was coming. \n We knew it was coming, but it was one of those things that we needed to make sure we did the appropriate steps. And so as we start to derisk it, that's one thing. In Germany, we have wonderful basal coverage there, or shouldn't say wonderful, for the small population that's agreed to it. But that's a wonderful start for us. In terms of now saying, well, there is a pocket of payers in Germany, albeit small that do have basal coverage. It's a wonderful progression for us. And we are the leader in terms of basal coverage in Germany right now. \n And so these are the things that help derisk the year that hopefully give you guys a little bit more confidence in that base case, certainly, it gives us confidence in that base case. And that's why when we come out and feel comfortable moving that up. it's that confidence that we have in that base case. Yes, it's a question we've asked ourselves quite a bit. So I'm happy to give you our thoughts on it. From G6 to G7, we've seen a relatively consistent rate. There hasn't been much of a change in terms of retention utilization across those 2 products. And that's as expected as we upgrade folks from one to the other. Obviously, we think the G7 experience is wonderful, but so is the G6 experience, and we pride ourselves on the experiences that we offer. So that's been relatively consistent. \n What we've also found to date, and I think it's important to start to date, is that there isn't really as much of a difference in the populations we've served across our -- across those folks on our products today. We find that there's only really one category where retention and utilization is markedly different, and it's those on AID systems. Everybody else seems to follow a pretty similar pattern of retention and utilization. And I say that to date because we are moving into new populations, we are moving more into basal. We are moving it more into non-insulin-using population, albeit still a smaller part of our user base. \n And the hypothesis has always been we expect a high utilization in those spaces. We've always been positively surprised, but we are aware that as you move down the acuity curve, there is the potential opportunity for folks to use it, maybe a little bit less. That being said, we haven't seen it to date, but we'll keep you posted as we're moving through what we're seeing. To help you guys kind of get your arms around it, Kevin? Yes. We think about resource allocation. There's obviously a combination of resources, which is what Kevin referred to as supply. And that's absolutely something we have the capacity to go after it. But in terms of resource allocation, then on the support, right? \n And what do we do from a sales and marketing and where do the resources go, we're making the decision that really, quite frankly, are in the best interest of returns to the company and then serving the unmet need. So expect us to continue to look at that accordingly. One of the things we are doing this year, and I think you can see we've made it a priority is as we go through the organization and drive efficiencies, it allows us to reinvest in the business. \n And all those efficiencies we've been able to get and working through leverage in the business, has allowed us to do all the work we're doing around Stelo, which includes all of our launch plans. So we'll continue to do the robust work that we do around resource allocation, really important. It's really important for us to do so in order to continue to scale, but also to scale efficiently and appropriately."
