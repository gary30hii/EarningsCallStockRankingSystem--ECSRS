With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation's, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the fourth quarter 2020 as well as answer any questions that you might have. The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially and the company cautions to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP.\n Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Gigi. And good afternoon to everyone and welcome to Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter and Full 2020 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonz\u00e1lez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member.\n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during these trying times. In today's call, we will begin with an update on the measures we have taken to keep COVID-19 at bay. We will then review the copper market and Southern Copper's key results for production, sales, operating costs, financial results and expansion projects. Subsequently, we will open the session for questions.\n In 2020, Southern Copper faced the challenges of the pandemic with resilience, innovation and solidarity. The new normal that the virus has imposed in the world requires governments, companies and society to assume joint responsibility to protect citizens as we resume growth, generate value and fuel economic recovery. \n When COVID-19 reared its head in early 2020, Southern Copper moved quickly to preserve the health of its workers, their families and the communities in the countries where we operate. The company is committed to guaranteeing safe work environments and has developed lines of action to prevent transmission, strengthen community outreach and bolster capacities for medical response.\n In Mexico, a special budget was allotted to properly equip health personnel and support care functions in COVID hospitals. The company used these funds to donate almost 0.5 million protection equipment kits, 139 artificial support ventilators and 500 noninvasive ventilators to hospitals in different states around Mexico, as well as an important number of medical supplies such as monitors, beds and resuscitation carts. Hundreds of portable sinks for handwashing were installed and a company facility in Sonora was conditioned with dozens of beds for COVID patients with mild to moderate symptoms. \n In Peru, the company set up 18 temporary hospitals with a total of 250 COVID beds and provided each facility with oxygen supplies. In addition, the company donated 318,000 liters of liquid oxygen to public hospitals in the regions of Moquegua and Arequipa and set up 2 oxygen plants in the Tacna and Puno regions with capacities of 720 cubic meters and 222 cubic meters per day, respectively. \n To ensure the timely detection of COVID-19 cases and stop chains of contagion, a PCR lab test was donated in Moquegua. Additionally, medical equipment was donated to health care professionals, application of serology or PCR tests is now a standard procedure, which is key to stopping contagion at its tracks.\n Southern Copper has supported the most vulnerable populations in both Mexico and Peru by distributing thousands of food bags and continues to funnel outreach through its permanent community programs. Our top priority is to roll out solidarity-based efforts with the communities in our areas of influence to work together to stem the pandemic and its impact. In this regard, the company has mounted intense communication campaigns to educate the population about the prevention and hygiene measures recommended by health authorities and to provide psychological support for families throughout the online counseling and workshops. \n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the London Metal Exchange Copper price averaged $3.25 per pound, that is 21.7% higher than the price that we had in the fourth quarter of 2019. As of today, we are seeing prices a little bit over $3.60 per pound, which boasts a positive outlook for the 2021 copper market. We believe the following factors are influencing the copper market. A worldwide recovery in copper demand for industrial uses, driven mainly by a sustained recovery in economic activity in China and other Asian economies as well as the European auto industry.\n Regarding China, it should be also noted that copper scrap imports dropped 48% in the last 10 months of 2020, which led to a subsequent increase in Chinese consumption of refined copper. The combined inventories of the London Metal Exchange, COMEX and Shanghai and bonded warehouses close 2020 at their lowest levels since December 2014. Given the current market outlook for supply and demand, we have a positive view for this year and for the long-term evolution of the copper market. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2020. Copper represented 82% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2020. Copper production registered an increase of 1.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and situated at 259,744 tons in the fourth quarter or in the past quarter. This was primarily due to an increase in production at our Cuajone mine, attributable to higher ore grades and recoveries as well as higher production at the Buenavista mine due to an increase in the tonnage processed by concentrate. This effect was partially offset by lower production at our Toquepala mine due to lower ore grades. \n For the year 2020, copper production topped 1 million tons and represented a new milestone in the company's history. This represented a 0.8% increase with regard to 2019 production and was primarily due to higher production at our Cuajone mine, which was attributable to higher ore grades and recoveries. And to growth in production at both the La Caridad and the IMMSA mines in Mexico. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in production at the Toquepala and Buenavista mines, mainly due to lower ore grades. \n For 2021 and 2022 for the next -- this year and the next one, we expect to produce a little bit north of 943,000 tons of copper. This year's production will be affected by a temporary reduction in ore grade and recoveries, at the Peruvian operations. We expect our copper production to recover by 2023, reaching 1,031,000 tons of production as we get the Peruvian production back on track and generate new production on our projects of Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista Zinc concentrate. We believe 2023 will mark a new inflection point for new production as we aim to produce 1.9 million tons by 2028 by developing the following organic growth projects, all of them fully owned by us. \n For Mexico, we have Pilares that is expected to initiate production in -- early in 2022 with a capacity of 35,000 tons. El Pilar will increase our production by 2023, with a capacity of 35,500 tons of copper. El Arco, a major greenfield project in the Baja California, Peninsula, is expected to get into operation in 2028 with a contribution of 245,000 tons of copper. And the Buenavista Zinc concentrator is expected to produce 149,000 tons of zinc by 2023 and 20,000 -- I'm sorry, 28,000 tons of copper. These add 343,000 tons of new production from our Mexican operations.\n At the Peruvian ones, growth will come from new organic projects. We expect that the start-up dates and production -- are as follows: Tia Maria, we expect to initiate production by 2024 with 120,000 tons of refined copper production per year; Los Chancas is expected to initiate operations by 2027 with a capacity of 180,000 tons of copper; Michiquillay for 2028 with a capacity of 225,000 tons. These projects will add 525,000 tons of new production from Peru. These volumes, combined with our additional Mexican production, will put us in good shape to reach our long-term goal of producing 1.9 million tons by 2028.\n It should be noticed that our strong by-product base will increase as we add new copper volumes to our operations. As such, we expect to produce for 40,500 tons of molybdenum by 2028, 23.9 million ounces of silver by 2023 and 29.1 million ounces of silver by 2028. For zinc, we expect to produce 149,000 tons of zinc by 2023, and over 207,000 tons of zinc by 2028. As you can see, we're confident that our company will keep generating value for our shareholders through our organic growth base. In the meantime, we will be open to other possibilities to enhance value creation for our shareholders. \n For molybdenum, it represented 6.7% of the company's sales value in the fourth quarter of 2020, and it is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $8.93 per pound in the past quarter compared to $9.49 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is a 5.9% price reduction. \n In 2020, we produced 30,248 tons of molybdenum, an increase of 12.5% in production. This compares to the volume that we had in 2019. But the mention and production of 2020 is 30,248 tons. It's a new company record. This significant achievement was principally due to additional production from our Peruvian operations of Toquepala and Cuajone. Molybdenum production decreased by 4.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter of 2019, mainly due to lower production at our Buenavista and Toquepala mines because of lower grades and recoveries. This was partially offset by lower production at our Cuajone and Caridad mines due to higher grades and recoveries. In 2021, we expect to produce 26,800 tons of molybdenum, which represents a decrease of 11.3% over our 2020 production level.\n Silver represented 5.4% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of 2020, with an average price of $24.5 per ounce in the quarter. Up 41.9% from the same quarter of 2019. Silver is currently our second by-product. In 2020, we produced 21.5 million ounces of silver, an increase of 6.2% in production from 2019 and another company record. \n For the fourth quarter of 2020, mined silver production decreased by 4.5% from the same period of 2019 after production fell at Buenavista, Toquepala and IMMSA. This was partially offset by a 15.2% increase in production at the San Martin mine and higher production at the La Caridad and Cuajone mines.\n Refined silver production increased by 22.9% in the fourth quarter of last year due to higher production at La Caridad and IMMSA. In 2021, we expect to produce 21.4 million ounces of silver, in line with last year's production. \n Zinc represented 3.1% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of 2020, with an average price of $1.19 per pound in the quarter, a 10.2% increase from the fourth quarter of 2019. Zinc mine production decreased 17.7% quarter-on-quarter to situate at 16,763 tons. This was primarily due to the shutdown of our Santa Eulalia operation in the first quarter of 2020 due to a severe flooding. These negative variances in zinc production were partially offset by a production increase of 30.6% of zinc production at the San Martin mine. Refined zinc production decreased by 5.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\n For the year 2020, we produced 68,930 tons of zinc, a decrease of 6.8% with regard to 2019 and was mainly driven by the mentioned shutdown of the Santa Eulalia operation. The highly significant 150.7% increase in production at the San Martin mine was nonetheless insufficient to offset the aforementioned decrease. For 2021, we expect to produce 76,200 tons of zinc, a 10.5% increase in production when compared to last year. \n Looking at our financial results. For the fourth quarter of 2020 sales were $2.4 billion, or $496.1 million higher than sales for the fourth quarter of 2019. This is a 26.7% increase in sales.\n Copper sales volume increased by 1.4% and value by 28.2%, in a scenario of substantially better price.\n Regarding our main by-products, we had higher sales of molybdenum, due to the effect of provisional sales price adjustment, which was partially offset by a decrease in volume. Zinc sales were up due to growth in volume and price. Silver sales rose by -- due to an increase in volume and price. Let me mention the variances in sales for the by-products. In the case of molybdenum, sales increased by 31.3%. For zinc, it was 8.7%. For silver, 41.4%.\n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $61.6 million or 5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The main cost increments has been for workers' participation, inventory consumption, lower capitalized leachable material, the exchange rate variance, depreciation and other factors. These cost increments were partially offset by a decrease in labor cost, operations contractors and the diesel and fuel costs. \n In the fourth quarter of 2020, the adjusted EBITDA was $1,254 million, which represented an increase of 59.4%. With regard to the $786.7 million, were used during fourth quarter of 2019. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of last year was situated at 53.3% versus 42.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, adjusted EBITDA was 11.4% higher than the one at the third quarter of 2020. \n For the year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $3,868.8 million or 9.7% higher than 2019's adjusted EBITDA.\n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.44 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n Excuse me for a second. This is -- I'll -- starting with cash flow. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.44 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2020. This is $0.08 higher than the value for the third quarter of 2020. This 5.9% increase in the operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost, which was partially offset by a decrease in treatment and refining charges, administrative expenses and higher refined product premiums. \n Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.672 per pound in the fourth quarter of last year. This cash cost was $0.027 higher than the cash cost of $0.645 for the third quarter of 2020. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $420 million or $0.763 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2020. These figures represent a 7.4% increase when compared with the credit of $374.3 million or $0.711 per pound that we have in the third quarter of last year. \n Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc and sulfuric acid, and have decreased for silver and gold.\n Net income of $590.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year reflected an increase of 93.1% over the same period of 2019. Net income margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 25.1% versus 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, net income was 16.6% higher than the figure reported in the third quarter of 2020. Net income for 2020 was $1,570.4 million, that is $5.7 million higher than the prior year. \n For capital investments, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. The conditions generated by COVID-19 has led us to implement measures to produce vulnerability at the project execution level. These measures, which are constantly under review, including forcing social distance rules, strengthening sanitation efforts and requiring quarantine periods for personnel. Some activities in the project execution stage that are located in regions in Peru or Mexico, where new cases of infections are on the rise, have experienced delays. Consequently, we expect some delays, albeit minimal, in the execution of our investment projects. Nevertheless, today, delays primarily affect construction activities that require people to work in close physical proximity. All other engineering, procurement and construction activities that entail limited interaction between personnel are on scale. \n For 2020, capital investments were $592.2 million, which represented 37.7% of net income. Our current portfolio of approved projects in Peru totaled $2.8 billion, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested. If we include the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion investment and Los Chancas $2.6 billion, with these 2 projects, our total investment program in Peru reflects a commitment of $7.9 billion. \n In the case of the Tia Maria project in Arequipa, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of Islay Province population. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We also have promoted agricultural and livestock activity in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.\n Given the current Peruvian economic situation, where the country is in a strong recession and urgently requiring new jobs, it is crucial to move ahead with projects that will stimulate a sustained growth size. We reiterate our view that the social conditions are appropriate for the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria. The project will generate significant economic opportunities for Islay Province and Arequipa region.\n As we have mentioned in prior reports, during the construction and operation phase, we will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during Tia Maria's construction phase. When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in Arequipa region via royalties and tax.\n We expect the Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economic recovery and consequently, take the necessary steps to provide SEC with adequate support to initiate construction.\n For our Mexican projects, let's start with the Buenavista Zinc project in Sonora. This project is located between the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering study and the detailed engineering study is 81% complete. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 have been put in place. Purchase orders have been placed for major equipment, some of which are currently being manufactured. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. We expect to initiate operations in 2023, as mentioned before, and when completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n The project Pilaris, also in Sonora, is located 6 kilometers from La Caridad. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate, a new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks is under construction and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers of the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining the 0.78% expected from Pilares, with 0.34% from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, and we expect the project to begin production in the first quarter of next year.\n El Pilar is another project that we have in the Sonora state in Mexico. This low capital intensity, copper greenfield project is strategically located in Sonora in Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.287%, which is actually a very good ore grade for copper oxide. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper catalyst. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million, and we expect the project to start production in 2023, with an average expected mine life of 13 years. The results from experimental paths in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery.\n In Mexico, we have also the project El Arco, which is in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico. This is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves of over 2.4 billion tons with an ore rate of 0.426%, and 0.3 billion tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.288%.\n Besides that, El Arco has by-products of gold, 0.11 grams per ton of mineral. The project includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to situate at 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 tons of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request environmental impact permits. We're currently in the final stage of land acquisition process for the project.\n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation for operations, capital investment plan and other financial needs at each board meeting, to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on January 21, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.60 per pound or per share of common stock payable on February 24 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 10 of this year. \n So with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Isabella Vasconcelos from Bradesco. \nIsabella Vasconcelos: I have just a couple of questions on the outflow for cost and also CapEx on a year-by-year basis for the next couple of years or the next 3 or 4 years, if you can mention if there were -- have been any changes to the outlook versus what you mentioned in the latest conference call, that will be great. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you for your question, Isabella. And yes, we have had some changes in our CapEx forecast. For this year, 2021, we expect to spend $1.4 billion in CapEx. For 2022, $2 billion. 2023, $2.2 billion. 2024, $2.3 billion. 2025, $2.2 billion. If you compare these figures with the ones that we have or the one that we reported last quarter, we have had a reduction in the figures. And the reason for that has been the rescaling of some of the capital expenditures for the projects, not that the projects haven't changed their budgets, but their -- the time line has spread a little bit over time. And that's why we are having a certain reduction in the CapEx forecast vis-\u00e0-vis last quarter. \nIsabella Vasconcelos: Great. Very clear. And in terms of cost? \nRaul Jacob: Cost? Cash cost? \nIsabella Vasconcelos: Yes. \nRaul Jacob: Well, I wish we could have all the year, the cash cost that we have -- we had for 2020, that was $0.69. But for this year, we're forecasting $0.89 per pound of cash cost. Should be remaining at about that level, $0.89, $0.90 per pound until we go into -- towards 2028, where we should have another -- well, a reduction in cash cost before by-products. Currently, we're expecting to have $1.66 per pound for this year on cash cost before credits. So credits are $0.77. That's our expectation. By the way, we're relatively conservative in the prices that we're using for by-products as well as for copper in our planning. And then it should trend a little bit up after 2022. But when we -- as we get the new production and new by-products coming into our operations, prices should tend to remain where they are or decrease a little bit under the $0.89, $0.90 per ton that I mentioned. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser, UBS. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Just a quick follow-up. I mean you were talking about production earlier, obviously. What are you seeing both in Peru and Mexico, but mainly in Peru, I mean, we've obviously seen some COVID cases rising both in Chile and Peru and many of the large copper-producing nations of the world. But you also mentioned on the last call that you were bringing a lot of people back on site. Is that still happening? Are you kind of back to full nameplate capacity operating at a higher utilization here? Or are you still keeping some personnel off-site that could end up weighing a bit on production? Basically, that's the question. And maybe a follow up also, like what's the kind of conversation you're having with local communities, governments about this? \nRaul Jacob: I couldn't get your second concern, Andreas. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Yes, sorry, just -- are you getting any pushback from local communities or governments about bringing people back on-site given that COVID cases are rising again? Or is that not really a problem in the areas that where you operate? That's the follow-up question. \nRaul Jacob: No. What we are -- we were making our personnel coming back to work the premises. But the recent information that we have on the COVID-19 second wave that is affecting -- well, Peru, in particular, and Mexico has also a very serious problem as we do right now here in Peru. And as a consequence of that, the company has backed off a little bit on bringing in personnel to the premises, where what we have done is reorganize again and maintain our workforce as safe as we can. In the case of most administrative labor, it's coming back to work at a remote, if it is possible. And in many, many cases, that can be done. And the same with the -- obviously, with the most stringent strict protocols for sanitary safety, it's happening at the operations.\n In Mexico. We're doing a similar -- following a similar strategy. But currently, our operations are fine. We're in track for -- with our plans. Certain measures and activities that we have made between -- through the COVID-19 cycle has been very helpful for us in order to control the disease inside our premises. I think that we're being very successful at that point, and that has helped us to operate. And keep in mind that these are activities that are very high capital intensive. Many workers are isolated significant time of the daily shift. And the reason for that is that if you, for instance, operate a major mining track or certain facilities, you are usually with very important equipment that has been under your operation, but alone. It's not -- some of the crews that are required to do certain repairs or certain specific works require certain proximity. And in these cases, we are taking specific measures to protect our workforce in both Mexico and Peru. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: That's very clear. That's very clear. And one follow-up question. You partly answered it on cost, but something you were talking about on the last call as well. I mean you guys have obviously managed to keep your cost very, very low at about $0.67 a pound on a net basis. But you were also talking a little bit about cost inflation on the last call and a little bit more material hardness and potentially lower grade, this sort of thing. Should we still expect some cost inflation going into this year on the back of that? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. And that's why I mentioned that our cash cost for 2021 is expected to be at $0.89 per pound. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Right. So that's mainly driven by material hardness and the other factors? \nRaul Jacob: Basically catching up on certain maintenance work, certain stripping that we could make, particularly at the Toquepala operation on the stripping, we could make the stripping at Toquepala and maintenance work that was postponed. For instance, certain activities that require a crew that work closely. Well, at the beginning of the pandemic, we believe that it was not a good idea. And we could postpone that for a while, so we did. But we have been doing -- catching up. And if you see our cash cost this past quarter, it has been slightly higher than the average for the year. And the reason for that is basically that we already initiated the catch-up work in the fourth quarter of 2020. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jens Spiess from Morgan Stanley. \nJens Spiess: Raul, it's Jens. Just one question. Could you please repeat the guidance for 2021 for copper, moly and silver please? And also, in your CapEx guidance, when are you assuming that Tia Maria starts construction? And in case that gets delayed, do you think you could accelerate any other of smaller projects? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Okay. If I got -- well, your first question is guidance on 2021 production, right? \nJens Spiess: Correct. Also for the by-products and the copper, yes. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. For copper, we're expecting to produce 943,000 tons, molybdenum 26,800, zinc 76,200, silver 21.4 million ounces. That's basically it.\n On the Tia Maria, well, the date that we're considering now is 2024 to initiate production. That means that we should be initiated construction in 2022. That's probably speaking what we're thinking. Now we -- the way that we see the Tia Maria circumstance right now is as follows. Generally speaking, we believe that the work that the company has had with the local communities has been very, very successful. We believe that there is much more back up for the project now than what it used to be. And actually, we believe that if we have the political support, the project could move on. But now for that, we also think that we need to have a government with the possibility of moving forward with the project. And we believe that for that to happen, we need to pass the current election time. The elections are scheduled for first round in April 11. And then in June 6, the second round where a new President should emerge from that second vote. And with that definition, I mean, new Congress, new executive branch we believe that we will have the political support that the project requires to move on.\n But now specifically answering to your question, Jens, well, yes, we could accelerate it because we are ready. We have all the economic facilities to initiate the construction right away. And we have studied the project in depth, and we believe that it's feasible to initiate the construction very quickly. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Grant Sporre from Bloomberg Intelligence. \nGrant Sporre: It's just a follow-up question on CapEx. So if we look out to 2028, you've got 3, well, I would say, fairly large greenfield projects due to sort of kick off 2027, 2028, each between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion. That implies that you sort of have to kick off construction probably 2025. So my question is twofold. In your sort of guidance for CapEx in 2024, $2.3 billion, how much have you earmarked for those big 3 greenfield projects?\n And secondly, it's quite unusual for even a company the size of yours to be initiating 3 greenfield projects at the same time. So I just want to know how you're going to manage the risk of doing that when the time comes? \nRaul Jacob: Thank you for your question, Grant. Let me -- okay, on the 2024, $2.3 billion budget that we have. For El Arco, we have $525 million in CapEx. For Tia Maria, $312 million. For Michiquillay, $436 million. And Los Chancas 69 -- $70 million for 2024. That's on the detail that you requested.\n Well, on the risk of managing the projects. These projects are evolving at different stages. For instance, in the case of Tia Maria, it's more like execution of all the engineering that has already been done, all the equipment selection that we already have identified, et cetera, et cetera. So it's more like moving forward with the construction, doing biddings. It's a different part of the process. In the case of Michiquillay, it will go most likely after we be with Los Chancas already in line and ready to go. \n And in the case of El Arco, it will be -- we'll initiate construction in 2022. If everything goes okay. So generally speaking, the stages that these projects have are slightly different in time. You will not get caught by all of them at the same time at certain tasks. Now what you are saying is, it's obviously a concern for us. But we believe that the company has shown through the years that we are -- we have a very strong engineering team. The company prides on the fact that we usefully finish our projects under budget and on time. So we think that we can handle it. But obviously, what you're indicating, it's a matter of concern because one of the risks that these projects may have eventually. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Declan Hanlon from Santander. \nDeclan Hanlon: My question has been answered. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Leopoldo Silva from LarrainVial. Our next question comes from the line of Jean Bruny from BBVA. \nJean Baptiste Bruny: Raul, just to come back very quickly on cash cost. I understand your target of $0.89 per pound for this year. Maybe if you're focusing on a quarterly basis, can we expect the inflation to be gradual? Or do you expect to reach that number of $0.89 very quickly this year?\n And the second question, again, on cash cost. You mentioned by-product revenues of [ 77 ] for this year using very cautious estimates in terms of the pricing of by-product. I know you don't give a precise number in terms of prices. But can we expect prices being stable from current levels are going slightly down by year-end? \nRaul Jacob: Well, more than cost inflation, what we are seeing is a catch-up in expenses. And that's why we are having also slightly lower ore grades at the Peruvian operations in this year and the next one. And the reason for that is that we will have -- we will be operating in certain areas of the mines where we didn't work last year. Last year, we focused basically on an area where we could get the mineral that was required to maintain our production level where we plan to do that under the COVID circumstance. \n Keep in mind that we operate at a certain point in time with about 40% of the labor force that we have. So it was certainly an emergency. And now we still have -- are facing the challenges of COVID. But at the same time, we have -- we are -- I think we managed to deal with this, with how to operate safe, with right sanitary level for our workforce. And do what we need to do in order to maintain a sound operation. So it's a catching up rather than inflation. Obviously, if you look at the fuel prices, yes, there has been some inflation on that, obviously. But more than that, I think it's a catching up in certain words. And that has a side consequence that we are having a much lower ore grade. \n By-product prices, well, we're very conservative on the kind of prices that we use for by-products. And I think that if we have a risk on this, it may go for having a much lower cash cost than what we're planning at this point. So the risk is for a downside or a better cash cost in our view. So yes.\n So for instance, for molybdenum, we're using $9.50 per pound. It's more or less in line with what we're seeing today, but the information that we have from our commercial team is that there is quite a good chance that the molybdenum market has a deficit in the next few quarters, that will certainly put pressure on the molybdenum prices. For zinc, it's $1.15, and today, we're at a little bit more than $1.20 -- in zinc, I'm sorry. While silver is more or less where it is today. And gold also more or less where we are nowadays.\n So the credits -- and the other thing is that our mine plans are focusing on getting the right or the expected copper production. The by-products are not as precise and usually, the bias is to the downside. So we underestimate a little bit, for instance, our molybdenum production each year. Our initial plan is usually lower than the actuals that we get through the year for different reasons. So we are much more optimistic and believe that if there is a risk on the cash cost, we expect it to be on the downside rather than an upside in it. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos. \nJohn Tumazos: Some of the early-stage companies I follow, almost lost the whole year last year due to virus restrictions. I'm thinking of one company that had 7-month delays in drilling because of the transportation restrictions in the country they were in. For your distant projects, Tia Maria, Los Chancas, El Arco, Michiquillay, did you lose any of the cushion on the 2024 or 2027, '28 timeframes? I'm impressed that you still have the same schedule. \nRaul Jacob: Well, we look at it. And our engineering team has indicated that they will do certain works in order to get these projects back on track as a scale. So they were -- they back up their initial results on most of the projects. This is the thing, John, and I certainly appreciate your question. It's been a bad year for capital goods vendors as well. So in some cases, what we're seeing is that lead times that certain equipment have had has reduced, and that has helped us. And so there are other things that are happening as well that are helping us, and that made our engineering teams to be -- to feel confident and to keep the initial goals as it scale. \nJohn Tumazos: Congratulations on keeping as close to track as you are. \nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Leopoldo Silva from LarrainVial. \nLeopoldo Silva: Sorry for -- I apologize for the technical issue on my side. So I have 2 questions. The first is very quick. I would like to know what the cash cost -- the guideline for the zinc project at? When -- if you can give maybe the quartile, it's going to be?\n And second, it's about your by-products. I was wondering with these prices of precious metals or molybdenum, will you be merging through to see, evaluate and make a streaming contract through an agreement as the ones we saw last year, maybe in molybdenum? If not, why it would be strategic to not to clean maybe your copper profile from this 15% of by-products and continue to operate them at least on your 4 main copper mines? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Let me start by the last one. We don't do streaming. We have -- we think that the company has -- will enjoy the upside of the different products that we produce and sell and live with the downside. But generally speaking, these are products -- the by-products are very, very competitive cost wise. So we believe that we are happy with having them inside our portfolio of different products to produce.\n On the cash cost for the Buenavista Zinc, I think, well, I have no -- I don't have information with me right now. But let me make a comment on that. This is a project that is inside the pit of the Buenavista mine. We will have to expand a little bit a certain area of the Buenavista Zinc -- the Buenavista pit. And if we don't do the concentrator, we will still need to do all the stripping. So instead of doing the stripping and losing the zinc, we are investing the money that we have a little bit more than $400 million for a zinc concentrator and some mining equipment that is required for the stripping. And capture the value of that metal. And I'm sorry for not having with me the cash cost -- the specific cash cost of this project. \nOperator: At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Raul Jacob for closing remarks. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Gigi. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter and Year 2020 Results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the first quarter of 2021. Thank you very much, stay safe, please. So thank you very much, again. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Gigi. And good afternoon to everyone and welcome to Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter and Full 2020 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonza\u0301lez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member.\n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during these trying times. In today's call, we will begin with an update on the measures we have taken to keep COVID-19 at bay. We will then review the copper market and Southern Copper's key results for production, sales, operating costs, financial results and expansion projects. Subsequently, we will open the session for questions.\n In 2020, Southern Copper faced the challenges of the pandemic with resilience, innovation and solidarity. The new normal that the virus has imposed in the world requires governments, companies and society to assume joint responsibility to protect citizens as we resume growth, generate value and fuel economic recovery. \n When COVID-19 reared its head in early 2020, Southern Copper moved quickly to preserve the health of its workers, their families and the communities in the countries where we operate. The company is committed to guaranteeing safe work environments and has developed lines of action to prevent transmission, strengthen community outreach and bolster capacities for medical response.\n In Mexico, a special budget was allotted to properly equip health personnel and support care functions in COVID hospitals. The company used these funds to donate almost 0.5 million protection equipment kits, 139 artificial support ventilators and 500 noninvasive ventilators to hospitals in different states around Mexico, as well as an important number of medical supplies such as monitors, beds and resuscitation carts. Hundreds of portable sinks for handwashing were installed and a company facility in Sonora was conditioned with dozens of beds for COVID patients with mild to moderate symptoms. \n In Peru, the company set up 18 temporary hospitals with a total of 250 COVID beds and provided each facility with oxygen supplies. In addition, the company donated 318,000 liters of liquid oxygen to public hospitals in the regions of Moquegua and Arequipa and set up 2 oxygen plants in the Tacna and Puno regions with capacities of 720 cubic meters and 222 cubic meters per day, respectively. \n To ensure the timely detection of COVID-19 cases and stop chains of contagion, a PCR lab test was donated in Moquegua. Additionally, medical equipment was donated to health care professionals, application of serology or PCR tests is now a standard procedure, which is key to stopping contagion at its tracks.\n Southern Copper has supported the most vulnerable populations in both Mexico and Peru by distributing thousands of food bags and continues to funnel outreach through its permanent community programs. Our top priority is to roll out solidarity-based efforts with the communities in our areas of influence to work together to stem the pandemic and its impact. In this regard, the company has mounted intense communication campaigns to educate the population about the prevention and hygiene measures recommended by health authorities and to provide psychological support for families throughout the online counseling and workshops. \n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the London Metal Exchange Copper price averaged $3.25 per pound, that is 21.7% higher than the price that we had in the fourth quarter of 2019. As of today, we are seeing prices a little bit over $3.60 per pound, which boasts a positive outlook for the 2021 copper market. We believe the following factors are influencing the copper market. A worldwide recovery in copper demand for industrial uses, driven mainly by a sustained recovery in economic activity in China and other Asian economies as well as the European auto industry.\n Regarding China, it should be also noted that copper scrap imports dropped 48% in the last 10 months of 2020, which led to a subsequent increase in Chinese consumption of refined copper. The combined inventories of the London Metal Exchange, COMEX and Shanghai and bonded warehouses close 2020 at their lowest levels since December 2014. Given the current market outlook for supply and demand, we have a positive view for this year and for the long-term evolution of the copper market. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2020. Copper represented 82% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2020. Copper production registered an increase of 1.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and situated at 259,744 tons in the fourth quarter or in the past quarter. This was primarily due to an increase in production at our Cuajone mine, attributable to higher ore grades and recoveries as well as higher production at the Buenavista mine due to an increase in the tonnage processed by concentrate. This effect was partially offset by lower production at our Toquepala mine due to lower ore grades. \n For the year 2020, copper production topped 1 million tons and represented a new milestone in the company's history. This represented a 0.8% increase with regard to 2019 production and was primarily due to higher production at our Cuajone mine, which was attributable to higher ore grades and recoveries. And to growth in production at both the La Caridad and the IMMSA mines in Mexico. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in production at the Toquepala and Buenavista mines, mainly due to lower ore grades. \n For 2021 and 2022 for the next -- this year and the next one, we expect to produce a little bit north of 943,000 tons of copper. This year's production will be affected by a temporary reduction in ore grade and recoveries, at the Peruvian operations. We expect our copper production to recover by 2023, reaching 1,031,000 tons of production as we get the Peruvian production back on track and generate new production on our projects of Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista Zinc concentrate. We believe 2023 will mark a new inflection point for new production as we aim to produce 1.9 million tons by 2028 by developing the following organic growth projects, all of them fully owned by us. \n For Mexico, we have Pilares that is expected to initiate production in -- early in 2022 with a capacity of 35,000 tons. El Pilar will increase our production by 2023, with a capacity of 35,500 tons of copper. El Arco, a major greenfield project in the Baja California, Peninsula, is expected to get into operation in 2028 with a contribution of 245,000 tons of copper. And the Buenavista Zinc concentrator is expected to produce 149,000 tons of zinc by 2023 and 20,000 -- I'm sorry, 28,000 tons of copper. These add 343,000 tons of new production from our Mexican operations.\n At the Peruvian ones, growth will come from new organic projects. We expect that the start-up dates and production -- are as follows: Tia Maria, we expect to initiate production by 2024 with 120,000 tons of refined copper production per year; Los Chancas is expected to initiate operations by 2027 with a capacity of 180,000 tons of copper; Michiquillay for 2028 with a capacity of 225,000 tons. These projects will add 525,000 tons of new production from Peru. These volumes, combined with our additional Mexican production, will put us in good shape to reach our long-term goal of producing 1.9 million tons by 2028.\n It should be noticed that our strong by-product base will increase as we add new copper volumes to our operations. As such, we expect to produce for 40,500 tons of molybdenum by 2028, 23.9 million ounces of silver by 2023 and 29.1 million ounces of silver by 2028. For zinc, we expect to produce 149,000 tons of zinc by 2023, and over 207,000 tons of zinc by 2028. As you can see, we're confident that our company will keep generating value for our shareholders through our organic growth base. In the meantime, we will be open to other possibilities to enhance value creation for our shareholders. \n For molybdenum, it represented 6.7% of the company's sales value in the fourth quarter of 2020, and it is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $8.93 per pound in the past quarter compared to $9.49 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is a 5.9% price reduction. \n In 2020, we produced 30,248 tons of molybdenum, an increase of 12.5% in production. This compares to the volume that we had in 2019. But the mention and production of 2020 is 30,248 tons. It's a new company record. This significant achievement was principally due to additional production from our Peruvian operations of Toquepala and Cuajone. Molybdenum production decreased by 4.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter of 2019, mainly due to lower production at our Buenavista and Toquepala mines because of lower grades and recoveries. This was partially offset by lower production at our Cuajone and Caridad mines due to higher grades and recoveries. In 2021, we expect to produce 26,800 tons of molybdenum, which represents a decrease of 11.3% over our 2020 production level.\n Silver represented 5.4% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of 2020, with an average price of $24.5 per ounce in the quarter. Up 41.9% from the same quarter of 2019. Silver is currently our second by-product. In 2020, we produced 21.5 million ounces of silver, an increase of 6.2% in production from 2019 and another company record. \n For the fourth quarter of 2020, mined silver production decreased by 4.5% from the same period of 2019 after production fell at Buenavista, Toquepala and IMMSA. This was partially offset by a 15.2% increase in production at the San Martin mine and higher production at the La Caridad and Cuajone mines.\n Refined silver production increased by 22.9% in the fourth quarter of last year due to higher production at La Caridad and IMMSA. In 2021, we expect to produce 21.4 million ounces of silver, in line with last year's production. \n Zinc represented 3.1% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of 2020, with an average price of $1.19 per pound in the quarter, a 10.2% increase from the fourth quarter of 2019. Zinc mine production decreased 17.7% quarter-on-quarter to situate at 16,763 tons. This was primarily due to the shutdown of our Santa Eulalia operation in the first quarter of 2020 due to a severe flooding. These negative variances in zinc production were partially offset by a production increase of 30.6% of zinc production at the San Martin mine. Refined zinc production decreased by 5.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\n For the year 2020, we produced 68,930 tons of zinc, a decrease of 6.8% with regard to 2019 and was mainly driven by the mentioned shutdown of the Santa Eulalia operation. The highly significant 150.7% increase in production at the San Martin mine was nonetheless insufficient to offset the aforementioned decrease. For 2021, we expect to produce 76,200 tons of zinc, a 10.5% increase in production when compared to last year. \n Looking at our financial results. For the fourth quarter of 2020 sales were $2.4 billion, or $496.1 million higher than sales for the fourth quarter of 2019. This is a 26.7% increase in sales.\n Copper sales volume increased by 1.4% and value by 28.2%, in a scenario of substantially better price.\n Regarding our main by-products, we had higher sales of molybdenum, due to the effect of provisional sales price adjustment, which was partially offset by a decrease in volume. Zinc sales were up due to growth in volume and price. Silver sales rose by -- due to an increase in volume and price. Let me mention the variances in sales for the by-products. In the case of molybdenum, sales increased by 31.3%. For zinc, it was 8.7%. For silver, 41.4%.\n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $61.6 million or 5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The main cost increments has been for workers' participation, inventory consumption, lower capitalized leachable material, the exchange rate variance, depreciation and other factors. These cost increments were partially offset by a decrease in labor cost, operations contractors and the diesel and fuel costs. \n In the fourth quarter of 2020, the adjusted EBITDA was $1,254 million, which represented an increase of 59.4%. With regard to the $786.7 million, were used during fourth quarter of 2019. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of last year was situated at 53.3% versus 42.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, adjusted EBITDA was 11.4% higher than the one at the third quarter of 2020. \n For the year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $3,868.8 million or 9.7% higher than 2019's adjusted EBITDA.\n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.44 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n Excuse me for a second. This is -- I'll -- starting with cash flow. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.44 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2020. This is $0.08 higher than the value for the third quarter of 2020. This 5.9% increase in the operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost, which was partially offset by a decrease in treatment and refining charges, administrative expenses and higher refined product premiums. \n Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.672 per pound in the fourth quarter of last year. This cash cost was $0.027 higher than the cash cost of $0.645 for the third quarter of 2020. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $420 million or $0.763 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2020. These figures represent a 7.4% increase when compared with the credit of $374.3 million or $0.711 per pound that we have in the third quarter of last year. \n Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc and sulfuric acid, and have decreased for silver and gold.\n Net income of $590.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year reflected an increase of 93.1% over the same period of 2019. Net income margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 25.1% versus 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, net income was 16.6% higher than the figure reported in the third quarter of 2020. Net income for 2020 was $1,570.4 million, that is $5.7 million higher than the prior year. \n For capital investments, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. The conditions generated by COVID-19 has led us to implement measures to produce vulnerability at the project execution level. These measures, which are constantly under review, including forcing social distance rules, strengthening sanitation efforts and requiring quarantine periods for personnel. Some activities in the project execution stage that are located in regions in Peru or Mexico, where new cases of infections are on the rise, have experienced delays. Consequently, we expect some delays, albeit minimal, in the execution of our investment projects. Nevertheless, today, delays primarily affect construction activities that require people to work in close physical proximity. All other engineering, procurement and construction activities that entail limited interaction between personnel are on scale. \n For 2020, capital investments were $592.2 million, which represented 37.7% of net income. Our current portfolio of approved projects in Peru totaled $2.8 billion, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested. If we include the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion investment and Los Chancas $2.6 billion, with these 2 projects, our total investment program in Peru reflects a commitment of $7.9 billion. \n In the case of the Tia Maria project in Arequipa, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of Islay Province population. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We also have promoted agricultural and livestock activity in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.\n Given the current Peruvian economic situation, where the country is in a strong recession and urgently requiring new jobs, it is crucial to move ahead with projects that will stimulate a sustained growth size. We reiterate our view that the social conditions are appropriate for the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria. The project will generate significant economic opportunities for Islay Province and Arequipa region.\n As we have mentioned in prior reports, during the construction and operation phase, we will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during Tia Maria's construction phase. When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in Arequipa region via royalties and tax.\n We expect the Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economic recovery and consequently, take the necessary steps to provide SEC with adequate support to initiate construction.\n For our Mexican projects, let's start with the Buenavista Zinc project in Sonora. This project is located between the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering study and the detailed engineering study is 81% complete. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 have been put in place. Purchase orders have been placed for major equipment, some of which are currently being manufactured. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. We expect to initiate operations in 2023, as mentioned before, and when completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n The project Pilaris, also in Sonora, is located 6 kilometers from La Caridad. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate, a new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks is under construction and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers of the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining the 0.78% expected from Pilares, with 0.34% from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, and we expect the project to begin production in the first quarter of next year.\n El Pilar is another project that we have in the Sonora state in Mexico. This low capital intensity, copper greenfield project is strategically located in Sonora in Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.287%, which is actually a very good ore grade for copper oxide. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper catalyst. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million, and we expect the project to start production in 2023, with an average expected mine life of 13 years. The results from experimental paths in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery.\n In Mexico, we have also the project El Arco, which is in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico. This is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserves of over 2.4 billion tons with an ore rate of 0.426%, and 0.3 billion tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.288%.\n Besides that, El Arco has by-products of gold, 0.11 grams per ton of mineral. The project includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to situate at 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 tons of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request environmental impact permits. We're currently in the final stage of land acquisition process for the project.\n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation for operations, capital investment plan and other financial needs at each board meeting, to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on January 21, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.60 per pound or per share of common stock payable on February 24 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 10 of this year. \n So with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open the forum for questions. Thank you for your question, Isabella. And yes, we have had some changes in our CapEx forecast. For this year, 2021, we expect to spend $1.4 billion in CapEx. For 2022, $2 billion. 2023, $2.2 billion. 2024, $2.3 billion. 2025, $2.2 billion. If you compare these figures with the ones that we have or the one that we reported last quarter, we have had a reduction in the figures. And the reason for that has been the rescaling of some of the capital expenditures for the projects, not that the projects haven't changed their budgets, but their -- the time line has spread a little bit over time. And that's why we are having a certain reduction in the CapEx forecast vis-a\u0300-vis last quarter. Cost? Cash cost? Well, I wish we could have all the year, the cash cost that we have -- we had for 2020, that was $0.69. But for this year, we're forecasting $0.89 per pound of cash cost. Should be remaining at about that level, $0.89, $0.90 per pound until we go into -- towards 2028, where we should have another -- well, a reduction in cash cost before by-products. Currently, we're expecting to have $1.66 per pound for this year on cash cost before credits. So credits are $0.77. That's our expectation. By the way, we're relatively conservative in the prices that we're using for by-products as well as for copper in our planning. And then it should trend a little bit up after 2022. But when we -- as we get the new production and new by-products coming into our operations, prices should tend to remain where they are or decrease a little bit under the $0.89, $0.90 per ton that I mentioned. I couldn't get your second concern, Andreas. No. What we are -- we were making our personnel coming back to work the premises. But the recent information that we have on the COVID-19 second wave that is affecting -- well, Peru, in particular, and Mexico has also a very serious problem as we do right now here in Peru. And as a consequence of that, the company has backed off a little bit on bringing in personnel to the premises, where what we have done is reorganize again and maintain our workforce as safe as we can. In the case of most administrative labor, it's coming back to work at a remote, if it is possible. And in many, many cases, that can be done. And the same with the -- obviously, with the most stringent strict protocols for sanitary safety, it's happening at the operations.\n In Mexico. We're doing a similar -- following a similar strategy. But currently, our operations are fine. We're in track for -- with our plans. Certain measures and activities that we have made between -- through the COVID-19 cycle has been very helpful for us in order to control the disease inside our premises. I think that we're being very successful at that point, and that has helped us to operate. And keep in mind that these are activities that are very high capital intensive. Many workers are isolated significant time of the daily shift. And the reason for that is that if you, for instance, operate a major mining track or certain facilities, you are usually with very important equipment that has been under your operation, but alone. It's not -- some of the crews that are required to do certain repairs or certain specific works require certain proximity. And in these cases, we are taking specific measures to protect our workforce in both Mexico and Peru. Yes. And that's why I mentioned that our cash cost for 2021 is expected to be at $0.89 per pound. Basically catching up on certain maintenance work, certain stripping that we could make, particularly at the Toquepala operation on the stripping, we could make the stripping at Toquepala and maintenance work that was postponed. For instance, certain activities that require a crew that work closely. Well, at the beginning of the pandemic, we believe that it was not a good idea. And we could postpone that for a while, so we did. But we have been doing -- catching up. And if you see our cash cost this past quarter, it has been slightly higher than the average for the year. And the reason for that is basically that we already initiated the catch-up work in the fourth quarter of 2020. Yes. Okay. If I got -- well, your first question is guidance on 2021 production, right? Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. For copper, we're expecting to produce 943,000 tons, molybdenum 26,800, zinc 76,200, silver 21.4 million ounces. That's basically it.\n On the Tia Maria, well, the date that we're considering now is 2024 to initiate production. That means that we should be initiated construction in 2022. That's probably speaking what we're thinking. Now we -- the way that we see the Tia Maria circumstance right now is as follows. Generally speaking, we believe that the work that the company has had with the local communities has been very, very successful. We believe that there is much more back up for the project now than what it used to be. And actually, we believe that if we have the political support, the project could move on. But now for that, we also think that we need to have a government with the possibility of moving forward with the project. And we believe that for that to happen, we need to pass the current election time. The elections are scheduled for first round in April 11. And then in June 6, the second round where a new President should emerge from that second vote. And with that definition, I mean, new Congress, new executive branch we believe that we will have the political support that the project requires to move on.\n But now specifically answering to your question, Jens, well, yes, we could accelerate it because we are ready. We have all the economic facilities to initiate the construction right away. And we have studied the project in depth, and we believe that it's feasible to initiate the construction very quickly. Thank you for your question, Grant. Let me -- okay, on the 2024, $2.3 billion budget that we have. For El Arco, we have $525 million in CapEx. For Tia Maria, $312 million. For Michiquillay, $436 million. And Los Chancas 69 -- $70 million for 2024. That's on the detail that you requested.\n Well, on the risk of managing the projects. These projects are evolving at different stages. For instance, in the case of Tia Maria, it's more like execution of all the engineering that has already been done, all the equipment selection that we already have identified, et cetera, et cetera. So it's more like moving forward with the construction, doing biddings. It's a different part of the process. In the case of Michiquillay, it will go most likely after we be with Los Chancas already in line and ready to go. \n And in the case of El Arco, it will be -- we'll initiate construction in 2022. If everything goes okay. So generally speaking, the stages that these projects have are slightly different in time. You will not get caught by all of them at the same time at certain tasks. Now what you are saying is, it's obviously a concern for us. But we believe that the company has shown through the years that we are -- we have a very strong engineering team. The company prides on the fact that we usefully finish our projects under budget and on time. So we think that we can handle it. But obviously, what you're indicating, it's a matter of concern because one of the risks that these projects may have eventually. Well, more than cost inflation, what we are seeing is a catch-up in expenses. And that's why we are having also slightly lower ore grades at the Peruvian operations in this year and the next one. And the reason for that is that we will have -- we will be operating in certain areas of the mines where we didn't work last year. Last year, we focused basically on an area where we could get the mineral that was required to maintain our production level where we plan to do that under the COVID circumstance. \n Keep in mind that we operate at a certain point in time with about 40% of the labor force that we have. So it was certainly an emergency. And now we still have -- are facing the challenges of COVID. But at the same time, we have -- we are -- I think we managed to deal with this, with how to operate safe, with right sanitary level for our workforce. And do what we need to do in order to maintain a sound operation. So it's a catching up rather than inflation. Obviously, if you look at the fuel prices, yes, there has been some inflation on that, obviously. But more than that, I think it's a catching up in certain words. And that has a side consequence that we are having a much lower ore grade. \n By-product prices, well, we're very conservative on the kind of prices that we use for by-products. And I think that if we have a risk on this, it may go for having a much lower cash cost than what we're planning at this point. So the risk is for a downside or a better cash cost in our view. So yes.\n So for instance, for molybdenum, we're using $9.50 per pound. It's more or less in line with what we're seeing today, but the information that we have from our commercial team is that there is quite a good chance that the molybdenum market has a deficit in the next few quarters, that will certainly put pressure on the molybdenum prices. For zinc, it's $1.15, and today, we're at a little bit more than $1.20 -- in zinc, I'm sorry. While silver is more or less where it is today. And gold also more or less where we are nowadays.\n So the credits -- and the other thing is that our mine plans are focusing on getting the right or the expected copper production. The by-products are not as precise and usually, the bias is to the downside. So we underestimate a little bit, for instance, our molybdenum production each year. Our initial plan is usually lower than the actuals that we get through the year for different reasons. So we are much more optimistic and believe that if there is a risk on the cash cost, we expect it to be on the downside rather than an upside in it. Well, we look at it. And our engineering team has indicated that they will do certain works in order to get these projects back on track as a scale. So they were -- they back up their initial results on most of the projects. This is the thing, John, and I certainly appreciate your question. It's been a bad year for capital goods vendors as well. So in some cases, what we're seeing is that lead times that certain equipment have had has reduced, and that has helped us. And so there are other things that are happening as well that are helping us, and that made our engineering teams to be -- to feel confident and to keep the initial goals as it scale. Okay. Let me start by the last one. We don't do streaming. We have -- we think that the company has -- will enjoy the upside of the different products that we produce and sell and live with the downside. But generally speaking, these are products -- the by-products are very, very competitive cost wise. So we believe that we are happy with having them inside our portfolio of different products to produce.\n On the cash cost for the Buenavista Zinc, I think, well, I have no -- I don't have information with me right now. But let me make a comment on that. This is a project that is inside the pit of the Buenavista mine. We will have to expand a little bit a certain area of the Buenavista Zinc -- the Buenavista pit. And if we don't do the concentrator, we will still need to do all the stripping. So instead of doing the stripping and losing the zinc, we are investing the money that we have a little bit more than $400 million for a zinc concentrator and some mining equipment that is required for the stripping. And capture the value of that metal. And I'm sorry for not having with me the cash cost -- the specific cash cost of this project. Thank you very much, Gigi. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter and Year 2020 Results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the first quarter of 2021. Thank you very much, stay safe, please. So thank you very much, again."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation's Third Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation's, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the third quarter 2020 as well as answer any questions that you might have.\n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP.\n Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Gigi. Good morning to everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Third Quarter of 2020 Results Conference Call. Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during these trying times.\n In today's call, we will begin with an update on the measures that we have taken on to keep the COVID-19 at bay and the impact that the pandemic has had on our operations. We will then review the copper market and Southern Copper's key results for production, sales, operating costs, financial results and expansion projects. Subsequently, we will open the session for questions.\n Well, as I mentioned, we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic by prioritizing efforts to safeguard the health and well-being of our workforce, their families and nearby communities. Our company is operating in total compliance with emergency levels required by local, regional and national governments, and we have implemented rigorous hygiene, sanitation and safety protocols at all of our facilities. As of September 30 of this year, our operations are at 96% of capacity usage. About 97% of our labor is working in Mexico, and 67% of the workforce in Peru is working at the operation sites or at home. \n In July, we opened up our premises to our most essential contractors, all of whom must comply with very strict protocols, including testing for COVID-19, ongoing health monitoring and mandatory quarantine. We're enforcing measures to limit our workforce exposure to the disease by imposing travel restriction, prohibiting face-to-face meetings, urgent frequent hand washing and require adherence to all other health, safety and social distancing measures decreed by government authorities. From the beginning of the pandemic, Southern Copper has worked to implement strong prevention measures to protect the health of its workers, their families and their communities. For this purpose, the company approved and subsequently executed a budget of $14.6 million for the nations and general support for the populations of Peru and Mexico. Of that budget, 95% has been already executed. To date, we maintain a dialogue with the communities and local authorities to strengthen the fight against COVID-19.\n To bolster response to the pandemic, we have donated 290,000 medical item supplies and 213 ventilators for breathing support at hospitals in the communities where we operate. In Mexico, we have set up 49 confined beds in company-owned housing in Sonora for people who require isolation or primary hospital care. In Peru, we have donated 18 temporary hospitals with a total capacity of 250 beds under oxygen supply. In Peru also, the company has donated 318,000 liters of liquid oxygen to national hospitals to treat the population infected with COVID-19 in the regions of Arequipa and Moquegua in the southern part of Peru. On top of this initiative, we are donating a COVID-19 molecular testing laboratory to Moquegua and 2 medicinal oxygen plants, one in Tacna with 720 cubic meters per day of capacity and another one for Puno that has a capacity of 222 cubic meters per day of oxygen, medicinal oxygen. \n We have also donated over 63,600 kits for personal protection equipment to medical staff and 25,000 personal hygiene kits to our workers and to the population in our areas of influence. These donations include information for the population about COVID-19, its spread and symptoms. We have also donated cleaning and personal protection equipment to members of the National Guard of Mexico and of the Peruvian Police and Army. Additionally, we're helping vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly or disabled persons and pregnant women, by donating more than 45,900 kits containing food and personal hygiene items.\n In addition to the aforementioned efforts, we have installed more than 310 portable sinks in strategic areas of the communities to ensure access to preventive hand washing. Moreover, to encourage compliance with the stay-at-home measures, the company is offering 3,742 sports, cultural and educational workshops online to the community. The company sponsors 11 schools with 3,677 students that since the beginning of the pandemic have received 470,483 online courses, so they can continue their education with quality. Additionally, throughout our community care service, we offer free medical, psychological and employment counseling 24 hours a day.\n Other initiatives include the special programs that benefit communities around us. For the elderly people, more than 313 community volunteers have participated in a letter exchange program with messages delivered and virtual visits. In order to develop urban orchards, we have provided 2,199 supply kits. Community volunteers have participated in making more than 40,000 face masks.\n Considering the current environment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that mine introduction and investment will play an important role in the recovery of both the Mexican and the Peruvian economies. As such, we will continue to develop our projects, consistent with our belief that Southern Copper's operations constitute a risk-controlled generators of economic resources that provide well-remunerated employment and tax revenues to the countries in which we operate. \n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the third quarter of this year, 2020, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $2.63 per pound in the third quarter of 2019 to a price of $2.96 or 12.5% higher price. As of today, we're seeing prices at about $3.10 per pound, which reflects the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on both the supply and demand for copper and the effect of the combined liquidity provided by central banks in developed economies. At this point, the copper price seems to be driven by 2 important factors: expectations of lower supply coming from Chile, a major producer, due to labor negotiations; and an increase in demand from China and other Asian economies in a scenario of economic recovery. Considering the current market outlook for supply and demand, we have a positive view of the long-term evolution of the copper price. \n Now let me focus at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2020. For copper, it represented 82.2% of our sales in the third quarter of 2020. Copper production registered a decrease of 2.3% with regard to the figure reported in the third quarter of last year and situated at 246,560 tons in the third quarter of 2020. This was primarily due to a decrease in production at our Peruvian mines, which was, in turn, attributable to lower ore grades. This effect was partially offset by higher production at our Mexican mines, particularly at Buenavista, which increased its production by 2.3% due to higher ore grades. In 2020, we expect to produce 996,500 tons of copper, in line with last year's production and slightly lower than our production plan. \n For molybdenum, it represented 5.6% of the company's sales value in the third quarter of 2020 and it's currently our second by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $7.57 per pound in the quarter and that compared to $11.76 in the third quarter of 2019. This represents a decrease of 35.6%. Molybdenum production increased by 7.8% in the third quarter of this year compared to the same period of 2019, principally due to significantly higher production at our Toquepala mine. Toquepala increased its molybdenum production by 23.3% and of that additional production, 1,114 tons were produced at the new molybdenum plant of Toquepala. Also, the Cuajone production increased by 24.5% due to higher grades and recoveries. This was partially offset by lower production at our Buenavista mine. In 2020, we expect to produce 29,400 tons of molybdenum, which represent an increase of 9.5% over our 2019 production level of 26,900 tons. \n Silver represented 6.2% of our sales value in the third quarter of this year with an average price of $24.59 per ounce in the quarter, up 44.8% from the third quarter of last year. Silver is currently our first by-product. So silver is the first one, molybdenum is the second one. Mined silver production decreased by 1.3% in this past quarter due to a decrease in production at Toquepala, Buenavista and IMMSA. We had a positive increase in production at the San Martin mine, which increases its production by 10%. But -- and also in -- we had higher production at the La Caridad that increased its silver production by 23.4% and Cuajone. \n Refined silver production decreased by 8.6% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of 2019. In 2020, we expect to produce 21.6 million ounces of silver, an increase of 6.7% when compared to last year's production. This is mainly attributable to a significant contribution by the San Martin operation. San Martin has increased its production in this year to up to -- we are expecting to produce 2.9 million tons -- million ounces of silver in San Martin and that compares to 1.2 million ounces in 2019. Regarding silver, we believe that prices will be supported by the intensive industrial use of this metal and the fact that silver, like gold, is considered a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. \n Zinc represented 2.9% of our sales value in the third quarter of 2020 with an average price of $1.06 per pound in the quarter, in line with the average price of the third quarter of 2019. Zinc mine production registered a slight decrease of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter and situated at 17,198 tons. This was primarily due to the shutdown of our Santa Eulalia operation in the first quarter of this year due to severe flooding. We're currently evaluating different options to supply the concentrator at Santa Eulalia. These negative variances in zinc production were mostly offset by a production increase of 1,315 tons, that is a 63.5% increase, at the San Martin mine and an 11.4% increase in production at the Santa Barbara mine. Refined zinc production increased by 1.5% in the third quarter compared to the same period of last year. \n For our financial results, in the third quarter of 2020, sales were $2.1 billion, which represents an increase of $269.5 million over the sales reported in the third quarter of 2019. This is a 14.5% increase in sales. For copper sales volume, it increased by 2.1% and the value by 18.4% in a scenario of better prices. \n Regarding our main by-products, we reported higher sales of silver, that increased by 50% due to slight increase in volume and much better prices. Zinc sales rose by 8.7% due to an increase in volume of 7% and no variation in prices. These positive results were partially offset by lower sales of molybdenum that decreased by 23.5% due to drop in prices. As I mentioned, prices decreased by 35.6%, which was, in turn, partially compensated by the better volume that we had of 10.7%. \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $39.4 million or 3.4% when compared to the third quarter of 2019. Main cost increments has been in purchased copper, lower capitalized leachable material, workers participation and sales expenses. These cost increments were partially offset by a decrease in the use of operations, contractors, diesel and fuel cost, inventory consumption and operating and repair materials. \n The adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2020 was $1,125.9 million, which represented an increase of 24% with regard to the $907.7 million registered in the third quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin in this past quarter was situated at 52.9% versus 48.8% in the third quarter of 2019. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, EBITDA was 46.2% higher than in the second quarter of 2020. \n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.36 per pound in the third quarter of 2020. This represents an increase of $0.092 over the value reported in the second quarter of this year. This 7.3% increase in the operating cash cost is a result of an increase in cost per pound from production cost, treatment and refining charges and administrative expenses and was partially offset by an increase in the premium to refined copper sales. \n Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.645 per pound in the third quarter of 2020. This cash cost was $0.025 lower than the cash cost of $0.67 we reported in the second quarter of 2020. \n Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $374.3 million or $0.711 per pound in the third quarter of 2020. These figures represent a 19.8% increase when compared with the credit of $321.5 million or $0.593 per pound that we had in the second quarter of 2020. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc, silver and sulfuric acid. \n The third quarter of 2020 net income of $506 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.65 was 29.9% higher than the third quarter of 2019 net income. The net income margin for this past quarter was 23.8% versus 21% in the same quarter of 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, net income was 95% higher than the one in the second quarter of 2020.\n Capital expenditures. Southern Copper investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. The conditions generated by the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted us to introduce new measures to reduce vulnerability at our project execution level. Sanitary measures include frequent COVID-19 testing, daily temperature checks, mask provision and mandatory use, social distancing at work sites and in the mine camps and an obligatory quarantine period for our own and contractors' personnel. In locations where infections are on the rise, some activity has been pushed back or scaled down, particularly at construction sites where personnel are required to work closely. All other engineering, procurement and construction activities that are not personnel intensive or where social distancing can be applied are being executed at a normal pace. At this point, we do not expect significant delays in project execution. \n For the Peruvian projects, our current portfolio for approved projects totaled $2.8 billion in Peru, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested, mainly at the Toquepala concentrator expansion. If we include the up and coming Michiquillay, $2.5 billion of CapEx; and Los Chancas, $2.6 billion of CapEx, our total investment program in Peru show a commitment of $7.9 billion. For the Tia Maria project in the Arequipa region of Peru, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the Islay province population. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We also promoted agriculture and livestock activities in the Tambo valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.\n In the third quarter of 2020, we received the results of our review of the social environment in the Tia Maria project, which was conducted by a global leader in the environmental, social and government assessments. This evaluation concluded the following regarding our project. The company has improved its community relations and the plan for water management system in place for the Tia Maria project is aligned with international standards. The company has aligned its corporate-wide practices with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, a multi-stakeholder initiative that promotes principles to guys tracking companies in the process to provide security for their operations in a manner that respect human rights. We're pleased and encouraged by these results, which reflects the positive impact of our company's social programs in Tia Maria's area of influence and in the Arequipa region. We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle.\n During the construction and operation phase, we will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria's construction phase. When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200 workers. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes. We expect the Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently take the necessary steps to provide Southern Copper with adequate support to initiate construction. \n For the Mexican projects, particularly on Buenavista, we have the zinc -- the new zinc concentrator for our Buenavista facility. This project is located between the facility and includes development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering study and the detailed engineering has reached 75% of completion. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 have been put in place. Purchase orders have been placed for major equipment, some of which is currently being manufactured. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. We expect to initiate operations in the third quarter of 2022. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and will provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n For the Pilares project, also in Sonora, this is a project that is located 6 kilometers from our operation of La Caridad. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks is under construction and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% ore grade from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million and we expect the project to begin production in the first half of 2022. \n In Sonora, we also have a project named El Pilar. This is a low capital intensity copper greenfield project that is strategically located approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.287%, which is a very good ore grade for leachable material. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million, and we expect the project to start production in 2023 with an expected mine life of 13 years. The results from experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. \n We're adding to our projects discussion, El Arco, which is a project in Baja California. El Arco is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula with ore reserves over 2.4 billion tons, an ore grade of 0.426% and 0.3 billion tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.288%. And it also has, as a by-product, gold, which has 0.11 grams of gold per ton of mineral. This product includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to situate at about 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 tons -- ounces of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. We're currently in the final stage of land acquisition process for the project. \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plan and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on October 22, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock payable on November 24 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 11 of this year. \n Well, with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us today, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser from UBS. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Just 2 quick questions from me. Number one, on Tia Maria, obviously, you mentioned there's been some progress there end of third quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what are the next kind of milestones over the next 3 to 6 months? Are there any dates we should be looking after for any signposts and kind of also how you're thinking about the political environment in Peru vis-\u00e0-vis developing Tia Maria? So that's the first question. \n I'm sorry, could you just clarify one second question on the by-products. Sorry, did you say that cost before by-products went up? Or did they go down? I missed that. \nRaul Jacob: So, thank you, Andreas. Okay. On the Tia Maria, well, we do have all the permits now. So the next step will be to initiate the construction. That will be the basic next step that we're expecting to move on. In terms of the political environment, well, Peru is approaching elections. It will be on April 11 of next year. Obviously, when there is elections at the site, usually that makes a little bit harder to initiate new projects. And we are certainly considering that as part of our current outlook for the project. \n Regarding the by-products, well, we have -- at the press release, we indicated a reduction in our cash costs when compared to the third quarter of 2019. It was $0.82 in the third quarter of 2019, and it's been $0.65, that's 21.7% reduction year-on-year. Quarter-on-quarter, we had a slight variance, an increase, and that was the one that I mentioned in my report today. So before by-product credits, we have $1.36 per pound in this quarter, this past quarter. It was a little bit higher than the second quarter of 2020 cash cost by $0.092. I hope that this clarifies your concern. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Yes. No, that's very clear. Just a follow-up there. The reason for the slightly higher cost before by-products, what was that, again, sorry? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. The reason is that we have to -- in the second quarter, in particularly, we had to slow down our operations quite significantly. In the third quarter, we are recuperating the pace, not only in terms of mine material but also in some other operations. For instance, certain maintenances that were postponed in the second quarter were tackled in the third one. So that's why we had a slight increase in our cash cost, still very, very good cash cost, by the way, but slightly higher than before by-product credits, the increasing was from about $1.27 to $1.36 per ton before credits. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Thiago Lofiego from Bradesco BBI. \nThiago Lofiego: Raul, 2 questions for me. First one on the dividends. Is there a chance that we see a higher dividend payout in the coming quarters or maybe year while you don't have a final decision on the growth projects, I mean, the significant growth projects like Tia Maria or eventually if you go forward for another one?\n And then the second question is related to that as well. So Tia Maria, I understand you guys are doing a lot of things there, the ESG study. But just to understand, if this takes longer to become a reality, would you consider going for El Arco first? Or this is not in the cards for you? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. On dividends, well, the Board increased the dividend from $0.40 that we announced in July to $0.50 this past October 22. And it's always decided at the Board meeting what the dividend to pay. We think that the company has a very consistent track record of sending any cash that is perceived as excellent to the shareholders. That's what the company has done for quite a while. And -- but it's something that will have to be decided on an ongoing basis by the Board members. As you know, conditions are much more favorable price-wise in the products that we produce other than molybdenum. Molybdenum, sadly, is not keeping the price that it had last year, but that was about $12 per pound. Now it's close to $8 per pound, it's 1/3 of value loss. But all the other prices of products have improved; for copper, very significantly; silver and gold, obviously; and well, zinc remains pretty much the same, but that's basically it. So I think that as long as the company has some cash available, the Board will consider if that should be paid as a dividend. \n In the case of the Tia Maria, well, this -- the project suffered an evolution that required certain tasks to be accomplished. Currently, Tia Maria is [ completed ] on our side, has finished with all the permitting, and we are -- we have been doing a very strong and very successful, actually, social work in the area of the project. And we will -- are willing to move on with it. \n For El Arco, well, as I mentioned, it has initiating -- it is initiating its work to get the environmental impact assessment. We're getting land that is required for the project. So there are certain steps that we have to comply with in order to move on with the project. I don't see these 2 projects as this or that. I think that whenever they're mature to move on, the company will put the resources to do so. \nThiago Lofiego: That's good, Raul. And just a follow-up here. In terms of projects that are more mature or less mature beyond Tia Maria, which ones are the ones that you see that are closer to be more mature anyway? So would it be El Arco, Michiquillay, what would be the order there? \nRaul Jacob: Well, the ones that we are reporting for our Mexican operations, Pilares and the zinc concentrators -- concentrator, the new zinc concentrator, are the ones that are being developed right now. So those are -- those 3 in Mexico and Tia Maria, okay? Besides those, we have the greenfield projects that are in Mexico and Peru. In the case of Peru, it is Tia Maria. And then we look at the project completion. Los Chancas is also a project that is well advanced. And Michiquillay is -- we're moving forward. We did very nicely, actually. So we think that these projects are being developed at a proper pace. And in Mexico, another greenfield project is El Arco, which is the one that I already commented on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Brandt from HSBC. \nJonathan Brandt: I just wanted to clarify something you said at the beginning. Did you say, in Peru, there's about 65%, 70% of the workers back actually working? So I'm just wondering if you can clarify sort of what the other 30% are doing. Is this going to have repercussions? I mean presumably, it's impacting things like stripping and things like that. So I'm just wondering, will we see an impact on production from this in the next couple of years? \n And then secondly, I just wanted to ask you about the production versus sales volume numbers. I thought you said last -- during the call last quarter that destocking was pretty much done. But it seems like inventory has come down again, sales volumes were a bit higher than production again this quarter. So I'm just wondering if you're now running at a normalized inventory level? Or should we expect further improvement in working capital? \nRaul Jacob: Sure. Thank you for your questions, Jon. Well, for the Peruvian workforce, we have certain workers that, for different reasons, we haven't asked them to come back to work, mainly because they are on -- they have some restrictions due to certain health conditions. And that's a little bit more significant in Peru, given the protocols that the sanitary authorities has put in place than in Mexico. That's why we have -- we're operating with, as I'd say, about 65% of the workforce. These employees are being recalled to come back to work as we speak. We're already doing that. The process is relatively slow, and we're trying to catch up and having most of our workforce in our operations in the next few weeks, the Peruvian workforce. \n In the case of production versus sales, well, we're expecting to maintain a very close relationship between sales and production. Sometimes, as it happened in the last -- in the past quarter -- at the end of the second quarter, we couldn't ship all the material that we had already due to high fees at the Ilo port and some other inconveniences, but that -- well, obviously, we made an effort to catch up on that and that has been reflected in our sales volumes this past quarter. So we are currently normal regarding inventories and expect to maintain a very close relationship between our production and our sales. \nJonathan Brandt: Great. And just a follow-up on the labor side. We've seen some issues in Chile with strikes and issues at MMG. So I mean are you expecting any sort of -- I guess if you could comment a little bit on your overall relationship with the unions and the communities, both in Peru and Mexico? \nRaul Jacob: Certainly. Well, in the case of Peru, we had -- last year, we signed labor -- 3-year labor contracts with our unions, with most of them. One of them had slightly different time lag, but we do have a contract with them as well. So we don't see this as a problem now. We don't believe that we will have any inconveniences on that. \n In the case of the Mexican operations, they have a different arrangement for discussion of salaries. So far, we are not seeing any inconveniences regarding our labor force in Mexico as well. So we're -- in that regard, we are okay, I believe. As you may imagine, Jon, many people is quite concerned on the difficulties that both Mexico and Peru are facing due to the COVID pandemic. So labor discipline, I believe, it's very, very high in both countries where we operate. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jens Spiess from Morgan Stanley. \nJens Spiess: Just wanted to ask how much you still have to do in terms of stripping and how that will impact cost before by-products going forward? And in that sense, if you could provide an updated guidance for upcoming years? \n And also, do you have any notion of how much your tax flow will be affected if Congress passes the nondeductibility of royalties in Mexico? \nRaul Jacob: I'm sorry, I couldn't get your second question, Jens. \nJens Spiess: Yes. In Congress, there's apparently a proposal for the upcoming, how do you call it, budget for the next year. Mining royalties will no longer be deductible from the income tax. So I was wondering if you already have an assessment of what's the impact on your tax bill for that. \nRaul Jacob: You mean on the Mexican tax legislation? \nJens Spiess: Correct. \nRaul Jacob: Is that what you mean? \nJens Spiess: Yes, yes, correct. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Okay. Let me first go into -- well, we reported a slight increase in our cash cost before by-product credits. So far, we're expecting a cash cost of about $0.70 for this year. It will have -- it will be either the same or slightly higher. It depends on how much maintenance we can catch up in this fourth quarter for this year. Now for 2021, we are expecting to have -- we're certainly catching up on maintenance expenditures, some that will require some more contractors work. And our current view is that we should have a cash cost of about $1 next year; for 2022, $0.98; and $0.94 in 2023. Let me mention that we will be including the production of the new projects in Mexico in these 2 years. In 2022, we will have the Pilares operation already producing about a -- a little bit more than 30,000 tons per year, 35,000 tons. And then in 2023, we will have El Pilar and the Buenavista zinc operation. That will certainly improve our production as well as the cost profile. \n Regarding the second, the proposal in the Mexican Congress, well, we don't want to speculate on this. When this is a firm decision by the Congress, we'll provide an idea of the impact, but at this point, we don't think that it's a good idea to mention on the impact because it's mainly speculative at this point. \nJens Spiess: Okay. And could you maybe repeat the cash cost guidance before include -- before the deduction of by-products? \nRaul Jacob: For next year or for now? \nJens Spiess: Yes. So this year and next year, preferably. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. For this year, we are expecting $1.35 before credits. And for next year, $1.64. By the way, we're -- this quarter, we are usually doing a major review on the outlook for the company. So it may vary a little bit when we report our view of the operations in the next quarter, in January. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Leopoldo Silva from LarrainVial. \nLeopoldo Silva: So I have a first question regarding your growth projects. I see in the Los Chancas CapEx guidance that you have reduced it 20 -- to $200 million (sic) [ by $200 million ]. What is the explanation for that? And then I have a follow-up. \nRaul Jacob: Sure. In the case of Lo Chancas, we have made a throughput -- a complete review on the project. And as a consequence, we found that -- well, basically, we're -- we have changed the mining plan, the long-term mining plan of the project. As a consequence, we will be doing less stripping and that will have an impact on the CapEx, of the CapEx of the project because it will require less equipment at the beginning of the investment as well as pre-stripping. So that -- those 2 components are the main explanation for the project reduction in CapEx. \nLeopoldo Silva: Great. Very clear. And my second question is regarding your steady state after building all these projects in Peru and Mexico. How -- your sustaining CapEx, what level should you reach after your -- all of these operations are up and running? \nRaul Jacob: Well, currently, we have a sustaining capital that's in the range of $500 million per year. Obviously, we -- and that's considering the current production capacity. So once we finish our projects, and that will mean that we will be producing almost 2 million -- 1.8 million tons of copper, that will be our capacity. Then we should have obviously a much higher maintenance CapEx. Well, for a while, it will not press our equipments or our expenditures because the, well, new equipment usually requires less maintenance for a while and then you initiate a routine of maintenance. For now, we believe that, that should be at about 750 million tons (sic) [ $750 million ] for the long run. But that's something that we will be reviewing as we move on into 2028 when we believe we will be operating all the projects at full capacity. \nLeopoldo Silva: Okay. So on a per ton basis, it should be relatively the same after the initial years? \nRaul Jacob: Yes, that's a fair assumption. \nLeopoldo Silva: Okay. And now that you said you spend $500 million a year in CapEx. I believe this year, CapEx at the beginning of the year was going to be $1.1 billion, right? I know you have downsized it to $800 million, but those -- the $600 million difference with your sustaining CapEx, what -- as you're not spending on growth projects -- no, I mean, you are. Those $600 million, where are they going or where they were planned to go at the beginning of the year? \nRaul Jacob: We are rescheduling them. Well, this year, we had -- as you well mentioned, we had an initial budget that was much higher than what we expect to spend. And we are adjusting the current CapEx for 2020 to about $650 million. Of those, it has a mix of certain maintenance CapEx that we haven't been able to do. So we are not going to spend the money that we expect for maintenance CapEx for the reasons that I explained. Certain capital-related activities cannot be performed. Let's say, for instance, a technical visit to evaluate an equipment in some other country, well, you may not been able to travel to that country where the operation of the equipment that you want to buy is located. So you have to postpone certain expenses for reasons, technical reasons as well as sanitary reasons. \n And so we have been reducing our CapEx on an ongoing basis this year. At this point, we are not changing the view on the projects or the CapEx for maintenance that we have to do. We are in either event postponing a little bit expenses. The money that we have not spent through 2020, it's being distributed in the following years, 2021 and on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jean Bruny from BBVA. \nJean Baptiste Bruny: Congratulations for the results. Maybe 2 quick ones for me. The first one on molybdenum... \nRaul Jacob: Could you -- we can -- Jean, we cannot copy you. Could you approach a little bit to the microphone. \nJean Baptiste Bruny: Sure. Sure. Can you hear me better now? \nRaul Jacob: Sure. \nJean Baptiste Bruny: Is it better? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. \nJean Baptiste Bruny: Sorry about that. Just 2 quick ones for me. The first one on molybdenum. We have seen all prices of metals trading up after the first quarter but for molybdenum. Maybe what's your view on that. \n And the second one on the copper market. I understand you're optimistic. Maybe what's your take as well on the dynamic, especially on the supply side? How much capacity do you think is currently you're seeing less due to COVID? And what's your take as well on the demand side? I understand that you're seeing a very strong demand from China. Can you update on the other part of the world. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. I got your second question. On the first one, I couldn't copy well what you said. Let me focus on that and then we'll tackle your second. Okay. Well, so far, we are seeing a reduction in demand and a reduction in supply. This is a crisis, the COVID-19 crisis, economic crisis, for copper, it's a different than -- it's different situation than what we usually faced in the past. Let me explain why. Usually, when you had a market turmoil that reduced economic growth worldwide, what we saw in the copper market was a reduction in demand, but supply remained basically intact. So adjustments in supply came after a while due to much lower prices than the ones that are sustainable long term. So those lower prices produced shutting down of high-cost operations, and that's how the market move on towards economic equilibrium for the copper market. That's, say, what happened in the 2008, 2009 recession, worldwide. We had lower demand than lower supply. \n In this case, due to the COVID impact in the operations of different copper producers, we had both supply and demand decrease. And now we are at a much lower level of demand and supply. Our commercial team has indicated that they are expecting -- or they believe that demand has decreased in 2020 by about 700,000 tons and supply has decreased by about 350,000 tons. That's for 2020.\n At the same time, we're seeing different events that are supporting copper prices. I mentioned the liquidity available at the different central banks, particularly the European Central Bank and the Fed has provided to the market. That is certainly helping to maintain economic activities and metal prices at a good level. Also a concern from -- for different actors at this market is what is happening in Chile, where labor talks are affecting about 50% of the Chile's supply this -- in the next 12 months. And that's on the supply side. And on the demand, we're seeing a very strong recovery from China and other Asian economies that are demanding copper. And we're expecting a positive outlook for this coming year. And that's why we have this positive view on the copper price. That's why I have to comment on that. Could you mention your second concern, please, Jean? \nJean Baptiste Bruny: Yes. Yes, sure. Just one quick question on [Technical Difficulty] \nRaul Jacob: We're not copying you. \nOperator: It appears that his line has disconnected. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Let's move on. He may reconnect, and we'll take the call whenever he's back. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rodolfo De Angele from JPMorgan. \nRodolfo De Angele: I guess we already discussed a lot. So I just wanted to confirm the numbers of your expectations for production of both copper and moly into next year that you mentioned in your opening remarks. I'm not sure I got it right. Can you repeat, please? And that's all for me. \nRaul Jacob: Certainly. Good talking to you, Rodolfo. For copper, we're expecting 996,500 tons; for molybdenum, 29,400 tons. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rodrigo Garcilazo from GBM. \nRodrigo Garcilazo: I have just a quick clarification. In the last conference call, you mentioned that you were expecting to have higher costs for about $170 million due to postponed maintenance and stripping costs and that, that amount will be spread out in the next 3 quarters. So considering your higher cash cost expectations for next year, the question is, did you move a big chunk of these additional costs through 2021 and by how much? That's the first one. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Well, we already commented on that, and we're following a plan to catch up on all the maintenance and some other activities that we had to postpone due to the pandemic. A portion of that has been already absorbed by our operations and will be the case for now and at least 2 quarters of next year. At the same time, we're seeing certain synergies that we're getting by doing -- finding out different ways to do what we are doing now. And that is -- there are some saving opportunities that are -- were foreseen for the future. We will report on that when we have more clarity. But at this point, the plan is to do the maintenance that we have postponed and try to be as much efficient as we can by addressing these different works in the next few quarters. \nRodrigo Garcilazo: The next question is a quick follow-up regarding Peruvian workforce. Could you mention the effects in terms of cost and production once all the workforce returns in the next few weeks, please, in Peru? \nRaul Jacob: Well, they have been paid, so we never stopped paying them. The Peruvian legislation, in this case, asked them for -- asked for them to recuperate the time that they have been not working. So we're developing a plan, so they can pay back that time. That's one thing. The other one is that we have incurred in certain expenditures related to this situation, we have to pay some extra labor time. It was, relatively speaking, a small amount, $16 million, that we have to spend in our operations due to COVID-19 labor or production inconveniences. So most of it is for extra labor for the ones that could work at the premises of the company. Ones that are not working will have to pay back the salaries that they have received, and there are different ways that they can do that. And that's following the Peruvian legislation regarding this matter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rodrigo Salazar from AM Advisors. \nRodrigo Salazar Couttolenc;AM Advisors;Associate Equity Analyst: Just one question from my side. If you could give us an update on CapEx. With these changes on payments, what do you expect for next year on CapEx? And how much of that is maintenance? \nRaul Jacob: Certainly. Let me follow in a sec, please. Okay. For next year, we are expecting to spend $1.4 billion; for 2022, $1.8 billion; 2023, $2.2 billion; 2024, $2.9 billion. So basically, we're rescheduling our expenses. The ones that we are not exercising this year and a little bit -- that has some kind of a waterfall in terms of rescheduling of expenditures for CapEx. \nRodrigo Salazar Couttolenc;AM Advisors;Associate Equity Analyst: Okay. And how much of that is maintenance for next year, of the $1.4 billion? \nRaul Jacob: Well, it's -- there are some expenses that -- for instance, all the equipment that could be acquired, we already -- we have already put the purchase orders on that. Some of that will be paid, particularly for the new concentrator at Buenavista, will be paid this quarter, about $70 million of that. And then it varies depending on the different projects. It's not specific for different projects in this case. \nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. I have -- the gentleman that disconnected has e-mailed us. His question is on the molybdenum market. He is indicating why molybdenum price is the only one that is going down. Well, that's a question that we also do ourselves. Actually, it's -- there is plenty of supply, and that's why. This is Jean Bruny's question from BBVA. It's basically excess supply in the market. Molybdenum is also related to certain industry that, well, won't be favored by current circumstances, such as airplane manufacturing, for instance. That's one of the consumers of molybdenum in the stainless steel alloys that they use for this. \n Okay. Let me -- well, with this, we conclude our conference call for today. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report for the fourth quarter of this year and the full year 2020. Thank you very much, and have a nice day today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Gigi. Good morning to everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Third Quarter of 2020 Results Conference Call. Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during these trying times.\n In today's call, we will begin with an update on the measures that we have taken on to keep the COVID-19 at bay and the impact that the pandemic has had on our operations. We will then review the copper market and Southern Copper's key results for production, sales, operating costs, financial results and expansion projects. Subsequently, we will open the session for questions.\n Well, as I mentioned, we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic by prioritizing efforts to safeguard the health and well-being of our workforce, their families and nearby communities. Our company is operating in total compliance with emergency levels required by local, regional and national governments, and we have implemented rigorous hygiene, sanitation and safety protocols at all of our facilities. As of September 30 of this year, our operations are at 96% of capacity usage. About 97% of our labor is working in Mexico, and 67% of the workforce in Peru is working at the operation sites or at home. \n In July, we opened up our premises to our most essential contractors, all of whom must comply with very strict protocols, including testing for COVID-19, ongoing health monitoring and mandatory quarantine. We're enforcing measures to limit our workforce exposure to the disease by imposing travel restriction, prohibiting face-to-face meetings, urgent frequent hand washing and require adherence to all other health, safety and social distancing measures decreed by government authorities. From the beginning of the pandemic, Southern Copper has worked to implement strong prevention measures to protect the health of its workers, their families and their communities. For this purpose, the company approved and subsequently executed a budget of $14.6 million for the nations and general support for the populations of Peru and Mexico. Of that budget, 95% has been already executed. To date, we maintain a dialogue with the communities and local authorities to strengthen the fight against COVID-19.\n To bolster response to the pandemic, we have donated 290,000 medical item supplies and 213 ventilators for breathing support at hospitals in the communities where we operate. In Mexico, we have set up 49 confined beds in company-owned housing in Sonora for people who require isolation or primary hospital care. In Peru, we have donated 18 temporary hospitals with a total capacity of 250 beds under oxygen supply. In Peru also, the company has donated 318,000 liters of liquid oxygen to national hospitals to treat the population infected with COVID-19 in the regions of Arequipa and Moquegua in the southern part of Peru. On top of this initiative, we are donating a COVID-19 molecular testing laboratory to Moquegua and 2 medicinal oxygen plants, one in Tacna with 720 cubic meters per day of capacity and another one for Puno that has a capacity of 222 cubic meters per day of oxygen, medicinal oxygen. \n We have also donated over 63,600 kits for personal protection equipment to medical staff and 25,000 personal hygiene kits to our workers and to the population in our areas of influence. These donations include information for the population about COVID-19, its spread and symptoms. We have also donated cleaning and personal protection equipment to members of the National Guard of Mexico and of the Peruvian Police and Army. Additionally, we're helping vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly or disabled persons and pregnant women, by donating more than 45,900 kits containing food and personal hygiene items.\n In addition to the aforementioned efforts, we have installed more than 310 portable sinks in strategic areas of the communities to ensure access to preventive hand washing. Moreover, to encourage compliance with the stay-at-home measures, the company is offering 3,742 sports, cultural and educational workshops online to the community. The company sponsors 11 schools with 3,677 students that since the beginning of the pandemic have received 470,483 online courses, so they can continue their education with quality. Additionally, throughout our community care service, we offer free medical, psychological and employment counseling 24 hours a day.\n Other initiatives include the special programs that benefit communities around us. For the elderly people, more than 313 community volunteers have participated in a letter exchange program with messages delivered and virtual visits. In order to develop urban orchards, we have provided 2,199 supply kits. Community volunteers have participated in making more than 40,000 face masks.\n Considering the current environment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that mine introduction and investment will play an important role in the recovery of both the Mexican and the Peruvian economies. As such, we will continue to develop our projects, consistent with our belief that Southern Copper's operations constitute a risk-controlled generators of economic resources that provide well-remunerated employment and tax revenues to the countries in which we operate. \n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the third quarter of this year, 2020, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $2.63 per pound in the third quarter of 2019 to a price of $2.96 or 12.5% higher price. As of today, we're seeing prices at about $3.10 per pound, which reflects the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on both the supply and demand for copper and the effect of the combined liquidity provided by central banks in developed economies. At this point, the copper price seems to be driven by 2 important factors: expectations of lower supply coming from Chile, a major producer, due to labor negotiations; and an increase in demand from China and other Asian economies in a scenario of economic recovery. Considering the current market outlook for supply and demand, we have a positive view of the long-term evolution of the copper price. \n Now let me focus at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2020. For copper, it represented 82.2% of our sales in the third quarter of 2020. Copper production registered a decrease of 2.3% with regard to the figure reported in the third quarter of last year and situated at 246,560 tons in the third quarter of 2020. This was primarily due to a decrease in production at our Peruvian mines, which was, in turn, attributable to lower ore grades. This effect was partially offset by higher production at our Mexican mines, particularly at Buenavista, which increased its production by 2.3% due to higher ore grades. In 2020, we expect to produce 996,500 tons of copper, in line with last year's production and slightly lower than our production plan. \n For molybdenum, it represented 5.6% of the company's sales value in the third quarter of 2020 and it's currently our second by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $7.57 per pound in the quarter and that compared to $11.76 in the third quarter of 2019. This represents a decrease of 35.6%. Molybdenum production increased by 7.8% in the third quarter of this year compared to the same period of 2019, principally due to significantly higher production at our Toquepala mine. Toquepala increased its molybdenum production by 23.3% and of that additional production, 1,114 tons were produced at the new molybdenum plant of Toquepala. Also, the Cuajone production increased by 24.5% due to higher grades and recoveries. This was partially offset by lower production at our Buenavista mine. In 2020, we expect to produce 29,400 tons of molybdenum, which represent an increase of 9.5% over our 2019 production level of 26,900 tons. \n Silver represented 6.2% of our sales value in the third quarter of this year with an average price of $24.59 per ounce in the quarter, up 44.8% from the third quarter of last year. Silver is currently our first by-product. So silver is the first one, molybdenum is the second one. Mined silver production decreased by 1.3% in this past quarter due to a decrease in production at Toquepala, Buenavista and IMMSA. We had a positive increase in production at the San Martin mine, which increases its production by 10%. But -- and also in -- we had higher production at the La Caridad that increased its silver production by 23.4% and Cuajone. \n Refined silver production decreased by 8.6% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of 2019. In 2020, we expect to produce 21.6 million ounces of silver, an increase of 6.7% when compared to last year's production. This is mainly attributable to a significant contribution by the San Martin operation. San Martin has increased its production in this year to up to -- we are expecting to produce 2.9 million tons -- million ounces of silver in San Martin and that compares to 1.2 million ounces in 2019. Regarding silver, we believe that prices will be supported by the intensive industrial use of this metal and the fact that silver, like gold, is considered a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. \n Zinc represented 2.9% of our sales value in the third quarter of 2020 with an average price of $1.06 per pound in the quarter, in line with the average price of the third quarter of 2019. Zinc mine production registered a slight decrease of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter and situated at 17,198 tons. This was primarily due to the shutdown of our Santa Eulalia operation in the first quarter of this year due to severe flooding. We're currently evaluating different options to supply the concentrator at Santa Eulalia. These negative variances in zinc production were mostly offset by a production increase of 1,315 tons, that is a 63.5% increase, at the San Martin mine and an 11.4% increase in production at the Santa Barbara mine. Refined zinc production increased by 1.5% in the third quarter compared to the same period of last year. \n For our financial results, in the third quarter of 2020, sales were $2.1 billion, which represents an increase of $269.5 million over the sales reported in the third quarter of 2019. This is a 14.5% increase in sales. For copper sales volume, it increased by 2.1% and the value by 18.4% in a scenario of better prices. \n Regarding our main by-products, we reported higher sales of silver, that increased by 50% due to slight increase in volume and much better prices. Zinc sales rose by 8.7% due to an increase in volume of 7% and no variation in prices. These positive results were partially offset by lower sales of molybdenum that decreased by 23.5% due to drop in prices. As I mentioned, prices decreased by 35.6%, which was, in turn, partially compensated by the better volume that we had of 10.7%. \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $39.4 million or 3.4% when compared to the third quarter of 2019. Main cost increments has been in purchased copper, lower capitalized leachable material, workers participation and sales expenses. These cost increments were partially offset by a decrease in the use of operations, contractors, diesel and fuel cost, inventory consumption and operating and repair materials. \n The adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2020 was $1,125.9 million, which represented an increase of 24% with regard to the $907.7 million registered in the third quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin in this past quarter was situated at 52.9% versus 48.8% in the third quarter of 2019. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, EBITDA was 46.2% higher than in the second quarter of 2020. \n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.36 per pound in the third quarter of 2020. This represents an increase of $0.092 over the value reported in the second quarter of this year. This 7.3% increase in the operating cash cost is a result of an increase in cost per pound from production cost, treatment and refining charges and administrative expenses and was partially offset by an increase in the premium to refined copper sales. \n Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.645 per pound in the third quarter of 2020. This cash cost was $0.025 lower than the cash cost of $0.67 we reported in the second quarter of 2020. \n Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $374.3 million or $0.711 per pound in the third quarter of 2020. These figures represent a 19.8% increase when compared with the credit of $321.5 million or $0.593 per pound that we had in the second quarter of 2020. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc, silver and sulfuric acid. \n The third quarter of 2020 net income of $506 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.65 was 29.9% higher than the third quarter of 2019 net income. The net income margin for this past quarter was 23.8% versus 21% in the same quarter of 2019. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, net income was 95% higher than the one in the second quarter of 2020.\n Capital expenditures. Southern Copper investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. The conditions generated by the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted us to introduce new measures to reduce vulnerability at our project execution level. Sanitary measures include frequent COVID-19 testing, daily temperature checks, mask provision and mandatory use, social distancing at work sites and in the mine camps and an obligatory quarantine period for our own and contractors' personnel. In locations where infections are on the rise, some activity has been pushed back or scaled down, particularly at construction sites where personnel are required to work closely. All other engineering, procurement and construction activities that are not personnel intensive or where social distancing can be applied are being executed at a normal pace. At this point, we do not expect significant delays in project execution. \n For the Peruvian projects, our current portfolio for approved projects totaled $2.8 billion in Peru, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested, mainly at the Toquepala concentrator expansion. If we include the up and coming Michiquillay, $2.5 billion of CapEx; and Los Chancas, $2.6 billion of CapEx, our total investment program in Peru show a commitment of $7.9 billion. For the Tia Maria project in the Arequipa region of Peru, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the Islay province population. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We also promoted agriculture and livestock activities in the Tambo valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.\n In the third quarter of 2020, we received the results of our review of the social environment in the Tia Maria project, which was conducted by a global leader in the environmental, social and government assessments. This evaluation concluded the following regarding our project. The company has improved its community relations and the plan for water management system in place for the Tia Maria project is aligned with international standards. The company has aligned its corporate-wide practices with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, a multi-stakeholder initiative that promotes principles to guys tracking companies in the process to provide security for their operations in a manner that respect human rights. We're pleased and encouraged by these results, which reflects the positive impact of our company's social programs in Tia Maria's area of influence and in the Arequipa region. We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle.\n During the construction and operation phase, we will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria's construction phase. When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200 workers. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes. We expect the Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently take the necessary steps to provide Southern Copper with adequate support to initiate construction. \n For the Mexican projects, particularly on Buenavista, we have the zinc -- the new zinc concentrator for our Buenavista facility. This project is located between the facility and includes development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering study and the detailed engineering has reached 75% of completion. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 have been put in place. Purchase orders have been placed for major equipment, some of which is currently being manufactured. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. We expect to initiate operations in the third quarter of 2022. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and will provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n For the Pilares project, also in Sonora, this is a project that is located 6 kilometers from our operation of La Caridad. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks is under construction and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% ore grade from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million and we expect the project to begin production in the first half of 2022. \n In Sonora, we also have a project named El Pilar. This is a low capital intensity copper greenfield project that is strategically located approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.287%, which is a very good ore grade for leachable material. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million, and we expect the project to start production in 2023 with an expected mine life of 13 years. The results from experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. \n We're adding to our projects discussion, El Arco, which is a project in Baja California. El Arco is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula with ore reserves over 2.4 billion tons, an ore grade of 0.426% and 0.3 billion tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.288%. And it also has, as a by-product, gold, which has 0.11 grams of gold per ton of mineral. This product includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to situate at about 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 tons -- ounces of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. We're currently in the final stage of land acquisition process for the project. \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plan and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on October 22, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock payable on November 24 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 11 of this year. \n Well, with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us today, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. So, thank you, Andreas. Okay. On the Tia Maria, well, we do have all the permits now. So the next step will be to initiate the construction. That will be the basic next step that we're expecting to move on. In terms of the political environment, well, Peru is approaching elections. It will be on April 11 of next year. Obviously, when there is elections at the site, usually that makes a little bit harder to initiate new projects. And we are certainly considering that as part of our current outlook for the project. \n Regarding the by-products, well, we have -- at the press release, we indicated a reduction in our cash costs when compared to the third quarter of 2019. It was $0.82 in the third quarter of 2019, and it's been $0.65, that's 21.7% reduction year-on-year. Quarter-on-quarter, we had a slight variance, an increase, and that was the one that I mentioned in my report today. So before by-product credits, we have $1.36 per pound in this quarter, this past quarter. It was a little bit higher than the second quarter of 2020 cash cost by $0.092. I hope that this clarifies your concern. Yes. The reason is that we have to -- in the second quarter, in particularly, we had to slow down our operations quite significantly. In the third quarter, we are recuperating the pace, not only in terms of mine material but also in some other operations. For instance, certain maintenances that were postponed in the second quarter were tackled in the third one. So that's why we had a slight increase in our cash cost, still very, very good cash cost, by the way, but slightly higher than before by-product credits, the increasing was from about $1.27 to $1.36 per ton before credits. Okay. On dividends, well, the Board increased the dividend from $0.40 that we announced in July to $0.50 this past October 22. And it's always decided at the Board meeting what the dividend to pay. We think that the company has a very consistent track record of sending any cash that is perceived as excellent to the shareholders. That's what the company has done for quite a while. And -- but it's something that will have to be decided on an ongoing basis by the Board members. As you know, conditions are much more favorable price-wise in the products that we produce other than molybdenum. Molybdenum, sadly, is not keeping the price that it had last year, but that was about $12 per pound. Now it's close to $8 per pound, it's 1/3 of value loss. But all the other prices of products have improved; for copper, very significantly; silver and gold, obviously; and well, zinc remains pretty much the same, but that's basically it. So I think that as long as the company has some cash available, the Board will consider if that should be paid as a dividend. \n In the case of the Tia Maria, well, this -- the project suffered an evolution that required certain tasks to be accomplished. Currently, Tia Maria is [ completed ] on our side, has finished with all the permitting, and we are -- we have been doing a very strong and very successful, actually, social work in the area of the project. And we will -- are willing to move on with it. \n For El Arco, well, as I mentioned, it has initiating -- it is initiating its work to get the environmental impact assessment. We're getting land that is required for the project. So there are certain steps that we have to comply with in order to move on with the project. I don't see these 2 projects as this or that. I think that whenever they're mature to move on, the company will put the resources to do so. Well, the ones that we are reporting for our Mexican operations, Pilares and the zinc concentrators -- concentrator, the new zinc concentrator, are the ones that are being developed right now. So those are -- those 3 in Mexico and Tia Maria, okay? Besides those, we have the greenfield projects that are in Mexico and Peru. In the case of Peru, it is Tia Maria. And then we look at the project completion. Los Chancas is also a project that is well advanced. And Michiquillay is -- we're moving forward. We did very nicely, actually. So we think that these projects are being developed at a proper pace. And in Mexico, another greenfield project is El Arco, which is the one that I already commented on. Sure. Thank you for your questions, Jon. Well, for the Peruvian workforce, we have certain workers that, for different reasons, we haven't asked them to come back to work, mainly because they are on -- they have some restrictions due to certain health conditions. And that's a little bit more significant in Peru, given the protocols that the sanitary authorities has put in place than in Mexico. That's why we have -- we're operating with, as I'd say, about 65% of the workforce. These employees are being recalled to come back to work as we speak. We're already doing that. The process is relatively slow, and we're trying to catch up and having most of our workforce in our operations in the next few weeks, the Peruvian workforce. \n In the case of production versus sales, well, we're expecting to maintain a very close relationship between sales and production. Sometimes, as it happened in the last -- in the past quarter -- at the end of the second quarter, we couldn't ship all the material that we had already due to high fees at the Ilo port and some other inconveniences, but that -- well, obviously, we made an effort to catch up on that and that has been reflected in our sales volumes this past quarter. So we are currently normal regarding inventories and expect to maintain a very close relationship between our production and our sales. Certainly. Well, in the case of Peru, we had -- last year, we signed labor -- 3-year labor contracts with our unions, with most of them. One of them had slightly different time lag, but we do have a contract with them as well. So we don't see this as a problem now. We don't believe that we will have any inconveniences on that. \n In the case of the Mexican operations, they have a different arrangement for discussion of salaries. So far, we are not seeing any inconveniences regarding our labor force in Mexico as well. So we're -- in that regard, we are okay, I believe. As you may imagine, Jon, many people is quite concerned on the difficulties that both Mexico and Peru are facing due to the COVID pandemic. So labor discipline, I believe, it's very, very high in both countries where we operate. I'm sorry, I couldn't get your second question, Jens. You mean on the Mexican tax legislation? Is that what you mean? Okay. Okay. Let me first go into -- well, we reported a slight increase in our cash cost before by-product credits. So far, we're expecting a cash cost of about $0.70 for this year. It will have -- it will be either the same or slightly higher. It depends on how much maintenance we can catch up in this fourth quarter for this year. Now for 2021, we are expecting to have -- we're certainly catching up on maintenance expenditures, some that will require some more contractors work. And our current view is that we should have a cash cost of about $1 next year; for 2022, $0.98; and $0.94 in 2023. Let me mention that we will be including the production of the new projects in Mexico in these 2 years. In 2022, we will have the Pilares operation already producing about a -- a little bit more than 30,000 tons per year, 35,000 tons. And then in 2023, we will have El Pilar and the Buenavista zinc operation. That will certainly improve our production as well as the cost profile. \n Regarding the second, the proposal in the Mexican Congress, well, we don't want to speculate on this. When this is a firm decision by the Congress, we'll provide an idea of the impact, but at this point, we don't think that it's a good idea to mention on the impact because it's mainly speculative at this point. For next year or for now? Okay. For this year, we are expecting $1.35 before credits. And for next year, $1.64. By the way, we're -- this quarter, we are usually doing a major review on the outlook for the company. So it may vary a little bit when we report our view of the operations in the next quarter, in January. Sure. In the case of Lo Chancas, we have made a throughput -- a complete review on the project. And as a consequence, we found that -- well, basically, we're -- we have changed the mining plan, the long-term mining plan of the project. As a consequence, we will be doing less stripping and that will have an impact on the CapEx, of the CapEx of the project because it will require less equipment at the beginning of the investment as well as pre-stripping. So that -- those 2 components are the main explanation for the project reduction in CapEx. Well, currently, we have a sustaining capital that's in the range of $500 million per year. Obviously, we -- and that's considering the current production capacity. So once we finish our projects, and that will mean that we will be producing almost 2 million -- 1.8 million tons of copper, that will be our capacity. Then we should have obviously a much higher maintenance CapEx. Well, for a while, it will not press our equipments or our expenditures because the, well, new equipment usually requires less maintenance for a while and then you initiate a routine of maintenance. For now, we believe that, that should be at about 750 million tons (sic) [ $750 million ] for the long run. But that's something that we will be reviewing as we move on into 2028 when we believe we will be operating all the projects at full capacity. Yes, that's a fair assumption. We are rescheduling them. Well, this year, we had -- as you well mentioned, we had an initial budget that was much higher than what we expect to spend. And we are adjusting the current CapEx for 2020 to about $650 million. Of those, it has a mix of certain maintenance CapEx that we haven't been able to do. So we are not going to spend the money that we expect for maintenance CapEx for the reasons that I explained. Certain capital-related activities cannot be performed. Let's say, for instance, a technical visit to evaluate an equipment in some other country, well, you may not been able to travel to that country where the operation of the equipment that you want to buy is located. So you have to postpone certain expenses for reasons, technical reasons as well as sanitary reasons. \n And so we have been reducing our CapEx on an ongoing basis this year. At this point, we are not changing the view on the projects or the CapEx for maintenance that we have to do. We are in either event postponing a little bit expenses. The money that we have not spent through 2020, it's being distributed in the following years, 2021 and on. Could you -- we can -- Jean, we cannot copy you. Could you approach a little bit to the microphone. Sure. Yes. Okay. I got your second question. On the first one, I couldn't copy well what you said. Let me focus on that and then we'll tackle your second. Okay. Well, so far, we are seeing a reduction in demand and a reduction in supply. This is a crisis, the COVID-19 crisis, economic crisis, for copper, it's a different than -- it's different situation than what we usually faced in the past. Let me explain why. Usually, when you had a market turmoil that reduced economic growth worldwide, what we saw in the copper market was a reduction in demand, but supply remained basically intact. So adjustments in supply came after a while due to much lower prices than the ones that are sustainable long term. So those lower prices produced shutting down of high-cost operations, and that's how the market move on towards economic equilibrium for the copper market. That's, say, what happened in the 2008, 2009 recession, worldwide. We had lower demand than lower supply. \n In this case, due to the COVID impact in the operations of different copper producers, we had both supply and demand decrease. And now we are at a much lower level of demand and supply. Our commercial team has indicated that they are expecting -- or they believe that demand has decreased in 2020 by about 700,000 tons and supply has decreased by about 350,000 tons. That's for 2020.\n At the same time, we're seeing different events that are supporting copper prices. I mentioned the liquidity available at the different central banks, particularly the European Central Bank and the Fed has provided to the market. That is certainly helping to maintain economic activities and metal prices at a good level. Also a concern from -- for different actors at this market is what is happening in Chile, where labor talks are affecting about 50% of the Chile's supply this -- in the next 12 months. And that's on the supply side. And on the demand, we're seeing a very strong recovery from China and other Asian economies that are demanding copper. And we're expecting a positive outlook for this coming year. And that's why we have this positive view on the copper price. That's why I have to comment on that. Could you mention your second concern, please, Jean? We're not copying you. Okay. Let's move on. He may reconnect, and we'll take the call whenever he's back. Certainly. Good talking to you, Rodolfo. For copper, we're expecting 996,500 tons; for molybdenum, 29,400 tons. Okay. Well, we already commented on that, and we're following a plan to catch up on all the maintenance and some other activities that we had to postpone due to the pandemic. A portion of that has been already absorbed by our operations and will be the case for now and at least 2 quarters of next year. At the same time, we're seeing certain synergies that we're getting by doing -- finding out different ways to do what we are doing now. And that is -- there are some saving opportunities that are -- were foreseen for the future. We will report on that when we have more clarity. But at this point, the plan is to do the maintenance that we have postponed and try to be as much efficient as we can by addressing these different works in the next few quarters. Well, they have been paid, so we never stopped paying them. The Peruvian legislation, in this case, asked them for -- asked for them to recuperate the time that they have been not working. So we're developing a plan, so they can pay back that time. That's one thing. The other one is that we have incurred in certain expenditures related to this situation, we have to pay some extra labor time. It was, relatively speaking, a small amount, $16 million, that we have to spend in our operations due to COVID-19 labor or production inconveniences. So most of it is for extra labor for the ones that could work at the premises of the company. Ones that are not working will have to pay back the salaries that they have received, and there are different ways that they can do that. And that's following the Peruvian legislation regarding this matter. Certainly. Let me follow in a sec, please. Okay. For next year, we are expecting to spend $1.4 billion; for 2022, $1.8 billion; 2023, $2.2 billion; 2024, $2.9 billion. So basically, we're rescheduling our expenses. The ones that we are not exercising this year and a little bit -- that has some kind of a waterfall in terms of rescheduling of expenditures for CapEx. Well, it's -- there are some expenses that -- for instance, all the equipment that could be acquired, we already -- we have already put the purchase orders on that. Some of that will be paid, particularly for the new concentrator at Buenavista, will be paid this quarter, about $70 million of that. And then it varies depending on the different projects. It's not specific for different projects in this case. Okay. I have -- the gentleman that disconnected has e-mailed us. His question is on the molybdenum market. He is indicating why molybdenum price is the only one that is going down. Well, that's a question that we also do ourselves. Actually, it's -- there is plenty of supply, and that's why. This is Jean Bruny's question from BBVA. It's basically excess supply in the market. Molybdenum is also related to certain industry that, well, won't be favored by current circumstances, such as airplane manufacturing, for instance. That's one of the consumers of molybdenum in the stainless steel alloys that they use for this. \n Okay. Let me -- well, with this, we conclude our conference call for today. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report for the fourth quarter of this year and the full year 2020. Thank you very much, and have a nice day today."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation's Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation's Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President of Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the second quarter of 2020 as well as answer any questions that you might have. \n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. \n Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP.  \n Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Victor. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. Participating with me in today's conference are Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member.  \n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during these trying times. In today's call, we will begin with an update on the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations. We will then review the copper market and Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results and expansion projects. After that, we will open the session for questions.  \n We continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic by prioritizing efforts to safeguard the health and well-being of our workforce, their families and nearby communities. Our company is operating in total compliance with the emergency levels required by local, regional and national governments, and we have implemented rigorous hygiene, sanitation and safety protocols at all our facilities. As of June 30, about 83% of our workforce in Mexico and 64% of the workforce in Peru are working at the operations while at home. Recently, we have opened limited access to company premises to our most essential contractors, as part of the protocol followed by our contractors must comply with proper COVID-19 testing, clinical monitoring and mandatory quarantine. We're enforcing multiple actions to limit workforce exposure to the disease by imposing travel restrictions, prohibiting face-to-face meetings, urging frequent hand washing and require adherence to all other health, safety and social distancing measures created by government authorities. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Southern Copper has been implementing strong prevention measures to protect the health of its workers, their families and their communities.  \n For this purpose, the company has approved a budget of $11.2 million for donation and general support for the populations of Peru and Mexico. To date, the majority of this budget has been executed, and we are considering a second budget for this purpose. To bolster response to the pandemic, we have donated medical supplies and dozens of medical ventilators for breathing support at hospitals in the communities where we operate. In Mexico, we have set up 135 confined beds in company-owned housing in Sonora, Guanajuato and Campeche to serve as temporary sanitary facilities for people presenting symptoms of respiratory disease who require isolation or primary hospital care. In Peru, the company is donating 25,000 liters per week of liquid oxygen to national hospitals to treat the population infected with COVID-19 in the regions of Arequipa and Moquegua in Southern Peru. On top of this initiative, we are donating a COVID-19 molecular testing laboratory to the Moquegua region. While for the Tacna region, we are about to donate an oxygen plant with a capacity of 720 cubic meters per day of medicinal oxygen. We have also donated over 63,000 items for personal protection equipment to medical staff and 25,000 personal hygiene kits to our workers and to the population in our areas of influence. These donations include information for the population about COVID-19 disease spread and symptoms. We have also donated cleaning and personal protection equipment to members of the National Guard of Mexico and of the Peruvian Police and Army.  \n Additionally, we're helping vulnerable individuals such as the elderly or disabled persons and pregnant women by donating more than 43,000 kits containing food and personal hygiene items. In addition to the aforementioned efforts, we have installed more than 200 portable sinks in strategic areas of the communities to ensure access to preventive hand washing. Moreover, to bolster compliance with stay-at-home measures, the company is offering over 2,000 sports, cultural and educational workshops online. Additionally, throughout our community care service, we offer free medical, psychological counseling 24 hours a day. Southern Copper is making every effort to keep the pace of production at satisfactory levels while achieving a competitive cash cost. This is reflected in our second quarter 2020 cash cost per pound of $0.67 net of by-product credits. In this past quarter, we managed to maintain our production level by focusing on mineral production and prioritizing high mineral ore grade mining. Operational stripping, particularly at the Peruvian operations, and major maintenance activities were temporarily postponed and will be addressed in the next 9 months. We believe that our strong financial position, cost competitiveness and copper reserve will allow us to overcome these difficult times.  \n Considering the current environment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that mining production and investment will play an important role in the recovery of both the Mexican and Peruvian economies. As such, we will continue to develop our projects, consistent with our belief that Southern Copper's operations constitute risk control generators of economic resources that provide well-remunerated employment and tax revenues to the countries in which we operate.  \n Let me now focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the second quarter of 2020, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased from an average of $2.77 per pound in the second quarter of 2019 to $2.42 per pound. This is a 12.6% reduction in its price. As of today, we are seeing prices slightly higher than $2.90 per pound, which reflects the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on both the supply and demand for copper. At this point, the copper price seems to be driven basically by 2 factors: expectations of lack of supply in major producing countries such as Chile and Peru due to COVID-19 outbreaks and an increase in China's demand in this scenario of an economic recovery for this country. Since the pandemic is affecting both supply and demand, at this point, it is difficult to assess the long-term effects of this crisis on the copper market balance and consequently on copper prices. \n Now let's focus on Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2020. Copper represented 82.3% of our sales in the second quarter of this year. Copper production registered a slight decrease of 1.3% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and situated at 243,097 tons in the second quarter of 2020. This was primarily due to lower production at our Buenavista and Toquepala mines because of lower ore grades. This effect was partially offset by higher production at the Cuajone mine due to higher ore grades and recoveries as well as to higher production at the IMMSA after operations resumed at the San Martin mine.  In 2020, we expect to produce 997,100 tons of copper, in line with last year's production and is slightly lower than our production plan. \n For molybdenum, it represented 6% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of 2020 and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $8.24 per pound in the quarter compared to $12.13 in the second quarter of last year. This is a 32.1% decrease. Molybdenum production increased by 16.3% in the past quarter compared to the same period of 2019 due to significantly higher production at our Toquepala mine. We produced 1,237 tons of molybdenum from our new molybdenum plant of Toquepala. This is a 44.8% increase in this facility, the Toquepala mine facility for molybdenum. Production also rose at Cuajone with an increase of 25.2% due to higher grades and recoveries. In 2020, we expect to produce 28,500 tons of molybdenum, which represents an increase of 5.9% over last year's production level of 26,900 tons and an increase through our plan for this year. \n Silver represented 5.6% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2020 with an average price of $16.54 per ounce in the quarter, up 11.4% from the second quarter of 2019. Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production increased by 13.5% in the second quarter as a result of higher production at IMMSA after production resumed at the San Martin mine. In addition, there was higher production at the La Caridad mine as a result of higher grades as well as higher production at the Cuajone mine in Peru due to higher grades and recoveries. Silver production increased by 27.5% in the second quarter from the same quarter of -- from the similar quarter of 2019 as a result of growth in all of our facilities. In 2020, we expect to produce 22.7 million ounces of silver, an increase of 11.7% when compared to 2019. This is mainly attributable to the significant contribution of the San Martin mine and the Santa Barbara mine, both operations at the IMMSA company, our IMMSA subsidiary. Regarding silver, we believe that prices will be supported by the intensive industrial use of this metal and the fact that silver, like gold, is considered a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. \n Zinc represented 2.7% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2020, with an average price of $0.89 per pound in the quarter, a price decrease of 28.8% from the second quarter of 2019. Zinc mine production decreased by 11.5% quarter-on-quarter to situate at 15,706 tons. This was primarily due to lower production in the Charcas mine and to the shutdown of our Santa Eulalia operation due to severe flooding. We're currently evaluating different options to supply the concentrator of Santa Eulalia. These negative variances in zinc production were partially offset by a production increase of 2,821 tons. This is an increase of 249% at the San Martin mine. Refined zinc production decreased by 13% in the second quarter of 2020. \n For our financial results in the second quarter of this year, sales were $1.8 billion, which represented a decrease of $32.6 million with regard to the sales reported in the second quarter of 2019. This is a 1.8% reduction in revenues or sales. The sales volume for copper increased 11% -- excuse me for a second please. The sales volume for copper increased by 11%, and its value was up 1.4% in a scenario of lower copper prices. In this case, due to copper, we had -- we mentioned a reduction in sales value of 12.6%. Regarding our main by-products, we registered higher sales of silver that increased by 44.2% due to higher volume and prices. Also, higher sales for gold that increased by 69.4% due to higher volumes and prices. In contrast, we reported lower sales for molybdenum by 30.7% due to lower prices, partially offset by a higher volume of 15.4%. And also, we had a decrease in sales of zinc by 36% due to both lower volumes and prices. Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $103.8 million or 9.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2019. The main cost increments are associated with purchased copper, lower capitalized leachable material, higher inventory consumption and other factors. These cost increments were partially compensated by lower diesel and fuel cost, repair materials and operations contractors and operating materials and supply. \n Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was $770 million, which represented a decrease of 18.3% with regard to the $942.8 million registered in the second quarter of 2019. The adjusted EBITDA margin of the second quarter was situated at 43.1% versus 51.9% in the second quarter of 2019. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, EBITDA was 7.1% higher than in the first quarter of 2020. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.26 per pound in the second quarter of 2020. This is $0.166 lower than the value for the first quarter of 2020. The 11% decrease in the operating cash cost is a result of lower cost per pound from production that decreased 13.1% that was partially offset by higher treatment and refining charges, administrative expenses and lower premiums. Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.67 per pound in the second quarter of 2020. This cash cost was $0.094 lower than the cash cost of $0.764 that we had in the first quarter of 2020. This is a 12.3% reduction in cash costs quarter-on-quarter. \n Regarding our by-products, we had a total credit of $321.5 million or $0.593 per pound in the second quarter of 2020. These figures represent a 9.7% decrease when compared with the credit of $340.2 million or $0.657 per pound in the first quarter of 2020. Total credits have increased for silver by 27.2%, gold for 60.4% but has decreased for molybdenum and zinc and sulfuric acid. Net earnings or net income attributable to SCC shareholders in the second quarter of 2020 was $259.5 million. This is 14.5% of sales or diluted earnings per share of $0.34. This figure compares with net income attributable to SCC shareholders for the second quarter of 2019 of $402.4 million. This is a 22.1% of sales or diluted earnings per share of $0.52. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, net income was 20.8% higher than in the first quarter of 2020. \n Capital expenditures. Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. In the second quarter of this year, we spent $113.3 million on capital investments, which reflected a 37.2% decrease with regard to the same period in 2019 and represented a 43.7% of net income this quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent $214.3 million on capital investments, which represented 45.2% of net income. As a consequence of global COVID-19 conditions, new measures to reduce vulnerability have been introduced in our project execution practices. Sanitary measures include rapid tests, daily temperature checks, mask provision and mandatory use, social distancing on work sites and in the camps and a quarantine period for our own and contractors' personnel. Locations where infections are on the rise, some activities have been pushed back or scaled down, particularly on construction sites where personnel are required to work closely. All other engineering, procurement and construction activities that are not personnel-intensive, where social distances can be applied, are being executed at a normal pace. At this point, we don't expect a significant delays in project execution. \n Our current portfolio for Peruvian projects totals $2.8 billion of approved projects, of which $1.6 billion has been already invested. Considering the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion investment and Los Chancas $2.8 billion investment projects, our total investment program in Peru will increase to $8.1 billion. For Tia Maria, as you know, on July 8, 2019, we were granted the construction permit for an SX-EW copper greenfield project to produce 120,000 tons a year with a capital budget of $1.4 billion. The government awarded the permit after completing -- after the company completed an exhaustive review process of environmental and social matters and determined that the company had complied with all regulatory requirements after addressing all observations made. The challenges surrounding the construction permit were overcome when on October 30, 2019, the Mining Council of the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines ratified the construction permit for the Tia Maria project. \n For the Mexican projects, the Buenavista zinc concentrator in Sonora, as I say, it's a facility located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering study and the detailed engineering analysis is underway. Site preparation has begun and stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 have been put in place. Purchase orders have been placed for major equipment and some is already being manufactured. The project has all the necessary permits. The capital budget is $413 million, and we expect to initiate operations in the third quarter of 2022. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and will provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n The Pilares project in Sonora, it's located 6 kilometers from the La Caridad mine. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper concentrate, a new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks is under construction and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% ore grade -- average ore grade from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, and we expect the project to begin production in the first half of 2022. \n El Pilar project in Sonora, it's a low capital intensity copper greenfield project, which is located about 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.287%. El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine and copper cathodes will be produced using highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million, and we expect the project to start production in 2023.  Construction at the pilot plant and experimental pads has end, and tests are being performed. We're glad to report that the first results from experimental tests on leaching process has confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery.  \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review at each Board meeting the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plan and all financial needs in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on July 23, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock payable on August 25 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 12 of this year.  \n Well with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  And our first question will come from the line of Jonathan Brandt from HSBC. \nJonathan Brandt: Congratulations on the results. I first wanted to ask you about the project. So I know you were saying that you don't expect material delay. I'm just wondering sort of why that is. Are you assuming that -- are things sort of getting back to normal now with the project work? Are you expecting to make it up? If you could help me sort of understand there isn't more of a delay in the projects, that would be helpful. And then secondly, it'd be great if you could sort of touch upon what you're seeing from your clients in terms of demand for copper. Are you continuing to sell to sort of the traditional clients that you always do? Are you seeing interest from sort of your nontraditional clients given the potential for supply disruptions from other parts of the supply chain? That would be great. \nRaul Jacob: On the projects, we have, as I mentioned, we have implemented several COVID-19 combat measures that our -- at our projects as well. I explained them a few minutes ago. And we have 2 situations here for the projects. Certain activities are required or are performed at a certain level of isolation. Let me say, for instance, if you have to, for example, travel or do some land works, most likely, the individuals involved in this are not in contract. And particularly, we stress the fact that they have to maintain social distance and use the proper equipment. So even though certain activities have been postponed, we are still working on all the engineering that we can perform on a safe mode and operations that are keeping social distance and other COVID-19 precautionary measures. We expect to catch up, basically. We are seeing now a slight delay. It's probably a couple of months, and we want to catch up on that. Regarding our clients, I'd like to remind our audience that our copper production, it's a very high quality. We offer -- we guarantee four nines. That is 99.99% of our refined copper. And our concentrate sales are for what you will call nowadays a clean concentrate, which is a high-quality concentrate. So we haven't had much trouble with our clients. Maybe one or 2 requesting a delay in the shipments that we have programmed, but nothing significant to note at this point. We are not seeing a change in the way that our clients operate. They are keeping our contracts. By the way, this is the same pattern that we observed at the prior crisis in 2008, 2009 in the sense that the quality of our copper make us to be preferred on top of some other producers. That's a personal assumption. \nJonathan Brandt: Okay. Just to follow-up on the project question. If sort of COVID lingers for longer and some of these restrictions that are currently in place sort of remain in place, could we potentially see sort of longer delays to some of the projects if things sort of don't improve? And sort of at what point do you -- would you start the construction progress where you would sort of have to delay it? So I understand how with the engineering and things like that, you're not sort of in close proximity to other people. But at what point does the constructions have to start in order to meet these time lines that you've laid out? \nRaul Jacob: Well we don't like to speculate on different possibility of a worsened scenario -- in a scenario that's worse vis-a-vis what we have today. What we are reporting is what we see now. If there is a more difficult environment to operate, then we'll certainly have to maintain, as a top priority, the safety of our workforce and the health of our workforce and our contractors as well. That includes, obviously, the capital projects. So I don't want to speculate on that. What we are seeing now, if conditions remain as they are now, we will be -- we'll need to catch up later on in the future on these projects. I believe that a delay of 2 months or so that we may have now for some of the projects and some others that have been moving forward, as I explained, should or could be recuperated over time. \nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Thiago Ojea from Goldman Sachs. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America. \nTimna Tanners: I wanted to drill down a little bit more on your cost commentary. So it's clearly a really impressive result, as you point out. How should we -- I'm trying to drill down how much of that is sticky? And how much of that was due to the delays in or suspension of stripping and maintenance? In your commentary, you mentioned that it could take 9 months for you to do some of that catch up. So will it be like spread out over those 9 months equally? Should we expect more -- if this was a lower cost than normal quarter? Should we expect higher costs than normal for three quarters? If you could just help understand what to expect on cost side. \nRaul Jacob: Certainly, Timna. As I say, we have to prioritize to maintain levels at our plants to do the very focused work in order to produce the mineral that was required to fit our concentrators and the plants that we have.  That -- the cost of that for the future was to postpone certain maintenance and certain stripping, particularly at the Peruvian operations. We believe that this -- the catch-up on the stripping will be spread through the 9 months that I mentioned. For the year, we're expecting a cash cost before by-product rates of $1.37 per pound. Currently, for the 6 months that we have had already, it's $1.34. So it's a $0.03 of additional cost that we will incur. It's about $170 million that should be spread through time in the next few months. As I say, it's 9 months for the most important -- certain maintenances were scheduled for the past 2 months or 3 months, and we have been reprogrammed them as proper for depending on the condition of the equipment for this quarter and the next ones. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. Just to clarify then, the $1.37 is the forecast for the year from $1.34 year-to-date. That's across all operations, not just Peru so the Peru impact... \nRaul Jacob: For the whole corporation, yes. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. Perfect. So just wanted to ask maybe a basic question, taking a step back. It's been remarkable how little your operations seem to have been affected by COVID-19. You've been -- despite some of the pretty severe actions taken in Peru and Mexico. So do you think that that's sustainable? Is it possible that there's not really any further lockdown and you're able to continue to produce in both those geographies? And then if while you're at it, if you could give us any update on Tia Maria that it's been a year, as you point out, since the license was granted. \nRaul Jacob: Certainly. Well in our mining operations, in some cases, as is the case of the Peruvian mines and some of the Mexican operations as well we have the possibility of -- we have had the possibility of isolating our operations because of the nature of where they are located. Let me put as an example of what happens with the Toquepala mine in Peru. It's 150 kilometers away from the nearest city. So we agree, and we certainly appreciate the help of our unions on this, we agree to have a strict lockdown, defined as if you go out, you can't get back until the quarantine ends. That was what we did. And we took several measures to control the supply chain that we have to feed this operation and provide all the services, food, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that is required by our workforce. And we have operated through the lockdown with these characteristics, and we haven't had any cases during -- at the operations of these facilities for quite a while. That allows us to maintain a proper production environment. And by the way, in the Peruvian operations, we -- the workers have their families living at the premises in the town site, nearby the mines and the metallurgical facilities. In the case of Tia Maria, well we have expressed several times that the company has all the permits that are required for initiating the production of the construction of the project. We believe that this is -- the pandemic has make us much more clear for the local population of the importance of this project, and we are expecting the national government to work with us in order to move on with the project in a time where this kind of investment that will create about 9,000 jobs while in construction will be a good possibility of improving the economic environment in both the Islay province and the Arequipa region. We're expecting, in this case, to move on with the project at any time. We're ready for that. We want the Peruvian government to concur with this view and then move forward with the operation. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Andreas Bok (sic) [ Bokkenheuser ] from UBS. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Just one question from me. So just one clarification on your sales strategy versus your production strategy in the second quarter and first half as a whole. I mean we obviously saw sales volumes up more than production was obviously down a bit. Was that purely just buying more concentrate from third-party operators and selling that onwards? Or did you do any destocking as well of any of your inventories on site?  And maybe related to that, if there was any destocking, would you expect any restocking on your behalf in the second half of the year and maybe for sales volumes to slow down a bit? So that's basically a second half kind of sales volume outlook question. \nRaul Jacob: Andreas, well we had -- at the end of the first quarter, we had some inventory buildup of production in process that was finished through the quarter. And we, at the very beginning of the pandemic, had some difficulties in shipping some of our production, but that was very quickly solved. And we could deliver our shipments as scheduled. So that allows us to sell this excess inventories of production that we have through the second quarter. That explains the difference in sales vis-a-vis productions.  In the case of the concentrate purchases, we have -- for technical reasons, we're buying some concentrates that have certain characteristics that allow us to mix with our own concentrate, use our smelting and refining facilities at a much higher capacity or almost at full capacity nowadays because of the quality of the concentrates that we buy. These concentrates mix very well with our own, and that creates certain synergies that allow us to reduce the smelting and refining costs, which, by the way, our smelters have -- has had a record in cash cost at the Peruvian operations. \nOperator: Our next question come from the line of Jens Spiess from Morgan Stanley. \nJens Spiess: Congrats on the results. Just -- I just want to know if your $1.37 cash cost guidance includes the impact of improved sanitary standards and testing of your workforce. And also, if you could give us an updated guidance for production, cash costs and CapEx for other years. \nRaul Jacob: Certainly. Okay. Yes, it does. The $1.37 includes all the expenditures that we have had at the operational side of our facilities in both Mexico and Peru. In total, we have spent a little bit less than $12 million in this past quarter for sanitary standards, et cetera. This includes -- let me explain what I mean. This money is just for purposes of maintaining proper working conditions with -- for our workforce. It does not include the donations that we're doing that are included in some -- in the administrative expenses for the company. And in the case of cash cost and production guidance, certainly -- for production, I mentioned already our forecast for the year, but I'm repeating it now. We're expecting to produce 997,100 tons of copper for 2020. Our production will be pretty much flat all the way to 2023. For 2021, we're expecting to produce 986,300 tons; 2018 -- 2022, 949 -- 950,000; 2023, where we will have the beginning impact of Pilares, Buenavista zinc and El Pilar, we're expecting to increase our production to 1,066,000 tons. For 2024, we're expecting to produce 1,104,000 tons, and this is basically the result of having Pilares, Buenavista zinc, El Pilar and a partial production of Tia Maria. In the case of cash cost for this year, I already mentioned that we are expecting an overall for the whole corporation cash cost before by-product credits of $1.37. In credit, we're expecting $0.60 per pound of copper. That give us $0.77 per pound for the year, slightly higher than what we're expecting now. As you know, cash cost is one of the most difficult things to predict because it has not only the cost impact on several supplies, such as fuel, power, et cetera, labor and -- but also the impact on price -- of prices on our by-products. I mentioned already -- I mentioned already silver price, an average silver price for the quarter of about $16.54 per ounce of silver. And as you know, now it's over $20. It's much higher than that even today. So it will vary, but that's our forecast at this point, $0.77 per ton. For the next few years, well we're assuming an increase in our cash cost due to the price deck that we're considering for the next years and certain ore grades variances that we have in different operations. Overall, we will have -- we're expecting a cash cost of about $0.93 for 2021, $0.96 for 2022, $0.88 for 2023 and $0.87 for 2024. \nJens Spiess: Okay. And just to be clear, you said $12 million per quarter spend on increased sanitary standards and testing? \nRaul Jacob: No. I'd say that so far, $12 million. \nJens Spiess: So far? \nRaul Jacob: I don't think that we will be spending -- so far, yes. That includes like a onetime expenditure for different items that are at inventories right now, let's say, medical supplies. We have several medical supplies that are at disposal for our -- are ready-to-use for -- by our workforce, and that will be consumed through the year. So let me add a little bit on what -- your question. The COVID-19 requires a big effort on our site and our workforce and everybody to contain it. But we haven't had a major damage to any of our facilities or anything that requires a significant expenditure. We're basically focusing on having the proper medical supplies, the social distancing. Several measures to maintain social distance has been undertaken. For instance, the capacity of the shuttles that transport our personnel has been reduced. So you have to spend a little bit more money renting some additional buses, for instance. But that -- those are relatively speaking, minor expenditures given the size of our operations. \nJens Spiess: Okay. So you're not required to test your workforce? \nRaul Jacob: No, we do. We do. And we are including the testing in what I just said. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Grant Sporre from Bloomberg Intelligence. \nGrant Sporre: Just -- it's -- I guess it's a follow-up question from my side. You've obviously given guidance for production for this year. But given the delays in maintenance and stripping, at what point does that start to impact your production going forward? If for some reason, you can't achieve the schedule that you would like. So that's my first question. And the second one is, I guess, just to complete on the CapEx guidance and following up from the last question, you gave production and cash costs. Just if you could give us CapEx guidance as well that would be great. \nRaul Jacob: Certainly, Grant. Well we have been operating our facilities not at full capacity in the past quarter for a while. Then we're able to increase the capacity as we move on into having less restrictions, generally speaking, in both Mexico and Peru. We don't want to find out when this is going to impact our production delay and maintenance and such. We're focusing on scheduling them as we come with the proper workforce in our facilities and the contractors that, in some cases, perform this maintenance of major equipment. We are in that process. We expect to have, by the end of this quarter, most of our workforce at the operations already. So we are basically focusing on being sure that how -- the way that we're operating won't be affected by major, major -- any major maintenance. We were relatively lucky in the sense that we did significant maintenance of our smelter facilities in Peru last year. We have to do each 2 years a major maintenance to the smelter. Well it was scheduled for 2019, we perform it. And this facility and the refineries are in good shape. The same happened in some of our operations in the mining side in Mexico. And we focus quite a bit on having all of our production line with proper maintenance, which is preventive maintenance in most of the cases. And that is certainly useful to situations like this. On CapEx, our current guidance is as follows: for this year, we're reducing our CapEx guidance from $1.10 billion to $800 million. We're expecting a reduction of about a little bit more than $300 million in capital expenditures in 2020. That money will be reallocated to 2021, most of it. For next year, we're expecting $1.7 billion of capital expenditures. For 2022, $2 billion. For 2023, $2.9 billion and for 2024, $2.7 billion.  This is to have the 3 projects that we have in Mexico, the Buenavista zinc, the Pilares project and the El Pilar project. These 3 projects, up and running by the end of 2023 and at full capacity in 2024 and also to accommodate the Tia Maria investment that we should initiate, if not this year, next one and the Michiquillay project and the Chancas projects. In this case, for Michiquillay and Los Chancas, they will be -- they will not be in operation by 2024. We will be on the investing part of the projects at that time. \nOperator: Our next question will come from line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos. \nJohn Tumazos: There were earlier questions about your costs I don't want to duplicate, but the questioners might have stressed deferring maintenance or deferring stripping or COVID costs. But how much of the $0.67 cash cost simply was the decline in crude oil prices or weaker currencies? And now crude is back over $40, that's an upward pressure? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you very much for your question, John. Let me comment on that. We had -- for diesel and fuel, we have savings of $38.5 million. That's on the average price that we had in the second quarter. We have, for labor cost, a reduction of about $10 million, mainly due to exchange rate. That's for the second quarter. We expect -- well exchange rates seems to be for a while where they are, so we should be having some savings on that regard. On fuel, yes, there is a recovery. We're still not back to where we were before the COVID-19 crisis initiated, so we will be capturing a portion of these savings through the year. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Thiago Ojea from Goldman Sachs. \nThiago Ojea: Sorry, I think I had an issue with the telephone for. I think what I would like to understand a little bit better is, it seems that your volumes comparing to peers were better. Do you expect -- although your volumes increase, that for the entire industry, especially in the country that you operate in, Peru and Mexico, that you're going to outpace your peers in terms of volume output? \n And the second question is, do you see the supply globally being weaker that this could be a favor in terms of demand? It seems that now the COVID-19 is starting to ease. So thinking more 6 months, 12 months, do you see an important difference on the supply and demand stabilization? \nRaul Jacob: Sure. Well I think that we have certain conditions in our operations that allow us with a very detailed and thoughtful plan to maintain -- or to catch up on our production level once we have the possibility. As you -- as I mentioned before, certain -- some of our facilities are relatively isolated. And the workers are performing -- being this a very high capital-intensive industry, you may have a facility that is huge, where maybe 40 workers are on a daily basis, and they are spread through a big area, so they have no contact to be sure. And particularly, if you stress that they can't relate as they used to with their fellow workers, that has helped us. As I mentioned, we focus specifically on prioritizing mineral production. So you have with this combination of 2 factors that has been in our favor. As I mentioned before, as an example, Toquepala mine, due to the fact that it was constructed in the 1960s of the past century, and at that time, you have to provide the housing facilities to the workforce and their families. And so what we have in some of our operations are little towns actually, where you have a bank agency, a hospital, a market, churches, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So that plus a very mature attitude of our workforce allow us to maintain operations, keeping social distance and operating at the very beginning of the pandemic with very little personnel, basically maintaining our operations at a lower than the usual rate. And then we -- as conditions were understood by the authorities, we could improve and increase our production and operation. And by focusing on better areas of the mine, we were able to produce the copper that has been reported. \n Now regarding the supply and demand balance for this current situation, it's hard to say. This is an unusual market circumstance. Usually, when you have a slowdown in the world economy, what you have in the copper and other metals markets is a reduction in demand, not necessarily in supply. The major difference of this COVID-19 pandemic is that not only demand, but supply is also affected. So we have had supply reductions in different countries. Peru and Chile together produce about 40% of the world supply of copper. And as you know, both countries have had, in different operations, at different levels depending on each of the -- on each company, a significant impact or a reduced impact depending on the company, on the production. That's a major difference to some other circumstances. As I say, if we talk about the 2008-2009 crisis, that was basically a big drop in demand. What we saw at that time, supply was fine. I mean, well obviously, after a while, you had shutting downs of certain premises, high-cost premises by different companies, and that helped to balance the market. But in this case, that process, well we are not seeing that as of now because as I said, supply has been affected as well as demand. \n Where are we going? Well I expect the supply to catch up eventually. For now, we're seeing different countries and companies struggling with supply issues due to COVID-19 outbreaks. Hopefully, that will cease, and we'll see a recovery. But at this point, it's very hard to either predict or confirm where supply and demand balance will be in the future. \nThiago Ojea: Just a final question. The Latin American countries are suffering a lot with the pandemic. Mexico is one of the most affected, and the economies are being affected, and therefore, your tax collection is also being affected. Late last year, there were a few congressmen in Mexico proposing different mining deals and an increase on royalties and taxes. Do you see this as a potential source of concern for the mining industry in Mexico? Do you think that this could be now, given the economic situation, proposed again or something towards that line? \nRaul Jacob: No. At this point, we don't see anything related to that. Nobody is talking about specific new taxation for mining companies or operations at Mexico or Peru. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Alfonso Salazar from Scotiabank. \nAlfonso Salazar: I have one clarification, if I may. You mentioned that production was not at full capacity, is that right? Because I see, actually, in the quarter was above 250,000 tons that if you analyze that, it's more than a million tons a year. So if that is correct or not? \n And regarding the situation in Cananea, because some of the Peruvian mines seem to be more far away from the city's [ port stacks ]. It's not the case of Cananea, which is very close to the town. So what's the situation there? If you -- what's the COVID situation in Cananea? Do you have any cases in that mine? If you can comment anything on that. \n Also 1 year ago, if you remember, there were some costs that's going to take place precisely 1 year because it was the anniversary of the strike that started in 2007. But I haven't heard anything for this year. Apparently, there are no protests there taking place this time. If you can just mention anything about it. \nRaul Jacob: Hold on a second please, Alfonso. Okay. Well we -- at the beginning of the pandemic, we were not able to operate at full capacity. We were operating with about 40% of the workforce in Mexico and a similar number in Peru. So we were not reaching full capacity at that time. Then we have been operating -- if you see our concentrators, they were not milling as much mineral as they could on a daily basis. But they were milling much higher ore grade minerals, so that allows us to catch up on the production side. When you add a higher ore grade mineral, you have not only the benefit of that higher ore grade, but also the possibility of recuperating a slightly higher percentage of copper per ton of mineral. So those 2 factors have helped us to produce as we have reported this past quarter. \n Now regarding the Cananea, as you well mentioned, Alfonso,  the Cananea town is nearby or almost side-by-side with the Buenavista mine that we have. We had about 18 cases of COVID at the Cananea. It's a relatively small number. You consider the size of our workforce over there is, well, less than 1% of our workforce. And so far, we haven't had any major or any deceased to regret in this case. That's basically it. \n We haven't had any impact on what you say about the strike. I think that the workforce is acting very -- in a very mature way in our operations, as I stressed in different parts of this presentation. \nAlfonso Salazar: Very good, Raul. Just one follow-up. If you are -- we're using high-grade ore at the beginning of the pandemic, should we expect lower grades going forward or at some point? \nRaul Jacob: We have to mine certain parts of the operations where you have not as good ore grades as we have mined before. That will have an impact in cost, and -- but we're expecting to fulfill our forecast for the year, as I indicated before. \nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking from Citi. \nAlexander Hacking: I just have 2 quick clarifications, if that's okay. Did you say that the target for copper production next year is 949,000 tons? Did I hear that correctly? \nRaul Jacob: Hold on a second please, Alex. For this year, we're expecting 997,100. And for next year, it's 986,300. Yes. \nAlexander Hacking: Oh, 996,000? Okay. \nRaul Jacob: 9-8-6. 9-8-6. \nAlexander Hacking: Okay, 9-8-6. And then the other clarification was just on the CapEx. Did you -- you said $800 million for this year? Is that correct? \nRaul Jacob: Yes, that's correct. \nAlexander Hacking: But you only spent $200 million and less than $250 million in the first half. I guess why are we going to see such a huge ramp-up in the second half of the year? \nRaul Jacob: Well, one of the reasons for that is that we will be doing -- paying the bills that we have put as purchase orders at the first half of this year for, say, the Buenavista concentrator, the Pilares, some of the expenditures that we have to do in order to initiate the mine operation of Pilares in the next year or so. So that's basically it. It's basically paying bills on purchase orders that we have put in the first part of the year. \nAlexander Hacking: Okay. But I mean, I guess, not the -- I mean the total budget for those 2 projects combined is less than $600 million. So it seems aggressive, but fair enough. \nRaul Jacob: Well that's what the -- our project team has indicated that they are -- they don't see their expenditures going through the initial budget that was $1.1 billion. They are expecting $800 million. That's what the information that we have from them. \nOperator: And our next question comes line of [ Yuri Maxwell ] from [ Craig Asset Management ]. \nUnknown Analyst: Yes. Just a quick clarification. You've given the guidance for cash costs, but you gave it for cash cost, after by-products. Do you mind giving the cash cost guidance before the by-products throughout the year as well? So it's $1.37 for this year. What about the other years, please? \nRaul Jacob: Certainly, [ Yuri ]. Well for next year, we're expecting $1.53. For 2022, $1.66. And for 2023, $1.54. And for 2024, $1.61. Let me comment, [ Yuri ], let me comment on that. We're expecting and we're assuming that certain prices that we're seeing much more positive now will change over time and come back to where they were. That's -- that put us on a very conservative pattern in certain cases, but we operate our assumptions on that base. \nUnknown Analyst: When you talk about the price, do you mean the prices for supplies, raw materials, this kind of stuff? \nRaul Jacob: A recovery or, let's say, a recovery of the Mexican peso or a recovery of the Peruvian sol that will make -- or a weaker dollar to put it differently, will make local cost a little bit more expensive in U.S. dollars, fuel oil coming back to where they were. That's -- those are general assumptions. We, on this case, rather be on the more conservative side to do our planning for the other years. \nOperator: Thank you. Now I'm not showing any further questions at this time. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Victor. Well with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's Second Quarter of 2020 Results. We certainly appreciate your participation. I hope to have you back with us when we report the third quarter of this year. Thank you very much, and have a nice day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Victor. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. Participating with me in today's conference are Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member.  \n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during these trying times. In today's call, we will begin with an update on the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations. We will then review the copper market and Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results and expansion projects. After that, we will open the session for questions.  \n We continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic by prioritizing efforts to safeguard the health and well-being of our workforce, their families and nearby communities. Our company is operating in total compliance with the emergency levels required by local, regional and national governments, and we have implemented rigorous hygiene, sanitation and safety protocols at all our facilities. As of June 30, about 83% of our workforce in Mexico and 64% of the workforce in Peru are working at the operations while at home. Recently, we have opened limited access to company premises to our most essential contractors, as part of the protocol followed by our contractors must comply with proper COVID-19 testing, clinical monitoring and mandatory quarantine. We're enforcing multiple actions to limit workforce exposure to the disease by imposing travel restrictions, prohibiting face-to-face meetings, urging frequent hand washing and require adherence to all other health, safety and social distancing measures created by government authorities. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Southern Copper has been implementing strong prevention measures to protect the health of its workers, their families and their communities.  \n For this purpose, the company has approved a budget of $11.2 million for donation and general support for the populations of Peru and Mexico. To date, the majority of this budget has been executed, and we are considering a second budget for this purpose. To bolster response to the pandemic, we have donated medical supplies and dozens of medical ventilators for breathing support at hospitals in the communities where we operate. In Mexico, we have set up 135 confined beds in company-owned housing in Sonora, Guanajuato and Campeche to serve as temporary sanitary facilities for people presenting symptoms of respiratory disease who require isolation or primary hospital care. In Peru, the company is donating 25,000 liters per week of liquid oxygen to national hospitals to treat the population infected with COVID-19 in the regions of Arequipa and Moquegua in Southern Peru. On top of this initiative, we are donating a COVID-19 molecular testing laboratory to the Moquegua region. While for the Tacna region, we are about to donate an oxygen plant with a capacity of 720 cubic meters per day of medicinal oxygen. We have also donated over 63,000 items for personal protection equipment to medical staff and 25,000 personal hygiene kits to our workers and to the population in our areas of influence. These donations include information for the population about COVID-19 disease spread and symptoms. We have also donated cleaning and personal protection equipment to members of the National Guard of Mexico and of the Peruvian Police and Army.  \n Additionally, we're helping vulnerable individuals such as the elderly or disabled persons and pregnant women by donating more than 43,000 kits containing food and personal hygiene items. In addition to the aforementioned efforts, we have installed more than 200 portable sinks in strategic areas of the communities to ensure access to preventive hand washing. Moreover, to bolster compliance with stay-at-home measures, the company is offering over 2,000 sports, cultural and educational workshops online. Additionally, throughout our community care service, we offer free medical, psychological counseling 24 hours a day. Southern Copper is making every effort to keep the pace of production at satisfactory levels while achieving a competitive cash cost. This is reflected in our second quarter 2020 cash cost per pound of $0.67 net of by-product credits. In this past quarter, we managed to maintain our production level by focusing on mineral production and prioritizing high mineral ore grade mining. Operational stripping, particularly at the Peruvian operations, and major maintenance activities were temporarily postponed and will be addressed in the next 9 months. We believe that our strong financial position, cost competitiveness and copper reserve will allow us to overcome these difficult times.  \n Considering the current environment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that mining production and investment will play an important role in the recovery of both the Mexican and Peruvian economies. As such, we will continue to develop our projects, consistent with our belief that Southern Copper's operations constitute risk control generators of economic resources that provide well-remunerated employment and tax revenues to the countries in which we operate.  \n Let me now focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the second quarter of 2020, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased from an average of $2.77 per pound in the second quarter of 2019 to $2.42 per pound. This is a 12.6% reduction in its price. As of today, we are seeing prices slightly higher than $2.90 per pound, which reflects the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on both the supply and demand for copper. At this point, the copper price seems to be driven basically by 2 factors: expectations of lack of supply in major producing countries such as Chile and Peru due to COVID-19 outbreaks and an increase in China's demand in this scenario of an economic recovery for this country. Since the pandemic is affecting both supply and demand, at this point, it is difficult to assess the long-term effects of this crisis on the copper market balance and consequently on copper prices. \n Now let's focus on Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2020. Copper represented 82.3% of our sales in the second quarter of this year. Copper production registered a slight decrease of 1.3% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and situated at 243,097 tons in the second quarter of 2020. This was primarily due to lower production at our Buenavista and Toquepala mines because of lower ore grades. This effect was partially offset by higher production at the Cuajone mine due to higher ore grades and recoveries as well as to higher production at the IMMSA after operations resumed at the San Martin mine.  In 2020, we expect to produce 997,100 tons of copper, in line with last year's production and is slightly lower than our production plan. \n For molybdenum, it represented 6% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of 2020 and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $8.24 per pound in the quarter compared to $12.13 in the second quarter of last year. This is a 32.1% decrease. Molybdenum production increased by 16.3% in the past quarter compared to the same period of 2019 due to significantly higher production at our Toquepala mine. We produced 1,237 tons of molybdenum from our new molybdenum plant of Toquepala. This is a 44.8% increase in this facility, the Toquepala mine facility for molybdenum. Production also rose at Cuajone with an increase of 25.2% due to higher grades and recoveries. In 2020, we expect to produce 28,500 tons of molybdenum, which represents an increase of 5.9% over last year's production level of 26,900 tons and an increase through our plan for this year. \n Silver represented 5.6% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2020 with an average price of $16.54 per ounce in the quarter, up 11.4% from the second quarter of 2019. Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production increased by 13.5% in the second quarter as a result of higher production at IMMSA after production resumed at the San Martin mine. In addition, there was higher production at the La Caridad mine as a result of higher grades as well as higher production at the Cuajone mine in Peru due to higher grades and recoveries. Silver production increased by 27.5% in the second quarter from the same quarter of -- from the similar quarter of 2019 as a result of growth in all of our facilities. In 2020, we expect to produce 22.7 million ounces of silver, an increase of 11.7% when compared to 2019. This is mainly attributable to the significant contribution of the San Martin mine and the Santa Barbara mine, both operations at the IMMSA company, our IMMSA subsidiary. Regarding silver, we believe that prices will be supported by the intensive industrial use of this metal and the fact that silver, like gold, is considered a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty. \n Zinc represented 2.7% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2020, with an average price of $0.89 per pound in the quarter, a price decrease of 28.8% from the second quarter of 2019. Zinc mine production decreased by 11.5% quarter-on-quarter to situate at 15,706 tons. This was primarily due to lower production in the Charcas mine and to the shutdown of our Santa Eulalia operation due to severe flooding. We're currently evaluating different options to supply the concentrator of Santa Eulalia. These negative variances in zinc production were partially offset by a production increase of 2,821 tons. This is an increase of 249% at the San Martin mine. Refined zinc production decreased by 13% in the second quarter of 2020. \n For our financial results in the second quarter of this year, sales were $1.8 billion, which represented a decrease of $32.6 million with regard to the sales reported in the second quarter of 2019. This is a 1.8% reduction in revenues or sales. The sales volume for copper increased 11% -- excuse me for a second please. The sales volume for copper increased by 11%, and its value was up 1.4% in a scenario of lower copper prices. In this case, due to copper, we had -- we mentioned a reduction in sales value of 12.6%. Regarding our main by-products, we registered higher sales of silver that increased by 44.2% due to higher volume and prices. Also, higher sales for gold that increased by 69.4% due to higher volumes and prices. In contrast, we reported lower sales for molybdenum by 30.7% due to lower prices, partially offset by a higher volume of 15.4%. And also, we had a decrease in sales of zinc by 36% due to both lower volumes and prices. Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $103.8 million or 9.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2019. The main cost increments are associated with purchased copper, lower capitalized leachable material, higher inventory consumption and other factors. These cost increments were partially compensated by lower diesel and fuel cost, repair materials and operations contractors and operating materials and supply. \n Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was $770 million, which represented a decrease of 18.3% with regard to the $942.8 million registered in the second quarter of 2019. The adjusted EBITDA margin of the second quarter was situated at 43.1% versus 51.9% in the second quarter of 2019. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, EBITDA was 7.1% higher than in the first quarter of 2020. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.26 per pound in the second quarter of 2020. This is $0.166 lower than the value for the first quarter of 2020. The 11% decrease in the operating cash cost is a result of lower cost per pound from production that decreased 13.1% that was partially offset by higher treatment and refining charges, administrative expenses and lower premiums. Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.67 per pound in the second quarter of 2020. This cash cost was $0.094 lower than the cash cost of $0.764 that we had in the first quarter of 2020. This is a 12.3% reduction in cash costs quarter-on-quarter. \n Regarding our by-products, we had a total credit of $321.5 million or $0.593 per pound in the second quarter of 2020. These figures represent a 9.7% decrease when compared with the credit of $340.2 million or $0.657 per pound in the first quarter of 2020. Total credits have increased for silver by 27.2%, gold for 60.4% but has decreased for molybdenum and zinc and sulfuric acid. Net earnings or net income attributable to SCC shareholders in the second quarter of 2020 was $259.5 million. This is 14.5% of sales or diluted earnings per share of $0.34. This figure compares with net income attributable to SCC shareholders for the second quarter of 2019 of $402.4 million. This is a 22.1% of sales or diluted earnings per share of $0.52. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, net income was 20.8% higher than in the first quarter of 2020. \n Capital expenditures. Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. In the second quarter of this year, we spent $113.3 million on capital investments, which reflected a 37.2% decrease with regard to the same period in 2019 and represented a 43.7% of net income this quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent $214.3 million on capital investments, which represented 45.2% of net income. As a consequence of global COVID-19 conditions, new measures to reduce vulnerability have been introduced in our project execution practices. Sanitary measures include rapid tests, daily temperature checks, mask provision and mandatory use, social distancing on work sites and in the camps and a quarantine period for our own and contractors' personnel. Locations where infections are on the rise, some activities have been pushed back or scaled down, particularly on construction sites where personnel are required to work closely. All other engineering, procurement and construction activities that are not personnel-intensive, where social distances can be applied, are being executed at a normal pace. At this point, we don't expect a significant delays in project execution. \n Our current portfolio for Peruvian projects totals $2.8 billion of approved projects, of which $1.6 billion has been already invested. Considering the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion investment and Los Chancas $2.8 billion investment projects, our total investment program in Peru will increase to $8.1 billion. For Tia Maria, as you know, on July 8, 2019, we were granted the construction permit for an SX-EW copper greenfield project to produce 120,000 tons a year with a capital budget of $1.4 billion. The government awarded the permit after completing -- after the company completed an exhaustive review process of environmental and social matters and determined that the company had complied with all regulatory requirements after addressing all observations made. The challenges surrounding the construction permit were overcome when on October 30, 2019, the Mining Council of the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines ratified the construction permit for the Tia Maria project. \n For the Mexican projects, the Buenavista zinc concentrator in Sonora, as I say, it's a facility located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering study and the detailed engineering analysis is underway. Site preparation has begun and stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 have been put in place. Purchase orders have been placed for major equipment and some is already being manufactured. The project has all the necessary permits. The capital budget is $413 million, and we expect to initiate operations in the third quarter of 2022. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and will provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n The Pilares project in Sonora, it's located 6 kilometers from the La Caridad mine. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper concentrate, a new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks is under construction and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% ore grade -- average ore grade from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, and we expect the project to begin production in the first half of 2022. \n El Pilar project in Sonora, it's a low capital intensity copper greenfield project, which is located about 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.287%. El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine and copper cathodes will be produced using highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million, and we expect the project to start production in 2023.  Construction at the pilot plant and experimental pads has end, and tests are being performed. We're glad to report that the first results from experimental tests on leaching process has confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery.  \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review at each Board meeting the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plan and all financial needs in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on July 23, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock payable on August 25 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 12 of this year.  \n Well with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. On the projects, we have, as I mentioned, we have implemented several COVID-19 combat measures that our -- at our projects as well. I explained them a few minutes ago. And we have 2 situations here for the projects. Certain activities are required or are performed at a certain level of isolation. Let me say, for instance, if you have to, for example, travel or do some land works, most likely, the individuals involved in this are not in contract. And particularly, we stress the fact that they have to maintain social distance and use the proper equipment. So even though certain activities have been postponed, we are still working on all the engineering that we can perform on a safe mode and operations that are keeping social distance and other COVID-19 precautionary measures. We expect to catch up, basically. We are seeing now a slight delay. It's probably a couple of months, and we want to catch up on that. Regarding our clients, I'd like to remind our audience that our copper production, it's a very high quality. We offer -- we guarantee four nines. That is 99.99% of our refined copper. And our concentrate sales are for what you will call nowadays a clean concentrate, which is a high-quality concentrate. So we haven't had much trouble with our clients. Maybe one or 2 requesting a delay in the shipments that we have programmed, but nothing significant to note at this point. We are not seeing a change in the way that our clients operate. They are keeping our contracts. By the way, this is the same pattern that we observed at the prior crisis in 2008, 2009 in the sense that the quality of our copper make us to be preferred on top of some other producers. That's a personal assumption. Well we don't like to speculate on different possibility of a worsened scenario -- in a scenario that's worse vis-a-vis what we have today. What we are reporting is what we see now. If there is a more difficult environment to operate, then we'll certainly have to maintain, as a top priority, the safety of our workforce and the health of our workforce and our contractors as well. That includes, obviously, the capital projects. So I don't want to speculate on that. What we are seeing now, if conditions remain as they are now, we will be -- we'll need to catch up later on in the future on these projects. I believe that a delay of 2 months or so that we may have now for some of the projects and some others that have been moving forward, as I explained, should or could be recuperated over time. Certainly, Timna. As I say, we have to prioritize to maintain levels at our plants to do the very focused work in order to produce the mineral that was required to fit our concentrators and the plants that we have.  That -- the cost of that for the future was to postpone certain maintenance and certain stripping, particularly at the Peruvian operations. We believe that this -- the catch-up on the stripping will be spread through the 9 months that I mentioned. For the year, we're expecting a cash cost before by-product rates of $1.37 per pound. Currently, for the 6 months that we have had already, it's $1.34. So it's a $0.03 of additional cost that we will incur. It's about $170 million that should be spread through time in the next few months. As I say, it's 9 months for the most important -- certain maintenances were scheduled for the past 2 months or 3 months, and we have been reprogrammed them as proper for depending on the condition of the equipment for this quarter and the next ones. For the whole corporation, yes. Certainly. Well in our mining operations, in some cases, as is the case of the Peruvian mines and some of the Mexican operations as well we have the possibility of -- we have had the possibility of isolating our operations because of the nature of where they are located. Let me put as an example of what happens with the Toquepala mine in Peru. It's 150 kilometers away from the nearest city. So we agree, and we certainly appreciate the help of our unions on this, we agree to have a strict lockdown, defined as if you go out, you can't get back until the quarantine ends. That was what we did. And we took several measures to control the supply chain that we have to feed this operation and provide all the services, food, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that is required by our workforce. And we have operated through the lockdown with these characteristics, and we haven't had any cases during -- at the operations of these facilities for quite a while. That allows us to maintain a proper production environment. And by the way, in the Peruvian operations, we -- the workers have their families living at the premises in the town site, nearby the mines and the metallurgical facilities. In the case of Tia Maria, well we have expressed several times that the company has all the permits that are required for initiating the production of the construction of the project. We believe that this is -- the pandemic has make us much more clear for the local population of the importance of this project, and we are expecting the national government to work with us in order to move on with the project in a time where this kind of investment that will create about 9,000 jobs while in construction will be a good possibility of improving the economic environment in both the Islay province and the Arequipa region. We're expecting, in this case, to move on with the project at any time. We're ready for that. We want the Peruvian government to concur with this view and then move forward with the operation. Andreas, well we had -- at the end of the first quarter, we had some inventory buildup of production in process that was finished through the quarter. And we, at the very beginning of the pandemic, had some difficulties in shipping some of our production, but that was very quickly solved. And we could deliver our shipments as scheduled. So that allows us to sell this excess inventories of production that we have through the second quarter. That explains the difference in sales vis-a-vis productions.  In the case of the concentrate purchases, we have -- for technical reasons, we're buying some concentrates that have certain characteristics that allow us to mix with our own concentrate, use our smelting and refining facilities at a much higher capacity or almost at full capacity nowadays because of the quality of the concentrates that we buy. These concentrates mix very well with our own, and that creates certain synergies that allow us to reduce the smelting and refining costs, which, by the way, our smelters have -- has had a record in cash cost at the Peruvian operations. Certainly. Okay. Yes, it does. The $1.37 includes all the expenditures that we have had at the operational side of our facilities in both Mexico and Peru. In total, we have spent a little bit less than $12 million in this past quarter for sanitary standards, et cetera. This includes -- let me explain what I mean. This money is just for purposes of maintaining proper working conditions with -- for our workforce. It does not include the donations that we're doing that are included in some -- in the administrative expenses for the company. And in the case of cash cost and production guidance, certainly -- for production, I mentioned already our forecast for the year, but I'm repeating it now. We're expecting to produce 997,100 tons of copper for 2020. Our production will be pretty much flat all the way to 2023. For 2021, we're expecting to produce 986,300 tons; 2018 -- 2022, 949 -- 950,000; 2023, where we will have the beginning impact of Pilares, Buenavista zinc and El Pilar, we're expecting to increase our production to 1,066,000 tons. For 2024, we're expecting to produce 1,104,000 tons, and this is basically the result of having Pilares, Buenavista zinc, El Pilar and a partial production of Tia Maria. In the case of cash cost for this year, I already mentioned that we are expecting an overall for the whole corporation cash cost before by-product credits of $1.37. In credit, we're expecting $0.60 per pound of copper. That give us $0.77 per pound for the year, slightly higher than what we're expecting now. As you know, cash cost is one of the most difficult things to predict because it has not only the cost impact on several supplies, such as fuel, power, et cetera, labor and -- but also the impact on price -- of prices on our by-products. I mentioned already -- I mentioned already silver price, an average silver price for the quarter of about $16.54 per ounce of silver. And as you know, now it's over $20. It's much higher than that even today. So it will vary, but that's our forecast at this point, $0.77 per ton. For the next few years, well we're assuming an increase in our cash cost due to the price deck that we're considering for the next years and certain ore grades variances that we have in different operations. Overall, we will have -- we're expecting a cash cost of about $0.93 for 2021, $0.96 for 2022, $0.88 for 2023 and $0.87 for 2024. No. I'd say that so far, $12 million. I don't think that we will be spending -- so far, yes. That includes like a onetime expenditure for different items that are at inventories right now, let's say, medical supplies. We have several medical supplies that are at disposal for our -- are ready-to-use for -- by our workforce, and that will be consumed through the year. So let me add a little bit on what -- your question. The COVID-19 requires a big effort on our site and our workforce and everybody to contain it. But we haven't had a major damage to any of our facilities or anything that requires a significant expenditure. We're basically focusing on having the proper medical supplies, the social distancing. Several measures to maintain social distance has been undertaken. For instance, the capacity of the shuttles that transport our personnel has been reduced. So you have to spend a little bit more money renting some additional buses, for instance. But that -- those are relatively speaking, minor expenditures given the size of our operations. No, we do. We do. And we are including the testing in what I just said. Certainly, Grant. Well we have been operating our facilities not at full capacity in the past quarter for a while. Then we're able to increase the capacity as we move on into having less restrictions, generally speaking, in both Mexico and Peru. We don't want to find out when this is going to impact our production delay and maintenance and such. We're focusing on scheduling them as we come with the proper workforce in our facilities and the contractors that, in some cases, perform this maintenance of major equipment. We are in that process. We expect to have, by the end of this quarter, most of our workforce at the operations already. So we are basically focusing on being sure that how -- the way that we're operating won't be affected by major, major -- any major maintenance. We were relatively lucky in the sense that we did significant maintenance of our smelter facilities in Peru last year. We have to do each 2 years a major maintenance to the smelter. Well it was scheduled for 2019, we perform it. And this facility and the refineries are in good shape. The same happened in some of our operations in the mining side in Mexico. And we focus quite a bit on having all of our production line with proper maintenance, which is preventive maintenance in most of the cases. And that is certainly useful to situations like this. On CapEx, our current guidance is as follows: for this year, we're reducing our CapEx guidance from $1.10 billion to $800 million. We're expecting a reduction of about a little bit more than $300 million in capital expenditures in 2020. That money will be reallocated to 2021, most of it. For next year, we're expecting $1.7 billion of capital expenditures. For 2022, $2 billion. For 2023, $2.9 billion and for 2024, $2.7 billion.  This is to have the 3 projects that we have in Mexico, the Buenavista zinc, the Pilares project and the El Pilar project. These 3 projects, up and running by the end of 2023 and at full capacity in 2024 and also to accommodate the Tia Maria investment that we should initiate, if not this year, next one and the Michiquillay project and the Chancas projects. In this case, for Michiquillay and Los Chancas, they will be -- they will not be in operation by 2024. We will be on the investing part of the projects at that time. Okay. Thank you very much for your question, John. Let me comment on that. We had -- for diesel and fuel, we have savings of $38.5 million. That's on the average price that we had in the second quarter. We have, for labor cost, a reduction of about $10 million, mainly due to exchange rate. That's for the second quarter. We expect -- well exchange rates seems to be for a while where they are, so we should be having some savings on that regard. On fuel, yes, there is a recovery. We're still not back to where we were before the COVID-19 crisis initiated, so we will be capturing a portion of these savings through the year. Sure. Well I think that we have certain conditions in our operations that allow us with a very detailed and thoughtful plan to maintain -- or to catch up on our production level once we have the possibility. As you -- as I mentioned before, certain -- some of our facilities are relatively isolated. And the workers are performing -- being this a very high capital-intensive industry, you may have a facility that is huge, where maybe 40 workers are on a daily basis, and they are spread through a big area, so they have no contact to be sure. And particularly, if you stress that they can't relate as they used to with their fellow workers, that has helped us. As I mentioned, we focus specifically on prioritizing mineral production. So you have with this combination of 2 factors that has been in our favor. As I mentioned before, as an example, Toquepala mine, due to the fact that it was constructed in the 1960s of the past century, and at that time, you have to provide the housing facilities to the workforce and their families. And so what we have in some of our operations are little towns actually, where you have a bank agency, a hospital, a market, churches, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So that plus a very mature attitude of our workforce allow us to maintain operations, keeping social distance and operating at the very beginning of the pandemic with very little personnel, basically maintaining our operations at a lower than the usual rate. And then we -- as conditions were understood by the authorities, we could improve and increase our production and operation. And by focusing on better areas of the mine, we were able to produce the copper that has been reported. \n Now regarding the supply and demand balance for this current situation, it's hard to say. This is an unusual market circumstance. Usually, when you have a slowdown in the world economy, what you have in the copper and other metals markets is a reduction in demand, not necessarily in supply. The major difference of this COVID-19 pandemic is that not only demand, but supply is also affected. So we have had supply reductions in different countries. Peru and Chile together produce about 40% of the world supply of copper. And as you know, both countries have had, in different operations, at different levels depending on each of the -- on each company, a significant impact or a reduced impact depending on the company, on the production. That's a major difference to some other circumstances. As I say, if we talk about the 2008-2009 crisis, that was basically a big drop in demand. What we saw at that time, supply was fine. I mean, well obviously, after a while, you had shutting downs of certain premises, high-cost premises by different companies, and that helped to balance the market. But in this case, that process, well we are not seeing that as of now because as I said, supply has been affected as well as demand. \n Where are we going? Well I expect the supply to catch up eventually. For now, we're seeing different countries and companies struggling with supply issues due to COVID-19 outbreaks. Hopefully, that will cease, and we'll see a recovery. But at this point, it's very hard to either predict or confirm where supply and demand balance will be in the future. No. At this point, we don't see anything related to that. Nobody is talking about specific new taxation for mining companies or operations at Mexico or Peru. Hold on a second please, Alfonso. Okay. Well we -- at the beginning of the pandemic, we were not able to operate at full capacity. We were operating with about 40% of the workforce in Mexico and a similar number in Peru. So we were not reaching full capacity at that time. Then we have been operating -- if you see our concentrators, they were not milling as much mineral as they could on a daily basis. But they were milling much higher ore grade minerals, so that allows us to catch up on the production side. When you add a higher ore grade mineral, you have not only the benefit of that higher ore grade, but also the possibility of recuperating a slightly higher percentage of copper per ton of mineral. So those 2 factors have helped us to produce as we have reported this past quarter. \n Now regarding the Cananea, as you well mentioned, Alfonso,  the Cananea town is nearby or almost side-by-side with the Buenavista mine that we have. We had about 18 cases of COVID at the Cananea. It's a relatively small number. You consider the size of our workforce over there is, well, less than 1% of our workforce. And so far, we haven't had any major or any deceased to regret in this case. That's basically it. \n We haven't had any impact on what you say about the strike. I think that the workforce is acting very -- in a very mature way in our operations, as I stressed in different parts of this presentation. We have to mine certain parts of the operations where you have not as good ore grades as we have mined before. That will have an impact in cost, and -- but we're expecting to fulfill our forecast for the year, as I indicated before. Hold on a second please, Alex. For this year, we're expecting 997,100. And for next year, it's 986,300. Yes. 9-8-6. 9-8-6. Yes, that's correct. Well, one of the reasons for that is that we will be doing -- paying the bills that we have put as purchase orders at the first half of this year for, say, the Buenavista concentrator, the Pilares, some of the expenditures that we have to do in order to initiate the mine operation of Pilares in the next year or so. So that's basically it. It's basically paying bills on purchase orders that we have put in the first part of the year. Well that's what the -- our project team has indicated that they are -- they don't see their expenditures going through the initial budget that was $1.1 billion. They are expecting $800 million. That's what the information that we have from them. Certainly, [ Yuri ]. Well for next year, we're expecting $1.53. For 2022, $1.66. And for 2023, $1.54. And for 2024, $1.61. Let me comment, [ Yuri ], let me comment on that. We're expecting and we're assuming that certain prices that we're seeing much more positive now will change over time and come back to where they were. That's -- that put us on a very conservative pattern in certain cases, but we operate our assumptions on that base. A recovery or, let's say, a recovery of the Mexican peso or a recovery of the Peruvian sol that will make -- or a weaker dollar to put it differently, will make local cost a little bit more expensive in U.S. dollars, fuel oil coming back to where they were. That's -- those are general assumptions. We, on this case, rather be on the more conservative side to do our planning for the other years. Thank you very much, Victor. Well with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's Second Quarter of 2020 Results. We certainly appreciate your participation. I hope to have you back with us when we report the third quarter of this year. Thank you very much, and have a nice day."

All results are expected in all U.S. GAAP.Now, I will pass the call to Mr. Raul Jacob.\nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmine, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Southern Copper's first quarter 2020 results conference call. Participating with me in today's conference are Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member; and Mr. Xavier Garcia de Quevedo, also a Board member.Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones, in these difficult times that we're currently facing. In today's call, we will begin with an update from the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations. We will then review the copper markets and Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, and expansion projects. After that, we will open the session for questions.The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking proper care of our personnel has always been of paramount importance to our company. While confronting the COVID-19 pandemic in the countries where we operate, Southern Copper continues essential operations in compliance with local emergency measures.As soon as COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Southern Copper implemented rigorous hygiene and sanitation protocols at all of its facilities to protect the health and welfare of its employees, their families and the neighboring communitiesThe statements from governmental authorities has made it clear that essential economic activities must continue during the COVID-19 health emergency and that industrial mining, which is closely linked to chemical and construction industries, is essential to the requirements of electrical, hospital and medical infrastructure, as well as for the manufacturing of health related supplies and technological equipment.These industries are indispensable and strengthen the infrastructure of manufacturing, logistics and support global supply chains. The strategic position of industrial mining as a supplier of key materials such as steel, copper, gold, coal, silver, zinc and cement has been recognized by the US, Canada, Mexico and Peru.These countries have confronted COVID-19 through social distancing and stay-at-home measures and recognize that industrial mining is indispensable to avoid the interruption of supply chains of essential products to fight the pandemic.Copper is indispensable for the manufacturing of specialized cables required to produce high-voltage electrical installations that supply electric power to local communities, hospitals and supply centers.Indeed, copper is essential for the manufacturing of electrical components required to generate, transmit and distribute electric power to urban centers. Electrical and electronic copper components are also necessary for medical equipment and appliances, cell phones, computer hardware, digital data transmission, images and voice.Copper is also required in surfaces to remove viruses and bacteria, which make it essential for the production of drinking water and air conditioning systems. Chemical industries with their metallurgical processes have proved to be vital in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the world.Given the nature of mining operations, with an highly automated is conducted in remote locations and with mandatory use of personal safety equipment, it is easier to implement and comply with COVID-19 protective measures, such as physical isolation and access control.Industrial mining uses advanced and reliable machinery and does not require high physical concentration of employees. In many cases, workers fulfill their duties maintaining distances of more than 100 meters from their coworkers.The Company has developed rigorous COVID-19 emergency protocol and only 40% of the labor force in Mexico, or about 6,300 employees are currently working on site under strict safety measures. The remaining workforce of 8,751 employees are working from home, including all high risk individuals due to age or prior medical conditions.For the Peruvian operations about 3,500 employees or 39% of the workforce are working on site under strict safety measures, while the remaining 5,468 employees are working from home or staying at it.It should be noted that to date, there have been not known cases of COVID-19 contagion among our employees at our mining facilities in Mexico and Peru. Our COVID-19 emergency protocol has reinforced preventive measures such as disinfecting, clinical monitoring before work, cleaning and sanitizing of work areas and respect for social distancing.We have also restricted access to contractors, suppliers and non-essential personnel and enforced multiple actions to limit workforce exposure to the COVID-19 such as travel restrictions, prohibiting face-to-face meetings and urging frequent hand washing, as well as adherence to all other health, safety and social distancing measures issued by governmental authorities.From the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic, Southern Copper has been implementing a strong prevention measures to protect the health of its workers, their families, and their communities. For this purpose, the Company has approved a budget of $11.2 million for donations and general support for the population of Peru and Mexico.As a way to content the pandemic we have donated medical supplies and dozens of mechanical ventilators for breathing support to hospitals in the communities where we operate.In Sonora, we have established 88 confined beds in Company housing property, to serve as temporary sanitary facilities for people presenting symptoms of respiratory disease who require isolation or moderate hospital care.We are also donating over 200,000 items of personal protection equipment to medical staff, and 30,000 hygiene kits to our workers and to the population of our areas of influence, including general information materials about the pandemic.We have also donated cleaning and personal protection equipment to the staff members of National Guard of Mexico, and the Peruvian police and army. Additionally, we are helping vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly or disabled persons and pregnant women by donating more than 30,000 kits containing food and hygiene items.In addition to the above mentioned efforts, we have installed more than 200 portable sinks in strategic areas of the communities in order to reinforce preventive hand washing. Moreover, to endorse the stay at home measures, we have offered over 350 sports, cultural and educational workshops online and over 58,000 virtual instructing activities have been watched by 3,700 students from the schools sponsored by our Company.Additionally, throughout our Community Care Service we offer free medical, psychological and employment counselling 24 hours a day.Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. Copper, during the first quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange Copper Price decreased from an average of $2.82 per pound in the first quarter of 2019 to $2.56 per pound that is 9.2% reduction. As of today, we're seeing prices in the range of $2.20 to $2.30 per pound. Today, its about $2.33 as a reflection of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the demand and on copper supply.The world is currently experiencing the public health, financial and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since it is affecting both supply and demand, at this point it is difficult to assess the full effect of this crisis on the copper market balance and on copper prices.Let me say that on a normal year, we expect to have a seasonal copper inventories increase of about 200 to 250,000 tons in the first quarter of the year due to the New Year's festivities of China and the winter impact in demand of the Northern Hemisphere. This year we have the COVID-19 outbreaks as an additional end factor affecting copper demand and supply and obviously copper prices.At the end of 2019, copper demand for refined copper was estimated at 23.6 million tons and global inventory, that is the addition of the London Metal Exchange, the Comics, in Shanghai warehouses and an estimate on bonded warehouses. That number of inventories with some of those were 599,000 tons. By the end of February of this year, paid this inventory of warehouses, add up to 917,000 [ph] tons or 318,000 tons higher than the inventories at the end of last year.Last Friday, April 24, global inventories were estimated at 925,000 tons. This is 326,000 tons over the closing of 2019, not [ph] a reliable stable mark since they increase at the end of February. We believe this reflects the mentioned seasonal effects of about 250,000 tons due to the Chinese New Year and the winter effect I mentioned, as well as the additional market surplus created by the COVID-19 pandemic.In a normal year, we expect additional inventory to be partially absorbed through the rest of the year. For 2020, it is difficult to estimate when these may happen, since we are seeing a much weaker demand than last year.Let\u2019s now focus on Southern Copper\u2019s production for the past quarter. Copper represented 79.4% of our sales in the first quarter 2020. Copper production increased by 5.8% to 241,967 tons in the first quarter compared to 228,629 tons in the first quarter of last year. This was principally due to high production at our Peruvian mines.Toquepala mine production increased by 14.5%, as a result of additional copper production of 8,574 tons from the new concentrator and Cuajone mine production increased by 23.2% due to higher ore grades all great recoveries.In Mexico copper production slightly increased by 1.4% when compared to last year's first quarter, mainly due to lower production at the Buenavista operations, as a result of lower ore grades. This effect was partially offset by higher production at our IMMSA unit that increased its total production by 30.5%, as a result of the restoration of the San Martin mine operations.For molybdenum, it represented 7.3% of the company sales value in the first quarter of 2020 and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $9.56 per pound in the quarter, which compares with $11.70 per pound in the first quarter of 2019, an 18.3% decrease.Molybdenum mine production increased by 39.7% in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of last year. It was principally due to significantly higher production at our Toquepala mine. We had a new molybdenum plant starting in the second quarter of 2019 and as a result of that the Toquepala mine increased its production by 280% [ph] in the first quarter of this year. Well, this plant produced 993 tons of new molybdenum production and as I say began operation in April of last year.We also have the benefits of much higher production of molybdenum at Cuajone, which increases its molybdenum production by 42.6% due also to higher grades.Silver represented 5.1% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2020 with an average price of $16.87 per ounce in the quarter, an 8.7% increase from the first quarter of last year. Silver is currently our second by-product.Mined silver production increased by 21.6% in the first quarter from this year from the same - from the first quarter of 2019, as a result of higher production at all our operations, particularly at IMMSA, the underground complex mines that we have, which increased its production by 35.7% due to restored production at the San Martin mine. San Martin approximately at 607,000 ounces in the first quarter of this year of silver - ounces of silver.In addition, there was higher production on the Toquepala mine that increased its production 16.3% in silver, that was 128,000 tons of ounces of silver from the new concentrator, as well as higher production at the Buenavista mine, that increased its production by 13.3% due to higher grades and recoveries.For zinc, it represented 3.8% of our sales volume in the fourth quarter of this year with an average price of $0.97 per pound in the quarter, a price increase of 21.1% from the first quarter of last year.Zinc mine production increased by 3.8% to 19,263 tons in the first quarter of 2020, mainly due to 2,851 [ph] tons of new production coming from the San Martin mine, as well as increased production in the Charcas mine, increased its production by 9%. And Santa Barbara that also increased its production by 7.2%.These two operations, plus the San Martin increased - were partially offset by Santa Eulalia mine production - reduction that reduced its production by 90%. Santa Eulalia, regarding this operation the company has decided to shut down its mine facility due to several closing events at the mine. We're currently evaluating different options to supply the concentrator of Santa Eulalia. Refinancing production increased by 8.5% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to first quarter of 2019.Financial results. For the first quarter of 2010 sales were $1.7 billion, that is $33.7 million lower than sales for the first quarter of last year or 1.9% lower. Copper sales volume increased by 10.6%, value decreased by 3.5% and it's an area of lower prices. As I mentioned, London Metal Exchange price decreased by 9.2% in the quarter.Regarding our main by-products, we have higher sales of molybdenum, 6.6% due to higher volume or 41.9%, partially offset by lower prices. Silver sales increased by 14.7% due to higher volume and better prices. For sales of zinc even though we had higher volume of 7.1%, its value was lower by 15.4% due to lower price.Our total operating costs and expenses increased by $126.7 million or 12% when compared to the first quarter of 2019. The main cost increment has been in purchased copper, $77.4 million, lower capitalized leachable material $73.5 million, the term [ph] materials $16.8 million, depreciation $11.3 and other factors.These cost increments were partially compensated by exchange rate variances that decreased cost by $30 million and lower inventory consumption by $20.6 million and fuel cost decreased by $8.7 million in the first quarter.Regarding EBITDA, for the first quarter of 2020 it was $719.8 million, this is a 41.8% margin compared with $889 million or 50.8% margin in the first quarter of 2019.Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.41 per pound in the first quarter of 2020. That is $0.171 [ph] lower than the value for the fourth quarter of last year. This 10.8% decrease in operating cash cost is a result of lower cost per pound from production cost, treatment and refining charges, and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower premiums.Southern Copper operating cash including the benefit of by-product credits was $0.774 per pound in the first quarter of 2020. This cash cost was $0.204 lower than the cash cost of $0.978 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is a 20.9% reduction in cash cost.Regarding by-products, we have a total credit of $332.2 million or $0.641 per pound in the first quarter of 2020. These figures represent a 5.6% increase when compared with the credit $0.607 [ph] per pound in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc and sulfuric acid and decreased for phosphates [ph]Net income attributable to SCC shareholders in the first quarter of 2020 was $214.8 million, that is 12.5% of sales or diluted earnings per share of $0.28 per pound \u2013 per share.Capital expenditures. Southern Copper as you know, as an investment philosophy of not basing its growth on the outlook of copper prices, on fact, on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to invest on a continuous basis in our great asset portfolio.In the first quarter of 2020, we spent $101 million in capital investments, this is a 41.7% lower than the same period of 2019 and represented 58.8% of our net income for the quarter.For the Peruvian projects. We have currently a portfolio of $2.8 billion of approved projects in Peru, of which $1.6 billion have already been invested. Considering the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion project and Los Chancas, a $2.8 billion project, our total investment program in Peru will increase to $8.1 billion.For Tia Maria, on July 8 of 2019 we received a construction permit for this 120,000 tons annual SX-EW copper greenfield project with a capital budget of $1.4 billion. The government awarded the permit after completing an exhaustive review process of environmental and social matters, recognizing compliance with all established regulatory requirements and having addressed all observation rates.The challenges to the construction permit were decided on October 30 of last year and the Mining Council of the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines gratified the construction permit for the Tia Maria project.For the Mexican projects, in the case of Mexico as you know we have three projects, the Buenavista concentrator, which is in Sonora. It's a project that is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. Currently, we have completed the basic engineering and the detailed engineering is in process.The site operation has started and the purchase orders for the new equipment has increased. The project is fully permitted. The capital budget is $430 million. And we expect to initiate operations in the third quarter of 2022. When completed, this facility will double the company\u2019s zinc production capacity and will provide 409 direct jobs and 1,417 indirect jobs.For the Pilares project also located in Sonora, it is operating 6 kilometers away from La Caridad. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity 35,000 tons of copper and constitutes. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining traffic under construction and will be used to transport the ore for the pit to its primary freshers of the La Caridad copper concentrate.This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grades, combining the 2.78% effective from Pilares, the ore grade - of Pilares, with the 2.34% ore grade from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million and we expected to start production during the first half of 2022.The whole project in Mexico that we're undertaking is project El Pilar, also in Sonora. This is a low capital-intensive offer greenfield, which is approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven probable reserves for 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 28.7% [ph]In Pilares, we just operate as a conventional open pit mine and copper cathodes will be produced using the highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX/EW technology. The budget for Pilares is $310 million and we expect it to start about during 2023. The construction of the pilot plant is finished and the production tests are being developed with encouraging results.Regarding dividends, as you know, it is a company policy to review at each Board meeting the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend.Accordingly, as announced to the market on April 23rd, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock payable on May 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 13 of this year. Despite the strong cash position of the company and the reasonably good results for the quarter, due to uncertainty of the metal markets and world [ph] economy and the important expansions planned by our company, the Board has taken this occasion and more cautious approach regarding dividends.Consequently, our Board approved a dividend equivalent to 50% of what the company has been paying the last few quarters. Considering Southern Copper\u2019s strong financial - strong financial condition and competitive cost structure, we have no doubt that Southern will endure the current difficult time and overcome the crisis.With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us and we will like now to open up the phone for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Alfonso Salazar with Scotiabank. Please go ahead, Alfonso.\nAlfonso Salazar: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thank you for the presentation Raul. The question I have is regarding the operations in Mexico. If you can clarify how - if you expect any impact from the closure \u2013 temporary closures that the government announced to mining operations. What is the status there? If you can clarify what is the status of operations in Mexico?And if you can provide guidance on production for the full year. And the CapEx [guidance] [ph] as well? Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much for your question Alfonso. Well, as you - we have mentioned in our report, we're operating with about 40% of our workforce in Mexico and 39% of it in Peru. Obviously, following and complying with all regulations that have been established by the authorities in both countries.When you operate with this much lower part of your usual and recommended workforce, what happens is that you are postponing, somehow, certain maintenance works and certain works at the mine operations.In Peru, our plants are what we call confined at the -- at the mine in the sense that we have basically agreed with our workforce over there to shut down the facilities in order to avoid the possibility of contagion. So we're following as I mentioned very strict protocols for our operations. That includes the suppliers of our materials that we require to operate.At the mines, generally speaking, we have for now postponed several works related to leachable material and stripping. That's something that is put aside for this time of emergency. In Peru, we are expecting the authorities to open up certain activities that are concurrent with mine operations and allows us to operate at a much higher activity level than what we're doing now.In Mexico, we're currently operating as I said with 40% of the workforce on the metallurgical side, this is considered part of chemical industries and that we have no significant cessation to our operations other than having the material available and that's obviously restricted due to the measures taken by the authority.At this point for the year, it's hard to provide a guidance. We will provide much certain guidance that in July when we had a better handle of where we are in terms of production and the emergency plans that we can put in place once we have more openness to operate our facilities because of slowing down of the of the crisis for changing regulations.Having said that, we have made some estimate that we may have smaller production of about between 3% to 4% for 2020 when you compare that with our initial plan and that's basically our current view on copper.\nAlfonso Salazar: Okay. Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Carlos.\nCarlos de Alba: Thank you very much. And good morning, everyone. I was just \u2013 [Technical difficulty]\nRaul Jacob: Carlos, I am sorry, but I can\u2019t \u2013 Carlos, I can\u2019t copy your words, it seems that you are having some extra noise in your microphone.\nCarlos de Alba: Is it better? Can you hear me?\nRaul Jacob: Yes. Yes.\nCarlos de Alba: Thank you, Raul. So the question is maybe - maybe pressing a little bit on the prior point. Can you tell specifically in the mine in Mexico are producing or not. My understanding is that the mines in Peru are producing, but you know, given the comments in the press release and you read earlier, it seems that you are implying or the company is implying that the mining sector in both countries was declared essential, whereas that is not our understanding. So if you could please help us clarify that and exactly whether or not the Southern Copper mines in both countries are producing that that will be very useful.And then if I understood correctly, it seems that in [Peruvian region] [ph], there is some production going with delays or deferred stripping. Could you talk maybe as to how do you see the impact of these deferral of stripping cost in the second quarter and then beyond as the company needs to catch up with the delay stripping? Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: Thank you for your question Carlos. On the Mexican mines \u2013 let me first mention, in the Peruvian mines where our mines are operating at a very high capacity level, over 90% most of the time, close to capacity in some days. As I mentioned our mines are confined or shut down. You can't - you can't go - if you go out, you'll not go in until the quarantine that has been established by the authorities is finished. And that on the metallurgical facilities we\u2019re operating with a production of concentrate, we're smelting them and moving forward with that.In the case of the Mexican operations, well, there are certain facilities that just cannot be stopped. Let me put up an example, the SX-EW operations. We have stopped at the mine site to produce leachable material, but the areas where you collect the material for operating the SX-EW plant, it's producing the pregnant liquid solution that you have to either store or process and storing has a certain limiting capacity. So eventually, you have to keep producing in order to maintain a certain level of operation.In Mexico, we have diminished at the mine site all the operations related to - related to stripping and leachable material and produced it in a very limited fashion mineral for the concentrators.The deferral for stripping in the second quarter [indiscernible] it's - this is what we're seeing, frankly we are postponing certain maintenance and certain jobs at the mine, as well as the metallurgical facility because we're operating with much less workforce than normal times.As a consequence, we\u2019re postponing certain repair jobs et cetera, et cetera. Well, we have to undertake that eventually and obviously we are not - we will have to consider at certain point in time if we cannot perform these maintenance and jobs to either reduce the operational level or shut down certain equipments that are required and that may require maintenance in the next few weeks or so.The cost of that we don't have it at this point specifically defined, but we do know that we will have to make a special effort in the second part of the year or in the second quarter if available to do a catch up. Our current plan is that at certain point after the emergency has passed, we will consider for instance, the rental of [lots of] [ph] equipment in order to do to a catch up in \u2013 what I mentioned as stripping or leachable material moving at the mine.At the concentrator, it's mainly maintenance that were postponed, in some cases. In some other cases, we have advanced this maintenance in the first quarter because we knew and we realized that we were having some difficulties in the coming weeks after the initial outbreak of the COVID-19.So, at this point I can\u2019t provide you with a specific figure on that. We do know that it will require an extra effort and we will - we will provide information on details from that when we are with a more clear situation, which we believe will be by the end of the second quarter of this year.\nCarlos de Alba: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with the Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the detail. I am sorry if I missed it, I know last conference call you provided updated thoughts on your long-term CapEx budget. And I was wondering if you could review any changes to that near term?And I know you went through the projects, but I don't think I caught, if there are any changes to the timing of completion of the project. Can you remind us please.\nRaul Jacob: Yeah, Timna. Thank you for your question. No at this point we haven't done any changes in our goals. As you pointed out, we made a significant adjustment \u2013 I\u2019d say a reduction in our capital budget when we reported the end of 2019 in February. At this point we have made a further reduction in our capital expenditures. For this year, 2020, relatively its more. We are basically putting in place purchase orders and finding contracts for works related to our projects. And we expect given the time spent that we have \u2013 we expect to maintain - if we want to maintain the - a completion date for now. For 2020 for instance we have to reduce our budget in $38.6 million, for 2021 it's $132.8 million reduction and in total for the next five years, it's about $367.5 million.Basically, the cost reduction in CapEx has come from minor projects at the Toquepala operations. We have decreased over there some grades that we were considering for the next five years. We have postponed them for a little bit longer. And also for the - for the - well we were considering the construction of a new smelter in Peru that required certain investments in short time and we have decided to postpone these investments for a while.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thank you. And then I was just wondering if you could provide any framework for how to think about the decision regarding the dividend. So how much does the board take into consideration the copper price or the sustain - importance of sustaining its CapEx levels or is it a combination of both? Or is it a given free cash flow level that they consider or any other color would be great.\nRaul Jacob: Well, if you look at the results for the first quarter and how we being \u2013 the company has been approving their dividend in the last \u2013 say its through 2018 the company approved for - the board approved dividends of $0.40 per share in each of their quarters, even though we have certain points in time prices well, lower than what we had at the end of 2010. I mentioned already that we were at about to - a little bit north of 280 and that will obviously go to our smelted [ph] prices today.In today's prices, at least, we believe that the company could be holding on the $0.40 dividend, but the board decided to be more cautious in this occasion due to the lack of clarity that we have regarding the supply and demand balance in the next few months for copper.Even though we feel very comfortable with our cash costs. As I mentioned, it will be about $0.77 for per pound and that put us at probably at the lowest cost level of the first quartile, even though we believe that this is a very comfortable situation for us and that we don't have, other than the projects that you know that we\u2019re undertaking, other major cash out commitment for the next few years, it was decided to slow down a little bit on dividends for and to see \u2013 until we see - we have some more clarity.This quarter, the second quarter, we have paid one of the debts that we have. It was $400 million on bond that was paid on April 16. That was [indiscernible] And our cash position even though its sold, so far right now, we believe that it's better to maintain a prudent view on these matters and to \u2013 well, be sure we're cash flow positive in these difficult times.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thank you and best of health, Raul.\nRaul Jacob: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Brandt with HSBC.\nJohn Brandt: Hi. Good morning, Raul. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask you about demand. What are your customers saying, are they \u2013 do they continue to take their contracted volumes. Are you seeing any deferrals of volumes or are you still able to sell everything you can produce. And are you having any issues logistically getting it from Peru and Mexico to the clients.And then secondly, you touched on a little bit on the supply chain issues for your current operations. I'm hoping you can comment a little bit on any issues you're having on supply chain from projects, are you seeing sort of delays in getting equipment, any contract of works? I mean, I'm trying to understand \u2013 I know you said there's no official change in project timelines, but what is the likelihood that because of the COVID outbreak, you potentially push those projects back and there is some delay? Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: Sure. Thank you for your question, John. Well, basically we're selling all the material that we're producing. Obviously, the transportation has been a little bit more complicated particularity first week of April and the end of March when we have - we had some logistics issues, not only on our ports, but also on the ports of our clients where operations were restricted or with less workforce, as happens to be the case in the ports that we operate in Peru and the one that we used in Mexico, the Guaymas port.In terms of sales, we haven't had any problems with our customers. We are shipping, delivery is okay. Let me mention something, when we have the financial crisis back in 2008, 2009, we sold all the copper that we produced, even though we knew at the time that demand dropped by 7%, demand for refine copper dropped by 7% during those years.So it seems that the quality of the material that we provide to our customers is appreciated and that it's helping that to maintain our sales, physical sales with no significant issues.About supply chain. Well, we have some problems at the beginning because certain important suppliers of us decided to shut down their facilities. For instance, an exclusive factory in Peru that was key for us shut down facilities, and that was a problem. Also getting lime, which is the basic material for our concentrator and smelting operations was somehow difficult in Peru at certain point in time.But these problems were fixed, and we are currently being supplied on a reasonable level. Obviously, we're working with slightly less base of inventory in much of our key inputs, but that's \u2013 well, that's a sign of the current times.On the on the project, certainly, certain activities related to projects cannot be provided at this point, because they require travelling or site visits that are not low at this point. That's the downside of two of the projects activities.On the upside, I\u2019d say that all the movement equipment, I mean, by these, the tractor trucks, et cetera, drilling, drillers, well some other companies are canceling their purchases, and that has made us to move ahead in the waiting line for this moving equipment.So in a way it has different effect. So we - that's why we want to wait a little bit to pause and see specifically what we're seeing more a clearer - clear tendency in this matter.\nJohn Brandt: Its great. Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Hernan Kisluk with MetLife.\nHernan Kisluk: Hello, good morning. Thank you for the presentation. I have two quick questions. The first one is, if you could provide a breakdown of variable versus fixed cost included in your cash cost? And the second one if you have available any kind of committed credit facilities?\nRaul Jacob: The second please?\nHernan Kisluk: If you have any kind of committed credit facilities?\nRaul Jacob: I'm sorry, I couldn't - I couldn't get what you said on the second one.\nHernan Kisluk: If you have available some credit - committed credit facilities, you will be paid\u2026\nRaul Jacob: Okay, sure. No, we don't. Last year we did \u2013 I am starting by your second question. Good afternoon. Last year, we issued $1 billion bond that is paying a base interest rate of 4.5%. We think that we have no problem. We are required to go to the financial markets, but even as these prices are over, we are cash flow positive. So we don't see the reason for having any specific facilities that are related to revolving, for instance, or this type of facility.On the question on variable versus fixed cost, about 30% of our costs are fixed. The rest of it is variable. If you look at the mines, over there it's probably more like a 25% fix, while the metallurgical facilities are little bit more than 30%.So we have some extra room if we were to reduce our production, but please keep in mind, that and this is an important point for all of our listeners. Keep in mind that all of our facilities are very competitive cost wise. We don't have a high cost facility at Southern Copper. The most - the cash growth reflects that condition and its relatively similar, if you look at the four major operations that we have.\nHernan Kisluk: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Thank you very much. Just a quick question for me. How do you think about the current oil price? Not so much the outlook, but is there anything we are missing. Although then you know, presumably would benefit your fuel costs, in terms of lower fuel costs going into the second quarter, may be partly offsetting the lower copper price we're seeing at the moment.But is there any other place in your operation where we should think about what the current low oil price, how its affecting your \u2013 either your results or your overall operations? That is the question. Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: Sure. Well, oil represented a while ago, last year for instance about 14% of our operating costs. The last quarter it was 12.7% of our operating cost. So obviously - and at the end of the second quarter, the first quarter we didn't have the significant price reduction that oil has had in the last few \u2013 the same week or week and half ago.Mainly, we would use diesel for moving our truck force. We use some diesel for our smelting operations and that's basically it. So it's an important material. It will reduce its impact on total cost, that's for sure and we believe that - that that's somehow an offset any time that we have a reduction in copper price. It's just truly joined by a reduction in oil prices, as well FX impact.In the case of FX, I reported on our review in cost that we are - the first quarter we had reduction of about $35 million in our operating cost due to foreign exchange adjustment. That has been much more important in Mexico where the Mexican peso devaluation or depreciation has been slightly lower than 25% than in Peru, in Peru the depreciation of the Peruvian sol has been about 4%. So you can see there that it's different in terms of the impact on the two countries.By the way, I like to mention now that our net earnings were impact, the higher effective tax rate in the first quarter of the 2020 this year due to the impact on our local financial tax payments in Mexico and Peru related to exchange gain variances that according to Mexican and Peruvian tax laws, generates certain tax profits and that has been reflected in our first quarter effective tax rate that is unusually much higher than the average, 38% that we have on a normal year basis, its little bit, almost 12 points over that, 12 percentage points over that and that's how we are seeing much higher - much higher tax rates in this quarter than what we \u2013 we expect on a normal \u2013 in the normal course of operations.\nOperator: Andreas, does that answer your question?\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: It does actually. Actually maybe, one quick follow up, just to clarify, so we can assume that you're not hedging your oil exposure or your fuel exposure in any material ways. Is that fair to assume?\nRaul Jacob: We don't have to indicate it right now and we are looking into the matter. But no, we haven't had any decision on that.\nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much. That's all my questions. Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you so much. And our next question is from Thiago Lofiego with Bradesco BBI. Please go ahead. Thiago, your line is open.\nThiago Lofiego: Hi, I'm sorry, I was on mute. Can you hear me now?\nRaul Jacob: Yes.\nThiago Lofiego: Okay. Hi, Raul. How are you?\nRaul Jacob: Fine. How are you, Thiago.\nThiago Lofiego: Good. Good. Okay. So just two quick questions here. One is on the average capacity utilization you're running right now. You mentioned you're running at around 90% in Peru, if I'm not mistaken. Did you provide that number for Mexico as well?And the second question is are there any specific rules for different operations or regions within Mexico and Peru in regards to the - you know, the shut down or reduction in operations, reduction in utilization rates for the mining operations and if you see risks of further reductions on production in any regions or mines within those two countries? And also when do you expect to be back to 100% utilization in both countries?\nRaul Jacob: Okay. Let me start by the - last part of your question. Well, once we be able to operate with all the usual activities that we have for the mining as well as the metallurgical operations, we'll have certainly, have to look into how that we're going to do the catch up in certain maintenance expenditures or certain activities that have been postponed due to the operation, as well as the maintenance activity that has been postponed due to the emergency.That will take a while. We believe that we will be able to pass through these situation during the second quarter of this year. If possible, we will certainly try to do it the quickest as possible. So we are operating at full capacity.Now, in Peru, as I say, we're operating over 90% of capacity in terms of production. In Mexico, we are not at that high level, we are operating the SX-EW facility that are important at the Mexican operations. You've seen what we have available in terms of PLF.At the mining operations, we are - we're doing also as much as we can on the mineral production side. But obviously, you have to have certain limits because of the way that we are operating. You've seen, what we're doing is we're focusing what we call critical activities, we're covering those. These are very important. For instance, these activities are curtailing that certain -- the waste or the tailings are under control. We're using water for some of the facilities. So we don't have any environmental issues in our facility.So these are these are critical things that we're doing and we're doing that in order to maintain our operations sound and waiting for the proper time to increase at full capacity, our Mexican as well Peruvian facilities.\nThiago Lofiego: So you would assume that you're going to be back to 100% most likely in the third quarter, is that fair to assume?\nRaul Jacob: That's a fair assumption.\nThiago Lofiego: And regarding a - at least a ballpark number of where you're \u2013 where is your capacity utilization in Mexico right now, is it 60%, 50%, 70%?\nRaul Jacob: Well, on the SX-EW facilities we\u2019re operating using all the capacity that we have for the mining operations, it's slightly lower than what we have. We're concentrating on producing mineral. So with that we are maintaining our production level as expected in the original plan, less 5% to 6% on that.\nThiago Lofiego: Okay. Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible] Management. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thank you for doing the call. Just, it wasn't clear on the gentlemen's pre-discussion what the capacity utilization was in Mexico compared to Peru, if you can clarify this?And then my second question is on liquidity, it seems like subsequent lead to the end of the third quarter you paid the $400 million bonds. So I'm curious what your cash position is pro forma payment of that debt and if you're comfortable with your liquidity position after paying this debt? Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: Yes. We already paid, if you\u2019ve seen our cash position at the end of March, it was a little bit close to $2.1 billion in cash where we paid $400 million dollars of debt in April. So just a simple arithmetic, not - we have not affected our cash position significantly after - I mean, other than this statement.\nUnidentified Analyst: So is it fair to assume that - sorry, just to clarify, so it's fair to assume that you - after doing this payment, its like you're running at $1.7 billion in cash, is that kind of the way I have to assume\u2026\nRaul Jacob: About that\u2026\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. And then on the liquidity, I mean, going forward, you\u2019re okay with this?\nRaul Jacob: I am sorry, couldn\u2019t get what you said.\nUnidentified Analyst: Just you know, the liquidity and then the capacity utilization in Mexico, just something to recap \u2026\nRaul Jacob: Yes. Okay. Yes. Yes. It's important to mention that the first quarter of the year, usually we have to pay much - we have much more cash out expenses than say on the second quarter and the rest of the year. The reason for that is that we usually pay - we do our final payment of income taxes, it has been the case in the first quarter for the Peruvian operation, for Mexico it's on the second quarter that if there is any catch up at the end of the year that you have to pay on taxes, its coming for Peru in the first quarter for Mexico on the second quarter.So the first quarter we have to pay debt. Also, once 40% [ph] dividend was declared at the \u2013 for the fourth quarter 2019 that was paid on the first quarter as well. And some other taxes, the special mining tax are paid in Peru. So all of these, plus the workers participation affected the cash position of the company in the first quarter. And it's usually the case. So it's more like a seasonal - seasonal situation.So ending the first quarter with a little bit north of $2 billion show the capacity of cash generation that the company has, even though we pay certain amounts for taxes and the workers' profit sharing. Now that means that much more cash positive. Well, subtracting the impact of lower prices obviously, on second quarters and - in the second quarter and the second half of the year.So at this point, we are very comfortable with our cash position. We can see a reason for moving or going to financial markets. I think it's something that we are obviously evaluating on an ongoing basis and that's how we see right now.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. And on the Mexico capacity utilization, sorry, I didn't catch that?\nRaul Jacob: Well, we are \u2013 we\u2019re operating at the SX-EW plants with a much higher capacity than the traditional mining because of the characteristics of these two different technologies. So that's where we are.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you so much. And our next question is from Lucas Yang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLucas Yang: Hi. My questions actually were answered already. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAlex Hacking: Yeah. Good morning, Raul. Thanks for the call and I hope you're doing well. Just a couple of follow up. Firstly on net debt, the company has been holding that net debt around $5 billion for the last few years. Are you still overall comfortable with that level?And then the second question, just on the supply chain, just a follow up a little bit. I guess, when do you start to reach critical levels of key supplies and improve if the restrictions are lifted? I mean, are you at a point where you're down to a few days or weeks here or you could continue for longer? Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: On net debt. Well, we believe that we're okay, where we are now. This is, as I say, something that we evaluate at an ongoing basis. We see no reason after, as I'd say, we issue $1 billion in debt last year for financing the project that we have in Mexico. I think that that's fine for now.Now on the on the supply chains and supply issues. Well, we - I think we are doing better now than say three weeks ago in Peru. Two weeks ago, certainly for the suppliers of us, I mentioned lime and [indiscernible] as an example had their plants shut down at that time. So it was very difficult for us to get in this materials, and we were basically running out of inventories of them.We - after talks with the government and the companies, they both agreed that they were necessary for our supply chains and opened up their operations and we\u2019re being reasonably well supplied now of those materials as well as - of orders. And what we're seeing here in Peru is that Peruvian government is now moving to a second stage in this emergency, and the second stage means also that certain economic activities, and we believe that mining will be among them. It will be considered for smart open up.So we will - are expecting some regulations for us to improve our operational level at this point, but we have to wait for that. The government has announced that as of next week we should have some regulations on that, so we're expecting them and we believe that, that will be even - allow us to operate at a much higher level of activity.\nAlex Hacking: Great, thanks. Well, take care.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome, Alex. Good to talk to you.\nAlex Hacking: You too.\nOperator: Thank you so much. Our next question is from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much. In the first quarters the mine output averaged 80 to 81,000 tons a month. In the current last April which is almost over, do you think the mine output will be closer to 50,000 tons or 60,000 tons, or 70,000 tons?\nRaul Jacob: Well, it depends on how are we doing in terms of our different plants, at this point we expect it to be slightly higher than 70,000 tons, significant contribution from the Peruvian operations.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos de Alba: Yeah. Thank you very much. Can you hear me well, Raul?\nRaul Jacob: Yes. Go ahead, Carlos.\nCarlos de Alba: So I know there is - these are uncertain times, but maybe could you comment on - as to how you see production, copper production and CapEx in the next few years and if that has changed based on what we're going through regarding the virus? Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: You mean for us?\nCarlos de Alba: Yeah, for you. Yes, for foreign copper.\nRaul Jacob: Well, basically we\u2019re maintaining our view on the production where we are - the fact that the Peruvian operations are low to operate and we're almost at the full capacity reserve is encouraging because we're meeting production at the Mexican facilities at certain point. But we believe that we will be able to overcome this matters, as possible, through this quarter.In terms of our production, basically what we have been saying, I'll refresh the forecast. For this year, our - I'm looking at it on page, for this year in our plan as mentioned at the beginning of the year was 993,000 tons \u2013 I am sorry, that was 2019, for this year's 995,000 tons from fixed, for 2021, 986.3000 [ph] tons, 2022, 550,000, 2023, 166,000 million, 2024 1,100,000 [ph] tons for copper.We think that what is happening its affecting both supply and demand for copper. And the net effect on prices is not as hard as you may imagine at the very beginning. At the very beginning, we have reports on the company, the two market intelligence that demand was falling down by about 700,000 tons per year on a market that has 23.5 million tons of copper produced and consume of refined copper, no?But what we're seeing now is that it's not only demand and supply, but it's also decreasing. Let me mention this as an example, we have right now three major mines in Peru that are - two of them are shut down. Their capacity is about 400,000 tons per year of copper in each of the cases. So that's a 100,000 tons of work capacity of supply, the copper production that is up.And another one which is half a capacity of about 450,000 tons operating at 50% of capacity. So you have just in three significant players, about 1 million tons of annual capacity put aside. And that is somehow levelling the demand - to demand drop that we're seeing which is significant as well.As I mentioned before, our client base has not been affected so far. We are hoping that this is going to be the case, we're seeing as a very encouraging sign. The fact that China is moving forward with different smelting facilities, as well as the economic activities by China. We are expecting the other areas where we sold our copper which is Europe and the US to be also moving forward with the open up of their economic activities as a more significant move. That's our expectation. We believe that this should be an event that affects this year, but not necessarily in next month's.\nCarlos de Alba: So can you clarify, you don't expect the current deferral of stripping in Peru and perhaps in Mexico to affect your production at least not materially. So you expect to catch up during the year and remain relatively flat versus prior production guidance, right?\nRaul Jacob: We expect to do a catch up plan. We're considering being a catch up plan that will mean for instance shrinking certain equipment for a few months and doing the additional stripping that we require. So at this point, we're not expecting to have an impact due to stripping in our operations.\nCarlos de Alba: Okay. Thank you. I'll keep something like that.\nRaul Jacob: Let me say something else, Carlos, and to all of our audience. We will provide - we think that we're currently in a very unstable environment. We need to have some more clarity and we believe that the next few weeks we will have that and we'll report on a more complete base on our July call, looking at our second quarter results.\nCarlos de Alba: Wonderful. Thank you, Raul.\nRaul Jacob: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Raul, I am not showing any further questions from the queue. I\u2019ll pass it back to you for any final remarks or thoughts.\nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper first quarter of 2020. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope you \u2013 I hope to have you back with us when we report the second quarter. Thank you very much. And have a nice day.\nOperator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's program. And you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Carmine, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Southern Copper's first quarter 2020 results conference call. Participating with me in today's conference are Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member; and Mr. Xavier Garcia de Quevedo, also a Board member.Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones, in these difficult times that we're currently facing. In today's call, we will begin with an update from the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations. We will then review the copper markets and Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, and expansion projects. After that, we will open the session for questions.The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking proper care of our personnel has always been of paramount importance to our company. While confronting the COVID-19 pandemic in the countries where we operate, Southern Copper continues essential operations in compliance with local emergency measures.As soon as COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Southern Copper implemented rigorous hygiene and sanitation protocols at all of its facilities to protect the health and welfare of its employees, their families and the neighboring communitiesThe statements from governmental authorities has made it clear that essential economic activities must continue during the COVID-19 health emergency and that industrial mining, which is closely linked to chemical and construction industries, is essential to the requirements of electrical, hospital and medical infrastructure, as well as for the manufacturing of health related supplies and technological equipment.These industries are indispensable and strengthen the infrastructure of manufacturing, logistics and support global supply chains. The strategic position of industrial mining as a supplier of key materials such as steel, copper, gold, coal, silver, zinc and cement has been recognized by the US, Canada, Mexico and Peru.These countries have confronted COVID-19 through social distancing and stay-at-home measures and recognize that industrial mining is indispensable to avoid the interruption of supply chains of essential products to fight the pandemic.Copper is indispensable for the manufacturing of specialized cables required to produce high-voltage electrical installations that supply electric power to local communities, hospitals and supply centers.Indeed, copper is essential for the manufacturing of electrical components required to generate, transmit and distribute electric power to urban centers. Electrical and electronic copper components are also necessary for medical equipment and appliances, cell phones, computer hardware, digital data transmission, images and voice.Copper is also required in surfaces to remove viruses and bacteria, which make it essential for the production of drinking water and air conditioning systems. Chemical industries with their metallurgical processes have proved to be vital in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the world.Given the nature of mining operations, with an highly automated is conducted in remote locations and with mandatory use of personal safety equipment, it is easier to implement and comply with COVID-19 protective measures, such as physical isolation and access control.Industrial mining uses advanced and reliable machinery and does not require high physical concentration of employees. In many cases, workers fulfill their duties maintaining distances of more than 100 meters from their coworkers.The Company has developed rigorous COVID-19 emergency protocol and only 40% of the labor force in Mexico, or about 6,300 employees are currently working on site under strict safety measures. The remaining workforce of 8,751 employees are working from home, including all high risk individuals due to age or prior medical conditions.For the Peruvian operations about 3,500 employees or 39% of the workforce are working on site under strict safety measures, while the remaining 5,468 employees are working from home or staying at it.It should be noted that to date, there have been not known cases of COVID-19 contagion among our employees at our mining facilities in Mexico and Peru. Our COVID-19 emergency protocol has reinforced preventive measures such as disinfecting, clinical monitoring before work, cleaning and sanitizing of work areas and respect for social distancing.We have also restricted access to contractors, suppliers and non-essential personnel and enforced multiple actions to limit workforce exposure to the COVID-19 such as travel restrictions, prohibiting face-to-face meetings and urging frequent hand washing, as well as adherence to all other health, safety and social distancing measures issued by governmental authorities.From the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic, Southern Copper has been implementing a strong prevention measures to protect the health of its workers, their families, and their communities. For this purpose, the Company has approved a budget of $11.2 million for donations and general support for the population of Peru and Mexico.As a way to content the pandemic we have donated medical supplies and dozens of mechanical ventilators for breathing support to hospitals in the communities where we operate.In Sonora, we have established 88 confined beds in Company housing property, to serve as temporary sanitary facilities for people presenting symptoms of respiratory disease who require isolation or moderate hospital care.We are also donating over 200,000 items of personal protection equipment to medical staff, and 30,000 hygiene kits to our workers and to the population of our areas of influence, including general information materials about the pandemic.We have also donated cleaning and personal protection equipment to the staff members of National Guard of Mexico, and the Peruvian police and army. Additionally, we are helping vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly or disabled persons and pregnant women by donating more than 30,000 kits containing food and hygiene items.In addition to the above mentioned efforts, we have installed more than 200 portable sinks in strategic areas of the communities in order to reinforce preventive hand washing. Moreover, to endorse the stay at home measures, we have offered over 350 sports, cultural and educational workshops online and over 58,000 virtual instructing activities have been watched by 3,700 students from the schools sponsored by our Company.Additionally, throughout our Community Care Service we offer free medical, psychological and employment counselling 24 hours a day.Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. Copper, during the first quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange Copper Price decreased from an average of $2.82 per pound in the first quarter of 2019 to $2.56 per pound that is 9.2% reduction. As of today, we're seeing prices in the range of $2.20 to $2.30 per pound. Today, its about $2.33 as a reflection of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the demand and on copper supply.The world is currently experiencing the public health, financial and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since it is affecting both supply and demand, at this point it is difficult to assess the full effect of this crisis on the copper market balance and on copper prices.Let me say that on a normal year, we expect to have a seasonal copper inventories increase of about 200 to 250,000 tons in the first quarter of the year due to the New Year's festivities of China and the winter impact in demand of the Northern Hemisphere. This year we have the COVID-19 outbreaks as an additional end factor affecting copper demand and supply and obviously copper prices.At the end of 2019, copper demand for refined copper was estimated at 23.6 million tons and global inventory, that is the addition of the London Metal Exchange, the Comics, in Shanghai warehouses and an estimate on bonded warehouses. That number of inventories with some of those were 599,000 tons. By the end of February of this year, paid this inventory of warehouses, add up to 917,000 [ph] tons or 318,000 tons higher than the inventories at the end of last year.Last Friday, April 24, global inventories were estimated at 925,000 tons. This is 326,000 tons over the closing of 2019, not [ph] a reliable stable mark since they increase at the end of February. We believe this reflects the mentioned seasonal effects of about 250,000 tons due to the Chinese New Year and the winter effect I mentioned, as well as the additional market surplus created by the COVID-19 pandemic.In a normal year, we expect additional inventory to be partially absorbed through the rest of the year. For 2020, it is difficult to estimate when these may happen, since we are seeing a much weaker demand than last year.Let's now focus on Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 79.4% of our sales in the first quarter 2020. Copper production increased by 5.8% to 241,967 tons in the first quarter compared to 228,629 tons in the first quarter of last year. This was principally due to high production at our Peruvian mines.Toquepala mine production increased by 14.5%, as a result of additional copper production of 8,574 tons from the new concentrator and Cuajone mine production increased by 23.2% due to higher ore grades all great recoveries.In Mexico copper production slightly increased by 1.4% when compared to last year's first quarter, mainly due to lower production at the Buenavista operations, as a result of lower ore grades. This effect was partially offset by higher production at our IMMSA unit that increased its total production by 30.5%, as a result of the restoration of the San Martin mine operations.For molybdenum, it represented 7.3% of the company sales value in the first quarter of 2020 and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $9.56 per pound in the quarter, which compares with $11.70 per pound in the first quarter of 2019, an 18.3% decrease.Molybdenum mine production increased by 39.7% in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of last year. It was principally due to significantly higher production at our Toquepala mine. We had a new molybdenum plant starting in the second quarter of 2019 and as a result of that the Toquepala mine increased its production by 280% [ph] in the first quarter of this year. Well, this plant produced 993 tons of new molybdenum production and as I say began operation in April of last year.We also have the benefits of much higher production of molybdenum at Cuajone, which increases its molybdenum production by 42.6% due also to higher grades.Silver represented 5.1% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2020 with an average price of $16.87 per ounce in the quarter, an 8.7% increase from the first quarter of last year. Silver is currently our second by-product.Mined silver production increased by 21.6% in the first quarter from this year from the same - from the first quarter of 2019, as a result of higher production at all our operations, particularly at IMMSA, the underground complex mines that we have, which increased its production by 35.7% due to restored production at the San Martin mine. San Martin approximately at 607,000 ounces in the first quarter of this year of silver - ounces of silver.In addition, there was higher production on the Toquepala mine that increased its production 16.3% in silver, that was 128,000 tons of ounces of silver from the new concentrator, as well as higher production at the Buenavista mine, that increased its production by 13.3% due to higher grades and recoveries.For zinc, it represented 3.8% of our sales volume in the fourth quarter of this year with an average price of $0.97 per pound in the quarter, a price increase of 21.1% from the first quarter of last year.Zinc mine production increased by 3.8% to 19,263 tons in the first quarter of 2020, mainly due to 2,851 [ph] tons of new production coming from the San Martin mine, as well as increased production in the Charcas mine, increased its production by 9%. And Santa Barbara that also increased its production by 7.2%.These two operations, plus the San Martin increased - were partially offset by Santa Eulalia mine production - reduction that reduced its production by 90%. Santa Eulalia, regarding this operation the company has decided to shut down its mine facility due to several closing events at the mine. We're currently evaluating different options to supply the concentrator of Santa Eulalia. Refinancing production increased by 8.5% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to first quarter of 2019.Financial results. For the first quarter of 2010 sales were $1.7 billion, that is $33.7 million lower than sales for the first quarter of last year or 1.9% lower. Copper sales volume increased by 10.6%, value decreased by 3.5% and it's an area of lower prices. As I mentioned, London Metal Exchange price decreased by 9.2% in the quarter.Regarding our main by-products, we have higher sales of molybdenum, 6.6% due to higher volume or 41.9%, partially offset by lower prices. Silver sales increased by 14.7% due to higher volume and better prices. For sales of zinc even though we had higher volume of 7.1%, its value was lower by 15.4% due to lower price.Our total operating costs and expenses increased by $126.7 million or 12% when compared to the first quarter of 2019. The main cost increment has been in purchased copper, $77.4 million, lower capitalized leachable material $73.5 million, the term [ph] materials $16.8 million, depreciation $11.3 and other factors.These cost increments were partially compensated by exchange rate variances that decreased cost by $30 million and lower inventory consumption by $20.6 million and fuel cost decreased by $8.7 million in the first quarter.Regarding EBITDA, for the first quarter of 2020 it was $719.8 million, this is a 41.8% margin compared with $889 million or 50.8% margin in the first quarter of 2019.Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.41 per pound in the first quarter of 2020. That is $0.171 [ph] lower than the value for the fourth quarter of last year. This 10.8% decrease in operating cash cost is a result of lower cost per pound from production cost, treatment and refining charges, and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower premiums.Southern Copper operating cash including the benefit of by-product credits was $0.774 per pound in the first quarter of 2020. This cash cost was $0.204 lower than the cash cost of $0.978 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is a 20.9% reduction in cash cost.Regarding by-products, we have a total credit of $332.2 million or $0.641 per pound in the first quarter of 2020. These figures represent a 5.6% increase when compared with the credit $0.607 [ph] per pound in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc and sulfuric acid and decreased for phosphates [ph]Net income attributable to SCC shareholders in the first quarter of 2020 was $214.8 million, that is 12.5% of sales or diluted earnings per share of $0.28 per pound \u2013 per share.Capital expenditures. Southern Copper as you know, as an investment philosophy of not basing its growth on the outlook of copper prices, on fact, on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to invest on a continuous basis in our great asset portfolio.In the first quarter of 2020, we spent $101 million in capital investments, this is a 41.7% lower than the same period of 2019 and represented 58.8% of our net income for the quarter.For the Peruvian projects. We have currently a portfolio of $2.8 billion of approved projects in Peru, of which $1.6 billion have already been invested. Considering the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion project and Los Chancas, a $2.8 billion project, our total investment program in Peru will increase to $8.1 billion.For Tia Maria, on July 8 of 2019 we received a construction permit for this 120,000 tons annual SX-EW copper greenfield project with a capital budget of $1.4 billion. The government awarded the permit after completing an exhaustive review process of environmental and social matters, recognizing compliance with all established regulatory requirements and having addressed all observation rates.The challenges to the construction permit were decided on October 30 of last year and the Mining Council of the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines gratified the construction permit for the Tia Maria project.For the Mexican projects, in the case of Mexico as you know we have three projects, the Buenavista concentrator, which is in Sonora. It's a project that is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 80,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. Currently, we have completed the basic engineering and the detailed engineering is in process.The site operation has started and the purchase orders for the new equipment has increased. The project is fully permitted. The capital budget is $430 million. And we expect to initiate operations in the third quarter of 2022. When completed, this facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and will provide 409 direct jobs and 1,417 indirect jobs.For the Pilares project also located in Sonora, it is operating 6 kilometers away from La Caridad. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with an annual production capacity 35,000 tons of copper and constitutes. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining traffic under construction and will be used to transport the ore for the pit to its primary freshers of the La Caridad copper concentrate.This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grades, combining the 2.78% effective from Pilares, the ore grade - of Pilares, with the 2.34% ore grade from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million and we expected to start production during the first half of 2022.The whole project in Mexico that we're undertaking is project El Pilar, also in Sonora. This is a low capital-intensive offer greenfield, which is approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven probable reserves for 325 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 28.7% [ph]In Pilares, we just operate as a conventional open pit mine and copper cathodes will be produced using the highly cost efficient and environmentally friendly SX/EW technology. The budget for Pilares is $310 million and we expect it to start about during 2023. The construction of the pilot plant is finished and the production tests are being developed with encouraging results.Regarding dividends, as you know, it is a company policy to review at each Board meeting the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend.Accordingly, as announced to the market on April 23rd, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock payable on May 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 13 of this year. Despite the strong cash position of the company and the reasonably good results for the quarter, due to uncertainty of the metal markets and world [ph] economy and the important expansions planned by our company, the Board has taken this occasion and more cautious approach regarding dividends.Consequently, our Board approved a dividend equivalent to 50% of what the company has been paying the last few quarters. Considering Southern Copper's strong financial - strong financial condition and competitive cost structure, we have no doubt that Southern will endure the current difficult time and overcome the crisis.With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us and we will like now to open up the phone for questions. Thank you very much for your question Alfonso. Well, as you - we have mentioned in our report, we're operating with about 40% of our workforce in Mexico and 39% of it in Peru. Obviously, following and complying with all regulations that have been established by the authorities in both countries.When you operate with this much lower part of your usual and recommended workforce, what happens is that you are postponing, somehow, certain maintenance works and certain works at the mine operations.In Peru, our plants are what we call confined at the -- at the mine in the sense that we have basically agreed with our workforce over there to shut down the facilities in order to avoid the possibility of contagion. So we're following as I mentioned very strict protocols for our operations. That includes the suppliers of our materials that we require to operate.At the mines, generally speaking, we have for now postponed several works related to leachable material and stripping. That's something that is put aside for this time of emergency. In Peru, we are expecting the authorities to open up certain activities that are concurrent with mine operations and allows us to operate at a much higher activity level than what we're doing now.In Mexico, we're currently operating as I said with 40% of the workforce on the metallurgical side, this is considered part of chemical industries and that we have no significant cessation to our operations other than having the material available and that's obviously restricted due to the measures taken by the authority.At this point for the year, it's hard to provide a guidance. We will provide much certain guidance that in July when we had a better handle of where we are in terms of production and the emergency plans that we can put in place once we have more openness to operate our facilities because of slowing down of the of the crisis for changing regulations.Having said that, we have made some estimate that we may have smaller production of about between 3% to 4% for 2020 when you compare that with our initial plan and that's basically our current view on copper. You're welcome. Carlos, I am sorry, but I can't \u2013 Carlos, I can't copy your words, it seems that you are having some extra noise in your microphone. Yes. Yes. Thank you for your question Carlos. On the Mexican mines \u2013 let me first mention, in the Peruvian mines where our mines are operating at a very high capacity level, over 90% most of the time, close to capacity in some days. As I mentioned our mines are confined or shut down. You can't - you can't go - if you go out, you'll not go in until the quarantine that has been established by the authorities is finished. And that on the metallurgical facilities we're operating with a production of concentrate, we're smelting them and moving forward with that.In the case of the Mexican operations, well, there are certain facilities that just cannot be stopped. Let me put up an example, the SX-EW operations. We have stopped at the mine site to produce leachable material, but the areas where you collect the material for operating the SX-EW plant, it's producing the pregnant liquid solution that you have to either store or process and storing has a certain limiting capacity. So eventually, you have to keep producing in order to maintain a certain level of operation.In Mexico, we have diminished at the mine site all the operations related to - related to stripping and leachable material and produced it in a very limited fashion mineral for the concentrators.The deferral for stripping in the second quarter [indiscernible] it's - this is what we're seeing, frankly we are postponing certain maintenance and certain jobs at the mine, as well as the metallurgical facility because we're operating with much less workforce than normal times.As a consequence, we're postponing certain repair jobs et cetera, et cetera. Well, we have to undertake that eventually and obviously we are not - we will have to consider at certain point in time if we cannot perform these maintenance and jobs to either reduce the operational level or shut down certain equipments that are required and that may require maintenance in the next few weeks or so.The cost of that we don't have it at this point specifically defined, but we do know that we will have to make a special effort in the second part of the year or in the second quarter if available to do a catch up. Our current plan is that at certain point after the emergency has passed, we will consider for instance, the rental of [lots of] [ph] equipment in order to do to a catch up in \u2013 what I mentioned as stripping or leachable material moving at the mine.At the concentrator, it's mainly maintenance that were postponed, in some cases. In some other cases, we have advanced this maintenance in the first quarter because we knew and we realized that we were having some difficulties in the coming weeks after the initial outbreak of the COVID-19.So, at this point I can't provide you with a specific figure on that. We do know that it will require an extra effort and we will - we will provide information on details from that when we are with a more clear situation, which we believe will be by the end of the second quarter of this year. Yeah, Timna. Thank you for your question. No at this point we haven't done any changes in our goals. As you pointed out, we made a significant adjustment \u2013 I'd say a reduction in our capital budget when we reported the end of 2019 in February. At this point we have made a further reduction in our capital expenditures. For this year, 2020, relatively its more. We are basically putting in place purchase orders and finding contracts for works related to our projects. And we expect given the time spent that we have \u2013 we expect to maintain - if we want to maintain the - a completion date for now. For 2020 for instance we have to reduce our budget in $38.6 million, for 2021 it's $132.8 million reduction and in total for the next five years, it's about $367.5 million.Basically, the cost reduction in CapEx has come from minor projects at the Toquepala operations. We have decreased over there some grades that we were considering for the next five years. We have postponed them for a little bit longer. And also for the - for the - well we were considering the construction of a new smelter in Peru that required certain investments in short time and we have decided to postpone these investments for a while. Well, if you look at the results for the first quarter and how we being \u2013 the company has been approving their dividend in the last \u2013 say its through 2018 the company approved for - the board approved dividends of $0.40 per share in each of their quarters, even though we have certain points in time prices well, lower than what we had at the end of 2010. I mentioned already that we were at about to - a little bit north of 280 and that will obviously go to our smelted [ph] prices today.In today's prices, at least, we believe that the company could be holding on the $0.40 dividend, but the board decided to be more cautious in this occasion due to the lack of clarity that we have regarding the supply and demand balance in the next few months for copper.Even though we feel very comfortable with our cash costs. As I mentioned, it will be about $0.77 for per pound and that put us at probably at the lowest cost level of the first quartile, even though we believe that this is a very comfortable situation for us and that we don't have, other than the projects that you know that we're undertaking, other major cash out commitment for the next few years, it was decided to slow down a little bit on dividends for and to see \u2013 until we see - we have some more clarity.This quarter, the second quarter, we have paid one of the debts that we have. It was $400 million on bond that was paid on April 16. That was [indiscernible] And our cash position even though its sold, so far right now, we believe that it's better to maintain a prudent view on these matters and to \u2013 well, be sure we're cash flow positive in these difficult times. Thank you. Sure. Thank you for your question, John. Well, basically we're selling all the material that we're producing. Obviously, the transportation has been a little bit more complicated particularity first week of April and the end of March when we have - we had some logistics issues, not only on our ports, but also on the ports of our clients where operations were restricted or with less workforce, as happens to be the case in the ports that we operate in Peru and the one that we used in Mexico, the Guaymas port.In terms of sales, we haven't had any problems with our customers. We are shipping, delivery is okay. Let me mention something, when we have the financial crisis back in 2008, 2009, we sold all the copper that we produced, even though we knew at the time that demand dropped by 7%, demand for refine copper dropped by 7% during those years.So it seems that the quality of the material that we provide to our customers is appreciated and that it's helping that to maintain our sales, physical sales with no significant issues.About supply chain. Well, we have some problems at the beginning because certain important suppliers of us decided to shut down their facilities. For instance, an exclusive factory in Peru that was key for us shut down facilities, and that was a problem. Also getting lime, which is the basic material for our concentrator and smelting operations was somehow difficult in Peru at certain point in time.But these problems were fixed, and we are currently being supplied on a reasonable level. Obviously, we're working with slightly less base of inventory in much of our key inputs, but that's \u2013 well, that's a sign of the current times.On the on the project, certainly, certain activities related to projects cannot be provided at this point, because they require travelling or site visits that are not low at this point. That's the downside of two of the projects activities.On the upside, I'd say that all the movement equipment, I mean, by these, the tractor trucks, et cetera, drilling, drillers, well some other companies are canceling their purchases, and that has made us to move ahead in the waiting line for this moving equipment.So in a way it has different effect. So we - that's why we want to wait a little bit to pause and see specifically what we're seeing more a clearer - clear tendency in this matter. You're welcome. The second please? I'm sorry, I couldn't - I couldn't get what you said on the second one. Okay, sure. No, we don't. Last year we did \u2013 I am starting by your second question. Good afternoon. Last year, we issued $1 billion bond that is paying a base interest rate of 4.5%. We think that we have no problem. We are required to go to the financial markets, but even as these prices are over, we are cash flow positive. So we don't see the reason for having any specific facilities that are related to revolving, for instance, or this type of facility.On the question on variable versus fixed cost, about 30% of our costs are fixed. The rest of it is variable. If you look at the mines, over there it's probably more like a 25% fix, while the metallurgical facilities are little bit more than 30%.So we have some extra room if we were to reduce our production, but please keep in mind, that and this is an important point for all of our listeners. Keep in mind that all of our facilities are very competitive cost wise. We don't have a high cost facility at Southern Copper. The most - the cash growth reflects that condition and its relatively similar, if you look at the four major operations that we have. Sure. Well, oil represented a while ago, last year for instance about 14% of our operating costs. The last quarter it was 12.7% of our operating cost. So obviously - and at the end of the second quarter, the first quarter we didn't have the significant price reduction that oil has had in the last few \u2013 the same week or week and half ago.Mainly, we would use diesel for moving our truck force. We use some diesel for our smelting operations and that's basically it. So it's an important material. It will reduce its impact on total cost, that's for sure and we believe that - that that's somehow an offset any time that we have a reduction in copper price. It's just truly joined by a reduction in oil prices, as well FX impact.In the case of FX, I reported on our review in cost that we are - the first quarter we had reduction of about $35 million in our operating cost due to foreign exchange adjustment. That has been much more important in Mexico where the Mexican peso devaluation or depreciation has been slightly lower than 25% than in Peru, in Peru the depreciation of the Peruvian sol has been about 4%. So you can see there that it's different in terms of the impact on the two countries.By the way, I like to mention now that our net earnings were impact, the higher effective tax rate in the first quarter of the 2020 this year due to the impact on our local financial tax payments in Mexico and Peru related to exchange gain variances that according to Mexican and Peruvian tax laws, generates certain tax profits and that has been reflected in our first quarter effective tax rate that is unusually much higher than the average, 38% that we have on a normal year basis, its little bit, almost 12 points over that, 12 percentage points over that and that's how we are seeing much higher - much higher tax rates in this quarter than what we \u2013 we expect on a normal \u2013 in the normal course of operations. We don't have to indicate it right now and we are looking into the matter. But no, we haven't had any decision on that. You're welcome. Yes. Fine. How are you, Thiago. Okay. Let me start by the - last part of your question. Well, once we be able to operate with all the usual activities that we have for the mining as well as the metallurgical operations, we'll have certainly, have to look into how that we're going to do the catch up in certain maintenance expenditures or certain activities that have been postponed due to the operation, as well as the maintenance activity that has been postponed due to the emergency.That will take a while. We believe that we will be able to pass through these situation during the second quarter of this year. If possible, we will certainly try to do it the quickest as possible. So we are operating at full capacity.Now, in Peru, as I say, we're operating over 90% of capacity in terms of production. In Mexico, we are not at that high level, we are operating the SX-EW facility that are important at the Mexican operations. You've seen what we have available in terms of PLF.At the mining operations, we are - we're doing also as much as we can on the mineral production side. But obviously, you have to have certain limits because of the way that we are operating. You've seen, what we're doing is we're focusing what we call critical activities, we're covering those. These are very important. For instance, these activities are curtailing that certain -- the waste or the tailings are under control. We're using water for some of the facilities. So we don't have any environmental issues in our facility.So these are these are critical things that we're doing and we're doing that in order to maintain our operations sound and waiting for the proper time to increase at full capacity, our Mexican as well Peruvian facilities. That's a fair assumption. Well, on the SX-EW facilities we're operating using all the capacity that we have for the mining operations, it's slightly lower than what we have. We're concentrating on producing mineral. So with that we are maintaining our production level as expected in the original plan, less 5% to 6% on that. Yes. We already paid, if you've seen our cash position at the end of March, it was a little bit close to $2.1 billion in cash where we paid $400 million dollars of debt in April. So just a simple arithmetic, not - we have not affected our cash position significantly after - I mean, other than this statement. About that... I am sorry, couldn't get what you said. Yes. Okay. Yes. Yes. It's important to mention that the first quarter of the year, usually we have to pay much - we have much more cash out expenses than say on the second quarter and the rest of the year. The reason for that is that we usually pay - we do our final payment of income taxes, it has been the case in the first quarter for the Peruvian operation, for Mexico it's on the second quarter that if there is any catch up at the end of the year that you have to pay on taxes, its coming for Peru in the first quarter for Mexico on the second quarter.So the first quarter we have to pay debt. Also, once 40% [ph] dividend was declared at the \u2013 for the fourth quarter 2019 that was paid on the first quarter as well. And some other taxes, the special mining tax are paid in Peru. So all of these, plus the workers participation affected the cash position of the company in the first quarter. And it's usually the case. So it's more like a seasonal - seasonal situation.So ending the first quarter with a little bit north of $2 billion show the capacity of cash generation that the company has, even though we pay certain amounts for taxes and the workers' profit sharing. Now that means that much more cash positive. Well, subtracting the impact of lower prices obviously, on second quarters and - in the second quarter and the second half of the year.So at this point, we are very comfortable with our cash position. We can see a reason for moving or going to financial markets. I think it's something that we are obviously evaluating on an ongoing basis and that's how we see right now. Well, we are \u2013 we're operating at the SX-EW plants with a much higher capacity than the traditional mining because of the characteristics of these two different technologies. So that's where we are. You're welcome. On net debt. Well, we believe that we're okay, where we are now. This is, as I say, something that we evaluate at an ongoing basis. We see no reason after, as I'd say, we issue $1 billion in debt last year for financing the project that we have in Mexico. I think that that's fine for now.Now on the on the supply chains and supply issues. Well, we - I think we are doing better now than say three weeks ago in Peru. Two weeks ago, certainly for the suppliers of us, I mentioned lime and [indiscernible] as an example had their plants shut down at that time. So it was very difficult for us to get in this materials, and we were basically running out of inventories of them.We - after talks with the government and the companies, they both agreed that they were necessary for our supply chains and opened up their operations and we're being reasonably well supplied now of those materials as well as - of orders. And what we're seeing here in Peru is that Peruvian government is now moving to a second stage in this emergency, and the second stage means also that certain economic activities, and we believe that mining will be among them. It will be considered for smart open up.So we will - are expecting some regulations for us to improve our operational level at this point, but we have to wait for that. The government has announced that as of next week we should have some regulations on that, so we're expecting them and we believe that, that will be even - allow us to operate at a much higher level of activity. You're welcome, Alex. Good to talk to you. Well, it depends on how are we doing in terms of our different plants, at this point we expect it to be slightly higher than 70,000 tons, significant contribution from the Peruvian operations. Yes. Go ahead, Carlos. You mean for us? Well, basically we're maintaining our view on the production where we are - the fact that the Peruvian operations are low to operate and we're almost at the full capacity reserve is encouraging because we're meeting production at the Mexican facilities at certain point. But we believe that we will be able to overcome this matters, as possible, through this quarter.In terms of our production, basically what we have been saying, I'll refresh the forecast. For this year, our - I'm looking at it on page, for this year in our plan as mentioned at the beginning of the year was 993,000 tons \u2013 I am sorry, that was 2019, for this year's 995,000 tons from fixed, for 2021, 986.3000 [ph] tons, 2022, 550,000, 2023, 166,000 million, 2024 1,100,000 [ph] tons for copper.We think that what is happening its affecting both supply and demand for copper. And the net effect on prices is not as hard as you may imagine at the very beginning. At the very beginning, we have reports on the company, the two market intelligence that demand was falling down by about 700,000 tons per year on a market that has 23.5 million tons of copper produced and consume of refined copper, no?But what we're seeing now is that it's not only demand and supply, but it's also decreasing. Let me mention this as an example, we have right now three major mines in Peru that are - two of them are shut down. Their capacity is about 400,000 tons per year of copper in each of the cases. So that's a 100,000 tons of work capacity of supply, the copper production that is up.And another one which is half a capacity of about 450,000 tons operating at 50% of capacity. So you have just in three significant players, about 1 million tons of annual capacity put aside. And that is somehow levelling the demand - to demand drop that we're seeing which is significant as well.As I mentioned before, our client base has not been affected so far. We are hoping that this is going to be the case, we're seeing as a very encouraging sign. The fact that China is moving forward with different smelting facilities, as well as the economic activities by China. We are expecting the other areas where we sold our copper which is Europe and the US to be also moving forward with the open up of their economic activities as a more significant move. That's our expectation. We believe that this should be an event that affects this year, but not necessarily in next month's. We expect to do a catch up plan. We're considering being a catch up plan that will mean for instance shrinking certain equipment for a few months and doing the additional stripping that we require. So at this point, we're not expecting to have an impact due to stripping in our operations. Let me say something else, Carlos, and to all of our audience. We will provide - we think that we're currently in a very unstable environment. We need to have some more clarity and we believe that the next few weeks we will have that and we'll report on a more complete base on our July call, looking at our second quarter results. You're welcome. Thank you very much, Carmen. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper first quarter of 2020. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope you \u2013 I hope to have you back with us when we report the second quarter. Thank you very much. And have a nice day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation Third Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. \n With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the third quarter 2021 as well as answer any questions that you may have.\n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP. \n Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Third Quarter of 2021 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member.\n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during this trying times. \n In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market. We will then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the third quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $2.90 per pound in the third quarter of 2020 to $4.25 per pound, that is a 43.6% increase in price. As of today, we're seeing prices at about $4.40, which tops the year-to-date price of $4.17 per pound and bodes a positive outlook for the company. \n We believe the following factors are influencing the market. We are seeing a strong demand that were -- in the U.S. and Europe, particularly in terms of capital, which is refined copper consumption. China, although affected by real estate travel and power shortages, it's experiencing a reduction in scrap imports, which favors the consumption of refined copper.\n The uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, it's another factor, because these 2 countries represent together 40% of the world supply. The combined inventories of the London Metal Exchange, COMEX, Shanghai and [ bond ] warehouses remain at relatively low levels. Combined some of these inventories fell from 907,000 tons in June of this year down to 569,000 tons at the end of September. This is a 37% reduction.\n Fourth factor. It's the expectation of those agencies that do market intelligence in the copper market. They are expecting a market deficit at about 200,000 tons this year due to a recovery in demand, which is estimated to grow at about 5% this year, driven by the economic recovery, as I mentioned, mainly in the developed economies.\n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2021. For copper, it represented 78.7% of our sales in the third quarter of this year. Copper production registered a slight decrease of 0.6% compared to the third quarter of 2020, to stand this year or this past quarter at 245,146 tons. This was mainly attributable to a drop in production at our La Caridad and Toquepala mines due to lower ore grades and recoveries. This effect was offset by higher production at our Cuajone mine due to an improvement in ore grades. \n On a year-on-year basis, copper production decreased 2.8% and totaled 720,658 tons. This result was driven by a drop in ore grades due to stripping and maintenance work that was rescheduled from last year to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, copper production increased by 3.4%, which was mainly attributable to an increase in production at the Buenavista and Cuajone mine. In both cases, due to an improvement of ore grade -- in ore grades. It was partially offset by a decrease in production at the La Caridad mine, where grades and concentrator recovery dropped. \n For this year, we expect to produce 958,000 tons of copper. As you know, production is being affected by a slight ore grade and recovery production -- of bulk of production at the Peruvian operations.\n In 2023, we expect our copper production to bounce back over 1 million tons of production as we get our Peruvian operations back on track and generate new production through our Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista zinc concentrator project. \n Molybdenum production represented 11% of the company's sales in value, sales value in the first quarter of 2021 and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $18.43 per pound in the quarter compared to $7.57 in the third quarter of 2020. This represents a significant increase of 143.5%. \n Molybdenum production increased in the third quarter of this year by 5.4%. This was mainly driven by a growth in production at both the Toquepala and Buenavista mines due to higher ore grades. These results were partially offset by lower production at La Caridad and Cuajone. Compared this past quarter with the second quarter of this year, molybdenum production increased by 16.1%, which was mainly attributable to growth in production at our Toquepala and Buenavista mines, driven by an improvement in ore grades in both cases. For 2021, we expect to produce 29,400 tons of molybdenum, which represents a decrease of 3.2% over our 2020 production level. \n Silver represented 3.9% of our sales value in the third quarter of 2020, with an average price of $24.28 per ounce in the quarter. This represented a slight decrease of 1.3% with regard to the production of the third quarter of 2020. Silver is currently our second by-product. \n Mined silver production fell 8.8% year-on-year in the third quarter after production fell at Buenavista, Toquepala and IMMSA. This was partially offset by an increase in production at the Cuajone mine. Refined silver production increased 11.9% in the third quarter of this year, mainly due to an increase in production at all of our refineries. \n Comparing the third quarter of 2021 with the prior one, the second quarter, mined silver production increased by 4.4%, which was primarily attributable to a higher production at IMMSA and Cuajone. Refined silver production slightly increased by 1.4% in the third quarter versus the second quarter of this year. In 2021, we expect to produce 19.3 million ounces of silver. \n For zinc, it represented 3.7% of our sales value in the third quarter with an average price of $1.36 per pound in the quarter, a 28.3% increase from the same period of 2020. Zinc mine production slightly decreased 1.8% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 16,894 tons. This was primarily driven by lower production at our Santa Barbara and Charcas mines, which was partially offset by an increase in production at the San Martin operation. Refined zinc production increased by 29.2% in the third quarter of this year compared to the same period of 2020. \n Looking at -- or comparing the third quarter of this year with the second one, mined zinc production decreased by 1.3% in the third quarter, mainly due to a drop in production at our San Martin mine, which was partially offset by an increase in introduction at the Santa Barbara operation. Refined zinc production increased by 23.9% in the third quarter compared to the second one of this year. For this year, 2021, we expect to produce 67,500 tons of zinc, that's a 2% decrease in production when compared to last year. \n Financial results. For the third quarter of 2021, sales were $2.7 billion. This is $551.8 million higher than sales for the third quarter of last year or 25.9% increase. Of the total amount of this increase, copper sales represented $360 million -- $360.5 million. This is an increase of 20.6% in the value of copper sales driven by an improvement in prices, which increased by 43.6%, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume of 14.3%, mainly due to lower third parties copper purchases and higher copper concentrate inventories. \n As you know, our production declined 0.6%. That's lesser than 1%, but our sales have declined a little bit more due to the reduction that we have made in the purchases of third parties copper concentrates.  Regarding our main by-products, we registered higher sales of molybdenum, which increased by 145.8% due to better prices and higher volumes. For zinc, they increased by 58.7% due to better prices and volumes. And in contrast, we post lower sales of silver that decreased by 21.6%, which was attributable to lower prices and volume.\n Our total operating cost and expenses decreased by $12 million or 1% when compared to the third quarter of 2020. The main cost reductions have been in purchased copper. We reduced our purchases of third parties materials by $82.5 million, exchange rate variances, workers' participation and leachable material consumption and cost. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher costs for diesel and fuel operating materials, energy, labor, and repair and operating contractors.\n Our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of this year was $1,709.3 million, which represented an increase of 51.8% with regard to the $1,125.9 million, registered in the third quarter of 2020. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 63.8% versus 52.9% in the third quarter of 2020.  Adjusted EBITDA in the 9 months of this year was $5,126.2 million. This is a 96% higher than the one for the same period of 2020, for the 9 months. The adjusted EBITDA margin year-to-date was 63.2% versus 46.4% in the 9 months of 2020. \n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.62 per pound in the third quarter of 2021. That is $0.01 higher than the value for the second quarter of 2021. This 0.6% increase in operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost, administrative expenses and lower premiums. These higher costs were partially compensated by lower treatment and refining charges.\n Regarding by-products, we registered a total credit of $543.4 million, or $1.04 per pound in the third quarter of this year. These figures represent a 1.3% increase when compared with the credit of $521.2 million or $1.26 per pound in the second quarter of 2021. Total credits increased for molybdenum, zinc and sulfuric acid and decreased for silver.\n Consequently, Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credit, was $0.581 per pound in the third quarter of 2021. This cash cost was $0.04 lower than the cash cost of $0.585 that we had in the second quarter of 2021. \n Net income in the third quarter of 2021 was $867.6 million, which represented a 71.5% increase with regard to the $506 million registered in the third quarter of 2020. The net income margin in the third quarter was 32.4% versus 23.8% in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-on-year basis, net income was 161.6% higher than what we had in 2020. This significant improvements were attributable to higher sales and our strict cost control measures. \n For capital investments, as you know, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices, but of the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. In the third quarter of this year, we spent $243.1 million in capital investments, which reflected an 80.7% increase with regard to the year 2020 and represented 28% of our net income for this quarter. As of September 30 of this year, we had spent $695.5 million on capital investments, which represented 27.1% of net income. \n Looking at the projects that we are developing, let me start by commenting on the Tia Maria project in the Arequipa region in Peru. As you know, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of Islay province. As part of these effort, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.\n On January 7, 2021, the mayor of Islay province of Arequipa awarded a City Diploma to Southern Copper in recognition of the company's efforts to assist the population of Islay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Southern Copper provided medical beds and assistance, tests, oxygen, personal protection equipment and food stuffs for the population in the area of influence of the Tia Maria project.\n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and  the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria's construction. \n When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs to another 4,200 persons. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes. \n We expect the Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently, take the necessary steps and actions to provide SCC with an adequate support to initiate construction. \n We have news on the Michiquillay project as well. On September 3 of this year, the company signed a social agreement with the Michiquillay Community. Additionally, on October 1, the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines approved a semi-detailed environmental impact study for the project. The social agreement with the Michiquillay Community represents an opportunity to improve the quality of life of the residence of Michiquillay via our strong social programs and backed by a solid framework for technical work at the project level. Talks for signing a similar agreement are being conducted with the La Enca\u00f1ada Community. That's the other community that we have related to the Michiquillay project, and we expect to have positive results shortly. These events are important steps that we allow Southern Copper to initiate an in-depth exploration program in the first quarter of 2020. \n For our Mexican projects, we have the Buenavista zinc concentrator, which is part of the Buenavista operation. This is a project that is located, as I say, within the Buenavista facility, and includes the development of a new concentrator, zinc concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the engineering study. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to COVID-19 has been put in place. Procurement has progressed 93%, and all the main equipment is on site. Construction site works are in progress. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. As of September of this year, we have invested $196.8 million in this project. We expect to initiate operations in 2023. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs.\n The Pilares project, also in Sonora, is located 6 kilometers from La Caridad operations. This project consists of an open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks has been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade by combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% ore grade from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, of which we have invested $81.4 million. We expect the project to begin production in the first quarter of 2022. \n The third project that we have in the Sonora state is El Pilar. This is a greenfield project, and it's a low capital intensity one, which is using SX-EW technology. The project is approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 281 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.3%, which is a very good -- a remarkable good ore grade for this kind of technology. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper concentrate -- copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly technology, which is the SX-EW. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. We expect production to begin in 2023 and the mine life is estimated at 13 years. The results from experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study is finished, and the company continues developing project and site environmental activities. \n In the Baja California state, we have El Arco, which is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California Peninsula with ore reserves of over 2.4 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.422%. And as a by-product, we have 0.11 grams of gold per ton. The project includes an open-pit mine combining a concentrator and an SX-EW operation. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permits. Several years back, we began to acquire the rights to all relevant mining concessions in the area. This process was successfully completed in 2010. \n For environmental, social and governance investments. Southern Copper, as you know, is committed to improve its ESG record by adopting the best practices and communicated to the investment community and other stakeholders, our progress in these matters. \n Several programs and initiatives have been launched by the company to help communities face the COVID-19 pandemic in all regions where we operate. In Peru, a partnership was established with the government in July of this year to help vaccinate 40% of the population in the 5 regions where our operations are located. The company donated over $2.5 million to help build, modernize, equip and operate vaccination centers. About 92% of the 850,000 vaccines contemplated in this initiative has been administered by government personnel. To date, 91.4% of Southern Copper Corporation workforce in Peru has been vaccinated against COVID -- Sorry. This is for both Peru and Mexico. 91.4% of Southern Copper workforce has been vaccinated against COVID-19. \n The mining chamber of Mexico recognized La Caridad's mine, refinery and metallurgical plants for top safety performance in their respective categories in 2020. La Caridad mine received a Silver Helmet, or Casco de Plata, in the category for open-pit mining operations with more than 500 employees, whereas the refinery and metallurgical plants received the same distinction in the category for metallurgical plants and smelters with up to 500 employees. \n Southern Copper Corporation reaffirms its commitment to presenting an improving environment by implementing actions to generate a net positive impact on biodiversity throughout our operations. To fulfill this commitment, which is outlining in the company's Environmental Policy, we have developed action plans for biodiversity management that are aligned with the guide for Good Practice Guidance for Mining and Biodiversity published by the International Council on Mining and Metals, the ICMM. These plans further improve the company's capacity to implement effective mitigation measures and contribute to the preservation and improvement of the environment in which we operate. \n Southern Copper Corporation recognized the importance and urgency of tackling climate change. The company's operations -- operational greenhouse gases emissions have decreased significantly over the past 3 years and dropped by 4% in 2020 alone. And this is in spite an increase in production volumes. In 2020, we also began to align our disclosure of efforts to manage climate-related risks and opportunities with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Grupo Mexico Sustainable Development report for 2020 included a section with specific details on our progress in this regard. We're in the process of setting new absolute emission reduction targets to further mitigate our carbon footprint. \n The government of Sonora recognized Southern Copper Corporation for being a culturally responsible company for the voluntary initiatives implemented to promote and safeguard the state's history, culture and traditions. Three of the community programs launched by the company were pinpointed as particularly relevant: The itinerary documentary cinema workshop, which led to the creation of over 200 videos; the support provided for organizing the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Festival Alfonso Ortiz Tirado in Nacozari and Cananea; and the creation of Youth Orchestras. These educational music programs, which are offered by over 2,100 children in the communities surrounding our mining operations in Mexico and Peru, have led to the creation of 6 orchestras and 4 choirs.\n Switching gears to dividends. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expect cash flow generation from variations, capital investment plans and other financial needs in each core meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on October 1, the company Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock payable on November 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 10 of this year.\n Well, with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. I have a question from Jens Spiess with Morgan Stanley. \nJens Spiess: Yes. I just wanted to ask if you could repeat the guidance for molybdenum in 2021 and silver? And also if you could give a bit more color on the cash cost that you're expecting before by-products, especially for next year and beyond? And also, if you could just remember us which projects are already fully Board approved? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you very much for your question, Jens. Okay. For cash cost, next year, we will have -- we're expecting a slightly lower production than this year. The reason for that is that we are seeing -- we're getting into some patches of the Peruvian operations where ore grades are lower. This is a consequence also of the work that we have been doing to catch up with certain activities that we postponed in 2020 due to the COVID-19. So we will reduce slightly our production for next year. We're still looking into the figure to see and we would like to report on this for the next quarter when we review the full year 2021 and give us our view on 2022. \n Considering that, we are expecting to have a cash cost before by-product credits in the range of $1.70 per pound. By-products will be -- well, as you know, you have to consider by-product prices, and that's sometimes a difficult task because they may vary significantly. But using relatively conservative prices and what I mean by this is, for instance, molybdenum instead of $19 per pound, $16 per pound, zinc instead of $150, $120 and so on. We have expecting credits in the range of slightly under $0.80 per pound for next year.\n And the guidance -- you want the guidance for molybdenum for 2021? \nJens Spiess: Molybdenum and silver. \nRaul Jacob: Yes, yes, yes. For this year, it's 29.4 metric tons. For next year, it goes a little bit lower, 24.9. And for silver, this year is 19.3 million ounces. Next year, it increases a little bit, 19.8. And then in 2023, when we expect to have our production back on track, we will have the benefit of Pilares, the Buenavista zinc production and copper production of Buenavista and El Pilar. With that, we will bounce back to 1 million tons per -- of production. And we will increase quite significantly our production for zinc. We will pass from a mark, which is about 70,000 tons nowadays, up to 149,000 tons. That's for 2023 for zinc. So we're more than doubling our production of zinc in 2023. That's our current forecast. And with that, obviously, our cash cost will decrease due to the much higher contribution of by-product -- zinc as a by-product. \n Board approved -- projects that are fully Board approved.  Well, we're working on the 3 projects that I mentioned for Mexico that are underway right now, which are in Pilares, El Pilar and the Buenavista zinc. In Peru, we have Tia Maria, fully approved. There is not -- it's not -- we're -- we'll keep doing some efforts in order to move on with the construction, but that's fully approved. And we have El Arco, where we are working to have a full view on the project. And once we have that, we will present that to the Board. The same is the case for Michiquillay.\n Once we finish the -- In the case of Michiquillay, which is actively -- it will come back -- coming later on in time. We will have -- we are about to initiate a drilling campaign in 2022 and '23. And with the results of this campaign, we will propose to the Board of the company, the approval of an investment for -- we're expecting for an operation that may produce 225,000 tons of copper per year. \nJens Spiess: Okay. And when do you expect to bring that to the port Michiquillay position? \nRaul Jacob: Well, it will be at least 3 more years because it's -- you have to do the drilling campaign, then you have to do the environmental impact -- excuse me, the feasibility study and then we'll present the results of that to the board, asking for permission on that. It should be at least by 2024, where we will know the size of the project that we want to do and have all the work related to knowing exactly what we want to build. The very important thing that I'd like to mention on Michiquillay is that this is a very good prospect in terms of ore grade, quality of the mineral, for instance, it's a mineral that has no traces of arsenic in it in -- well, not significant traces, obviously. And so it's a very interesting project for us. It's projects that correspond to a prior generation. It was not developed by the company that has had it before, and we won the action -- the auction that the Peruvian government did in 2018, and that's how we have this project as part of our pipeline of future developments. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Just 2 quick questions from me. One is on costs. Obviously, we saw some cost inflation there in Q3 for you guys. Congratulations, I think, higher by-product revenues. Can you just kind of talk about what do you think costs are going to look like disregarding the by-product revenues over the next 12 months? Obviously, you don't know for sure where the by-product revenues are going to go. So just kind of operationally, where do you see cost or unit cost going over the next 12 months? And why? \n And maybe as a second question, are you seeing anything in China, just given all the energy issues and there's been some talk about shutdown of smelters and this kind of thing. I mean any latest read-throughs from China as to what's happening there given the concentrate you're sending there? Those are my 2 questions. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much for your questions, Andreas. Let me start by China. We don't see -- for us, we haven't seen any changes in our sales of concentrates to Chinese smelters. We have no concerns so far. We know about what has happened in the -- well, on the power shortages in China. But so far, we haven't had any impact in our concentrate sales to that market.\n Looking at the cost for the next 12 months, well, the obvious cost increases we already -- I already mentioned them at the at the presentation of the call. We're seeing higher fuel costs, power cost in Mexico, a little bit due to the gas crisis that we had at the beginning of this year, but nothing relevant forward-looking other than having some concerns on fuel basically.\n The other thing is -- for the Mexican operations is the exchange rate appreciation, the Mexican peso vis-a-vis where it was a year ago, is now stronger, We're at about MXN 20 per dollar, and we used to be at the MXN 23 or so. So that has created some dollar inflation in our cost of Mexico. In Peru, we have a depreciation of the Peruvian currency vis-a-vis the dollar of about 15%. That has helped us our dollars cost. \n And in both Mexico and Peru, we have seen work -- we have to do a catch-up work for certain maintenance. We had to do a catch-up work for certain maintenance and stripping works that we couldn't tackle in 2020, and we passed them to 2021. So the fact that we are finishing this works will make us to be in better shape in 2022, where we will only have to work at our program for that year specifically.\n So that will be -- that plus the exchange depreciation in Peru will be some cost control points, issues. While we have higher fuel cost and some cost inflation, obviously, in steel and some other materials, but so far, if you see our cost, generally speaking, we have managed to control them by replacing in this year third parties concentrate by our own. As you may imagine, when we buy third parties material, we pay a market price less discounts. While when we produce and process our own copper that has only the cost that we have to incur in order to produce that metal. So that has helped us this year, and we are expecting next year to have a slightly higher cost before by-product credits, but somehow it will be tempered by a reduction in stripping and some other maintenance work that we're -- that had to -- we have to catch up on them in 2021. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Got it. That's very clear. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alfonso Salazar with Scotiabank. \nAlfonso Salazar: A couple of questions from me. The first one is regarding production. You mentioned that for the year, you are projecting copper production of 958,000 tons. I think this is on production, on mine production, but correct me if I'm wrong. And then for next year, you didn't provide a guidance at this point on the level of production, but you mentioned that it's going to be lower than in '21. And then you're going back to 1 million tons in 2023. Just want to clarify if this is correct. \nRaul Jacob: That's correct, Alfonso. Our guidance is, as you have mentioned, 958,000 tons. For next year, it's -- we're expecting a reduction. Right now, we're looking at the number in the range of 950,000 tons, but still to be confirmed. So I think that we need to -- we need to wait for a final forecast on this, which we will provide on the next quarter's call. \nAlfonso Salazar: Okay. And the second question I have... \nRaul Jacob: The 1 million ton for 2023 is correct. That's what I said. \nAlfonso Salazar: Okay. Excellent. The second question I have is regarding the labor reform. If you anticipate -- other miners have flagged this as a risk for costs, but I don't know if that is your case or not. And the second is that you mentioned that you are seeing the inflationary pressure in case of fuel and a little bit in the power cost because of the price of gas, but nothing forward-looking. This is provided that there is no change in the electric law that applies in Mexico, if I'm not mistaken or if that's your base case because you have right now contracts with MGE with [indiscernible] and Fenicias in Mexico. But based on that, the fact that this could change, then you might change that, that -- is this correct? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Let me comment on the power reform first. We need to see what finally is approved -- the power reform in Mexico. We need to see what is finally approved. And on that base, we will evaluate the consequence for Southern Copper. Obviously, we have some concerns as has been expressed in different firms by other economic agents as well. Regarding cost inflation, well, we talk about a little bit on fuel. Let me give you some news on this. We have -- we are -- we have acquired price protection for gas for these next few months. We'll go into the hardest part of the winter, where we are -- we have required some price protection for that part of the season. And we believe -- well, currently, the gas price is higher than our facility. So we're okay with that. \n In power -- in labor, we are also addressing the impact of labor cost -- of the new labor costs or new labor legislation in Mexico. At the same time, we are pretty much finishing negotiations with our labor force in Peru, and we have signed contracts that range from 4 years to 6 years with the different unions, the 6 unions that we have down there. So we have -- we will believe that our labor costs will be under control in the next few years for the Peruvian operations. In Mexico, we have to fully review what's the impact of the labor reform that it's -- the impact that it may have on our cost. \nUnknown Executive: Raul, if I may [indiscernible]... \nRaul Jacob: Sure. Go ahead. [indiscernible] go ahead. \nUnknown Executive: Just to comment -- we will comment on the -- if you have any concerns on the energy reform [indiscernible] call at 11 a.m. local time. But just to give you [indiscernible]... \nRaul Jacob: [indiscernible] come a little bit forward because we -- come a little bit forward, we can't listen to you well. \nUnknown Executive: So in Mexico, we now have currently the combined cycle [indiscernible] in Mexico that are part of Grupo Mexico. So that means that the electric power [indiscernible] in the combined cycle is considered to be authentic for supply since it is exclusively supplied with a [indiscernible] company with the same pace of control. So the current government has been very impacted in [indiscernible], the two unrelated parties agreed on [indiscernible], but not outside [indiscernible]. We will comment further on that, but just to give you that sense in the same case for the other in one part. Just to comment on that, sorry. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Hacking with Citi. \nAlexander Hacking: Just following up on Michiquillay. You mentioned you have an agreement with the Michiquillay Community and discussions with La Enca\u00f1ada Community. Are those -- are those the only 2 communities that you're dealing with? Or are there others? And then... \nRaul Jacob: No, those are -- go ahead, go ahead, please. Sorry. \nAlexander Hacking: No, you go ahead, please. \nRaul Jacob: Well, yes, the 2 -- the area of influence of the project has these 2 communities. Michiquillay, we already mentioned the agreement that we have signed with them very successfully, and we're all very happy on that. And the other one La Enca\u00f1ada. We are working with them, and we expect to have an agreement shortly. \nAlexander Hacking: Okay. And then are there specific critical issues such as water rights or relocating families? Or is it more of a general concern about disrupting their way of life? I guess what are the critical concerns that these communities have? And how do you plan to address them? \nRaul Jacob: I think that the critical issue for them is to have -- to benefit -- to clearly benefit from the project. That's why we're working. We're working with them in several initiatives to improve their development as communities. And well, there should be some relocation of certain number of families. But most of the community lives in the surrounding areas of the project footprint. So we don't need to relocate many, many, many families. But there are some that will need to move to a different place. But if I can summarize their major concern is how can they benefit from the economic impulse that this project will bring in to this area. \nAlexander Hacking: Okay. And then just a very quick follow-up on something else. Shipments lagging production a little bit this year. Is that something -- is that just inventory build? Do you sort of rebuild from last year normal? Or should we expect a little bit of catch-up in the fourth quarter? \nRaul Jacob: Well, we are expecting to have some catch-up. And the reason for this inventory buildup is that we replace third parties concentrates by our own concentrate, and that has to pass through the whole production process. So that's mainly the reason. We're working in order to catch up on sales for the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. \nJohn Tumazos: My question is in terms of capital management priorities. Does the many projects come first? And the projects, of course, are of a high quality of scheduling and sequence issues where you would borrow if you need to, depending on the copper price, et cetera? The reason I'm asking the question yesterday, the World Steel Association described September output, Chinese steel output fell another 10% in December. It's fallen by 25% since April, 15% of world steel output magnitude. It's 90x bigger than the largest blast furnace in North America, [indiscernible]. So it's an epic size. It appears the property sector, whatever they're doing to fight inflation. They're winning that war. They're really killing their economy. So given the variations that might occur in copper demand or prices, should we assume the projects come first? \nRaul Jacob: Well, we -- what we're seeing it's -- my personal belief is that the Chinese authorities have the right instruments to deal with the circumstances that they are facing now, generally speaking. But looking into your concern, John, and thank you very much for your question. I think that what we are doing is focusing in developing these very good projects that we have. They are, generally speaking, much lower in capital intensity per ton of copper capacity installed than the average worldwide. Also, when they be in operation, their cash costs will be well aligned with our current cash cost. So we think that these are projects that will be required to go on in the next few years. \n You mentioned some of the troubles that the Chinese economy is facing. We also see on the flip side for this what were -- the Green Energy's revolution and their impact on copper demand -- long-term copper demand that it's basically increasing or moving upward the estimates for copper consumption for the next decade. \n So I think that hopefully, the Chinese will be able to deal with their current matters, their current problems. And this new green energy revolution that will require significant amounts of copper and some other basic metals will give support to our operations and to the copper market price, particularly. \nJohn Tumazos: So to summarize your reply, not concerning copper demand, but your capital management. Your projects are high quality, they come first, yes. And if necessary, you would borrow to complete them. \nRaul Jacob: Usually, we are taking some debt when we are tackling new projects. You have seen that we issued in 2019 $1 billion bond in order to fund the 3 projects that we are currently developing in Mexico. And we did that as well with the Buenavista expansion. So once we have some certainty of future increase in, say, EBITDA, we usually consider going to the debt markets to assure a healthy share of debt in our balance sheet for this new undertaking. \n So in this case, for instance, if we move on with some new project of the ones that we have been talking about, we'll probably consider and that's always up to the Board, but we'll propose as management to look into the debt market. And if conditions are fine, we may consider going on for new debt. \nJohn Tumazos: May I ask a different question? \nRaul Jacob: Go ahead, please. \nJohn Tumazos: I meticulously read the World Bureau of Metal Statistics copper data, and I ignore all the popular consultants. In 2019, '20 and '21, rest of world copper demand, ex China, is lower than 2009 recession. So that confuses me about copper demand growth because it appears to be decay. Chinese demand since 2014, only had 1 good year, last year, which may have been stockpiled building. Maybe the compound growth rate is 2%, except for last year's gain in this year's decline.\n So I believe that all these new applications exist. I don't believe they're fantasies, they're real. But I interpret that there's a 4% decay rate in the base level of mature demand due to wireless controls, smartphones complying -- applying, combining 10 or 20 appliances, downsizing my new air conditioner for the outside of my house is 1/3 as big as the one it replaced. Could you talk to why copper demand is not bigger when we have all these applications? And excuse me, I'm cynical, I think that the leading consultants, they tell the CEOs what they want to hear. And I'm just looking at the WBMS data, which I respect. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. What we're seeing is that new technologies are using much more copper, and we're seeing a clear path towards the development of that. And this will -- I mean, well, first, let me mention that we're currently in a much different market than what we say expect before the pandemic. So everything is tainted by these major breakdown that we have had due to the pandemic.  We have to see -- we believe that new uses of copper will replace and surpass lower demand due to substitution or some recession in certain parts of the world. What we're seeing now it's a war economy growing for this year and expecting to grow for next year, and that will certainly propel new corporate demand. \n On China, I mentioned already, my personal view is that they will be able to deal with these as they have done with some other even more problematic matters in the past. But that's my view as an officer of copper-producing company. That's it. \nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Alfonso Salazar with Scotiabank. \nAlfonso Salazar: Just a quick follow-up, a very easy one. Just wondering why Southern Copper is lower in third-party purchases? Is this because there are less concentrates available? Is this a strategic move of the company? So what is behind the decision? \nRaul Jacob: A simple answer to that, Alfonso, is that market conditions change a little bit, and we decided to move on with our own material. As you know, we are long on copper concentrates. We have been selling our own concentrates and buying some other different qualities and copper concentrates. We made a review vis-a-vis the new market conditions that we have had through 2021 and decided to stop buying third parties copper concentrates. No market shortages just to be very straight in answer to what you express as a concern. \nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue, sir. You may continue with any final remarks. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's Third Quarter 2021 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the fourth quarter and the full year 2021 results. Thank you very much, and have a nice day. \nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Third Quarter of 2021 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member.\n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during this trying times. \n In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market. We will then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the third quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $2.90 per pound in the third quarter of 2020 to $4.25 per pound, that is a 43.6% increase in price. As of today, we're seeing prices at about $4.40, which tops the year-to-date price of $4.17 per pound and bodes a positive outlook for the company. \n We believe the following factors are influencing the market. We are seeing a strong demand that were -- in the U.S. and Europe, particularly in terms of capital, which is refined copper consumption. China, although affected by real estate travel and power shortages, it's experiencing a reduction in scrap imports, which favors the consumption of refined copper.\n The uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, it's another factor, because these 2 countries represent together 40% of the world supply. The combined inventories of the London Metal Exchange, COMEX, Shanghai and [ bond ] warehouses remain at relatively low levels. Combined some of these inventories fell from 907,000 tons in June of this year down to 569,000 tons at the end of September. This is a 37% reduction.\n Fourth factor. It's the expectation of those agencies that do market intelligence in the copper market. They are expecting a market deficit at about 200,000 tons this year due to a recovery in demand, which is estimated to grow at about 5% this year, driven by the economic recovery, as I mentioned, mainly in the developed economies.\n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2021. For copper, it represented 78.7% of our sales in the third quarter of this year. Copper production registered a slight decrease of 0.6% compared to the third quarter of 2020, to stand this year or this past quarter at 245,146 tons. This was mainly attributable to a drop in production at our La Caridad and Toquepala mines due to lower ore grades and recoveries. This effect was offset by higher production at our Cuajone mine due to an improvement in ore grades. \n On a year-on-year basis, copper production decreased 2.8% and totaled 720,658 tons. This result was driven by a drop in ore grades due to stripping and maintenance work that was rescheduled from last year to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, copper production increased by 3.4%, which was mainly attributable to an increase in production at the Buenavista and Cuajone mine. In both cases, due to an improvement of ore grade -- in ore grades. It was partially offset by a decrease in production at the La Caridad mine, where grades and concentrator recovery dropped. \n For this year, we expect to produce 958,000 tons of copper. As you know, production is being affected by a slight ore grade and recovery production -- of bulk of production at the Peruvian operations.\n In 2023, we expect our copper production to bounce back over 1 million tons of production as we get our Peruvian operations back on track and generate new production through our Pilares, El Pilar and Buenavista zinc concentrator project. \n Molybdenum production represented 11% of the company's sales in value, sales value in the first quarter of 2021 and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $18.43 per pound in the quarter compared to $7.57 in the third quarter of 2020. This represents a significant increase of 143.5%. \n Molybdenum production increased in the third quarter of this year by 5.4%. This was mainly driven by a growth in production at both the Toquepala and Buenavista mines due to higher ore grades. These results were partially offset by lower production at La Caridad and Cuajone. Compared this past quarter with the second quarter of this year, molybdenum production increased by 16.1%, which was mainly attributable to growth in production at our Toquepala and Buenavista mines, driven by an improvement in ore grades in both cases. For 2021, we expect to produce 29,400 tons of molybdenum, which represents a decrease of 3.2% over our 2020 production level. \n Silver represented 3.9% of our sales value in the third quarter of 2020, with an average price of $24.28 per ounce in the quarter. This represented a slight decrease of 1.3% with regard to the production of the third quarter of 2020. Silver is currently our second by-product. \n Mined silver production fell 8.8% year-on-year in the third quarter after production fell at Buenavista, Toquepala and IMMSA. This was partially offset by an increase in production at the Cuajone mine. Refined silver production increased 11.9% in the third quarter of this year, mainly due to an increase in production at all of our refineries. \n Comparing the third quarter of 2021 with the prior one, the second quarter, mined silver production increased by 4.4%, which was primarily attributable to a higher production at IMMSA and Cuajone. Refined silver production slightly increased by 1.4% in the third quarter versus the second quarter of this year. In 2021, we expect to produce 19.3 million ounces of silver. \n For zinc, it represented 3.7% of our sales value in the third quarter with an average price of $1.36 per pound in the quarter, a 28.3% increase from the same period of 2020. Zinc mine production slightly decreased 1.8% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 16,894 tons. This was primarily driven by lower production at our Santa Barbara and Charcas mines, which was partially offset by an increase in production at the San Martin operation. Refined zinc production increased by 29.2% in the third quarter of this year compared to the same period of 2020. \n Looking at -- or comparing the third quarter of this year with the second one, mined zinc production decreased by 1.3% in the third quarter, mainly due to a drop in production at our San Martin mine, which was partially offset by an increase in introduction at the Santa Barbara operation. Refined zinc production increased by 23.9% in the third quarter compared to the second one of this year. For this year, 2021, we expect to produce 67,500 tons of zinc, that's a 2% decrease in production when compared to last year. \n Financial results. For the third quarter of 2021, sales were $2.7 billion. This is $551.8 million higher than sales for the third quarter of last year or 25.9% increase. Of the total amount of this increase, copper sales represented $360 million -- $360.5 million. This is an increase of 20.6% in the value of copper sales driven by an improvement in prices, which increased by 43.6%, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume of 14.3%, mainly due to lower third parties copper purchases and higher copper concentrate inventories. \n As you know, our production declined 0.6%. That's lesser than 1%, but our sales have declined a little bit more due to the reduction that we have made in the purchases of third parties copper concentrates.  Regarding our main by-products, we registered higher sales of molybdenum, which increased by 145.8% due to better prices and higher volumes. For zinc, they increased by 58.7% due to better prices and volumes. And in contrast, we post lower sales of silver that decreased by 21.6%, which was attributable to lower prices and volume.\n Our total operating cost and expenses decreased by $12 million or 1% when compared to the third quarter of 2020. The main cost reductions have been in purchased copper. We reduced our purchases of third parties materials by $82.5 million, exchange rate variances, workers' participation and leachable material consumption and cost. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher costs for diesel and fuel operating materials, energy, labor, and repair and operating contractors.\n Our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of this year was $1,709.3 million, which represented an increase of 51.8% with regard to the $1,125.9 million, registered in the third quarter of 2020. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 63.8% versus 52.9% in the third quarter of 2020.  Adjusted EBITDA in the 9 months of this year was $5,126.2 million. This is a 96% higher than the one for the same period of 2020, for the 9 months. The adjusted EBITDA margin year-to-date was 63.2% versus 46.4% in the 9 months of 2020. \n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.62 per pound in the third quarter of 2021. That is $0.01 higher than the value for the second quarter of 2021. This 0.6% increase in operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost, administrative expenses and lower premiums. These higher costs were partially compensated by lower treatment and refining charges.\n Regarding by-products, we registered a total credit of $543.4 million, or $1.04 per pound in the third quarter of this year. These figures represent a 1.3% increase when compared with the credit of $521.2 million or $1.26 per pound in the second quarter of 2021. Total credits increased for molybdenum, zinc and sulfuric acid and decreased for silver.\n Consequently, Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credit, was $0.581 per pound in the third quarter of 2021. This cash cost was $0.04 lower than the cash cost of $0.585 that we had in the second quarter of 2021. \n Net income in the third quarter of 2021 was $867.6 million, which represented a 71.5% increase with regard to the $506 million registered in the third quarter of 2020. The net income margin in the third quarter was 32.4% versus 23.8% in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-on-year basis, net income was 161.6% higher than what we had in 2020. This significant improvements were attributable to higher sales and our strict cost control measures. \n For capital investments, as you know, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices, but of the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. In the third quarter of this year, we spent $243.1 million in capital investments, which reflected an 80.7% increase with regard to the year 2020 and represented 28% of our net income for this quarter. As of September 30 of this year, we had spent $695.5 million on capital investments, which represented 27.1% of net income. \n Looking at the projects that we are developing, let me start by commenting on the Tia Maria project in the Arequipa region in Peru. As you know, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of Islay province. As part of these effort, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.\n On January 7, 2021, the mayor of Islay province of Arequipa awarded a City Diploma to Southern Copper in recognition of the company's efforts to assist the population of Islay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Southern Copper provided medical beds and assistance, tests, oxygen, personal protection equipment and food stuffs for the population in the area of influence of the Tia Maria project.\n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and  the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria's construction. \n When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs to another 4,200 persons. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes. \n We expect the Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently, take the necessary steps and actions to provide SCC with an adequate support to initiate construction. \n We have news on the Michiquillay project as well. On September 3 of this year, the company signed a social agreement with the Michiquillay Community. Additionally, on October 1, the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines approved a semi-detailed environmental impact study for the project. The social agreement with the Michiquillay Community represents an opportunity to improve the quality of life of the residence of Michiquillay via our strong social programs and backed by a solid framework for technical work at the project level. Talks for signing a similar agreement are being conducted with the La Encan\u0303ada Community. That's the other community that we have related to the Michiquillay project, and we expect to have positive results shortly. These events are important steps that we allow Southern Copper to initiate an in-depth exploration program in the first quarter of 2020. \n For our Mexican projects, we have the Buenavista zinc concentrator, which is part of the Buenavista operation. This is a project that is located, as I say, within the Buenavista facility, and includes the development of a new concentrator, zinc concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the engineering study. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to COVID-19 has been put in place. Procurement has progressed 93%, and all the main equipment is on site. Construction site works are in progress. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. As of September of this year, we have invested $196.8 million in this project. We expect to initiate operations in 2023. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs.\n The Pilares project, also in Sonora, is located 6 kilometers from La Caridad operations. This project consists of an open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks has been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade by combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% ore grade from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, of which we have invested $81.4 million. We expect the project to begin production in the first quarter of 2022. \n The third project that we have in the Sonora state is El Pilar. This is a greenfield project, and it's a low capital intensity one, which is using SX-EW technology. The project is approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 281 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.3%, which is a very good -- a remarkable good ore grade for this kind of technology. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper concentrate -- copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly technology, which is the SX-EW. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. We expect production to begin in 2023 and the mine life is estimated at 13 years. The results from experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study is finished, and the company continues developing project and site environmental activities. \n In the Baja California state, we have El Arco, which is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California Peninsula with ore reserves of over 2.4 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.422%. And as a by-product, we have 0.11 grams of gold per ton. The project includes an open-pit mine combining a concentrator and an SX-EW operation. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permits. Several years back, we began to acquire the rights to all relevant mining concessions in the area. This process was successfully completed in 2010. \n For environmental, social and governance investments. Southern Copper, as you know, is committed to improve its ESG record by adopting the best practices and communicated to the investment community and other stakeholders, our progress in these matters. \n Several programs and initiatives have been launched by the company to help communities face the COVID-19 pandemic in all regions where we operate. In Peru, a partnership was established with the government in July of this year to help vaccinate 40% of the population in the 5 regions where our operations are located. The company donated over $2.5 million to help build, modernize, equip and operate vaccination centers. About 92% of the 850,000 vaccines contemplated in this initiative has been administered by government personnel. To date, 91.4% of Southern Copper Corporation workforce in Peru has been vaccinated against COVID -- Sorry. This is for both Peru and Mexico. 91.4% of Southern Copper workforce has been vaccinated against COVID-19. \n The mining chamber of Mexico recognized La Caridad's mine, refinery and metallurgical plants for top safety performance in their respective categories in 2020. La Caridad mine received a Silver Helmet, or Casco de Plata, in the category for open-pit mining operations with more than 500 employees, whereas the refinery and metallurgical plants received the same distinction in the category for metallurgical plants and smelters with up to 500 employees. \n Southern Copper Corporation reaffirms its commitment to presenting an improving environment by implementing actions to generate a net positive impact on biodiversity throughout our operations. To fulfill this commitment, which is outlining in the company's Environmental Policy, we have developed action plans for biodiversity management that are aligned with the guide for Good Practice Guidance for Mining and Biodiversity published by the International Council on Mining and Metals, the ICMM. These plans further improve the company's capacity to implement effective mitigation measures and contribute to the preservation and improvement of the environment in which we operate. \n Southern Copper Corporation recognized the importance and urgency of tackling climate change. The company's operations -- operational greenhouse gases emissions have decreased significantly over the past 3 years and dropped by 4% in 2020 alone. And this is in spite an increase in production volumes. In 2020, we also began to align our disclosure of efforts to manage climate-related risks and opportunities with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Grupo Mexico Sustainable Development report for 2020 included a section with specific details on our progress in this regard. We're in the process of setting new absolute emission reduction targets to further mitigate our carbon footprint. \n The government of Sonora recognized Southern Copper Corporation for being a culturally responsible company for the voluntary initiatives implemented to promote and safeguard the state's history, culture and traditions. Three of the community programs launched by the company were pinpointed as particularly relevant: The itinerary documentary cinema workshop, which led to the creation of over 200 videos; the support provided for organizing the \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Festival Alfonso Ortiz Tirado in Nacozari and Cananea; and the creation of Youth Orchestras. These educational music programs, which are offered by over 2,100 children in the communities surrounding our mining operations in Mexico and Peru, have led to the creation of 6 orchestras and 4 choirs.\n Switching gears to dividends. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expect cash flow generation from variations, capital investment plans and other financial needs in each core meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on October 1, the company Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock payable on November 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 10 of this year.\n Well, with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. Okay. Thank you very much for your question, Jens. Okay. For cash cost, next year, we will have -- we're expecting a slightly lower production than this year. The reason for that is that we are seeing -- we're getting into some patches of the Peruvian operations where ore grades are lower. This is a consequence also of the work that we have been doing to catch up with certain activities that we postponed in 2020 due to the COVID-19. So we will reduce slightly our production for next year. We're still looking into the figure to see and we would like to report on this for the next quarter when we review the full year 2021 and give us our view on 2022. \n Considering that, we are expecting to have a cash cost before by-product credits in the range of $1.70 per pound. By-products will be -- well, as you know, you have to consider by-product prices, and that's sometimes a difficult task because they may vary significantly. But using relatively conservative prices and what I mean by this is, for instance, molybdenum instead of $19 per pound, $16 per pound, zinc instead of $150, $120 and so on. We have expecting credits in the range of slightly under $0.80 per pound for next year.\n And the guidance -- you want the guidance for molybdenum for 2021? Yes, yes, yes. For this year, it's 29.4 metric tons. For next year, it goes a little bit lower, 24.9. And for silver, this year is 19.3 million ounces. Next year, it increases a little bit, 19.8. And then in 2023, when we expect to have our production back on track, we will have the benefit of Pilares, the Buenavista zinc production and copper production of Buenavista and El Pilar. With that, we will bounce back to 1 million tons per -- of production. And we will increase quite significantly our production for zinc. We will pass from a mark, which is about 70,000 tons nowadays, up to 149,000 tons. That's for 2023 for zinc. So we're more than doubling our production of zinc in 2023. That's our current forecast. And with that, obviously, our cash cost will decrease due to the much higher contribution of by-product -- zinc as a by-product. \n Board approved -- projects that are fully Board approved.  Well, we're working on the 3 projects that I mentioned for Mexico that are underway right now, which are in Pilares, El Pilar and the Buenavista zinc. In Peru, we have Tia Maria, fully approved. There is not -- it's not -- we're -- we'll keep doing some efforts in order to move on with the construction, but that's fully approved. And we have El Arco, where we are working to have a full view on the project. And once we have that, we will present that to the Board. The same is the case for Michiquillay.\n Once we finish the -- In the case of Michiquillay, which is actively -- it will come back -- coming later on in time. We will have -- we are about to initiate a drilling campaign in 2022 and '23. And with the results of this campaign, we will propose to the Board of the company, the approval of an investment for -- we're expecting for an operation that may produce 225,000 tons of copper per year. Well, it will be at least 3 more years because it's -- you have to do the drilling campaign, then you have to do the environmental impact -- excuse me, the feasibility study and then we'll present the results of that to the board, asking for permission on that. It should be at least by 2024, where we will know the size of the project that we want to do and have all the work related to knowing exactly what we want to build. The very important thing that I'd like to mention on Michiquillay is that this is a very good prospect in terms of ore grade, quality of the mineral, for instance, it's a mineral that has no traces of arsenic in it in -- well, not significant traces, obviously. And so it's a very interesting project for us. It's projects that correspond to a prior generation. It was not developed by the company that has had it before, and we won the action -- the auction that the Peruvian government did in 2018, and that's how we have this project as part of our pipeline of future developments. Thank you very much for your questions, Andreas. Let me start by China. We don't see -- for us, we haven't seen any changes in our sales of concentrates to Chinese smelters. We have no concerns so far. We know about what has happened in the -- well, on the power shortages in China. But so far, we haven't had any impact in our concentrate sales to that market.\n Looking at the cost for the next 12 months, well, the obvious cost increases we already -- I already mentioned them at the at the presentation of the call. We're seeing higher fuel costs, power cost in Mexico, a little bit due to the gas crisis that we had at the beginning of this year, but nothing relevant forward-looking other than having some concerns on fuel basically.\n The other thing is -- for the Mexican operations is the exchange rate appreciation, the Mexican peso vis-a-vis where it was a year ago, is now stronger, We're at about MXN 20 per dollar, and we used to be at the MXN 23 or so. So that has created some dollar inflation in our cost of Mexico. In Peru, we have a depreciation of the Peruvian currency vis-a-vis the dollar of about 15%. That has helped us our dollars cost. \n And in both Mexico and Peru, we have seen work -- we have to do a catch-up work for certain maintenance. We had to do a catch-up work for certain maintenance and stripping works that we couldn't tackle in 2020, and we passed them to 2021. So the fact that we are finishing this works will make us to be in better shape in 2022, where we will only have to work at our program for that year specifically.\n So that will be -- that plus the exchange depreciation in Peru will be some cost control points, issues. While we have higher fuel cost and some cost inflation, obviously, in steel and some other materials, but so far, if you see our cost, generally speaking, we have managed to control them by replacing in this year third parties concentrate by our own. As you may imagine, when we buy third parties material, we pay a market price less discounts. While when we produce and process our own copper that has only the cost that we have to incur in order to produce that metal. So that has helped us this year, and we are expecting next year to have a slightly higher cost before by-product credits, but somehow it will be tempered by a reduction in stripping and some other maintenance work that we're -- that had to -- we have to catch up on them in 2021. That's correct, Alfonso. Our guidance is, as you have mentioned, 958,000 tons. For next year, it's -- we're expecting a reduction. Right now, we're looking at the number in the range of 950,000 tons, but still to be confirmed. So I think that we need to -- we need to wait for a final forecast on this, which we will provide on the next quarter's call. The 1 million ton for 2023 is correct. That's what I said. Okay. Let me comment on the power reform first. We need to see what finally is approved -- the power reform in Mexico. We need to see what is finally approved. And on that base, we will evaluate the consequence for Southern Copper. Obviously, we have some concerns as has been expressed in different firms by other economic agents as well. Regarding cost inflation, well, we talk about a little bit on fuel. Let me give you some news on this. We have -- we are -- we have acquired price protection for gas for these next few months. We'll go into the hardest part of the winter, where we are -- we have required some price protection for that part of the season. And we believe -- well, currently, the gas price is higher than our facility. So we're okay with that. \n In power -- in labor, we are also addressing the impact of labor cost -- of the new labor costs or new labor legislation in Mexico. At the same time, we are pretty much finishing negotiations with our labor force in Peru, and we have signed contracts that range from 4 years to 6 years with the different unions, the 6 unions that we have down there. So we have -- we will believe that our labor costs will be under control in the next few years for the Peruvian operations. In Mexico, we have to fully review what's the impact of the labor reform that it's -- the impact that it may have on our cost. Sure. Go ahead. [indiscernible] go ahead. [indiscernible] come a little bit forward because we -- come a little bit forward, we can't listen to you well. No, those are -- go ahead, go ahead, please. Sorry. Well, yes, the 2 -- the area of influence of the project has these 2 communities. Michiquillay, we already mentioned the agreement that we have signed with them very successfully, and we're all very happy on that. And the other one La Encan\u0303ada. We are working with them, and we expect to have an agreement shortly. I think that the critical issue for them is to have -- to benefit -- to clearly benefit from the project. That's why we're working. We're working with them in several initiatives to improve their development as communities. And well, there should be some relocation of certain number of families. But most of the community lives in the surrounding areas of the project footprint. So we don't need to relocate many, many, many families. But there are some that will need to move to a different place. But if I can summarize their major concern is how can they benefit from the economic impulse that this project will bring in to this area. Well, we are expecting to have some catch-up. And the reason for this inventory buildup is that we replace third parties concentrates by our own concentrate, and that has to pass through the whole production process. So that's mainly the reason. We're working in order to catch up on sales for the fourth quarter. Well, we -- what we're seeing it's -- my personal belief is that the Chinese authorities have the right instruments to deal with the circumstances that they are facing now, generally speaking. But looking into your concern, John, and thank you very much for your question. I think that what we are doing is focusing in developing these very good projects that we have. They are, generally speaking, much lower in capital intensity per ton of copper capacity installed than the average worldwide. Also, when they be in operation, their cash costs will be well aligned with our current cash cost. So we think that these are projects that will be required to go on in the next few years. \n You mentioned some of the troubles that the Chinese economy is facing. We also see on the flip side for this what were -- the Green Energy's revolution and their impact on copper demand -- long-term copper demand that it's basically increasing or moving upward the estimates for copper consumption for the next decade. \n So I think that hopefully, the Chinese will be able to deal with their current matters, their current problems. And this new green energy revolution that will require significant amounts of copper and some other basic metals will give support to our operations and to the copper market price, particularly. Usually, we are taking some debt when we are tackling new projects. You have seen that we issued in 2019 $1 billion bond in order to fund the 3 projects that we are currently developing in Mexico. And we did that as well with the Buenavista expansion. So once we have some certainty of future increase in, say, EBITDA, we usually consider going to the debt markets to assure a healthy share of debt in our balance sheet for this new undertaking. \n So in this case, for instance, if we move on with some new project of the ones that we have been talking about, we'll probably consider and that's always up to the Board, but we'll propose as management to look into the debt market. And if conditions are fine, we may consider going on for new debt. Go ahead, please. Okay. What we're seeing is that new technologies are using much more copper, and we're seeing a clear path towards the development of that. And this will -- I mean, well, first, let me mention that we're currently in a much different market than what we say expect before the pandemic. So everything is tainted by these major breakdown that we have had due to the pandemic.  We have to see -- we believe that new uses of copper will replace and surpass lower demand due to substitution or some recession in certain parts of the world. What we're seeing now it's a war economy growing for this year and expecting to grow for next year, and that will certainly propel new corporate demand. \n On China, I mentioned already, my personal view is that they will be able to deal with these as they have done with some other even more problematic matters in the past. But that's my view as an officer of copper-producing company. That's it. A simple answer to that, Alfonso, is that market conditions change a little bit, and we decided to move on with our own material. As you know, we are long on copper concentrates. We have been selling our own concentrates and buying some other different qualities and copper concentrates. We made a review vis-a-vis the new market conditions that we have had through 2021 and decided to stop buying third parties copper concentrates. No market shortages just to be very straight in answer to what you express as a concern. Thank you very much, Carmen. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's Third Quarter 2021 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the fourth quarter and the full year 2021 results. Thank you very much, and have a nice day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the second quarter 2021 as well as answer any questions that you may have.  \n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. \n Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. As a result, all results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP.  \n Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's second quarter 2021 results conference call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper CEO and Board member; and by Mr. Xavier Garcia de Quevedo, also a Board member.  \n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during this still trying time. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market. We will then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions.  \n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the second quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $2.42 per pound in the second quarter of 2020 to $2 -- to $4.40, that is up 81.8% increase. As of today, we're seeing prices at about $4.50 per pound, which tops the year-to-date price of $4.13 per pound and bodes a positive outlook for the company.  \n We believe the following factors are influencing the market: the strong demand that we're seeing in the U.S. and Europe, particularly in terms of cathode consumption; the combined inventories of the London Metal Exchange, COMEX, Shanghai and bonded warehouses, which remained at relatively low levels, particularly given the number of days of consumption considered; the uncertainty regarding future production from Chile and Peru, which, together, represent about 40% of the world supply. \n The most important market intelligence houses for the copper market are expecting a market deficit of about 250,000 tons this year due to a recovery in demand, which should grow demand -- to grow between 2% to 3.5%.  \n Now let us look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2021. Copper represented 81.1% of our sales in the second quarter of this year. Copper production registered a decrease of 6.3% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and stood at 237,110 tons in this past quarter. This result was driven by a drop in ore grade due to stripping and maintenance work that was rescheduled in -- for this year after having been postponed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n On a year-on-year basis, copper production decreased 3.9% and totaled 475,512 tons. For 2021, we expect to produce 960,000 tons of copper. \n For molybdenum, it represented 9.7% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices average $13.89 per pound in the quarter compared to $8.24 per pound in the second quarter of last year. \n This is a 68.6% increase. In July, the average price for molybdenum stands at $18.39 per pound, which improves our outlook for revenue generation in this third quarter and possibly for the rest of the year. \n Molybdenum production decreased by 10.8% in the second quarter compared to the same period of 2020. This was mainly driven by a decrease in production at both the Toquepala and Buenavista mines due to lower ore grades. These results were partially offset by higher production at La Caridad and Cuajone.  \n Silver represented 4.1% of our sales value in the second quarter of this year, with an average price of $26.78 per ounce in the quarter, up 61.9% from the same period of 2020. Silver is currently our second by-product. \n Mined silver production decreased by 16.2% in this past quarter, as production fell at IMMSA, Buenavista and Toquepala, and this was partially offset by a higher production at the Cuajone and La Caridad mines. Refined silver production decreased 15.3% in the second quarter after production dropped at La Caridad and Ilo. This was also partially offset by an increase in production at IMMSA.  \n For zinc, it represented 2.8% of our sales value in the second quarter of this year, with an average price of $1.32 per pound in the quarter, a 48.3% increase from the same period of 2020. \n Zinc mine production increased by 8.9% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 17,111 tons. This was primarily driven by higher production at our Charcas and San Martin mines. Refined zinc production decreased by 2.8% in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of 2020.  \n For our financial results, in the second quarter of 2020, sales were $2.9 billion. That's $1.1 billion higher than sales for the second quarter of last year. This is a 62.3% increase in sales. Copper sales volume decreased by 13.6%, while value increased by 59.8% in a scenario of better prices.  \n Regarding our main by-products, we registered higher sales for molybdenum that increased 163.7% due to better prices, but partially offset by a decrease in volume. Zinc sales increased by 68% due to better prices and an increase in volume. For silver, we had an increase in sales of 21.2% due to better prices, but partially offset by a decrease in volume.  \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $13.6 million or 1.1% when compared to the same -- to the second quarter of 2020. The main cost increments has been in workers' participation, fuel cost, repair materials operating materials and supplies, operations, contractors, energy and translation difference due to the Mexican peso appreciation. These cost increments were partially offset by a decrease in inventory consumption, purchased copper and capitalized leachable material.  \n Our second quarter 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ] adjusted EBITDA was $1,862.4 million, which represented an increase of 141.9%, with regard to the $770 million registered in the second quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 64.3% versus 43.1% in the same period of 2020. \n For the 6 months of this year, the adjusted EBITDA was $3,416 million. This is 129.5% higher than the EBITDA -- the adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2020. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the 6 months of this year was 62.9%, and this compares with 42.5% for the same period of 2020.  \n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before byproduct credits was $1.61 per pound in the second quarter of this year. This is $0.101 higher than the value that we had in the first quarter of this year. This 6.7% increase in operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost, some administrative -- higher administrative expenses, lower premiums for our cathodes, and this was partially offset by a decrease in treatment and refining charges.  \n Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.586 per pound in the second quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.154 lower than the cash cost of $0.739 that we have per pound of copper in the first quarter of this year.  \n Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $521.2 million or $1.02 per pound in the second quarter of 2021. These figures represent a 33.1% increase when compared to the credit of $393.7 million or $0.771 per pound that we had in the first quarter of this year. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc and decrease for silver and sulfuric acid.  \n For net income, this past quarter, we had net income of $932.7 million, which represented a 259.4% increase with regard to the $259.5 million registered in the second quarter of 2020. The net income margin in the second quarter of this year was 32.2% versus 14.5% in the second quarter of 2020. \n We believe that our aggressive capital investment program, which has spent $10.6 million in the last 10 years, work alongside an improvement in market prices to drive growth in net income this quarter. \n Through all these investments, our company has significantly increased its production in the last decade. For copper, for instance, we increased our production by 109%, for molybdenum by 49%, and for silver by 70%. And at the same time, we improve cost efficiency and productivity. On a year-on-year basis, net income was 257.7% higher than what we had in 2020. \n For capital investments, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook of our copper prices, but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio.  \n In the second quarter of this year, we spent $219.8 million on capital investments, which reflected a 94% increase with regard to the same period of 2020 and represented 23.6% of net income this quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent $452.4 million on capital investments, which represented 26.7% of net income.\n Our current portfolio for approved projects in Peru totals $2.8 billion, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested. However, if we include the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion project, and Los Chancas $2.6 billion project, our total investment program in Peru reflects a commitment of $7.9 billion.  \n Regarding the Tia Maria project in the Arequipa region in Peru, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of Islay Province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agriculture and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.  \n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay Province and the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria's construction.  \n When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes.  \n We expect the upcoming Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently take the necessary steps to provide SCC with adequate support to initiate construction.   \n For the Buenavista zinc -- for the Mexican projects, let me start by the Buenavista zinc concentrator, which is in the Sonora state. This project is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. \n We have completed the basic engineering study, and the detailed engineering study is 94% complete. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 has been put in place. Procurement has progressed 84%. \n Additionally, construction site works are in progress. The project has all the necessary permits, and the capital budget is $413 million. As of June 30 of this year, we have invested $178.2 million in this project. We expect to initiate operations in 2023. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs.  \n For the Pilares project also located in Sonora, this is a project that is 6 kilometers away from La Caridad. This project consists in an -- of an open pit mine operation, with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. \n A new 25-meter white off-road facility for mining trucks has been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% current ore grade from La Caridad. \n The project for Pilares is $159 million, and we expect the project to begin production in the first quarter of 2022. As of June of this year, we have invested $75.3 million in this project.  \n El Pilar, it's a low capital intensity copper greenfield project, which is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico. It is about 45 kilometers away from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserve of 281 million tons of ore, with an average copper grade of 0.31%. Let me comment that this ore grade is an excellent one for oxides, which is the kind of material that the Pilar SX-EW plant would process. \n We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine, with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. \n The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. As of June 30, we have invested $2 million in this project. We expect production to begin in 2023, and the mine life is estimated at 13 years. The results from experimental paths in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. The company continues developing the project basic engineering and site environmental activities.  \n For our world-class copper deposit, El Arco, which is in the Baja California state, we have -- this project is located at the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserve of over 2.4 billion tons and an ore grade of 0.422% and 11 -- 0.11 grams of gold per ton. \n The project includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold, with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion.  \n As of June 30 of this year, we have invested $63.6 million in this project. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. Several years back, we began to acquire the rights to all relevant mining concessions in the area. This process was completed in 2020.  \n Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and communicated to the investment community and other stakeholders our progress in these matters. Southern Peru, our Peruvian branch, signed an institutional cooperation agreement with the Ministry of Health of Peru that allows the company to support the government in efforts to organize and implement 26 vaccination sites in the regions of Arequipa, Moquegua, Tacna, Cajamarca and Apurimac. \n The company will donate more than to USD 2.4 million to vaccinate 424,000 plus people over the next 2 months, which is equivalent to 40% of the population in these regions. The aforementioned agreement was the third of 3 agreements signed with the government of President Sagasti to aggressively fight the pandemic. \n The first entailed a donation of 2,181 tons of medical oxygen, which was produced by the oxygen plants at our Ilo smelter to provide liquid oxygen to the Southern regions of Peru. The second donated 4 oxygen plants, 2 of them mobile, which are currently operating in the regions of Tacna, Puno, Arequipa, PIura and Cajamarca.  \n Our company is committed with sourcing our operations with renewable energy. In 2020, 22% of Southern Copper Corporation electricity came from renewable sources. We're currently evaluating options to contract additional -- an additional portion of our power demand from renewable electricity. In 2022, we expect at least 25% of our energy supply will come from renewable electricity.  \n The percentage of recycled water from mining operations has increased 5% over the last 3 years, reached 74%. By this, I mean 5 percentage points, so from 69% to 74%. This represented savings of approximately 3.5 million cubic meters of freshwater a year. \n The company has made major efforts to increase the amount of water available to nearby communities in Mexico and Peru and has rehabilitated more than 200 kilometers of irrigation canals and 400 water reservoirs. These initiatives have benefited 20,000 farmers. And In just 5 years, the company has invested $79 million in water projects for communities.  \n Recently, Grupo Mexico published its sustainable development report for the year 2020. It contains information on Southern Copper Corporation's progress in areas relative to sustainability and is aligned with the reporting standards of the global reporting initiative and, for the first time, also adheres to the frameworks of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure.  \n The 2020 version includes a section on SCC's -- on the SCC's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and provides greater detail on issues relative to economic, governance and climate change performance.  \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. \n Accordingly, as announced to the market on July 22, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.90 per share of common stock payable on August 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 12 of this year.\n So with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Thiago Lofiego with Bradesco BBI. \nThiago Lofiego: Two quick questions about the lower ore grades. Could you give us an update on how that should evolve in the second half of the year? We understand that this is mostly related to maintenance that you didn't do last year and you're doing now, so just wanted to understand if there is more impact of lower ore grades in the second half.\n And the second one about dividends. So you just mentioned you will continue to evaluate the dividend policy. The truth of the matter of here is that copper prices remain quite high, and the outlook seems to be pretty positive. \n So what could we expect on the dividend side, maybe on the buyback side as well? Could we see an increased payout? The average payout for the last couple of years has been around 75%-ish. Could we see 100% payout, especially considering delays in big projects like Tia Maria? \nRaul Jacob: Thank you for your question, Thiago. Well, for the second half of the year, as we explained today, as we have reported before, in 2020, we couldn't make all the maintenance work and stripping that was required at our operations. We are doing a catch-up on that. And as a consequence, you go into certain areas of the mines where ore grades are not as good as what you have to say so in the main part of the ore body. \n That's why our ore grades are lower now. We expect this to improve as we go into a better part of the different operations. But we have indicated before that, at least in the case of the Peruvian operations, we will pass a patch of lower ore grades for this year and next year. \n So even though we are seeing a better performance than what we initially believed at the beginning of this year, we mentioned that our production profile was expecting -- we were expecting to produce 943,000 tons of copper. Now we have adjusted that upward to 960,000 tons of copper. \n And that's -- so that -- there is an improvement to our initial forecast. We expect to produce a little bit more than that. But for now, that's our current goal. \n Now regarding dividends, well, this is a company that -- that -- this is a decision that is always up to the Board. But as -- if you see our track record, this is a company that does not hoard cash. Our Board, in general, has been keen on sending any excess cash to our shareholders. \n So if there is a delay in projects or if there is a much better or a better outlook for metal prices, I think that they will make a decision. But if you look at the track record, you can get your own conclusions on that. We are not expecting to have any buybacks for now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jens Spiess with Morgan Stanley. \nJens Spiess: Yes. Raul, just wanted to ask, could you also provide an update of the guidance for the other metals if those were affected and also if this new copper production guidance also impacted the -- your cash cost for the year, in particular before by-products? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you for your question, Jens. Let's hold on a second, please. Okay. I mentioned already that for copper, our guidance is 960,000 tons; for molybdenum, 20,300 tons -- I'm sorry, 28,300 tons; for zinc, 72,800 tons; for silver, 21 -- 20.6 million ounces. And you mentioned already the cash cost guidance. \nJens Spiess: Exactly, the cash cost guidance, is that changed versus what you have mentioned before by-products? \nRaul Jacob: Well, what we're seeing is that before by-products, we're expecting a relatively lower total cash cost than what we had at the beginning of the year. We're currently expecting $1.61 per pound and a cash cost of about $0.65 for the year. \n And the reason for the better outlook that -- for what we -- at the beginning of the year, we mentioned about $0.85 per pound. And the reason mainly, it's related to the much better prices that we're seeing for our by-products. \n Cost, as you have seen, has increased, but we managed to contain it due to favorable variances in -- related to purchase of copper purchases, inventory movements and capitalized leachable material. \n So we believe that we will have cash cost in that range. Obviously, as we move on into a much inflationary environment, we may see an increase in the cash cost before by-product credits. But we also believe that, that will be reflected somehow in the prices of our by-products as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Grant Sporre with Bloomberg Intelligence. \nGrant Sporre: I've just got one question, if I may, and that's on Tia Maria. Could you just outline what you need in terms of permits? And what are the milestones you need to achieve before you fully go ahead with the Tia Maria project? \nRaul Jacob: You're welcome, Grant. We don't have any other needs for permits. We have all the permits that are required to initiate the construction of the project. What we have indicated is that we require a better social environment for the project to begin. \n Now let me say that we have made a very significant progress on the project's social environment. And at this point, we believe that if we work with the national government, the regional authorities as well as the local ones, we will be able to move on with the construction. \n Now for that, we need to see the -- how the new Peruvian government will consider this project. And on that matter, we're certainly willing to cooperate with the new administration to move on with the project as soon as we can. \nGrant Sporre: Yes. Okay. I guess, as an analyst, we're sort of looking for a hard yes or no. But I guess, in this instance, it's a little bit more. You have to gauge the environment, I'm guessing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Lambert with Loomis, Sayles. \nRaul Jacob: Carmen, we listen to you relatively lower -- relatively low. \nOperator: Okay. I'm sorry. Let me get my volume. Our next question is from Tim Lambert with Loomis, Sayles. \nTimothy Lambert: Just one question on CapEx for me. Has there been any revision to the guidance for CapEx for this year? It looks like at least first half of the year is on the lower end compared to what we're expecting for the full year? Or is it always expected to be back weighted? Just any color there would be great. \nRaul Jacob: Sure. Well, we have made a review on our CapEx, but not significantly -- it hasn't changed significantly. About $15 million, it's the change in CapEx. And the reason for that is that we're basically coming back from a year -- last year when we couldn't make as much as we want to and we are somehow catching up on what we couldn't do last year. So our current guidance is, as I've said, about $15 million lower than the initial one for this year. \nTimothy Lambert: Okay. That it will be about, what, $1.380 billion or so. \nRaul Jacob: For now? Currently, it's $1.340 billion. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. \nJohn Tumazos: Could you just walk us through the project completion schedule for 2022 and '23, if any of the dates have been pushed back with virus and other challenges? And should we interpret for Michiquillay and Los Chancas and El Arco that they're far enough away, that there's no firm date? \nRaul Jacob: Well, the answer to you -- the second part of your question is, no, we don't have a goal for finishing both Los Chancas and Michiquillay, and I'll give you an update on all the projects now. \n For -- well, for Pilares, I mentioned that we are expecting to initiate production next year at the first quarter. For the Buenavista zinc concentrator, we are expecting to initiate productions by mid-2023. El Pilar should be up and running by 2023. That's our current goal. For Tia Maria, we're expecting to initiate production by 2024. Los Chancas 220 -- sorry, 2027, and Michiquillay by 2028. \nJohn Tumazos: And El Arco? \nRaul Jacob: Sorry about that. El Arco is scheduled for 2028 as well. \nJohn Tumazos: If I can ask one more. We're trying to interpret politics in Peru. And here in America, in 2020 -- 2016 and 2020, many of us didn't like either presidential candidate, and it was more of a tough choice than embracing a mandate. \n Do you think, in Peru, there was strong support for either candidate or a little bit like which one was less unpopular? And do you think the legislature is majority left or majority right or partly undecided? \nRaul Jacob: On the election, the polls before getting into the second round, the Peruvian election process showed that both candidates, that cast to the runoff, had a relatively much lower support than the usual for Peruvian politics. \n Now regarding our Congress, I think that you have 3 main groups, and they have been the usual, the right, the left and some parties at the center. Yesterday, we had the election of the President of the Congress, and it was the lady that was elected. It's a center -- it's a member of one of the center parties, and she ran a coalition that was won -- that won that election. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Just a follow-up question on costs. I remember... \nRaul Jacob: Andreas, I can't copy you well. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Is this better? \nRaul Jacob: Much better. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Yes. Sorry about that. Yes, a question on cost -- a follow-up question on cost. So I remember last year, you were kind of talking about a bit of cost inflation and for cost to effectively normalize. We obviously saw costs coming down quite significantly in 2Q, which was nice to see. But what are you thinking in terms of your normalized cost levels per pound in 2020 year, too? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Well, for next year, we should have a relatively higher cash cost than what we had in this year, particularly before taking the by-product credits. And the reason for that is that we are having a relatively lower ore grade at the Peruvian operations for next year, which will impact on the cash cost. \n We are expecting probably $0.10 more than what we have now for cash cost before by-product credits for 2022. Now having said that, this is a figure that is under constant review, and we will be updating it as we move on through this -- the remaining part of 2021. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Alejandra Andrade with JPMorgan. \nAlejandra Andrade Carrillo: I just have a quick one on actual liability management. I know you only have very little debt coming due in '22 and '25. But I was thinking of how you were thinking about that debt that you were looking to refinance in the short term, where we could see LME for the '25. \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Thank you for your question, Alejandra. Well, the straight answer to your question is that, no, we are not considering at this point any specific liability management. We have looked into the matter. We always do. I mean, it's an ongoing task. \n But for now, we believe that we will remain with the structure that we have. As you know, we have a relatively relaxed payment scale. Next year, we have to pay $300 million. And then in 2025, another $500 million. You see our cash position. We are very comfortable with that. \n And the other -- the remaining part of our debt portfolio, it's relatively far away in terms of its maturities and at very high prices. So after a review -- an internal review in the matter, we decided that, for now, we are not looking into this matter. \n Now if we -- let's say that if we go on with one of our projects, we may consider -- one of our big projects, say, Tia Maria, we may consider tapping to that market, but that is something that will be discussed when appropriate. \nAlejandra Andrade Carrillo: Great. And just to clarify then. So for the '22, you would be looking to pay that with cash, instead of issuing a new bond. \nRaul Jacob: For the -- yes, that's correct. But again, we're always looking into this matter. And if conditions are considered to be appropriate ones at that time, we may review what I just said. \nOperator: Sir, I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. You may continue with any final remarks. \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Thank you very much, Carmen. And well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper second quarter of 2020 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the third quarter of this year. Thank you very much, and have a nice day. \nOperator: And this concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's second quarter 2021 results conference call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper CEO and Board member; and by Mr. Xavier Garcia de Quevedo, also a Board member.  \n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during this still trying time. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market. We will then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions.  \n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the second quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $2.42 per pound in the second quarter of 2020 to $2 -- to $4.40, that is up 81.8% increase. As of today, we're seeing prices at about $4.50 per pound, which tops the year-to-date price of $4.13 per pound and bodes a positive outlook for the company.  \n We believe the following factors are influencing the market: the strong demand that we're seeing in the U.S. and Europe, particularly in terms of cathode consumption; the combined inventories of the London Metal Exchange, COMEX, Shanghai and bonded warehouses, which remained at relatively low levels, particularly given the number of days of consumption considered; the uncertainty regarding future production from Chile and Peru, which, together, represent about 40% of the world supply. \n The most important market intelligence houses for the copper market are expecting a market deficit of about 250,000 tons this year due to a recovery in demand, which should grow demand -- to grow between 2% to 3.5%.  \n Now let us look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and 2021. Copper represented 81.1% of our sales in the second quarter of this year. Copper production registered a decrease of 6.3% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and stood at 237,110 tons in this past quarter. This result was driven by a drop in ore grade due to stripping and maintenance work that was rescheduled in -- for this year after having been postponed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n On a year-on-year basis, copper production decreased 3.9% and totaled 475,512 tons. For 2021, we expect to produce 960,000 tons of copper. \n For molybdenum, it represented 9.7% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices average $13.89 per pound in the quarter compared to $8.24 per pound in the second quarter of last year. \n This is a 68.6% increase. In July, the average price for molybdenum stands at $18.39 per pound, which improves our outlook for revenue generation in this third quarter and possibly for the rest of the year. \n Molybdenum production decreased by 10.8% in the second quarter compared to the same period of 2020. This was mainly driven by a decrease in production at both the Toquepala and Buenavista mines due to lower ore grades. These results were partially offset by higher production at La Caridad and Cuajone.  \n Silver represented 4.1% of our sales value in the second quarter of this year, with an average price of $26.78 per ounce in the quarter, up 61.9% from the same period of 2020. Silver is currently our second by-product. \n Mined silver production decreased by 16.2% in this past quarter, as production fell at IMMSA, Buenavista and Toquepala, and this was partially offset by a higher production at the Cuajone and La Caridad mines. Refined silver production decreased 15.3% in the second quarter after production dropped at La Caridad and Ilo. This was also partially offset by an increase in production at IMMSA.  \n For zinc, it represented 2.8% of our sales value in the second quarter of this year, with an average price of $1.32 per pound in the quarter, a 48.3% increase from the same period of 2020. \n Zinc mine production increased by 8.9% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 17,111 tons. This was primarily driven by higher production at our Charcas and San Martin mines. Refined zinc production decreased by 2.8% in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of 2020.  \n For our financial results, in the second quarter of 2020, sales were $2.9 billion. That's $1.1 billion higher than sales for the second quarter of last year. This is a 62.3% increase in sales. Copper sales volume decreased by 13.6%, while value increased by 59.8% in a scenario of better prices.  \n Regarding our main by-products, we registered higher sales for molybdenum that increased 163.7% due to better prices, but partially offset by a decrease in volume. Zinc sales increased by 68% due to better prices and an increase in volume. For silver, we had an increase in sales of 21.2% due to better prices, but partially offset by a decrease in volume.  \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $13.6 million or 1.1% when compared to the same -- to the second quarter of 2020. The main cost increments has been in workers' participation, fuel cost, repair materials operating materials and supplies, operations, contractors, energy and translation difference due to the Mexican peso appreciation. These cost increments were partially offset by a decrease in inventory consumption, purchased copper and capitalized leachable material.  \n Our second quarter 2001 (sic) [ 2021 ] adjusted EBITDA was $1,862.4 million, which represented an increase of 141.9%, with regard to the $770 million registered in the second quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 64.3% versus 43.1% in the same period of 2020. \n For the 6 months of this year, the adjusted EBITDA was $3,416 million. This is 129.5% higher than the EBITDA -- the adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2020. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the 6 months of this year was 62.9%, and this compares with 42.5% for the same period of 2020.  \n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before byproduct credits was $1.61 per pound in the second quarter of this year. This is $0.101 higher than the value that we had in the first quarter of this year. This 6.7% increase in operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost, some administrative -- higher administrative expenses, lower premiums for our cathodes, and this was partially offset by a decrease in treatment and refining charges.  \n Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.586 per pound in the second quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.154 lower than the cash cost of $0.739 that we have per pound of copper in the first quarter of this year.  \n Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $521.2 million or $1.02 per pound in the second quarter of 2021. These figures represent a 33.1% increase when compared to the credit of $393.7 million or $0.771 per pound that we had in the first quarter of this year. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc and decrease for silver and sulfuric acid.  \n For net income, this past quarter, we had net income of $932.7 million, which represented a 259.4% increase with regard to the $259.5 million registered in the second quarter of 2020. The net income margin in the second quarter of this year was 32.2% versus 14.5% in the second quarter of 2020. \n We believe that our aggressive capital investment program, which has spent $10.6 million in the last 10 years, work alongside an improvement in market prices to drive growth in net income this quarter. \n Through all these investments, our company has significantly increased its production in the last decade. For copper, for instance, we increased our production by 109%, for molybdenum by 49%, and for silver by 70%. And at the same time, we improve cost efficiency and productivity. On a year-on-year basis, net income was 257.7% higher than what we had in 2020. \n For capital investments, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook of our copper prices, but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio.  \n In the second quarter of this year, we spent $219.8 million on capital investments, which reflected a 94% increase with regard to the same period of 2020 and represented 23.6% of net income this quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent $452.4 million on capital investments, which represented 26.7% of net income.\n Our current portfolio for approved projects in Peru totals $2.8 billion, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested. However, if we include the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion project, and Los Chancas $2.6 billion project, our total investment program in Peru reflects a commitment of $7.9 billion.  \n Regarding the Tia Maria project in the Arequipa region in Peru, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of Islay Province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agriculture and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.  \n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay Province and the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria's construction.  \n When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes.  \n We expect the upcoming Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently take the necessary steps to provide SCC with adequate support to initiate construction.   \n For the Buenavista zinc -- for the Mexican projects, let me start by the Buenavista zinc concentrator, which is in the Sonora state. This project is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. \n We have completed the basic engineering study, and the detailed engineering study is 94% complete. In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 has been put in place. Procurement has progressed 84%. \n Additionally, construction site works are in progress. The project has all the necessary permits, and the capital budget is $413 million. As of June 30 of this year, we have invested $178.2 million in this project. We expect to initiate operations in 2023. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs.  \n For the Pilares project also located in Sonora, this is a project that is 6 kilometers away from La Caridad. This project consists in an -- of an open pit mine operation, with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. \n A new 25-meter white off-road facility for mining trucks has been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% current ore grade from La Caridad. \n The project for Pilares is $159 million, and we expect the project to begin production in the first quarter of 2022. As of June of this year, we have invested $75.3 million in this project.  \n El Pilar, it's a low capital intensity copper greenfield project, which is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico. It is about 45 kilometers away from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserve of 281 million tons of ore, with an average copper grade of 0.31%. Let me comment that this ore grade is an excellent one for oxides, which is the kind of material that the Pilar SX-EW plant would process. \n We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine, with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. \n The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. As of June 30, we have invested $2 million in this project. We expect production to begin in 2023, and the mine life is estimated at 13 years. The results from experimental paths in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. The company continues developing the project basic engineering and site environmental activities.  \n For our world-class copper deposit, El Arco, which is in the Baja California state, we have -- this project is located at the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with ore reserve of over 2.4 billion tons and an ore grade of 0.422% and 11 -- 0.11 grams of gold per ton. \n The project includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold, with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion.  \n As of June 30 of this year, we have invested $63.6 million in this project. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. Several years back, we began to acquire the rights to all relevant mining concessions in the area. This process was completed in 2020.  \n Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and communicated to the investment community and other stakeholders our progress in these matters. Southern Peru, our Peruvian branch, signed an institutional cooperation agreement with the Ministry of Health of Peru that allows the company to support the government in efforts to organize and implement 26 vaccination sites in the regions of Arequipa, Moquegua, Tacna, Cajamarca and Apurimac. \n The company will donate more than to USD 2.4 million to vaccinate 424,000 plus people over the next 2 months, which is equivalent to 40% of the population in these regions. The aforementioned agreement was the third of 3 agreements signed with the government of President Sagasti to aggressively fight the pandemic. \n The first entailed a donation of 2,181 tons of medical oxygen, which was produced by the oxygen plants at our Ilo smelter to provide liquid oxygen to the Southern regions of Peru. The second donated 4 oxygen plants, 2 of them mobile, which are currently operating in the regions of Tacna, Puno, Arequipa, PIura and Cajamarca.  \n Our company is committed with sourcing our operations with renewable energy. In 2020, 22% of Southern Copper Corporation electricity came from renewable sources. We're currently evaluating options to contract additional -- an additional portion of our power demand from renewable electricity. In 2022, we expect at least 25% of our energy supply will come from renewable electricity.  \n The percentage of recycled water from mining operations has increased 5% over the last 3 years, reached 74%. By this, I mean 5 percentage points, so from 69% to 74%. This represented savings of approximately 3.5 million cubic meters of freshwater a year. \n The company has made major efforts to increase the amount of water available to nearby communities in Mexico and Peru and has rehabilitated more than 200 kilometers of irrigation canals and 400 water reservoirs. These initiatives have benefited 20,000 farmers. And In just 5 years, the company has invested $79 million in water projects for communities.  \n Recently, Grupo Mexico published its sustainable development report for the year 2020. It contains information on Southern Copper Corporation's progress in areas relative to sustainability and is aligned with the reporting standards of the global reporting initiative and, for the first time, also adheres to the frameworks of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure.  \n The 2020 version includes a section on SCC's -- on the SCC's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and provides greater detail on issues relative to economic, governance and climate change performance.  \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. \n Accordingly, as announced to the market on July 22, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.90 per share of common stock payable on August 26 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 12 of this year.\n So with this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. Thank you for your question, Thiago. Well, for the second half of the year, as we explained today, as we have reported before, in 2020, we couldn't make all the maintenance work and stripping that was required at our operations. We are doing a catch-up on that. And as a consequence, you go into certain areas of the mines where ore grades are not as good as what you have to say so in the main part of the ore body. \n That's why our ore grades are lower now. We expect this to improve as we go into a better part of the different operations. But we have indicated before that, at least in the case of the Peruvian operations, we will pass a patch of lower ore grades for this year and next year. \n So even though we are seeing a better performance than what we initially believed at the beginning of this year, we mentioned that our production profile was expecting -- we were expecting to produce 943,000 tons of copper. Now we have adjusted that upward to 960,000 tons of copper. \n And that's -- so that -- there is an improvement to our initial forecast. We expect to produce a little bit more than that. But for now, that's our current goal. \n Now regarding dividends, well, this is a company that -- that -- this is a decision that is always up to the Board. But as -- if you see our track record, this is a company that does not hoard cash. Our Board, in general, has been keen on sending any excess cash to our shareholders. \n So if there is a delay in projects or if there is a much better or a better outlook for metal prices, I think that they will make a decision. But if you look at the track record, you can get your own conclusions on that. We are not expecting to have any buybacks for now. Okay. Thank you for your question, Jens. Let's hold on a second, please. Okay. I mentioned already that for copper, our guidance is 960,000 tons; for molybdenum, 20,300 tons -- I'm sorry, 28,300 tons; for zinc, 72,800 tons; for silver, 21 -- 20.6 million ounces. And you mentioned already the cash cost guidance. Well, what we're seeing is that before by-products, we're expecting a relatively lower total cash cost than what we had at the beginning of the year. We're currently expecting $1.61 per pound and a cash cost of about $0.65 for the year. \n And the reason for the better outlook that -- for what we -- at the beginning of the year, we mentioned about $0.85 per pound. And the reason mainly, it's related to the much better prices that we're seeing for our by-products. \n Cost, as you have seen, has increased, but we managed to contain it due to favorable variances in -- related to purchase of copper purchases, inventory movements and capitalized leachable material. \n So we believe that we will have cash cost in that range. Obviously, as we move on into a much inflationary environment, we may see an increase in the cash cost before by-product credits. But we also believe that, that will be reflected somehow in the prices of our by-products as well. You're welcome, Grant. We don't have any other needs for permits. We have all the permits that are required to initiate the construction of the project. What we have indicated is that we require a better social environment for the project to begin. \n Now let me say that we have made a very significant progress on the project's social environment. And at this point, we believe that if we work with the national government, the regional authorities as well as the local ones, we will be able to move on with the construction. \n Now for that, we need to see the -- how the new Peruvian government will consider this project. And on that matter, we're certainly willing to cooperate with the new administration to move on with the project as soon as we can. Carmen, we listen to you relatively lower -- relatively low. Sure. Well, we have made a review on our CapEx, but not significantly -- it hasn't changed significantly. About $15 million, it's the change in CapEx. And the reason for that is that we're basically coming back from a year -- last year when we couldn't make as much as we want to and we are somehow catching up on what we couldn't do last year. So our current guidance is, as I've said, about $15 million lower than the initial one for this year. For now? Currently, it's $1.340 billion. Well, the answer to you -- the second part of your question is, no, we don't have a goal for finishing both Los Chancas and Michiquillay, and I'll give you an update on all the projects now. \n For -- well, for Pilares, I mentioned that we are expecting to initiate production next year at the first quarter. For the Buenavista zinc concentrator, we are expecting to initiate productions by mid-2023. El Pilar should be up and running by 2023. That's our current goal. For Tia Maria, we're expecting to initiate production by 2024. Los Chancas 220 -- sorry, 2027, and Michiquillay by 2028. Sorry about that. El Arco is scheduled for 2028 as well. On the election, the polls before getting into the second round, the Peruvian election process showed that both candidates, that cast to the runoff, had a relatively much lower support than the usual for Peruvian politics. \n Now regarding our Congress, I think that you have 3 main groups, and they have been the usual, the right, the left and some parties at the center. Yesterday, we had the election of the President of the Congress, and it was the lady that was elected. It's a center -- it's a member of one of the center parties, and she ran a coalition that was won -- that won that election. Andreas, I can't copy you well. Much better. Okay. Well, for next year, we should have a relatively higher cash cost than what we had in this year, particularly before taking the by-product credits. And the reason for that is that we are having a relatively lower ore grade at the Peruvian operations for next year, which will impact on the cash cost. \n We are expecting probably $0.10 more than what we have now for cash cost before by-product credits for 2022. Now having said that, this is a figure that is under constant review, and we will be updating it as we move on through this -- the remaining part of 2021. Yes. Thank you for your question, Alejandra. Well, the straight answer to your question is that, no, we are not considering at this point any specific liability management. We have looked into the matter. We always do. I mean, it's an ongoing task. \n But for now, we believe that we will remain with the structure that we have. As you know, we have a relatively relaxed payment scale. Next year, we have to pay $300 million. And then in 2025, another $500 million. You see our cash position. We are very comfortable with that. \n And the other -- the remaining part of our debt portfolio, it's relatively far away in terms of its maturities and at very high prices. So after a review -- an internal review in the matter, we decided that, for now, we are not looking into this matter. \n Now if we -- let's say that if we go on with one of our projects, we may consider -- one of our big projects, say, Tia Maria, we may consider tapping to that market, but that is something that will be discussed when appropriate. For the -- yes, that's correct. But again, we're always looking into this matter. And if conditions are considered to be appropriate ones at that time, we may review what I just said. Yes. Thank you very much, Carmen. And well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper second quarter of 2020 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the third quarter of this year. Thank you very much, and have a nice day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Southern Copper Corporation's First Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the first quarter 2021 as well as answer any questions that you might have.\n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions, do not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP.\n Now I'll pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Jenny. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's First Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I am accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member.\n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during these trying times. In today's call, we will begin with an update on the measures that we have taken to keep COVID-19 at bay. We will then review the copper market and Southern Copper's key results for production, sales, operating costs, financial results and expansion projects. Subsequently, we will open the session for questions.\n Let me say first that since the beginning of the pandemic, Southern Copper has faced its challenges with resilience, innovation and solidarity. The new normal that the virus has imposed on the world requires government, companies and society to work together to protect citizens as we resume growth, generate value and fuel economic recovery.\n In this regard, we believe that the vaccination efforts, which have been carried out by the state of Sonora in Mexico represent a positive development. Through this endeavor, 100% of the medical personnel at our operations have been vaccinated. Similarly, 98% of the workers over the age of 60 in Cananea, and 100% of those in Nacozari have also received a vaccine.\n This significant event give us and our personnel needed protection against the COVID-19 virus, provides peace of mind to workers and their families and allows the company to begin normalizing operating levels at our installations. Our company is contributing to this effort by providing logistical support during the vaccination rollout.\n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. For copper, in the first quarter of 2021, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $2.56 per pound in the first quarter of 2020, up to $3.85 per pound. That is a 50.4% increase in copper prices. As of today, we're seeing prices over at about $4.50 per pound, which bodes a positive outlook for the 2021 copper market.\n We believe the following factors are influencing the market at this point. The automobile industry global recovery was reflected in an increase in sales of 89% in the first quarter of 2021. The $2 trillion infrastructure package announced by President Biden will significantly increase the demand for copper, which is a fundamental element at green energy facilities.\n The combined inventories of the London Metal Exchange, the COMEX warehouse in Shanghai and bonded warehouses remain at relatively low levels, particularly given the number of days of consumption considered by this inventory. The most important market intelligent houses for the copper market are expecting a market deficit this year due to a significant recovery in demand, which should be between 3.5% and 5.5%.\n Now let us look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 83.6% of our sales in the first quarter of this year. Copper production registered a slight decrease of 1.5% compared to the first quarter of last year and situated at 238,402 tons in the first quarter of this year. This was primarily attributable to lower production at our Peruvian mines and La Caridad mine in Mexico. This was driven by a decrease in ore grades. However, it was partially offset by an increase in production in our IMMSA operations, which was spurred by a recovery in production of 52.8% of additional production at the San Martin mine.\n Molybdenum represented 6.7% of the company sales value in the first quarter of 2021 and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices average $11.19 per pound in the quarter compared to $9.56 in the first quarter of 2020. This represents a 17.1% increase. Molybdenum production increased slightly by 0.2% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period of 2020. This was mainly due to higher production at our Peruvian mines, an increased production of molybdenum by about 10% due to higher grades and recoveries. And it was also partially offset by a decrease in production at our Buenavista mine due to lower grades.\n For silver, it represented 5.5% of our sales value in the first quarter of this year with an average price of $26.29 per ounce of silver in the quarter, up 55.8% from the first quarter of last year. Silver is currently our second byproduct. Mined silver production decreased by 6.3% in the first quarter of this year after a production fell at Buenavista, IMMSA and Toquepala. This was partially offset by higher production from the Cuajone and Caridad operations. We find silver production increased by 6% in the first quarter of this year mainly due to higher production at our IMMSA facilities.\n Zinc represented 1.4% of our sales value in the first quarter of this year with an average price of $1.25 per pound in the quarter. This is a 28.9% increase in price from the same period of 2020. Zinc mine production decreased by 14.5% quarter-on-quarter to situate at 16,466 tons. This was primarily attributable to lower ore grades at the Santa Barbara operation and Charcas, and to the shutdown of our Santa Eulalia operation in the first quarter of last year due to a severe flooding. Refined zinc production decreased by 35.7% in the first quarter compared to the same period of 2020 due to a fire at the facility. This has temporarily reduced the capacity of our San Luis Potos\u00ed zinc refinery.\n For our financial results, in the first quarter of 2021, sales were $2.5 billion, which is $812.8 million higher than the sales for the first quarter of 2020. Our sales increased by 47.3% in total. Copper sales volume decreased by 4.5%, while the value increased by 55% due to a scenario of better prices. As I said, copper prices increased by 50.4% during the past quarter.\n Regarding our main byproducts, we reported higher sales of molybdenum by 34.6% mainly due to better prices. Prices increased by 17.1% for molybdenum. And we have for open sales and adjustment that complete the 34.6% increase in molybdenum sales.\n For silver, sales increased by 57.6%, also due to better prices. In this case, prices increased by 55.8%. These results were partially offset by an increasing volume of 3.3% and sales of zinc due to lower volumes of refined zinc. This was partially offset by higher zinc price.\n Our total operating cost and expenses decreased by $5.5 million or 0.5% when compared to the same period of 2020. The main cost reductions were driven by a decrease in copper purchases from third parties and an increasing capitalized leachable material. These cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in workers' participation, an uptick in energy cost due to a temporary gas shortage in Northern Mexico, an increase in the diesel and fuel costs, higher figures for inventory consumption of -- for the quarter. We also had higher depreciation and other factors for a minor value.\n Let me focus on the increasing due to temporary gas shortage that we have in the first quarter. That represented an increase in energy cost of about $30.6 million as a consequence of the temporary scarcity that we had in February of natural gas in the northern part of Mexico.\n Our first quarter '21 adjusted EBITDA was $1,554.5 million, which represented an increase of 116.3% compared to the same period of 2020, where the adjusted EBITDA was $718.8 million. The EBITDA margin in the first quarter of this year was 61.4%, and that compares with 41.8% in the first quarter of last year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, adjusted EBITDA was 24% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n For the cash cost, operating cash cost per pound of copper before byproduct credits was $1.51 per pound in the first quarter of 2021. This is $0.074 higher than the value for the fourth quarter of 2020. This 5.2% increase in operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost and lower premiums, which were partially compensated by lower treatment and refining charges and administrative -- and lower administrative expenses.\n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproduct credit was $0.739 per pound in the first quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.067 higher than the cash cost of $0.672 that we had in the fourth quarter of 2020. That is a 10% increase in cash cost.\n Regarding byproducts, we had a total credit of $393.7 million or $0.771 per pound in the first quarter of this year. These figures represent a 1% increase when compared to a credit of $0.763 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2020. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, silver, gold and sulfuric acid and decreased for zinc.\n Net income attributable to SCC shareholders in the first quarter of this year was $763.8 million, that is 30.2% of our sales or diluted earnings per share of $0.99.\n Capital investments. As you know, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. The conditions generated by COVID-19 have led us to implement measures to reduce vulnerability at the project execution level.\n These measures, which are constantly under review include enforcing social distance rules, strengthening sanitation efforts and requiring quarantine periods for personnel. Some activities in the project execution stage, which are located in regions in Peru or Mexico where new cases of patients are on the rise, have experienced delays. Consequently, we expect some delays, albeit minimal at this point. We expect these delays in the execution of our investment project. Nevertheless, to date, delays primarily affect construction activities that require personnel to work in close physical proximity. All other engineering, procurement and construction activities that entail limited interaction between personnel are on scale.\n In the first quarter of 2021, we spent $232.6 million on capital investments, which represented 130% increase with regard to the same period of 2020 and accounted for 30.5% of our net income. For the Peruvian projects, our portfolio for approved projects in Peru totaled $2.8 billion, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested. If we include the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion budget, and Los Chancas $2.6 million budget, these 2 projects will increase our total investment program in Peru to reflect a commitment of $7.9 billion.\n For Tia Maria, a project that is located in the Peruvian region of Arequipa, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the Islay province population. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activity in the Tambo Valley and suppored growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.\n On January 7, 2020 (sic) [ 2021 ], this is the past quarter, the mayor of Islay province awarded a City Diploma to Southern Copper in recognition of the company's efforts to assist the population of Islay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Southern Copper provided medical assistant, tests, oxygen, personal protection equipment and food stuff for the population in the area of influence of the Tia Maria project.\n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle.\n During the construction and operation phase, we will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs of which 3,600 are direct and 5,400 are indirect jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria's construction phase. When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contributions to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes.\n We expect the Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the company has made on the social front for this project and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently, take the necessary steps to provide Southern Copper with adequate support to initiate construction.\n For our Mexican projects. In Buenavista, we have a new concentrator to produce the zinc concentrate. Buenavista is our operation at the Sonora state in Mexico. This project includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering study and the detailed engineering study is 89% complete.\n In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 has been put in place. Purchase orders have been placed for major equipment. As part of this process, the mill manufacturing process has been completed and the respective elements are being shipped or are already at the project site. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. We expect to initiate operations in 2023. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs.\n For the Pilares project, also in the Sonora state of Mexico, this is a project that is located 6 kilometers from La Caridad. It consists of an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks has been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit with primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrate. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining 0.78% expected ore from Pilares with the 0.34% ore from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, and we expect the project to begin production in the first quarter of next year.\n El Pilar is a low-capital intensity copper greenfield project, which is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico at about 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 281 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.31% (sic) [ 0.301% ].\n We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. We expect the project to start production in 2023 and the mine life is expected to be 13 years. The results from the experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. The company has started the project basic engineering and site species collection.\n For El Arco, a project that is located at the Baja California peninsula, this is a world-class copper deposit, which is located at the central part of the Baja California peninsula. It has ore reserve of over 2.4 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.422%. And to that, we have 0.3 billion tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.288%. And as a byproduct, the mineral contains 0.11 grams of gold per ton.\n The project considers the construction of an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. The annual production is expected to situate at 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request environmental impact permit. We have had the corresponding mining concessions for several years now. And during 2020, we finished acquiring all the land needed.\n You may have noticed that we are -- we have added a new section to our press release, which tackles the matters of the issues of environmental, social and government -- governance investments or ESG. Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and communicating to the investment community and other stakeholders our progress in this matters.\n  In this regard, the company's sustainable development policies were recently updated. These policies are applicable to SCC and its subsidiaries, formalize the company's vision, commitment and objective to promote sustainable development and generate share value for our stakeholders.\n In 2020, and for the second consecutive year, Southern Copper was listed on the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Index MILA. Additionally, our score on S&P Global Annual Sustainability Assessment increased to 50 points during the same period. This represents a 5-point increase over the 2019 level.\n In Peru, Southern Copper is coordinating with the Peruvian government and our main oxygen supplier to adapt, which has already been done, our Ilo Oxygen Plant number 2 in record time to produce 140 tons per week of liquid oxygen. What we have done is worked together with the Peruvian government and our main oxygen supply -- industrial oxygen supplier to adjust or to adapt our -- and 1 of our 2 oxygen plants to produce liquid oxygen, plant number 2. Plant number 1 has already been adapted in the past, and it's been -- it has been producing oxygen, but given the need of this element by -- to fight the COVID pandemic, the company decided to move on with this investment.\n The production is being used to supply hospital and medical facilities in Peru's central and southern regions, where medicinal oxygen is extremely scarce. The company has committed to donate 2,500 tons of liquid oxygen, which is equivalent of 194,000 of oxygen tanks of 10 cubic meters each. As of March 31, we have delivered 1,346 tons of liquid oxygen or 53% of the committed donation.\n In addition to this effort, in March, we donated 2 mobile oxygen plants each with a capacity of 720 cubic meters per day of medical oxygen. These plants will be transported to towns that lack sufficient oxygen supply to fight against COVID-19.\n Last year, 3,667 students from 11 educational centers sponsored by the company in Mexico and Peru, we're able to continue their school programs remotely. To cope with the global pandemic, the company's programs, which are developed under the community development model, migrated to virtual platforms. Last year, 4,634 online workshops were held, consolidating a community of over 290,000 users on social networks, which represents an increase of 63% compared to 2019.\n In the first quarter of this year, we continue to roll out remote school programs to provide education to 3,756 school-age students. Alongside these efforts, Southern Copper offered virtual workshops to the community, which has been reproduced more than 10 million tons since the beginning of the pandemic.\n Last year was marked by a good performance in terms of educational safety since no fatalities were registered and accident rates and lost days in the mining division dropped by 44% and 78%, respectively. This compared to 2019.\n Minera Mexico obtained for the second consecutive year, 3 of the 6 distinctions, or Casco de Plata, award by the Mining Chamber of Mexico for occupational health and safety performance. The survey conducted by the Mining Chamber of Mexico, which determines award recipients includes approximately 120 mining companies of different sizes that are grouped into diverse categories, such as open and underground mining, smelting and refining.\n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company's policy to review the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on April 22, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock payable on May 25 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 11, 2021.\n With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the phone for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America. \nTimna Tanners: Hope you are doing well. I wanted to ask a little bit more about how to think about the upcoming quarters. In particular, if we look at the run rate in the first quarter for copper volumes are ahead of your annual guidance, but silver is below. And in CapEx, you're below your run rate. So just any update on how you're thinking about the progress for the year would be great. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much for your question, Timna. Basically, we're maintaining our forecast. Even though we believe that in production, it may be a little bit higher than what we forecast. At the beginning of the year, we mentioned that we're expecting to produce 943,000 tons of copper. At this point, the number looks more like 950,000 tons, but we're still keeping our initial forecast to see how we evolve in that regard through the year.\n Regarding our CapEx, we're also maintaining our budget. Please keep in mind that we will be doing some catch-up of work that we couldn't have done through 2020, and that will certainly require some more activity in that regard. Our current forecast is the same that we had at the beginning of the year, which considers $1.4 billion of capital expenditures for this year, for 2021. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. So CapEx can ramp up, it sounds like and some catch-up is implied in there. Is that right? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Let me comment on why CapEx is relatively slower than the run rate, as you well mentioned, in your question. The reason for that is that usually, you initiate the process of certain new projects at the beginning of the year once the budget has been approved. And you usually catch up and have a little bit more -- a higher run rate, say, the second half of the year. That's why we're relatively comfortable with maintaining our current capital budget for this year. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. And if I could, one more. On the cost side, we've been hearing from many of the miners that higher prices lead to higher costs, which makes a lot of sense. You talked a little bit about factors to think about from Q4 to Q1. But if you could help also talk to us about what to expect in coming quarters. Freight costs are higher, higher copper prices, higher costs. But are there other factors that we should be mindful of, like any change in COVID measures may be coming off or other inflationary measures that we should follow? \nRaul Jacob: Obviously, fuel prices are higher now than what we had last year at this time. We had -- in the first quarter, we had a onetime event, which is the scarcity and much higher price for gas, natural gas. That has already passed. We're not seeing that. We are not seeing exchange rate appreciations, both in Mexico and Peru at this point, at least that -- an exchange rate that may impact on our cost at this point, we're not seeing that. And obviously, higher prices that you mentioned may reflect in the future on higher prices for certain materials. But at this point, we are not -- other than fuel, as I mentioned, we're not seeing anything significant at this point. \n Let me add something else to your question, Timna. We increased our cash cost before byproduct credit a little bit. It was $0.074 from what we had at the fourth quarter last year. And that's basically because of the catch-up that the company is doing in certain maintenance and stripping and some other jobs that were postponed at the beginning of 2020 at our operations due to the COVID pandemic.\n At the beginning, we were operating with about 40% of the workforce. That is not the case now. We're very close to 90% in total workforce operation at the corporation in average. And that's basically what we're doing now is catching up in certain maintenance and certain stripping and some other works that were part of 2020 are being done now. That explains the increase that you are seeing in cash cost before byproduct credits. Now we have a much more attractive wind tail (sic) [ tailwind ] coming from the prices of our byproducts as well as the price of copper, which is certainly helping our cash cost this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Thiago Lofiego from Bradesco BBI. \nThiago Lofiego: Two questions. Raul, if you could talk a little bit more about Tia Maria. Are conversations completely stalled ahead of the elections here? And also, what could be the timing for the other large projects, Michiquillay, Los Chancas? Is there any way you can accelerate those? And what could be the earliest start-up times for -- years for those projects?\n And the second question is just about the regulatory risk in Mexico. How do you perceive that risk at this point? Any potential for higher royalties, changes in concessions or any other regulatory risks that you're seeing? Or is this more and more on the quiet side now? \nRaul Jacob: Let me start by the second part of your question. I don't -- we don't see a risk at this point on the regulatory front. You and all the audience have seen in Mexico at the beginning of the current administration were some concerns about, well, increasing in taxation or regulatory matters. We don't see that, that has materialized specifically affecting our industry, and we are comfortable with the things as they are now.\n Regarding for the large projects that we have, well, for Tia Maria first, that was the beginning of your question. We are working actually in a very good way with both the civil society, the population, and the authorities. And that is reflected, as I mentioned, in recognition that the company has received from the Mayor of the province of Michiquillay, which is the area where the project is due to the contribution of the company to fight the pandemic. That was a recognition that we received at the beginning of the year. And I think it reflects the improvement that we have been obtaining regarding Tia Maria.\n In the case of the other projects, they take their time. For Michiquillay, we're currently very close to signing a new -- an agreement with the local communities to initiate the exploration for the project. We need to comply also with an environmental -- first environmental study that it's presented to the Peruvian authorities. We already did that. We already presented it at the -- in February of this year. And we're expecting the approval, that usually takes about a little bit more than 2 months. So we're close to the time where we will get their feedback and hopefully, the approval of this environmental -- first environmental study. We may accelerate the project a little bit. If we can, we will do that. But at this point, we are holding to our current forecast for Michiquillay.\n In the case of Los Chancas, we're working currently on the final environmental impact assessment. Good progress has been obtained in that regard. So we're relatively comfortable to how things are moving forward for Los Chancas.\n I think that I covered the 3 major projects that we have already. And we're not moving the start-up date for these projects. For the case of Tia Maria, it is expected to initiate production by 2024; for Los Chancas, it will be in 2027; and Michiquillay, next year, 2028. If we see an opportunity for moving faster with these projects, we'll take it. But first, we will be keen on getting the best project design to have a very competitive operation, which we believe is one of the key elements of the company's success in delivering good results to the investment community and obviously to our shareholders. \nThiago Lofiego: And just a quick follow-up. El Arco would be then after those 3, right? \nRaul Jacob: El Arco will be, yes. El Arco is expected for 2028 as well with Michiquillay. I haven't commented on the Mexican project. Let me do that. I thought that you referred to Peruvian ones, but for El Arco... \nThiago Lofiego: Yes, no, just in general. Yes, sorry. Yes. \nRaul Jacob: Yes. For El Arco, it is expected to initiate production by 2028. As we reported, we already have all the necessary land. We finished that process. We have all the concession. So we can move on with the project now with a much more -- in a much more comfortable position than we were in the past. For Pilares, we are expecting, as I said, to initiate it in 2022, and for El Pilar in 2023. \nThiago Lofiego: Yes. And very final question here, Raul. When you think about Los Chancas, for example, which is the first project, this considering Tia Maria to start up in the future, the first big project, right, which you mentioned 2027 start-up. What's holding you back from really accelerating that project, for example? I understand you mentioned you guys are studying and making sure you have the best project. But it's 6 years from here into 2027, right? I would imagine that there is room for you guys. If you want to accelerate maybe a couple of years, you could, right? Or is there something really that would make this impossible to happen? \nRaul Jacob: Certain work that has to be done in order to have ready the land were the trains and some other facilities will be built will take a while, and that's why we are not moving this. As you well mentioned, it looks like an unusual longer time frame for that. Now there are certain things that we can do and depend also on how the industry is performing, which is, for instance, accelerating the delivery of key critical equipment that could be done, or requesting to build the equipment and deliver it to us on advance. So we have, say, the mills for the concentrator ready to install. And that could save us some deep time. But at this point, that's -- the forecast that we have is as I mentioned, and we want to maintain it. We will report if there is a catch-up in that regard that allow us to reduce the time as we move on with it.\n Please keep in mind that the company has been very, very careful in developing these capital budgets, not only in the fact that they have to be accurate cost wise, capital cost wise, but also in the time line that they should follow. So when we initiate a project, we want to be very, very sure that we will comply with both the time line that we have for the project and the capital budget. That's why if you see our track record, you won't see that the company has failed with the budgets for the project that we have indicated at the construction time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. \nCarlos de Alba: I hope everything is fine with you and your families. Just a question on -- I have several questions. So the first one, if I may, is on cash cost before byproducts, when you mentioned why it increased quarter-on-quarter, it was certainly better, I think, than at least I expected and maybe better than the guidance for the year. So could you maybe elaborate how sustainable this level of cash costs are? And is there any revision to the guidance for the year in terms of cash cost before byproducts? \nRaul Jacob: Well, we expect to have our cash cost, that's about where we are now. We think that, as I say, we're catching up with certain works, and we have an unexpected event regarding the gas prices and cost and availability in the first quarter. So that should be removed from now on, that spike in gas prices. And then for the rest of the year, let's say that we're going to focus to have before byproduct credits between $1.50 and $1.55. And well, byproducts will certainly help, given the better prices that they are -- that we're seeing in that regard and the stronger production that we're getting from our molybdenum plants. And also, we expect to have a better zinc production for the rest of the year as we recuperate our zinc refinery and initiate sales of refined zinc for the rest of 2021. \nCarlos de Alba: Yes. That was my second question. How do you see that recovery? Do you expect refined zinc production and shipments sales to recover already in the second quarter after the fire? I mean what is the progress that you have made in the period of damage done to the refinery? \nRaul Jacob: The first part of the -- the first quarter -- during the first quarter, we have this fire that affected our facilities. We pretty much repaired most of the damage. But we couldn't produce the forms, the shapes that are required for selling the refined zinc. And that's what we have been working on through this quarter. So we're expecting it to initiate production. And as you may recall, Carlos, we are long in refining capacity at our zinc operations. So we do have some zinc concentrate that will be processed through the second quarter and the rest of the year, and that will allow us to catch up on refined zinc sales for the rest -- for this year. \nCarlos de Alba: All right. Excellent. And then 2 more, if I may. Just one, on capital allocation. I mean, clearly, the quality of the assets that Southern Copper has in copper specifically are very good, and the cash generation is impressive. But yet -- and the company pays the current dividends. But there is not a capital allocation in place or policy -- capital allocation policy in place as we are seeing other companies -- other mining companies incorporate in aluminum, in iron ore that have been developed recently. Can we ever expect Southern Copper to maybe have a more formal allocation policy for the excess cash generation that it has? And the second question, my last question, I'm sorry, do you have any specific number -- or has the company done an analysis on how much copper demand could come from the U.S. infrastructure package that you mentioned earlier in the call? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you for your questions, Carlos. Well, on capital allocation policy, well, that is something that we may consider. But so far, I think that the company track record is quite clear. What we want to do? We basically are developing projects that will maintain the company characteristics of being a low-cost copper producer, probably the lowest cost copper producer, given the size of the company. I mean, among our peers, we believe that we're the lowest cash cost of copper at this point.\n Regarding dividends, as you see, the company is basically not holding cash. Our Board has been increasing our quarterly dividend as we are moving towards a different price of the -- different part of the price cycle and as we have increased our production. Just as a reference for our audience, about 10 years ago, we were producing less than 500,000 tons of copper. Now we are producing about 1 million tons. We have doubled our capacity. Our goal is to go up to 1.8 million tons of copper production in the next -- in this decade. And by doing that, we will keep our copper -- characteristic of being a low-cost producer.\n And your last question, well, we have not -- we don't have a formal internal estimate to how much is the green revolution or the infrastructure package that has -- that is going to be discussed for infrastructure in the U.S. We don't have that information yet. Our commercial team is very positive about this. But -- and I've seen some studies that are doing a forecast that will be extremely favorable for copper producers in the next few years if this materializes. But at this point, we don't have a formal estimate ourselves. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rodrigo Salazar from AM Advisors. \nRodrigo Salazar Couttolenc: My question has been answered. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ivan Fernandez from Kinea. \nIvan Fernandez: I have a question about the political risk in Peru. I wonder how you're seeing the guy, Castillo, and his proposals, particularly on risks related to the nationalization or expropriation of mining operations or excessive taxation of mining operations or even potentially less government protection against protests that could affect operations. If you could comment on kind of defenses you might have against that in case it pushes forward that kind of proposition, or even more useful would be to hear your views on what he's actually likely to try to do if he wins, whether it's just campaign rhetoric or you really believe he would push for these kind of things. It would be very helpful to understand the risks you see for the company around that. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you for your question, Ivan. I think that at this point, we don't want to comment on the proposals that the candidates, both of them, are doing regarding the mining industry, in particularly -- particular, because they -- we have seen that the campaigns proceed, the positions not necessarily hold. We have seen that in the past. We believe that once the elected president starts looking at the matters regarding to our industry, he or she will see that we're a partner for the Peruvian development and one of the very strong locomotives that the country could use to go out of the very hard recession that COVID-19 has created in Peru. So at this point, we're not making any specific comment on that. Once we have definition, we will comment on specific measures that will be announced, if any, by the elected president. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Leopoldo Silva from LarrainVial. \nLeopoldo Silva: So my question is regarding your smelters projects. Here, could you please share with us some of the recent developments you have had on these projects in Ilo, in Peru, Empalme and Mexico? On what stage are they currently? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. As we have indicated to the market, we have 2 smelting projects, one is in Peru and the other one is in Mexico. Let me comment on the Mexican first. We are expecting to initiate these investments later on in this decade. For now, we're considering this project to require certain studies that are being developed, but we don't have this as, let's say, a priority -- specific priority in our expenditures for the future.\n Regarding the Peruvian project, we do have all the economics of the project already reviewed. There is a very interesting concentrate market at the northern part of Chile and the southern part of Peru. And as such, we are considering also an investment for a new smelter for the future.\n Now on the -- as I say, on the economic side, it's -- we have finished the review of the technology to use and the economic results of it. And it's very interesting, very -- actually a very good investment for the company. It has not been approved by our Board. We need to present it to the Board for a formal approval. And also, we need to initiate all the environmental permits for this project. We are considering some investment for this year, but it's related to a cogeneration of power at the Ilo smelter. That's what we're considering this year. And for 2022 and on, we will consider in investing the total budget for projects.\n In the case of Mexico, for the smelter, we're doing technical studies this year, and we will be -- we will consider certain investments on the project for 2022. There is also a very good and very interesting market for concentrates at the northern part of Mexico, not only because we are long in concentrate in Mexico as well as in Peru, but, as I say, there are good opportunities to capture value for smelting in the -- in both Mexico and Peru. \nLeopoldo Silva: Great. And regarding your answer, could you perhaps guide us through breaking down the strategic value of this investment on first and -- or meaning how much do you see the weight -- the returns of the stand-alone business? And how does that fit with being the lowest cost producer? That's on the one hand. And on the other, how much does it weigh in the eyes of miners the value of having smelting capacity in this side of the Pacific and also securing sulfuric acid supply coming from the smelters? I mean, is there like a hidden value of having the smelters on this side of the Pacific? \nRaul Jacob: Well, certainly, there is always the possibility of saving all the freight that will take the same, say, concentrates from the northern part of Chile, the southern part of Peru to China and the same applies to Mexico. There are U.S. copper concentrates that could go to these smelters as well as our own lone production that we have from the Buenavista operation at this point.\n On the budget, the smelter in Mexico has an estimated budget of $864 million. And for the Peruvian one, it's $1,357 million. That -- those are the budgets. Please keep in mind that these 2 have not been approved by our Board. So they are still under review, technical studies and we don't have a specific goal for them, but it's in our current outlook for the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andreas Bokkenheuser from UBS. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Just 2 quick questions for me, a follow-up and a question on volumes last year. So one of the things we noticed, obviously, last year out of Peru on a national level is that copper production fell on the back of COVID-19 and all the mining shutdowns and whatnot. You didn't really experience that. You bucked the trend and you actually saw production volume up on a year-on-year basis. Can you just spend a little bit of time talking about how you were able to grow your production in an otherwise somewhat pressured market? And how do you see yourself setting yourself apart from the guys that -- or producers that have been under pressure production-wise? That's the first question.\n And I guess the second question, just a follow-up on the Peruvian risk. I get the point that you don't want to comment on the current candidates. But if we talk about it like hypothetically, what would it actually take if you wanted to start nationalizing mining assets in Peru? I mean, my understanding based on conversations over the past month is that it would require constitutional changes. Is that something you could confirm, any visibility on what would be required? Those are my 2 questions. \nRaul Jacob: Sure. Thank you very much for your questions, Andreas. Well, on the how -- please keep in mind that in 2020 -- in 2019, in May, we initiated the production of the second concentrator of Toquepala. So in 2019, we had 8 months of production of a new facility that has a capacity of 100,000 tons of copper per year. And in 2020, we had that facility running at full speed through the whole year, 12 months. Now as I mentioned a while ago, we -- at the beginning of the pandemic, we cut everything that we could in order to maintain only the concentrators, the smelter, the refinery and the SX-EW operations moving forward.\n In the case of Peru, we were authorized given that our operations are isolated, and we have no cases of COVID at that point at the beginning of the pandemic. We have -- for quite a few months we've been where we didn't have -- most of the year, I would say, we didn't have any outbreaks of COVID inside the premises where our workers and their families live. We had some cases of people that were not staying at the premises, but living say in their houses in Moquegua or Ilo or Tacna.\n So we managed to produce the mineral that our concentrators require. We didn't do any stripping -- any specific stripping works for Toquepala, very little, just necessary to extract the mineral. And that allowed us to maintain our production level while having no cases inside our premises, and having our production to hold. And as I say, we had at the beginning of 2019 in May, in the first -- the second quarter of 2019, we initiated production with the new concentrator of Toquepala. And we had a full year of production, and that explains why we increased our production in 2020 of copper concentrate and copper containing concentrate in this year -- last year.\n Now regarding your question on possible expropriation of mining operations, well, the candidate that expressed that has indicated recently that he is considering more a change in taxation than a change for an expropriation of operations. So we actually don't think that this is going to be a material -- a thing that will be materialized. But as I say, we will see as we have a new president and this person takes the measures that he or she believes are the appropriate one for the country. \nAndreas Bokkenheuser: Hope you guys are all safe and stay safe. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Fernando Assad from Ashmore. \nFernando Assad: Congrats on the results in a very challenging environment. My question as well is hypothetical in nature. If the Peruvian political situation, whoever is in power, continues to be as much of a headwind and mix as it has been over the last 12 months, what can you do to reallocate priorities in terms of investments and perhaps production from Peru to Mexico? Or are the growth projects in Mexico totally unrelated in terms of the Peruvian projects in particular, Tia Maria. Is there any way you can put the Mexican growth projects ahead of Tia Maria? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you for your question, Fernando. Well, we have 3 projects that are being under developed in Mexico. We have a budget -- a combined budget of a little bit north of $900 million. These projects were okay, generally speaking, particularly Pilares, it's pretty much finished. We are looking into some details to initiate production. And we expect to have it -- there is a good possibility that we advance a little bit production for Pilares. That's one of the comments that I think it's important to share.\n Now El Pilar, it's moving forward. We are on a technical studies part of the project. So on that, we can move on with no problems at all. The one that we're affected a little bit by the pandemic is the zinc concentrator at Buenavista. We are expecting the final vaccination of people over 60 years in the area where the project is, and we expect that to be a starting point for coming back into operation at the zinc concentrator, meaning by this construction of the zinc concentrator will be -- will take some speed as the Mexican government finished distributing the shots of vaccines in Cananea. We reported on that, on a very promising activity conducted by Sonora government, which we certainly see as a very positive development.\n The company is constantly looking into different opportunities to acquire assets that fit the company characteristic of being a low-cost operation. And we are looking basically on copper, which is -- we believe it's a metal that has an excellent forecast for the next few years. So we're focusing on that. Obviously, if conditions are better in some other countries that will be attractive for us to get in, and there is a good project to developing there, we will certainly -- the first thing will be that our asset management will have to study this in detail, and give a recommendation to our Board, which will, at the end of the day, they will take the decision of moving into these kind of acquisitions or some other activities in places where we see opportunities. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Alfonso Salazar from Scotiabank. \nAlfonso Salazar: First of all, congratulations on all the COVID support initiatives of the company. I have a question regarding growth... \nRaul Jacob: Alfonso, could you -- I can't copy you. Could you approach a little bit to your microphone, please? \nAlfonso Salazar: Can you hear me better now? \nRaul Jacob: Much better. Thank you. \nAlfonso Salazar: So the question that I have is regarding the growth beyond the projects that you have announced. And after -- what you see at Toquepala and Buenavista. And let's leave aside the increasing rift, say, for example, in Peru because of the elections. But if we put that aside, is it possible that Southern Copper increases capacity at say Caridad and Cuajone agreements that you mentioned, the Cuajone expansion many years ago. Is that something that is feasible or not really? That's my first question.\n And the second one is regarding the mining reform in Mexico. I was disconnected right when you were talking about that. But let me give you a little bit notes here. What we have seen is a lot of reforms in Mexico are strategic in nature, many of them in natural resources, like the energy reform, hydrocarbons reform. So why do you think that the mining industry would be excused? \nRaul Jacob: I couldn't get your -- the final part of your second question, Alfonso. \nAlfonso Salazar: Yes, just trying to understand why do you think that mining reform is not likely to be materialized in Mexico. I got disconnected when you were talking about that. \nRaul Jacob: Well, let me first answer your first question on the increased capacity in Toquepala, I will say that we are at the optimal capacity level for this operation nowadays. Keep in mind that we pretty much doubled the concentrating capacity of Toquepala in 2019. So it's a fresh investment, so we feel happy and comfortable with that.\n In the case of Cuajone, we have now a lower mining rate on a daily basis for the Cuajone mine, and we're currently looking into possible expansion of the Cuajone operation to put it at the same median level of the Peru -- of the Toquepala operation also in Peru. That is a project that is -- that has been -- resources have been assigned to review this expansion. We're looking into ways to increase our water recovery, which will be an important step in order to go on with the Cuajone expansion. So with that, we may increase our production capacity in Peru a little bit more.\n Regarding the mining reform in Mexico, well, I think that we need to see how political circumstances evolve in Mexico as well. But at this point and for what we have seen through -- since the beginning of the new administration, we haven't seen any specific actions other than... \nOscar Gonz\u00e1lez Rocha: Raul. \nRaul Jacob: Yes? \nOscar Gonz\u00e1lez Rocha: Yes. This is Oscar. Can I mention that there was some -- okay. There was some reform last year to the special mining tax, some changes where there was a reduction on the concession fees that could be credited to the special mining tax. And also some adjustments that the government did to the concessions and how that special tax was paid. So there was some reform last year addressing some issues that the government felt the mining industry wasn't managing well with the special mining tax. So there was some, and it's having -- it affects this year and increase special mining tax. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jean Bruny from BBVA. \nJean Baptiste Bruny: Probably just a quick one on ESG. I found it very interesting that you put a full page dedicated to that matter, to ESG. Is it something we can expect now to happen every quarter? Maybe you can develop metrics you will be using in the future in the communique? And are you considering maybe in the medium term, depending on the demand on the projects, using green bonds or sustainable bonds to finance some specific projects? \nRaul Jacob: I couldn't get your question. Sorry, jean, could you repeat it please? \nJean Baptiste Bruny: Yes. Just on ESG that you're using a full page on ESG in the communique. So I would like to know if it's something we can see now every quarter? And what kind of metrics you will be using in that part of the communique? And are you analyzing the issuance of the bond or sustainable bond in the future -- green or sustainable bond in the future? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Yes. Thank you for your questions. As you have seen, we have a section on ESG at our press release, and we will keep it as we move on. We believe that one of the -- there are 2 things that we have been doing lately in the last few years, actually. One is, well, we did a gap analysis on what we need to do in order to improve our ESG metrics for now and the future. And that is a corporate effort that we are moving forward with. And we believe that part of this effort should be on the communication side to express and to show the different progress that we're getting on this matter as we move on. You will see these metrics as we report them in the next few quarters.\n Now regarding, well, green bonds are obviously an interesting source of funds for the future, and we will consider them if we go to the capital market as an option, and that's part of what we're doing is communicating what we are doing and catching up in whatever we feel that there is an opportunity to improve on ESG metrics. \nOperator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Jenny. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's First Quarter 2021 Results. We certainly appreciate your participation, and hope you -- and hope to have you back with us when we report the second quarter of this year. Thank you very much and stay well, all of you. Thank you very much again. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Jenny. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's First Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I am accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member.\n Before we go into the details of the past quarter, let me first express my best wishes for you and your loved ones during these trying times. In today's call, we will begin with an update on the measures that we have taken to keep COVID-19 at bay. We will then review the copper market and Southern Copper's key results for production, sales, operating costs, financial results and expansion projects. Subsequently, we will open the session for questions.\n Let me say first that since the beginning of the pandemic, Southern Copper has faced its challenges with resilience, innovation and solidarity. The new normal that the virus has imposed on the world requires government, companies and society to work together to protect citizens as we resume growth, generate value and fuel economic recovery.\n In this regard, we believe that the vaccination efforts, which have been carried out by the state of Sonora in Mexico represent a positive development. Through this endeavor, 100% of the medical personnel at our operations have been vaccinated. Similarly, 98% of the workers over the age of 60 in Cananea, and 100% of those in Nacozari have also received a vaccine.\n This significant event give us and our personnel needed protection against the COVID-19 virus, provides peace of mind to workers and their families and allows the company to begin normalizing operating levels at our installations. Our company is contributing to this effort by providing logistical support during the vaccination rollout.\n Now let us focus on the copper market, the core of our business. For copper, in the first quarter of 2021, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $2.56 per pound in the first quarter of 2020, up to $3.85 per pound. That is a 50.4% increase in copper prices. As of today, we're seeing prices over at about $4.50 per pound, which bodes a positive outlook for the 2021 copper market.\n We believe the following factors are influencing the market at this point. The automobile industry global recovery was reflected in an increase in sales of 89% in the first quarter of 2021. The $2 trillion infrastructure package announced by President Biden will significantly increase the demand for copper, which is a fundamental element at green energy facilities.\n The combined inventories of the London Metal Exchange, the COMEX warehouse in Shanghai and bonded warehouses remain at relatively low levels, particularly given the number of days of consumption considered by this inventory. The most important market intelligent houses for the copper market are expecting a market deficit this year due to a significant recovery in demand, which should be between 3.5% and 5.5%.\n Now let us look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 83.6% of our sales in the first quarter of this year. Copper production registered a slight decrease of 1.5% compared to the first quarter of last year and situated at 238,402 tons in the first quarter of this year. This was primarily attributable to lower production at our Peruvian mines and La Caridad mine in Mexico. This was driven by a decrease in ore grades. However, it was partially offset by an increase in production in our IMMSA operations, which was spurred by a recovery in production of 52.8% of additional production at the San Martin mine.\n Molybdenum represented 6.7% of the company sales value in the first quarter of 2021 and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices average $11.19 per pound in the quarter compared to $9.56 in the first quarter of 2020. This represents a 17.1% increase. Molybdenum production increased slightly by 0.2% in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period of 2020. This was mainly due to higher production at our Peruvian mines, an increased production of molybdenum by about 10% due to higher grades and recoveries. And it was also partially offset by a decrease in production at our Buenavista mine due to lower grades.\n For silver, it represented 5.5% of our sales value in the first quarter of this year with an average price of $26.29 per ounce of silver in the quarter, up 55.8% from the first quarter of last year. Silver is currently our second byproduct. Mined silver production decreased by 6.3% in the first quarter of this year after a production fell at Buenavista, IMMSA and Toquepala. This was partially offset by higher production from the Cuajone and Caridad operations. We find silver production increased by 6% in the first quarter of this year mainly due to higher production at our IMMSA facilities.\n Zinc represented 1.4% of our sales value in the first quarter of this year with an average price of $1.25 per pound in the quarter. This is a 28.9% increase in price from the same period of 2020. Zinc mine production decreased by 14.5% quarter-on-quarter to situate at 16,466 tons. This was primarily attributable to lower ore grades at the Santa Barbara operation and Charcas, and to the shutdown of our Santa Eulalia operation in the first quarter of last year due to a severe flooding. Refined zinc production decreased by 35.7% in the first quarter compared to the same period of 2020 due to a fire at the facility. This has temporarily reduced the capacity of our San Luis Potosi\u0301 zinc refinery.\n For our financial results, in the first quarter of 2021, sales were $2.5 billion, which is $812.8 million higher than the sales for the first quarter of 2020. Our sales increased by 47.3% in total. Copper sales volume decreased by 4.5%, while the value increased by 55% due to a scenario of better prices. As I said, copper prices increased by 50.4% during the past quarter.\n Regarding our main byproducts, we reported higher sales of molybdenum by 34.6% mainly due to better prices. Prices increased by 17.1% for molybdenum. And we have for open sales and adjustment that complete the 34.6% increase in molybdenum sales.\n For silver, sales increased by 57.6%, also due to better prices. In this case, prices increased by 55.8%. These results were partially offset by an increasing volume of 3.3% and sales of zinc due to lower volumes of refined zinc. This was partially offset by higher zinc price.\n Our total operating cost and expenses decreased by $5.5 million or 0.5% when compared to the same period of 2020. The main cost reductions were driven by a decrease in copper purchases from third parties and an increasing capitalized leachable material. These cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in workers' participation, an uptick in energy cost due to a temporary gas shortage in Northern Mexico, an increase in the diesel and fuel costs, higher figures for inventory consumption of -- for the quarter. We also had higher depreciation and other factors for a minor value.\n Let me focus on the increasing due to temporary gas shortage that we have in the first quarter. That represented an increase in energy cost of about $30.6 million as a consequence of the temporary scarcity that we had in February of natural gas in the northern part of Mexico.\n Our first quarter '21 adjusted EBITDA was $1,554.5 million, which represented an increase of 116.3% compared to the same period of 2020, where the adjusted EBITDA was $718.8 million. The EBITDA margin in the first quarter of this year was 61.4%, and that compares with 41.8% in the first quarter of last year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, adjusted EBITDA was 24% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n For the cash cost, operating cash cost per pound of copper before byproduct credits was $1.51 per pound in the first quarter of 2021. This is $0.074 higher than the value for the fourth quarter of 2020. This 5.2% increase in operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost and lower premiums, which were partially compensated by lower treatment and refining charges and administrative -- and lower administrative expenses.\n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproduct credit was $0.739 per pound in the first quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.067 higher than the cash cost of $0.672 that we had in the fourth quarter of 2020. That is a 10% increase in cash cost.\n Regarding byproducts, we had a total credit of $393.7 million or $0.771 per pound in the first quarter of this year. These figures represent a 1% increase when compared to a credit of $0.763 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2020. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, silver, gold and sulfuric acid and decreased for zinc.\n Net income attributable to SCC shareholders in the first quarter of this year was $763.8 million, that is 30.2% of our sales or diluted earnings per share of $0.99.\n Capital investments. As you know, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. The conditions generated by COVID-19 have led us to implement measures to reduce vulnerability at the project execution level.\n These measures, which are constantly under review include enforcing social distance rules, strengthening sanitation efforts and requiring quarantine periods for personnel. Some activities in the project execution stage, which are located in regions in Peru or Mexico where new cases of patients are on the rise, have experienced delays. Consequently, we expect some delays, albeit minimal at this point. We expect these delays in the execution of our investment project. Nevertheless, to date, delays primarily affect construction activities that require personnel to work in close physical proximity. All other engineering, procurement and construction activities that entail limited interaction between personnel are on scale.\n In the first quarter of 2021, we spent $232.6 million on capital investments, which represented 130% increase with regard to the same period of 2020 and accounted for 30.5% of our net income. For the Peruvian projects, our portfolio for approved projects in Peru totaled $2.8 billion, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested. If we include the up and coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion budget, and Los Chancas $2.6 million budget, these 2 projects will increase our total investment program in Peru to reflect a commitment of $7.9 billion.\n For Tia Maria, a project that is located in the Peruvian region of Arequipa, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the Islay province population. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activity in the Tambo Valley and suppored growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay.\n On January 7, 2020 (sic) [ 2021 ], this is the past quarter, the mayor of Islay province awarded a City Diploma to Southern Copper in recognition of the company's efforts to assist the population of Islay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Southern Copper provided medical assistant, tests, oxygen, personal protection equipment and food stuff for the population in the area of influence of the Tia Maria project.\n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle.\n During the construction and operation phase, we will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs of which 3,600 are direct and 5,400 are indirect jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria's construction phase. When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs for another 4,200. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contributions to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes.\n We expect the Peruvian government to acknowledge the significant progress the company has made on the social front for this project and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently, take the necessary steps to provide Southern Copper with adequate support to initiate construction.\n For our Mexican projects. In Buenavista, we have a new concentrator to produce the zinc concentrate. Buenavista is our operation at the Sonora state in Mexico. This project includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the basic engineering study and the detailed engineering study is 89% complete.\n In order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 has been put in place. Purchase orders have been placed for major equipment. As part of this process, the mill manufacturing process has been completed and the respective elements are being shipped or are already at the project site. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. We expect to initiate operations in 2023. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs.\n For the Pilares project, also in the Sonora state of Mexico, this is a project that is located 6 kilometers from La Caridad. It consists of an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks has been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit with primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrate. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining 0.78% expected ore from Pilares with the 0.34% ore from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, and we expect the project to begin production in the first quarter of next year.\n El Pilar is a low-capital intensity copper greenfield project, which is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico at about 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 281 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.31% (sic) [ 0.301% ].\n We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. We expect the project to start production in 2023 and the mine life is expected to be 13 years. The results from the experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. The company has started the project basic engineering and site species collection.\n For El Arco, a project that is located at the Baja California peninsula, this is a world-class copper deposit, which is located at the central part of the Baja California peninsula. It has ore reserve of over 2.4 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.422%. And to that, we have 0.3 billion tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.288%. And as a byproduct, the mineral contains 0.11 grams of gold per ton.\n The project considers the construction of an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. The annual production is expected to situate at 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request environmental impact permit. We have had the corresponding mining concessions for several years now. And during 2020, we finished acquiring all the land needed.\n You may have noticed that we are -- we have added a new section to our press release, which tackles the matters of the issues of environmental, social and government -- governance investments or ESG. Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and communicating to the investment community and other stakeholders our progress in this matters.\n  In this regard, the company's sustainable development policies were recently updated. These policies are applicable to SCC and its subsidiaries, formalize the company's vision, commitment and objective to promote sustainable development and generate share value for our stakeholders.\n In 2020, and for the second consecutive year, Southern Copper was listed on the S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Index MILA. Additionally, our score on S&P Global Annual Sustainability Assessment increased to 50 points during the same period. This represents a 5-point increase over the 2019 level.\n In Peru, Southern Copper is coordinating with the Peruvian government and our main oxygen supplier to adapt, which has already been done, our Ilo Oxygen Plant number 2 in record time to produce 140 tons per week of liquid oxygen. What we have done is worked together with the Peruvian government and our main oxygen supply -- industrial oxygen supplier to adjust or to adapt our -- and 1 of our 2 oxygen plants to produce liquid oxygen, plant number 2. Plant number 1 has already been adapted in the past, and it's been -- it has been producing oxygen, but given the need of this element by -- to fight the COVID pandemic, the company decided to move on with this investment.\n The production is being used to supply hospital and medical facilities in Peru's central and southern regions, where medicinal oxygen is extremely scarce. The company has committed to donate 2,500 tons of liquid oxygen, which is equivalent of 194,000 of oxygen tanks of 10 cubic meters each. As of March 31, we have delivered 1,346 tons of liquid oxygen or 53% of the committed donation.\n In addition to this effort, in March, we donated 2 mobile oxygen plants each with a capacity of 720 cubic meters per day of medical oxygen. These plants will be transported to towns that lack sufficient oxygen supply to fight against COVID-19.\n Last year, 3,667 students from 11 educational centers sponsored by the company in Mexico and Peru, we're able to continue their school programs remotely. To cope with the global pandemic, the company's programs, which are developed under the community development model, migrated to virtual platforms. Last year, 4,634 online workshops were held, consolidating a community of over 290,000 users on social networks, which represents an increase of 63% compared to 2019.\n In the first quarter of this year, we continue to roll out remote school programs to provide education to 3,756 school-age students. Alongside these efforts, Southern Copper offered virtual workshops to the community, which has been reproduced more than 10 million tons since the beginning of the pandemic.\n Last year was marked by a good performance in terms of educational safety since no fatalities were registered and accident rates and lost days in the mining division dropped by 44% and 78%, respectively. This compared to 2019.\n Minera Mexico obtained for the second consecutive year, 3 of the 6 distinctions, or Casco de Plata, award by the Mining Chamber of Mexico for occupational health and safety performance. The survey conducted by the Mining Chamber of Mexico, which determines award recipients includes approximately 120 mining companies of different sizes that are grouped into diverse categories, such as open and underground mining, smelting and refining.\n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company's policy to review the company's cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on April 22, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock payable on May 25 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 11, 2021.\n With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the phone for questions. Thank you very much for your question, Timna. Basically, we're maintaining our forecast. Even though we believe that in production, it may be a little bit higher than what we forecast. At the beginning of the year, we mentioned that we're expecting to produce 943,000 tons of copper. At this point, the number looks more like 950,000 tons, but we're still keeping our initial forecast to see how we evolve in that regard through the year.\n Regarding our CapEx, we're also maintaining our budget. Please keep in mind that we will be doing some catch-up of work that we couldn't have done through 2020, and that will certainly require some more activity in that regard. Our current forecast is the same that we had at the beginning of the year, which considers $1.4 billion of capital expenditures for this year, for 2021. Yes. Let me comment on why CapEx is relatively slower than the run rate, as you well mentioned, in your question. The reason for that is that usually, you initiate the process of certain new projects at the beginning of the year once the budget has been approved. And you usually catch up and have a little bit more -- a higher run rate, say, the second half of the year. That's why we're relatively comfortable with maintaining our current capital budget for this year. Obviously, fuel prices are higher now than what we had last year at this time. We had -- in the first quarter, we had a onetime event, which is the scarcity and much higher price for gas, natural gas. That has already passed. We're not seeing that. We are not seeing exchange rate appreciations, both in Mexico and Peru at this point, at least that -- an exchange rate that may impact on our cost at this point, we're not seeing that. And obviously, higher prices that you mentioned may reflect in the future on higher prices for certain materials. But at this point, we are not -- other than fuel, as I mentioned, we're not seeing anything significant at this point. \n Let me add something else to your question, Timna. We increased our cash cost before byproduct credit a little bit. It was $0.074 from what we had at the fourth quarter last year. And that's basically because of the catch-up that the company is doing in certain maintenance and stripping and some other jobs that were postponed at the beginning of 2020 at our operations due to the COVID pandemic.\n At the beginning, we were operating with about 40% of the workforce. That is not the case now. We're very close to 90% in total workforce operation at the corporation in average. And that's basically what we're doing now is catching up in certain maintenance and certain stripping and some other works that were part of 2020 are being done now. That explains the increase that you are seeing in cash cost before byproduct credits. Now we have a much more attractive wind tail (sic) [ tailwind ] coming from the prices of our byproducts as well as the price of copper, which is certainly helping our cash cost this year. Let me start by the second part of your question. I don't -- we don't see a risk at this point on the regulatory front. You and all the audience have seen in Mexico at the beginning of the current administration were some concerns about, well, increasing in taxation or regulatory matters. We don't see that, that has materialized specifically affecting our industry, and we are comfortable with the things as they are now.\n Regarding for the large projects that we have, well, for Tia Maria first, that was the beginning of your question. We are working actually in a very good way with both the civil society, the population, and the authorities. And that is reflected, as I mentioned, in recognition that the company has received from the Mayor of the province of Michiquillay, which is the area where the project is due to the contribution of the company to fight the pandemic. That was a recognition that we received at the beginning of the year. And I think it reflects the improvement that we have been obtaining regarding Tia Maria.\n In the case of the other projects, they take their time. For Michiquillay, we're currently very close to signing a new -- an agreement with the local communities to initiate the exploration for the project. We need to comply also with an environmental -- first environmental study that it's presented to the Peruvian authorities. We already did that. We already presented it at the -- in February of this year. And we're expecting the approval, that usually takes about a little bit more than 2 months. So we're close to the time where we will get their feedback and hopefully, the approval of this environmental -- first environmental study. We may accelerate the project a little bit. If we can, we will do that. But at this point, we are holding to our current forecast for Michiquillay.\n In the case of Los Chancas, we're working currently on the final environmental impact assessment. Good progress has been obtained in that regard. So we're relatively comfortable to how things are moving forward for Los Chancas.\n I think that I covered the 3 major projects that we have already. And we're not moving the start-up date for these projects. For the case of Tia Maria, it is expected to initiate production by 2024; for Los Chancas, it will be in 2027; and Michiquillay, next year, 2028. If we see an opportunity for moving faster with these projects, we'll take it. But first, we will be keen on getting the best project design to have a very competitive operation, which we believe is one of the key elements of the company's success in delivering good results to the investment community and obviously to our shareholders. El Arco will be, yes. El Arco is expected for 2028 as well with Michiquillay. I haven't commented on the Mexican project. Let me do that. I thought that you referred to Peruvian ones, but for El Arco... Yes. For El Arco, it is expected to initiate production by 2028. As we reported, we already have all the necessary land. We finished that process. We have all the concession. So we can move on with the project now with a much more -- in a much more comfortable position than we were in the past. For Pilares, we are expecting, as I said, to initiate it in 2022, and for El Pilar in 2023. Certain work that has to be done in order to have ready the land were the trains and some other facilities will be built will take a while, and that's why we are not moving this. As you well mentioned, it looks like an unusual longer time frame for that. Now there are certain things that we can do and depend also on how the industry is performing, which is, for instance, accelerating the delivery of key critical equipment that could be done, or requesting to build the equipment and deliver it to us on advance. So we have, say, the mills for the concentrator ready to install. And that could save us some deep time. But at this point, that's -- the forecast that we have is as I mentioned, and we want to maintain it. We will report if there is a catch-up in that regard that allow us to reduce the time as we move on with it.\n Please keep in mind that the company has been very, very careful in developing these capital budgets, not only in the fact that they have to be accurate cost wise, capital cost wise, but also in the time line that they should follow. So when we initiate a project, we want to be very, very sure that we will comply with both the time line that we have for the project and the capital budget. That's why if you see our track record, you won't see that the company has failed with the budgets for the project that we have indicated at the construction time. Well, we expect to have our cash cost, that's about where we are now. We think that, as I say, we're catching up with certain works, and we have an unexpected event regarding the gas prices and cost and availability in the first quarter. So that should be removed from now on, that spike in gas prices. And then for the rest of the year, let's say that we're going to focus to have before byproduct credits between $1.50 and $1.55. And well, byproducts will certainly help, given the better prices that they are -- that we're seeing in that regard and the stronger production that we're getting from our molybdenum plants. And also, we expect to have a better zinc production for the rest of the year as we recuperate our zinc refinery and initiate sales of refined zinc for the rest of 2021. The first part of the -- the first quarter -- during the first quarter, we have this fire that affected our facilities. We pretty much repaired most of the damage. But we couldn't produce the forms, the shapes that are required for selling the refined zinc. And that's what we have been working on through this quarter. So we're expecting it to initiate production. And as you may recall, Carlos, we are long in refining capacity at our zinc operations. So we do have some zinc concentrate that will be processed through the second quarter and the rest of the year, and that will allow us to catch up on refined zinc sales for the rest -- for this year. Okay. Thank you for your questions, Carlos. Well, on capital allocation policy, well, that is something that we may consider. But so far, I think that the company track record is quite clear. What we want to do? We basically are developing projects that will maintain the company characteristics of being a low-cost copper producer, probably the lowest cost copper producer, given the size of the company. I mean, among our peers, we believe that we're the lowest cash cost of copper at this point.\n Regarding dividends, as you see, the company is basically not holding cash. Our Board has been increasing our quarterly dividend as we are moving towards a different price of the -- different part of the price cycle and as we have increased our production. Just as a reference for our audience, about 10 years ago, we were producing less than 500,000 tons of copper. Now we are producing about 1 million tons. We have doubled our capacity. Our goal is to go up to 1.8 million tons of copper production in the next -- in this decade. And by doing that, we will keep our copper -- characteristic of being a low-cost producer.\n And your last question, well, we have not -- we don't have a formal internal estimate to how much is the green revolution or the infrastructure package that has -- that is going to be discussed for infrastructure in the U.S. We don't have that information yet. Our commercial team is very positive about this. But -- and I've seen some studies that are doing a forecast that will be extremely favorable for copper producers in the next few years if this materializes. But at this point, we don't have a formal estimate ourselves. Thank you for your question, Ivan. I think that at this point, we don't want to comment on the proposals that the candidates, both of them, are doing regarding the mining industry, in particularly -- particular, because they -- we have seen that the campaigns proceed, the positions not necessarily hold. We have seen that in the past. We believe that once the elected president starts looking at the matters regarding to our industry, he or she will see that we're a partner for the Peruvian development and one of the very strong locomotives that the country could use to go out of the very hard recession that COVID-19 has created in Peru. So at this point, we're not making any specific comment on that. Once we have definition, we will comment on specific measures that will be announced, if any, by the elected president. Yes. As we have indicated to the market, we have 2 smelting projects, one is in Peru and the other one is in Mexico. Let me comment on the Mexican first. We are expecting to initiate these investments later on in this decade. For now, we're considering this project to require certain studies that are being developed, but we don't have this as, let's say, a priority -- specific priority in our expenditures for the future.\n Regarding the Peruvian project, we do have all the economics of the project already reviewed. There is a very interesting concentrate market at the northern part of Chile and the southern part of Peru. And as such, we are considering also an investment for a new smelter for the future.\n Now on the -- as I say, on the economic side, it's -- we have finished the review of the technology to use and the economic results of it. And it's very interesting, very -- actually a very good investment for the company. It has not been approved by our Board. We need to present it to the Board for a formal approval. And also, we need to initiate all the environmental permits for this project. We are considering some investment for this year, but it's related to a cogeneration of power at the Ilo smelter. That's what we're considering this year. And for 2022 and on, we will consider in investing the total budget for projects.\n In the case of Mexico, for the smelter, we're doing technical studies this year, and we will be -- we will consider certain investments on the project for 2022. There is also a very good and very interesting market for concentrates at the northern part of Mexico, not only because we are long in concentrate in Mexico as well as in Peru, but, as I say, there are good opportunities to capture value for smelting in the -- in both Mexico and Peru. Well, certainly, there is always the possibility of saving all the freight that will take the same, say, concentrates from the northern part of Chile, the southern part of Peru to China and the same applies to Mexico. There are U.S. copper concentrates that could go to these smelters as well as our own lone production that we have from the Buenavista operation at this point.\n On the budget, the smelter in Mexico has an estimated budget of $864 million. And for the Peruvian one, it's $1,357 million. That -- those are the budgets. Please keep in mind that these 2 have not been approved by our Board. So they are still under review, technical studies and we don't have a specific goal for them, but it's in our current outlook for the future. Sure. Thank you very much for your questions, Andreas. Well, on the how -- please keep in mind that in 2020 -- in 2019, in May, we initiated the production of the second concentrator of Toquepala. So in 2019, we had 8 months of production of a new facility that has a capacity of 100,000 tons of copper per year. And in 2020, we had that facility running at full speed through the whole year, 12 months. Now as I mentioned a while ago, we -- at the beginning of the pandemic, we cut everything that we could in order to maintain only the concentrators, the smelter, the refinery and the SX-EW operations moving forward.\n In the case of Peru, we were authorized given that our operations are isolated, and we have no cases of COVID at that point at the beginning of the pandemic. We have -- for quite a few months we've been where we didn't have -- most of the year, I would say, we didn't have any outbreaks of COVID inside the premises where our workers and their families live. We had some cases of people that were not staying at the premises, but living say in their houses in Moquegua or Ilo or Tacna.\n So we managed to produce the mineral that our concentrators require. We didn't do any stripping -- any specific stripping works for Toquepala, very little, just necessary to extract the mineral. And that allowed us to maintain our production level while having no cases inside our premises, and having our production to hold. And as I say, we had at the beginning of 2019 in May, in the first -- the second quarter of 2019, we initiated production with the new concentrator of Toquepala. And we had a full year of production, and that explains why we increased our production in 2020 of copper concentrate and copper containing concentrate in this year -- last year.\n Now regarding your question on possible expropriation of mining operations, well, the candidate that expressed that has indicated recently that he is considering more a change in taxation than a change for an expropriation of operations. So we actually don't think that this is going to be a material -- a thing that will be materialized. But as I say, we will see as we have a new president and this person takes the measures that he or she believes are the appropriate one for the country. Okay. Thank you for your question, Fernando. Well, we have 3 projects that are being under developed in Mexico. We have a budget -- a combined budget of a little bit north of $900 million. These projects were okay, generally speaking, particularly Pilares, it's pretty much finished. We are looking into some details to initiate production. And we expect to have it -- there is a good possibility that we advance a little bit production for Pilares. That's one of the comments that I think it's important to share.\n Now El Pilar, it's moving forward. We are on a technical studies part of the project. So on that, we can move on with no problems at all. The one that we're affected a little bit by the pandemic is the zinc concentrator at Buenavista. We are expecting the final vaccination of people over 60 years in the area where the project is, and we expect that to be a starting point for coming back into operation at the zinc concentrator, meaning by this construction of the zinc concentrator will be -- will take some speed as the Mexican government finished distributing the shots of vaccines in Cananea. We reported on that, on a very promising activity conducted by Sonora government, which we certainly see as a very positive development.\n The company is constantly looking into different opportunities to acquire assets that fit the company characteristic of being a low-cost operation. And we are looking basically on copper, which is -- we believe it's a metal that has an excellent forecast for the next few years. So we're focusing on that. Obviously, if conditions are better in some other countries that will be attractive for us to get in, and there is a good project to developing there, we will certainly -- the first thing will be that our asset management will have to study this in detail, and give a recommendation to our Board, which will, at the end of the day, they will take the decision of moving into these kind of acquisitions or some other activities in places where we see opportunities. Alfonso, could you -- I can't copy you. Could you approach a little bit to your microphone, please? Much better. Thank you. I couldn't get your -- the final part of your second question, Alfonso. Well, let me first answer your first question on the increased capacity in Toquepala, I will say that we are at the optimal capacity level for this operation nowadays. Keep in mind that we pretty much doubled the concentrating capacity of Toquepala in 2019. So it's a fresh investment, so we feel happy and comfortable with that.\n In the case of Cuajone, we have now a lower mining rate on a daily basis for the Cuajone mine, and we're currently looking into possible expansion of the Cuajone operation to put it at the same median level of the Peru -- of the Toquepala operation also in Peru. That is a project that is -- that has been -- resources have been assigned to review this expansion. We're looking into ways to increase our water recovery, which will be an important step in order to go on with the Cuajone expansion. So with that, we may increase our production capacity in Peru a little bit more.\n Regarding the mining reform in Mexico, well, I think that we need to see how political circumstances evolve in Mexico as well. But at this point and for what we have seen through -- since the beginning of the new administration, we haven't seen any specific actions other than... \nOscar Gonza\u0301lez Rocha: Raul. Yes? \nOscar Gonza\u0301lez Rocha: Yes. This is Oscar. Can I mention that there was some -- okay. There was some reform last year to the special mining tax, some changes where there was a reduction on the concession fees that could be credited to the special mining tax. And also some adjustments that the government did to the concessions and how that special tax was paid. So there was some reform last year addressing some issues that the government felt the mining industry wasn't managing well with the special mining tax. So there was some, and it's having -- it affects this year and increase special mining tax. I couldn't get your question. Sorry, jean, could you repeat it please? Okay. Yes. Thank you for your questions. As you have seen, we have a section on ESG at our press release, and we will keep it as we move on. We believe that one of the -- there are 2 things that we have been doing lately in the last few years, actually. One is, well, we did a gap analysis on what we need to do in order to improve our ESG metrics for now and the future. And that is a corporate effort that we are moving forward with. And we believe that part of this effort should be on the communication side to express and to show the different progress that we're getting on this matter as we move on. You will see these metrics as we report them in the next few quarters.\n Now regarding, well, green bonds are obviously an interesting source of funds for the future, and we will consider them if we go to the capital market as an option, and that's part of what we're doing is communicating what we are doing and catching up in whatever we feel that there is an opportunity to improve on ESG metrics. Thank you very much, Jenny. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's First Quarter 2021 Results. We certainly appreciate your participation, and hope you -- and hope to have you back with us when we report the second quarter of this year. Thank you very much and stay well, all of you. Thank you very much again."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation's Fourth Quarter and 2022 Full Results Conference Call. With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the past quarter and year 2022 as well as answer any questions that you might have. \n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP. \n Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Gigi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter of 2022 and Full Year Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board member as well as Mr. Javier Garcia de Careo and Leonardo Contreras, both also federal Board members. \n In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Before we get to the agenda of today's meeting, let me say that 2022 was a very challenging year for us. We faced some difficulties in the economies where we operate, which have tested our strength and ability to operate at competitive terms. On top of lower metal prices and inflation, we had to deal with the 54 days to a hundred stoppage in the first half of 2022.\n Nonetheless, we have for severe, bolstered by the resilience of our workforce, SEC's strength and our strong financial position. Evidence of our quality can be seen when we compare the fourth quarter of 2022 were the third quarter of the same year. Net sales were in the fourth quarter, 31% over the same period. Consistent with these positive results, the operating cash cost per pound of copper, including byproduct revenue credits was $0.45 per pound. This is 57% lower than the $1.03 we reported in the third quarter of 2022. \n On December 7 of last year, the Peruvian Congress invoked its power under the constitution and removed President Pedro Castillo from office. Mrs. Dina Boluarte, the Vice President, immediately assumed the presidency -- these fast-moving events led to considerable upheaval, particularly in the south of Peru, where acts of vandalism ambient has escalated. Road blocks are scattered through the country -- throughout the country, which has natively affected the normal course of business in various regions. \n Fortunately, our operations has not been impacted. SEC hopes that the government will take clear actions to restore order to take the rights of all citizens and set the stage for a peaceful solution to process, so that Peru can resume growth and achieve the development it deserves. \n For 2023, we continue to focus on growth, and we expect to deliver or to La Caridad concentrator from the Pilares mine in the second quarter of this year. This will contribute with 35,000 tons of copper annually. \n Additionally, the new zinc concentrator at Buenavista is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2023, generating 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. Now let us focus on the copper market. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased 18% from an average $4.40 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $3.63 per pound, reflecting these concerns about a possible recession in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by good news on a positive Chinese recovery. Current prices for copper are over $4.10 per pound, reflecting a relatively more positive outlook for this market. \n We believe this is due to the following factors: a reduction in global inflation, which may slow down or even stop eventually, the interest rate hike cycle led by the Fed and the European Central Bank. The turnaround in China's policies regarding COVID-19 after the government embraced proven practices. Stimulus measures have been implemented also in China to show up a weak real estate market. \n The most relevant market intelligence houses for the copper market are expecting a market balance or a small surplus for 2023. This assumes a growth in demand of about between 2% and 3% this year. Uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, which together represent about 40% of the global supply. \n Low copper inventories, which stood at 241,000 tons as of December of 2022. These low inventories represent about 3.5 days of consumption, an extremely low level by copper inventories, I mean here, the addition of the London Metal Exchange, the Comex, the Shanghai, and the bonded warehouses in China. \n It is important to emphasize that copper plays a leading role in the global shift to clean energy, which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper will be strong in the long term. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and the year 2022. Copper represented 70% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. Copper production registered an increase of 1.6% in the fourth quarter to stand at 241,273 tons. Our quarterly results reflect a 4% increase in production in Peru and flat growth in production in Mexico. \n On a year-on-year basis, copper production fell 6.6% in 2022 and totaled 894,703 tons. This figure was nonetheless, 0.5 percentage point higher than our adjusted year plan of 890,000 tons. With the exception of the Buenavista operation, where production levels were higher than those registered in 2021, a decrease in yearly copper production was reported by our other open pit operations due to a temporary drop in ore grades and to the Cuajone stoppage, which reduced this platform, our 2022 production by 22,208 tons. \n Compared to the third quarter, Copper production increased 4.7%, which was mainly attributable to our growth in production at all the open pit operations. For 2023, we expect to produce 925,800 tons of copper, an increase of about 4% over the 2022 final trend. \n This growth will unfold as we get Peruvian production back on track, which coupled with new production in our Mexican operations through our Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrator project. Bollesen represented 18% of the company sales value in the fourth quarter of last year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $21.17 per pound in the quarter compared to $18.53 in the fourth quarter of 2021. This represents an increase of 14% in prices. \n Molybdenum production decreased by 16% in the fourth quarter of 2021 -- '22 when compared to the same period of 2021. This was mainly driven by a drop in production at the Toquepala mine due to lower ore grades. These results were partially offset by higher production at Cuajone and Buenavista. Molybdenum production fell 13% year-on-year in 2022 after production fell at Toquepala, Cuajone, and La Caridad. This was partially offset by an increase at the Buenavista mine. For 2023, we expect to produce 22,200 tons of molybdenum. Current money prices are over $35 per pound. We believe that prices will be supported by global supply shortages and a strong demand in China and the U.S. Silver represented 4% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of last year with an average price of $21.25 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected a decrease of 9%. \n Silver is currently our second by-product. Mine silver production increased 10% in the fourth quarter versus the same period of 2021 and serve production rose at Ina, Buenavista, Cuajone and Toquepala. This was partially offset by a decrease in production at La Caridad. Refined silver production fell by 1% year-over-year, which was mainly driven by a drop in production at our IMS and Hilo refineries. \n In 2022, we produced 18.6 million ounces of silver, which represents a 2% decrease with regard to the 2021 figure. This was mainly due to a drop in production at Cocapala, Cuajone and Caridad that was partially offset by an increase in production at the Buenavista and insane.  In 2023, we expect to produce 20.5 million ounces of silver. This is an increase of 10% compared to 2022 and higher than the 19 million ounces produced in 2021, higher by 8% when you compare that to 2021 as well. \n Zinc represented 3% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of last year with an average price of $1.36 per pound in the quarter, which represents an 11% decrease with regard to the fourth quarter of 2021 figure. Zinc is currently our third by-product. Zinc mine production decreased 7% quarter-on-quarter and total 15,263 tons. This was driven primarily by a drop in production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara mine. Refined zinc production increased by 26% in the fourth quarter of 2022 when compared to the same period of 2021. \n For the year 2022, we produced 6,010 tons of zinc, a decrease of 10% compared to 2021 that was mainly attributable to a drop in production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara operations. This was partially offset by increases in production at the San Martin, mine. Refining production increased 8% in year-over-year terms. For 2023, we expect to produce 116,800 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 95% over our 2022 production level. This growth will be driven by production start-up at the Buenavista zinc operations. The Buenavista zinc concentrator will add 51,600 tons of zinc to our production and also by the recovery of the Insamines that will add 6,200 tons. In the case of the ISA mines, we have identified better ore areas for the -- in the different mines. And we are contributing with a much higher production for this year coming from the inside. \n For the year 2024 and on, we expect to produce over 200,000 tons of zinc per year. Financial results. For the fourth quarter of 2022, sales were $2.8 billion, which is similar to the level reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Copper sales volume increased by 2%, while value decreased after prices drop for this metal. \n Regarding our main by-products, we reported higher sales of molybdenum that increased by 65% due to better prices. This was partially offset by a drop in molybdenum volume. Zinc sales were up by 26% due to an increase in volume of 38%, which was partially offset by lower prices. Silver sales were down in the fourth quarter by 0.5 percentage point due to lower prices. This evolution was partially offset by an uptick in silver volume. \n Comparing the fourth quarter of 2022, with the third quarter of last year, as I said in the fourth quarter, Sales totaled $2.8 billion. This represented an increase of [ 663 million ] over the figure reported in the third quarter of the past year. This is a 31% increase in sales. \n The copper sales volume saw 1% while value increased by 23% in a scenario of better prices. Regarding our main by-products, we registered higher sales of molybdenum for 138% due to an increase in the volume and better prices. Molybdenum is were also favored by provisional price adjustments of $92.6 million. Silver sales increased by 26% due to an uptick in the volume and in prices. And since sales fell 7% due to lower prices. This drop was partially offset by an increase in the volume of 4%. \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $157 million or 12% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The main cost increment has been in higher inventory consumption, workers' participation, repair materials, diesel and fuel, explosives and sales expenses. These cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in leachable material costs, translation difference, labor cost. \n Our total operating cost and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022, increased by $80 million or 6% in comparison with the third quarter of last year. The main cost increments has been in workers' participation, purchased copper, sales expenses, operating and repair materials, higher inventory consumption, and contractors. These cost increases were partially offset by a drop in the energy cost and the effect of translation difference and other factors. \n The fourth quarter of 2022 adjusted EBITDA was 1,647 million, which represented a decrease of 5% with regard to the 1,726 million registered in the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of last year was 58% versus 61% in the fourth quarter of 2021. \n For the year 2022, EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA was $5,365 million. This is 22% below the figure of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 was 53% versus 63% in 2021. Operating cash cost per ton of copper before byproduct credits was $2.04 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022. That is $0.25 lower than the value for the third quarter of last year. This 1% decrease in operating cash cost was driven by a drop in cost per pound from higher production that was partially offset by an increase in treatment and refining charges, administrative expenses, and a decrease in the premiums received by our refined Corp. \n Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credit, was $0.45 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022. This cash cost was $0.59 lower than the cash cost of $1.03 reported in the third quarter of 2022. This is a 47% reduction. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $806 million or $1.59 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022. These figures represent a 55% increase over the $501 million or $1.03 per pound reported in the third quarter of last year. \n Total credits have increased for molybdenum, silver and silver and decreased for zinc and sulfuric acid. -- byproduct credit has benefited from the adjustment on open molybdenum sales of $93 million, which represented an extra cash credit of $0.18 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022. \n Net income in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $902 million, which represented an 8% increase with regarded $833 million registered in the fourth quarter of 2021. The net income margin in the fourth quarter of last year was 32% versus 30% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Let me point out that net income in the fourth quarter of last year reflected a 74% increase with regard to the $519 million registered in the third quarter of last year. \n For the full year 2022, net income was $ 2,638 million which is 22% lower than the mark for 2021. The net income margin in 2022 was 26% versus 31% in 2021. Cash from operations. Cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $1,082 million, which represented an increase of 83% over the $590 million posted in the third quarter of 2022 and a decrease of 12% over the 1,220 million posted in the fourth quarter of 2021. Looking into capital investments. As you know, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. So the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. \n Our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and include investments in the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar, and El Arco projects in Mexico, and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas, and Michiquillay projects in Peru. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of the El Arco projects.\n In 2022, we spent $948 million in capital investment, which reflected a 6% increase year-on-year and represented 36% of net income in 2020. For our Mexican projects, we have the Buenavista zinc concentrator in the Sonora state. This project is located between the Buenavista deposit. And we are building now a new concentrator to process zinc. This facility has a production capacity of 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. \n We have completed the engineering study and the proving has all the necessary permits. When operating, this facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide more than 2,000 operational jobs. As I mentioned before, we're expecting for this year a significant contribution of -- on the zinc production, over 50,000 tons and for 2024, [ anounover ] 200,000 tons of addition for zinc production for the comp. \n Well, for as a project update, the capital budget for the project is $416 million, most of which has already been invested. We expect to initiate product operations in the second half of 2023 at this point. The Pilares project is located 6 kilometers from La Caridad. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with another production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper is concentrated. This project will significantly improve the oral mineral ore grade, considering the 0.78% expected from Pilares and the 0.29% from La Calia. \n Project update. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, most of which has already been in -- the project is currently operating and delivering copper mineral oxides to the SX-EW facilities of the La Caridad operation. We expect to produce mineral for the La Caridad concentrator at full capacity in the second quarter of 2023. \n El Pilar. This is a low capital-intensive copper greenfield project, which is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 317 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.25%. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for Pilar is $310 million. \n Project update. The results from experimental paths in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study is finished and the company continue to develop the project and engage in all site environmental activities. The SX-EW plant EPCM project contract has been awarded to a contractor and has started. We expect production to begin in 2024, and mine life is estimated at 13 years. \n El Arco, it's a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula with all reserves of over 1,230 million tons with an average ore grade of 0.4% and 141 million tons of leach material with an average ore grade of 0.27%. The project includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations, and our production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold per year. \n Project update. The company has completed the environmental baseline study for the mine and industrial facilities and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. For the Peruvian projects, we have the Tia Maria project, which is a greenfield project located in Arequipa in the Arequipa region in Peru. This project will use the state-of-the-art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards to produce 120,000 tons of refined copper capital per year. The estimated capital budget for the project is $1.4 billion. \n Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of this life province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of events in the region. We have also promoted agriculture and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in a -- in the case of Los Chancas, we have a project update that is the following. As of December 31 of 2022, part of the project's plan continue to be occupied by illegal miners, some of whom have irregularly registered their stakes in the integral registry of mining formalization, known in Spanish [indiscernible]. \n The company has filed criminal complaints and other legal remedies which have new claims of 70 illegal miners were while 5 cases remain open. You can see it's quite a minor number, and we hope that we will solve this problem shortly. \n For the Michiquillay project, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company informed MINEM that it has begun exploration activities and initiated an assessment of the existing mineral resource at depth. In 2022, in accordance with our social agreements with the Michiquillay and La Enca\u00f1ada communities, the company hired unskilled labor and pay for the use of surface land. SCC will continue to make surface land payments in 2023 and plans to support social programs in both communities as it rolls out additional exploration activities. \n For environmental, social and governance investments, Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and informing the investment community and other stakeholders about our progress in this matter. Give me for , please -- in line with best practice, the Board of Directors has approved the formation of a new sustainability committee shared by an independent director. \n The purpose of this committee is to support the Board of Directors of Southern Copper Corporation in developing and monitoring the company's compliance with ongoing commitments to environment, health, safety, communities, human rights and corporate goes. This is a significant step in our pledge to a robust and strong ESG performance. \n The Sustainable Development Committee held several sessions in the fourth quarter of 2022. During these meetings, our counselors review our advances in terms of our main performance indicator and gave us recommendations for the climate change strategy we are building. \n Progress on the corporate sustainability assessment front. S&P Global increased SEC's rating by 13% year-on-year in its corporate sustainability assessment 2022. This situates the company among the top 8% of best performance in the mining sector and places SEC 50% above the average rate. These results reflect the upward trend the company is experiencing in the rem of sustainability and reaffirm SEC's listing in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the Latin American integrated market, known as Mila. This is for the fourth consecutive year in which we achieve -- are considering these listings. \n Our ongoing improvement has been driven by positive performance in areas such as cybersecurity, water management, operations closure, occupational safety and health, among others. The open-pit mine of La Caridad and the Sonora metallurgical complex, both smelter refinery at this context, received copper mark certification. Both units were addressed -- assessed by this independent assurance system to demonstrate that SEC copper is produced responsibly and highlight the company's contribution to achieving the sustainable development goals of the United Nations in 5 main areas: the business and human rights, community, working conditions, environment and governance. SE's goal is to ensure that copper production at all of our units meet Copper Mark criteria. \n Additionally, La Caridad received the molybdenum mark. The aforementioned pilot programs were implemented by Copper Mark and the International Molybdenum Association. So producers have a framework of reference to the most leadership with regard to sustainability and responsible production practices. --occupational safety, the mining chamber of commerce of Mexico coming next and the national accounting to regulate and certify workplace practices, Konasel, awarded first place to the rescue class of the Charcas and Santa Barbara units in the categories of underground NRiskerQ and first age, respectively, the framework of the 6 national competition of underground mining rescues, first aid and hazard dose materials. \n Fundacion Grupo Mexico organized a volunteer day, which was attended by 8,000 volunteers in 13 states of Mexico and 5 regions of Peru. Efforts benefit more than 40 institutions near our operations with a focus on improving the quality of life at the community, family and environment levels. \n Dividend announced. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company's policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate orderly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on January 26, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock payable on March 1 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14 of this year. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end up our presentation today -- thank you very much for joining us. We would like to now open the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy from Barclays. \nMatthew Murphy: I have a question about your CapEx estimates for long-term projects. I'm wondering if we should be adjusting those for inflation. I noticed Grupo Mexico's disclosures, used to talk about investments of $10 billion in long-term projects, and that's now $15 billion, including EL Arco infrastructure. So I'm just wondering what has changed there and how it might impact the CapEx spending profile in the next few years? \nRaul Jacob: Well, the figure that I mentioned, the $15 million refers to what we expect to spend in the next 10 years. Let me correct what I just said, through the second, up to 2030. We have been adjusting some of our budgets. We have been including some new expenditures related to our projects. And that's basically what we're thinking. Let me give you the estimate of CapEx that we have for the next 5 years that will be -- that will give some color on what we are seeing now. For this year, we're expecting to spend $1.1 billion in capital for next year, 2 billion, 2025, $1.8 billion, 2026, 2.5 billion and 2027, $2.8 billion. \nMatthew Murphy: Okay. And the -- just the timing of the projects. So Los Chancas and Michiquillay have been pushed out, I guess, 3 years. And can you just address the reason for those changes? And how that reflects in the CapEx budget? Has there been sort of any reordering of your project pipeline? \nRaul Jacob: No, not at the ordering, but we have been looking into the projects, seeing how have they advanced. In the case of Los Chancas, for instance, we have this problem that we have been building of illegal mining inside the concession that we are very close to solve that has stopped as our work in this project for a while, even though we have been doing some cabinet work regarding the environmental permitting for Los Chancas, but that has affected somehow our forecast. And in the case of Michiquillay, given the delay that we had in signing the social contracts and beginning the exploration season that we are currently doing, we decided to make an adjustment on the time lines for these 2 projects. That's why we moved a little bit start--to the start-up for both of them. \n Obviously, if we see opportunities to advance them in time, we'll take that and inform when appropriate. But that's currently -- this is our view on the projects. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. \nTimna Tanners: I wanted to ask just a follow-up on the CapEx detail. Does that include a potential Kuoni expansion? And does it include TM Maria? So can you quantify those a bit, please. \nRaul Jacob: For now, it does not include the Cuajone expansion, Timna, and it does include Tia Maria. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. One about... \nRaul Jacob: Let me add that we expect to have that through this year, we expect to have more clarity on the Cuajone project and will inform to the market regarding that. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. Excellent. Molybdenum has obviously been an outperformer and you see continued strength there. Your run rate in Q4 is higher than what you're calling for into 2023. I'm just wondering, broadly, if you can help us understand that change. And also are there opportunities to maybe shift production a little higher or shift your focus there a bit given the better outlook in May? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Well, molybdenum have surprises on the positive side, given the price that we're seeing now are $35 per pound which is much, much higher than what we had -- we reported a little bit more than $21 per pound for the fourth quarter. So if you do the math, it's over 50% of price increase for molybdenum. \n We are looking into ways to produce a little bit more. As you know, our mining plans are made considering copper, the main product, that there are always opportunities to improve a little bit the production of ore products. And in this case, we're certainly taking a good look into how can we produce a little bit more molybdenum without affecting our copper forecast for 2023 and on. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. Excellent. If I could just one more. There's a lot of questions we're getting about the implications to Southern Copper of Grupo Mexico's reported bid for Banamex. Is that something that you can comment on one way or another? It would be very helpful. \nRaul Jacob: I think that, that question should be posed to Grupo Mexico. But from our side, we haven't seen any -- we have nothing to report about that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriel Simoes from Goldman Sachs. \nGabriel Simoes: So the first one would be -- it'd be interesting to hear your thoughts on the realized prices for the quarter, not only for copper, but also for the audio commodities as well. So may I get here be to understand what drove the much better than expected prices that we saw as the benchmark prices did grow as much as what as implied in your numbers. So was that a matter of timing for the sales of molybdenum for anything? Are there any other effects that you'd like to highlight here? And the second question is regarding costs, right? So the cost of for byproducts are already decreasing. So we already saw the tree this quarter as we were guiding for, but they're still above with $2 per ton mark. So my question is then, has something changed in your outlook for costs? Or should we expect costs to continue changing downward towards the $1.9 per pound that you spoke about earlier last year... \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Let me start by the last -- your second question on cost. Well, what we're seeing in the fourth quarter and now is that some of the much higher cost that we had before are somehow adjusting downward, particularly in the case of gas still explosive a little bit and -- but mainly this -- that's where we're seeing some adjustments -- some reductions put differently. We, at the same time, we'll be increasing our production from 895,000 tons last year to 926,000 tons this year. So that should have a positive benefit in our cash cost before byproduct credits. We expect it to be -- well, about 2 -- a little bit more than $2 and hopefully, less than $2 as we go through 2023. \n For the byproducts, we are expecting -- well, as you have -- we talked a little bit on molybdenum before. These prices are supported by a combination of higher demand as well as some supply surpass of primary production or primary mines of molybdenum that are having some travel in China and some other locations. \n For zinc, well, we are very positive on the market. The price currently is over $1.50 per pound, which is much higher than what we have been recording in the last -- in the fourth quarter. We are seeing a very good zinc demand for refinancing -- and we are obviously very encouraged by the beginning of our new concentrator that will produce about 100,000 tons of zinc per year and 20,000 tons of copper and some silver as well. \n So those are positive news for us. We see good demand for zinc, and we're happy on delivering, hopefully, on the third quarter at full speed, the thing a new facility for zinc production. And we also see on the positive side, the fact that our into mines are turning into -- or getting into a better ore grade area where we will have some more production. \n Now for gold and silver, I think that it's much more complicated to make a forecast, so I will stop in there. I have mentioned that we have a very good sulfuric acid sales in both volume and prices in 2002 and '22. So I expect this -- well, even though prices are not as good as the average of last year, we're still seeing a very positive market for sulfuric acid sales in 2023  \n [Technical Difficulty] \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alfonso Salazar from Scotiabank. \nAlfonso Salazar: One question on production. As you mentioned, production for 2023 copper production. Can you give us the outlook or your expectations for the years, '24 to '27. And the second one is on El Arco. It seems to me that once again, El Arco from the big projects that you have in the pipeline is becoming the one that can move faster. So just wondering if this is the case? And also, if you can talk about the challenges that you see ahead, especially environmental ones, it will require an operation of an open pit mine and also infrastructure, the legal challenges, anything that you can mention about the El Arco, please. \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Thank you for your question, Alfonso. The forecast that we have for the next 5 years is the following: for 2023, as I said, [ 126,000 ] tons, 2024 1,061,000 tons, at 2025 1,021,000 tons, 2026 1,108,000 tons and 2027 1,070,000 tons -- regarding El Arco, well, it is a very good project. We're working in it. We have secured all the land that is required for the project. We are -- we have been looking into the infrastructure that is required for the project to move on. And we're on that process as well as looking into the environmental permitting that we require for the project. \n Obviously, in some of these permits, there are certain challenges that we have to overcome. But we are very positive. So this is actually a very good project, and we believe that we can -- we will be able to develop it at a good pace at a certain point in time... \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos from Very Independent Research. \nJohn Tumazos: Could you refresh my memory -- in Peru, there's a statutory requirement to share a certain amount of profits with the employees, labor participation. Could you please just refresh my memory as to that formula and review your social programs in Peru and some of the programs associated with your 3 major projects, I think that maybe there's -- could even be a short line in railroad, for example, with TM Maria. And then help us to explain the communications efforts to the community to understand these benefits and advance your projects for permitting and social license and community approval. We know you work very hard on these things. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you for your question, John. Let's start by profit sharing. We have legally in both Mexico and Peru to have a profit sharing program. In Peru, it's 8% of profit before taxes. In Mexico, it's 10% of profit before taxes. The Mexico has some adjustment given on the fact that you need to take a 3-year -- the average of 3 years for giving the benefit to the labor force, but that's basically how it works. \n In the case of our social programs, let me point out first that we are in an area of the country with currently, there is some social uphill. And our operations are -- has been not affected by them so far, and we are making significant efforts to maintain them, as I said, just in good shape and operating at full capacity as we are right now. That's for the current operations of our 2 mines and our metallurgical complex. \n In the case of our projects, we have been in the last few years developing several programs on the social front in order to maintain a good relationship with the local communities or population. In some cases, we don't have a community that is nearby, but population. That's the case, for instance, of the Kia Maria project, where we have the slight province population, and there are no communities. \n For the other 2 projects for Los Chancas and Michiquillay, we do have communities in the case of Los Chancas 2 communities in both cases, 2 communities, also for the Michiquillay. In the case of Los Chancas, we had an incident last year where group of illegal miners going to our concession and fire our facilities in there. We have been working to recuperate our operational capacity for the project. \n I'd like to point out that we have evidence that no members of the communities participated in these Violin Act. It was driven by a group of people that want to develop in legal activities, mining legal mining in this area. We proceed to put all the legal tools that we have and to both retire these people from our premises, which over 75, we already managed to work with 70 of them canceling by the government, their permit to do mining. And obviously, they were proceeding illegally and doing these activities in our concession of first chunk. \n So there are 5 cases remaining, and then we will be able to recuperate the pace that we have lost a little bit on this pad. In the case of Michiquillay, last year, we signed social contracts with the 2 communities that are over there. These social contracts have several initiatives, some programs for hiring for the work of the project, for instance, for the exploration efforts -- we can -- we have a commitment on hiring local people from the 2 communities. \n We have also a program to recognize some rental for the use of certain facilities in these areas. And we are basically moving forward with these programs that have some other initiatives that we're considering. So that's basically where we are. But on top of that, we have been -- we have several programs that are very, very interesting and very powerful that we're using in our own current operations of Toquepala and Cuajone and we're extending them to the 3 projects that I just mentioned. \n For instance, we have project that developed certain abilities or, for instance, heavy weight machinery operation, electricity and some other civil works that can -- that are trained. We have programs to train people on this kind abilities. And with that, we can hire them for different jobs inside our operations as well as for the project. \n So all of this and mainly having a good communication standard with the communities is helping us to maintain these areas, we believe moving forward for a better development and to have these projects being successful over time. \nJohn Tumazos: If I could follow up, please, in Peru or in Mexico, roughly -- in very round numbers, how much is the statutory profit sharing per employee when copper is $4 in cash costs or $0.45, it must be very wonderful. \nRaul Jacob: For Peru, this year should be about -- let me put it in terms of monthly salaries, about 5% or a little bit more monthly salaries this year as a profit sharing. In Mexico, the number varies, but it's depending on the different operations, but it's also a very attractive profit sharing as well. \nJohn Tumazos: So when you say 5, you mean it's 5x the base salary. \nRaul Jacob: 5x the monthly salary. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hernan Kisluk from MetLife. \nHern\u00e1n Kisluk: It's related to the revenues of the quarter. So if I do the... \nRaul Jacob: Sorry, I can -- I can't copy you well. \nHern\u00e1n Kisluk: Yes. Can you think me better now? \nRaul Jacob: Much better. \nHern\u00e1n Kisluk: Okay. So my question is regarding revenues. So if I do the math for the quarter, multiplying the volume sold of each product by the reference price, I still have a very big gap compared to the reported revenues of about $450 million. So I would like to know if there is any kind of effects like provisional pricing or things like that, that are distorting the revenue for the quarter? \nRaul Jacob: Well, it's not distorting, but we're recognizing the value of the sales that we have at open safe. In the case of molybdenum, for instance, the adjustment on open sales, it's using the last price quoted by the market. It's a little bit -- it's almost $32. That's why we had a significant adjustment of over $92 million for molybdenum. Then we have some other revenue sources that are usually not some overlook such as forecasted revenues, we had a very good sulfuric acid prices through this past quarter and in the year that have been benefit the corporation. So those are the ones that have been -- that have been increasing our revenues in the fourth quarter of this year. \nHern\u00e1n Kisluk: Okay. And is there something of this effect on the copper side of the business? Or is it just modified on other product... \nRaul Jacob: No, no, no. There is also an adjustment on operating copper open sales but in the copper sales, we do have future curve while in molybdenum, we just have the price at the end of the month, there is no future prices for molybdenum. So in copper, we do have also an adjustment that is not as significant as the $92 million that I just mentioned.\n Yes. But let me comment a little bit on the revenues other than molybdenum. A moment thank you -- mainly, it's on molybdenum copper, zinc the ones that have been better in the case of zinc, it was more volume than anything else in molybdenum price and the open sales adjustment. So that's basically the -- so for cat that was an important driver of revenues. So over for -- just to give you an idea, in 2021, we had $83 million of sales so forecasted in 2022, the number went up $212 million. So there you have a significant chunk, $130 million of additional revenues on the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Camilla Barder for Bradesco BBI. \nCamilla Barder: My question have just been address. Thank you. \nOperator: At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Victor Pedraglio for closing remarks. \nVictor Pedraglio: It's going to be me, thank you. [indiscernible] Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter of 2022 and full year results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the first quarter of 2023. Thank you very much, and have a nice day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Gigi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter of 2022 and Full Year Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board member as well as Mr. Javier Garcia de Careo and Leonardo Contreras, both also federal Board members. \n In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Before we get to the agenda of today's meeting, let me say that 2022 was a very challenging year for us. We faced some difficulties in the economies where we operate, which have tested our strength and ability to operate at competitive terms. On top of lower metal prices and inflation, we had to deal with the 54 days to a hundred stoppage in the first half of 2022.\n Nonetheless, we have for severe, bolstered by the resilience of our workforce, SEC's strength and our strong financial position. Evidence of our quality can be seen when we compare the fourth quarter of 2022 were the third quarter of the same year. Net sales were in the fourth quarter, 31% over the same period. Consistent with these positive results, the operating cash cost per pound of copper, including byproduct revenue credits was $0.45 per pound. This is 57% lower than the $1.03 we reported in the third quarter of 2022. \n On December 7 of last year, the Peruvian Congress invoked its power under the constitution and removed President Pedro Castillo from office. Mrs. Dina Boluarte, the Vice President, immediately assumed the presidency -- these fast-moving events led to considerable upheaval, particularly in the south of Peru, where acts of vandalism ambient has escalated. Road blocks are scattered through the country -- throughout the country, which has natively affected the normal course of business in various regions. \n Fortunately, our operations has not been impacted. SEC hopes that the government will take clear actions to restore order to take the rights of all citizens and set the stage for a peaceful solution to process, so that Peru can resume growth and achieve the development it deserves. \n For 2023, we continue to focus on growth, and we expect to deliver or to La Caridad concentrator from the Pilares mine in the second quarter of this year. This will contribute with 35,000 tons of copper annually. \n Additionally, the new zinc concentrator at Buenavista is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2023, generating 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. Now let us focus on the copper market. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased 18% from an average $4.40 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $3.63 per pound, reflecting these concerns about a possible recession in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by good news on a positive Chinese recovery. Current prices for copper are over $4.10 per pound, reflecting a relatively more positive outlook for this market. \n We believe this is due to the following factors: a reduction in global inflation, which may slow down or even stop eventually, the interest rate hike cycle led by the Fed and the European Central Bank. The turnaround in China's policies regarding COVID-19 after the government embraced proven practices. Stimulus measures have been implemented also in China to show up a weak real estate market. \n The most relevant market intelligence houses for the copper market are expecting a market balance or a small surplus for 2023. This assumes a growth in demand of about between 2% and 3% this year. Uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, which together represent about 40% of the global supply. \n Low copper inventories, which stood at 241,000 tons as of December of 2022. These low inventories represent about 3.5 days of consumption, an extremely low level by copper inventories, I mean here, the addition of the London Metal Exchange, the Comex, the Shanghai, and the bonded warehouses in China. \n It is important to emphasize that copper plays a leading role in the global shift to clean energy, which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper will be strong in the long term. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter and the year 2022. Copper represented 70% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. Copper production registered an increase of 1.6% in the fourth quarter to stand at 241,273 tons. Our quarterly results reflect a 4% increase in production in Peru and flat growth in production in Mexico. \n On a year-on-year basis, copper production fell 6.6% in 2022 and totaled 894,703 tons. This figure was nonetheless, 0.5 percentage point higher than our adjusted year plan of 890,000 tons. With the exception of the Buenavista operation, where production levels were higher than those registered in 2021, a decrease in yearly copper production was reported by our other open pit operations due to a temporary drop in ore grades and to the Cuajone stoppage, which reduced this platform, our 2022 production by 22,208 tons. \n Compared to the third quarter, Copper production increased 4.7%, which was mainly attributable to our growth in production at all the open pit operations. For 2023, we expect to produce 925,800 tons of copper, an increase of about 4% over the 2022 final trend. \n This growth will unfold as we get Peruvian production back on track, which coupled with new production in our Mexican operations through our Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrator project. Bollesen represented 18% of the company sales value in the fourth quarter of last year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $21.17 per pound in the quarter compared to $18.53 in the fourth quarter of 2021. This represents an increase of 14% in prices. \n Molybdenum production decreased by 16% in the fourth quarter of 2021 -- '22 when compared to the same period of 2021. This was mainly driven by a drop in production at the Toquepala mine due to lower ore grades. These results were partially offset by higher production at Cuajone and Buenavista. Molybdenum production fell 13% year-on-year in 2022 after production fell at Toquepala, Cuajone, and La Caridad. This was partially offset by an increase at the Buenavista mine. For 2023, we expect to produce 22,200 tons of molybdenum. Current money prices are over $35 per pound. We believe that prices will be supported by global supply shortages and a strong demand in China and the U.S. Silver represented 4% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of last year with an average price of $21.25 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected a decrease of 9%. \n Silver is currently our second by-product. Mine silver production increased 10% in the fourth quarter versus the same period of 2021 and serve production rose at Ina, Buenavista, Cuajone and Toquepala. This was partially offset by a decrease in production at La Caridad. Refined silver production fell by 1% year-over-year, which was mainly driven by a drop in production at our IMS and Hilo refineries. \n In 2022, we produced 18.6 million ounces of silver, which represents a 2% decrease with regard to the 2021 figure. This was mainly due to a drop in production at Cocapala, Cuajone and Caridad that was partially offset by an increase in production at the Buenavista and insane.  In 2023, we expect to produce 20.5 million ounces of silver. This is an increase of 10% compared to 2022 and higher than the 19 million ounces produced in 2021, higher by 8% when you compare that to 2021 as well. \n Zinc represented 3% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of last year with an average price of $1.36 per pound in the quarter, which represents an 11% decrease with regard to the fourth quarter of 2021 figure. Zinc is currently our third by-product. Zinc mine production decreased 7% quarter-on-quarter and total 15,263 tons. This was driven primarily by a drop in production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara mine. Refined zinc production increased by 26% in the fourth quarter of 2022 when compared to the same period of 2021. \n For the year 2022, we produced 6,010 tons of zinc, a decrease of 10% compared to 2021 that was mainly attributable to a drop in production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara operations. This was partially offset by increases in production at the San Martin, mine. Refining production increased 8% in year-over-year terms. For 2023, we expect to produce 116,800 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 95% over our 2022 production level. This growth will be driven by production start-up at the Buenavista zinc operations. The Buenavista zinc concentrator will add 51,600 tons of zinc to our production and also by the recovery of the Insamines that will add 6,200 tons. In the case of the ISA mines, we have identified better ore areas for the -- in the different mines. And we are contributing with a much higher production for this year coming from the inside. \n For the year 2024 and on, we expect to produce over 200,000 tons of zinc per year. Financial results. For the fourth quarter of 2022, sales were $2.8 billion, which is similar to the level reported in the fourth quarter of 2021. Copper sales volume increased by 2%, while value decreased after prices drop for this metal. \n Regarding our main by-products, we reported higher sales of molybdenum that increased by 65% due to better prices. This was partially offset by a drop in molybdenum volume. Zinc sales were up by 26% due to an increase in volume of 38%, which was partially offset by lower prices. Silver sales were down in the fourth quarter by 0.5 percentage point due to lower prices. This evolution was partially offset by an uptick in silver volume. \n Comparing the fourth quarter of 2022, with the third quarter of last year, as I said in the fourth quarter, Sales totaled $2.8 billion. This represented an increase of [ 663 million ] over the figure reported in the third quarter of the past year. This is a 31% increase in sales. \n The copper sales volume saw 1% while value increased by 23% in a scenario of better prices. Regarding our main by-products, we registered higher sales of molybdenum for 138% due to an increase in the volume and better prices. Molybdenum is were also favored by provisional price adjustments of $92.6 million. Silver sales increased by 26% due to an uptick in the volume and in prices. And since sales fell 7% due to lower prices. This drop was partially offset by an increase in the volume of 4%. \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $157 million or 12% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The main cost increment has been in higher inventory consumption, workers' participation, repair materials, diesel and fuel, explosives and sales expenses. These cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in leachable material costs, translation difference, labor cost. \n Our total operating cost and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022, increased by $80 million or 6% in comparison with the third quarter of last year. The main cost increments has been in workers' participation, purchased copper, sales expenses, operating and repair materials, higher inventory consumption, and contractors. These cost increases were partially offset by a drop in the energy cost and the effect of translation difference and other factors. \n The fourth quarter of 2022 adjusted EBITDA was 1,647 million, which represented a decrease of 5% with regard to the 1,726 million registered in the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of last year was 58% versus 61% in the fourth quarter of 2021. \n For the year 2022, EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA was $5,365 million. This is 22% below the figure of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 was 53% versus 63% in 2021. Operating cash cost per ton of copper before byproduct credits was $2.04 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022. That is $0.25 lower than the value for the third quarter of last year. This 1% decrease in operating cash cost was driven by a drop in cost per pound from higher production that was partially offset by an increase in treatment and refining charges, administrative expenses, and a decrease in the premiums received by our refined Corp. \n Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credit, was $0.45 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022. This cash cost was $0.59 lower than the cash cost of $1.03 reported in the third quarter of 2022. This is a 47% reduction. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $806 million or $1.59 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022. These figures represent a 55% increase over the $501 million or $1.03 per pound reported in the third quarter of last year. \n Total credits have increased for molybdenum, silver and silver and decreased for zinc and sulfuric acid. -- byproduct credit has benefited from the adjustment on open molybdenum sales of $93 million, which represented an extra cash credit of $0.18 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022. \n Net income in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $902 million, which represented an 8% increase with regarded $833 million registered in the fourth quarter of 2021. The net income margin in the fourth quarter of last year was 32% versus 30% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Let me point out that net income in the fourth quarter of last year reflected a 74% increase with regard to the $519 million registered in the third quarter of last year. \n For the full year 2022, net income was $ 2,638 million which is 22% lower than the mark for 2021. The net income margin in 2022 was 26% versus 31% in 2021. Cash from operations. Cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter was $1,082 million, which represented an increase of 83% over the $590 million posted in the third quarter of 2022 and a decrease of 12% over the 1,220 million posted in the fourth quarter of 2021. Looking into capital investments. As you know, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. So the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. \n Our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and include investments in the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar, and El Arco projects in Mexico, and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas, and Michiquillay projects in Peru. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of the El Arco projects.\n In 2022, we spent $948 million in capital investment, which reflected a 6% increase year-on-year and represented 36% of net income in 2020. For our Mexican projects, we have the Buenavista zinc concentrator in the Sonora state. This project is located between the Buenavista deposit. And we are building now a new concentrator to process zinc. This facility has a production capacity of 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. \n We have completed the engineering study and the proving has all the necessary permits. When operating, this facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide more than 2,000 operational jobs. As I mentioned before, we're expecting for this year a significant contribution of -- on the zinc production, over 50,000 tons and for 2024, [ anounover ] 200,000 tons of addition for zinc production for the comp. \n Well, for as a project update, the capital budget for the project is $416 million, most of which has already been invested. We expect to initiate product operations in the second half of 2023 at this point. The Pilares project is located 6 kilometers from La Caridad. This project consists of an open pit mine operation with another production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper is concentrated. This project will significantly improve the oral mineral ore grade, considering the 0.78% expected from Pilares and the 0.29% from La Calia. \n Project update. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, most of which has already been in -- the project is currently operating and delivering copper mineral oxides to the SX-EW facilities of the La Caridad operation. We expect to produce mineral for the La Caridad concentrator at full capacity in the second quarter of 2023. \n El Pilar. This is a low capital-intensive copper greenfield project, which is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico, approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 317 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.25%. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for Pilar is $310 million. \n Project update. The results from experimental paths in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study is finished and the company continue to develop the project and engage in all site environmental activities. The SX-EW plant EPCM project contract has been awarded to a contractor and has started. We expect production to begin in 2024, and mine life is estimated at 13 years. \n El Arco, it's a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula with all reserves of over 1,230 million tons with an average ore grade of 0.4% and 141 million tons of leach material with an average ore grade of 0.27%. The project includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations, and our production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold per year. \n Project update. The company has completed the environmental baseline study for the mine and industrial facilities and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. For the Peruvian projects, we have the Tia Maria project, which is a greenfield project located in Arequipa in the Arequipa region in Peru. This project will use the state-of-the-art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards to produce 120,000 tons of refined copper capital per year. The estimated capital budget for the project is $1.4 billion. \n Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of this life province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of events in the region. We have also promoted agriculture and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in a -- in the case of Los Chancas, we have a project update that is the following. As of December 31 of 2022, part of the project's plan continue to be occupied by illegal miners, some of whom have irregularly registered their stakes in the integral registry of mining formalization, known in Spanish [indiscernible]. \n The company has filed criminal complaints and other legal remedies which have new claims of 70 illegal miners were while 5 cases remain open. You can see it's quite a minor number, and we hope that we will solve this problem shortly. \n For the Michiquillay project, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company informed MINEM that it has begun exploration activities and initiated an assessment of the existing mineral resource at depth. In 2022, in accordance with our social agreements with the Michiquillay and La Encan\u0303ada communities, the company hired unskilled labor and pay for the use of surface land. SCC will continue to make surface land payments in 2023 and plans to support social programs in both communities as it rolls out additional exploration activities. \n For environmental, social and governance investments, Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and informing the investment community and other stakeholders about our progress in this matter. Give me for , please -- in line with best practice, the Board of Directors has approved the formation of a new sustainability committee shared by an independent director. \n The purpose of this committee is to support the Board of Directors of Southern Copper Corporation in developing and monitoring the company's compliance with ongoing commitments to environment, health, safety, communities, human rights and corporate goes. This is a significant step in our pledge to a robust and strong ESG performance. \n The Sustainable Development Committee held several sessions in the fourth quarter of 2022. During these meetings, our counselors review our advances in terms of our main performance indicator and gave us recommendations for the climate change strategy we are building. \n Progress on the corporate sustainability assessment front. S&P Global increased SEC's rating by 13% year-on-year in its corporate sustainability assessment 2022. This situates the company among the top 8% of best performance in the mining sector and places SEC 50% above the average rate. These results reflect the upward trend the company is experiencing in the rem of sustainability and reaffirm SEC's listing in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the Latin American integrated market, known as Mila. This is for the fourth consecutive year in which we achieve -- are considering these listings. \n Our ongoing improvement has been driven by positive performance in areas such as cybersecurity, water management, operations closure, occupational safety and health, among others. The open-pit mine of La Caridad and the Sonora metallurgical complex, both smelter refinery at this context, received copper mark certification. Both units were addressed -- assessed by this independent assurance system to demonstrate that SEC copper is produced responsibly and highlight the company's contribution to achieving the sustainable development goals of the United Nations in 5 main areas: the business and human rights, community, working conditions, environment and governance. SE's goal is to ensure that copper production at all of our units meet Copper Mark criteria. \n Additionally, La Caridad received the molybdenum mark. The aforementioned pilot programs were implemented by Copper Mark and the International Molybdenum Association. So producers have a framework of reference to the most leadership with regard to sustainability and responsible production practices. --occupational safety, the mining chamber of commerce of Mexico coming next and the national accounting to regulate and certify workplace practices, Konasel, awarded first place to the rescue class of the Charcas and Santa Barbara units in the categories of underground NRiskerQ and first age, respectively, the framework of the 6 national competition of underground mining rescues, first aid and hazard dose materials. \n Fundacion Grupo Mexico organized a volunteer day, which was attended by 8,000 volunteers in 13 states of Mexico and 5 regions of Peru. Efforts benefit more than 40 institutions near our operations with a focus on improving the quality of life at the community, family and environment levels. \n Dividend announced. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company's policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate orderly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on January 26, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock payable on March 1 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14 of this year. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end up our presentation today -- thank you very much for joining us. We would like to now open the forum for questions. Well, the figure that I mentioned, the $15 million refers to what we expect to spend in the next 10 years. Let me correct what I just said, through the second, up to 2030. We have been adjusting some of our budgets. We have been including some new expenditures related to our projects. And that's basically what we're thinking. Let me give you the estimate of CapEx that we have for the next 5 years that will be -- that will give some color on what we are seeing now. For this year, we're expecting to spend $1.1 billion in capital for next year, 2 billion, 2025, $1.8 billion, 2026, 2.5 billion and 2027, $2.8 billion. No, not at the ordering, but we have been looking into the projects, seeing how have they advanced. In the case of Los Chancas, for instance, we have this problem that we have been building of illegal mining inside the concession that we are very close to solve that has stopped as our work in this project for a while, even though we have been doing some cabinet work regarding the environmental permitting for Los Chancas, but that has affected somehow our forecast. And in the case of Michiquillay, given the delay that we had in signing the social contracts and beginning the exploration season that we are currently doing, we decided to make an adjustment on the time lines for these 2 projects. That's why we moved a little bit start--to the start-up for both of them. \n Obviously, if we see opportunities to advance them in time, we'll take that and inform when appropriate. But that's currently -- this is our view on the projects. For now, it does not include the Cuajone expansion, Timna, and it does include Tia Maria. Let me add that we expect to have that through this year, we expect to have more clarity on the Cuajone project and will inform to the market regarding that. Yes. Well, molybdenum have surprises on the positive side, given the price that we're seeing now are $35 per pound which is much, much higher than what we had -- we reported a little bit more than $21 per pound for the fourth quarter. So if you do the math, it's over 50% of price increase for molybdenum. \n We are looking into ways to produce a little bit more. As you know, our mining plans are made considering copper, the main product, that there are always opportunities to improve a little bit the production of ore products. And in this case, we're certainly taking a good look into how can we produce a little bit more molybdenum without affecting our copper forecast for 2023 and on. I think that, that question should be posed to Grupo Mexico. But from our side, we haven't seen any -- we have nothing to report about that. Okay. Let me start by the last -- your second question on cost. Well, what we're seeing in the fourth quarter and now is that some of the much higher cost that we had before are somehow adjusting downward, particularly in the case of gas still explosive a little bit and -- but mainly this -- that's where we're seeing some adjustments -- some reductions put differently. We, at the same time, we'll be increasing our production from 895,000 tons last year to 926,000 tons this year. So that should have a positive benefit in our cash cost before byproduct credits. We expect it to be -- well, about 2 -- a little bit more than $2 and hopefully, less than $2 as we go through 2023. \n For the byproducts, we are expecting -- well, as you have -- we talked a little bit on molybdenum before. These prices are supported by a combination of higher demand as well as some supply surpass of primary production or primary mines of molybdenum that are having some travel in China and some other locations. \n For zinc, well, we are very positive on the market. The price currently is over $1.50 per pound, which is much higher than what we have been recording in the last -- in the fourth quarter. We are seeing a very good zinc demand for refinancing -- and we are obviously very encouraged by the beginning of our new concentrator that will produce about 100,000 tons of zinc per year and 20,000 tons of copper and some silver as well. \n So those are positive news for us. We see good demand for zinc, and we're happy on delivering, hopefully, on the third quarter at full speed, the thing a new facility for zinc production. And we also see on the positive side, the fact that our into mines are turning into -- or getting into a better ore grade area where we will have some more production. \n Now for gold and silver, I think that it's much more complicated to make a forecast, so I will stop in there. I have mentioned that we have a very good sulfuric acid sales in both volume and prices in 2002 and '22. So I expect this -- well, even though prices are not as good as the average of last year, we're still seeing a very positive market for sulfuric acid sales in 2023  \n [Technical Difficulty] Yes. Thank you for your question, Alfonso. The forecast that we have for the next 5 years is the following: for 2023, as I said, [ 126,000 ] tons, 2024 1,061,000 tons, at 2025 1,021,000 tons, 2026 1,108,000 tons and 2027 1,070,000 tons -- regarding El Arco, well, it is a very good project. We're working in it. We have secured all the land that is required for the project. We are -- we have been looking into the infrastructure that is required for the project to move on. And we're on that process as well as looking into the environmental permitting that we require for the project. \n Obviously, in some of these permits, there are certain challenges that we have to overcome. But we are very positive. So this is actually a very good project, and we believe that we can -- we will be able to develop it at a good pace at a certain point in time... Thank you for your question, John. Let's start by profit sharing. We have legally in both Mexico and Peru to have a profit sharing program. In Peru, it's 8% of profit before taxes. In Mexico, it's 10% of profit before taxes. The Mexico has some adjustment given on the fact that you need to take a 3-year -- the average of 3 years for giving the benefit to the labor force, but that's basically how it works. \n In the case of our social programs, let me point out first that we are in an area of the country with currently, there is some social uphill. And our operations are -- has been not affected by them so far, and we are making significant efforts to maintain them, as I said, just in good shape and operating at full capacity as we are right now. That's for the current operations of our 2 mines and our metallurgical complex. \n In the case of our projects, we have been in the last few years developing several programs on the social front in order to maintain a good relationship with the local communities or population. In some cases, we don't have a community that is nearby, but population. That's the case, for instance, of the Kia Maria project, where we have the slight province population, and there are no communities. \n For the other 2 projects for Los Chancas and Michiquillay, we do have communities in the case of Los Chancas 2 communities in both cases, 2 communities, also for the Michiquillay. In the case of Los Chancas, we had an incident last year where group of illegal miners going to our concession and fire our facilities in there. We have been working to recuperate our operational capacity for the project. \n I'd like to point out that we have evidence that no members of the communities participated in these Violin Act. It was driven by a group of people that want to develop in legal activities, mining legal mining in this area. We proceed to put all the legal tools that we have and to both retire these people from our premises, which over 75, we already managed to work with 70 of them canceling by the government, their permit to do mining. And obviously, they were proceeding illegally and doing these activities in our concession of first chunk. \n So there are 5 cases remaining, and then we will be able to recuperate the pace that we have lost a little bit on this pad. In the case of Michiquillay, last year, we signed social contracts with the 2 communities that are over there. These social contracts have several initiatives, some programs for hiring for the work of the project, for instance, for the exploration efforts -- we can -- we have a commitment on hiring local people from the 2 communities. \n We have also a program to recognize some rental for the use of certain facilities in these areas. And we are basically moving forward with these programs that have some other initiatives that we're considering. So that's basically where we are. But on top of that, we have been -- we have several programs that are very, very interesting and very powerful that we're using in our own current operations of Toquepala and Cuajone and we're extending them to the 3 projects that I just mentioned. \n For instance, we have project that developed certain abilities or, for instance, heavy weight machinery operation, electricity and some other civil works that can -- that are trained. We have programs to train people on this kind abilities. And with that, we can hire them for different jobs inside our operations as well as for the project. \n So all of this and mainly having a good communication standard with the communities is helping us to maintain these areas, we believe moving forward for a better development and to have these projects being successful over time. For Peru, this year should be about -- let me put it in terms of monthly salaries, about 5% or a little bit more monthly salaries this year as a profit sharing. In Mexico, the number varies, but it's depending on the different operations, but it's also a very attractive profit sharing as well. 5x the monthly salary. Sorry, I can -- I can't copy you well. \nHerna\u0301n Kisluk: Yes. Can you think me better now? Much better. \nHerna\u0301n Kisluk: Okay. So my question is regarding revenues. So if I do the math for the quarter, multiplying the volume sold of each product by the reference price, I still have a very big gap compared to the reported revenues of about $450 million. So I would like to know if there is any kind of effects like provisional pricing or things like that, that are distorting the revenue for the quarter? Well, it's not distorting, but we're recognizing the value of the sales that we have at open safe. In the case of molybdenum, for instance, the adjustment on open sales, it's using the last price quoted by the market. It's a little bit -- it's almost $32. That's why we had a significant adjustment of over $92 million for molybdenum. Then we have some other revenue sources that are usually not some overlook such as forecasted revenues, we had a very good sulfuric acid prices through this past quarter and in the year that have been benefit the corporation. So those are the ones that have been -- that have been increasing our revenues in the fourth quarter of this year. \nHerna\u0301n Kisluk: Okay. And is there something of this effect on the copper side of the business? Or is it just modified on other product... No, no, no. There is also an adjustment on operating copper open sales but in the copper sales, we do have future curve while in molybdenum, we just have the price at the end of the month, there is no future prices for molybdenum. So in copper, we do have also an adjustment that is not as significant as the $92 million that I just mentioned.\n Yes. But let me comment a little bit on the revenues other than molybdenum. A moment thank you -- mainly, it's on molybdenum copper, zinc the ones that have been better in the case of zinc, it was more volume than anything else in molybdenum price and the open sales adjustment. So that's basically the -- so for cat that was an important driver of revenues. So over for -- just to give you an idea, in 2021, we had $83 million of sales so forecasted in 2022, the number went up $212 million. So there you have a significant chunk, $130 million of additional revenues on the year."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the second quarter 2022 as well as answer any questions that you may have. The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. \n Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP. \n Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, [ Carmen ], and good morning to everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation's Second Quarter Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board Member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market. We will then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Before we go into the details of the second quarter of this year, let me mention that our financial results have been impacted by some unusual circumstances. This scenario has been compounded by 3 major factors: increases in cost for fuel, power and some other operating materials due to inflation, a drop in copper prices that affected results for the quarter as well as open sales through a significant mark-to-market adjustments, which led sales to drop $173.5 million, mark-to-market is our required accounting method to reflect the fair value of sales that have no final price due to quotational periods in the future time. \n In other words, when prices drop, we have to adjust sales that we have not collected. The value of these sales are the ones that are reflected in our financials. And as a consequence, we have this $173.5 million adjustment. Our third part, so, is that quarterly results were also affected by 25,624 tons decrease in copper production at our Peruvian operations, attributable to the stoppage at Cuajone and lower ore grades. To avoid [indiscernible] event, production losses were temporarily offset with copper purchase from third parties, albeit at a higher cost. \n Finally, net sales were affected by lower sales volumes due to an uptick in the finished goods inventory translated into $105.2 million sales reduction. Now let's focus on the copper market. In the second quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased 2% from an average of $4.40 per pound in 2021 to $4.32 in this quarter. However, during the month of June, we had a significant drop in copper prices down to its current level of between $3.30 and $3.40 per pound. A concern for a simultaneous recession in the U.S., Europe and China is dominated in the market and consequently affecting copper prices. \n These years are based upon the following impacts, the consistent increment in interest rates by the Fed, the [ SCB ] and other relevant central banks. The slowdown of the Chinese economy due to COVID-19 lockdowns and a minus 31% reduction in construction activities year-on-year. Even though these are issues that concern us, we should note that the most relevant market intelligence houses for the copper market, are expecting balance or small deficit for 2022 in the copper market. \n This assumes also that we're assuming that demand will grow between 1% and 2.5% this year, particularly in terms of [ capital ] consumption in the U.S. There is uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, which together represent about 40% of the total copper supply. The major warehouses have not reported a relevant increase in copper inventories. Just to give you an idea, the sum of the London Metal Exchange COMEX, Shanghai and bonded warehouses in China, altogether represent as of June 30, 80 days -- 8-days of consumption at relatively low level of refined material available. We believe the economic slowdowns in the U.S., China and Europe have temporarily weakened the demand for copper and are driving reductions in current prices. \n It is important to emphasize that copper trace a leading role in the global shift between -- which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper will be strong in the long term. In this scenario, we believe the current cycle of low prices should be [ shortly ]. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 78% of our sales in the second quarter of 2022. Copper production registered a decrease of 12.1% in the second quarter. In a quarter-on-quarter terms to spend 208,428 tons. Our quarterly results reflect a 25.3% drop in production in Peru, which was triggered by a production loss of 9,339 tons at the Cuajone Mine. This growth was primarily attributable to a 54-day mine stoppage and secondarily to a decrease in ore grades at both Toquepala and La Caridad. On a year-on-year basis, copper production fell 11.1% in 2022 to stand at 422,908 tons. \n Regarding the Cuajone stoppage, on April 30 of this year, the Peruvian government issued a Ministerial Resolution to set up a 3-party roundtable or dialogue with members of the community, government and company officials to better understand all parties concerned. As of today, 9 roundtable meetings and 3 direct meetings with this community has been held. The company has proposed plans to invest in social programs and address the needs voiced by the communities and SCC has indicated interest in purchasing land near the Cuajone operations to establish a buffer zone to protect installations and production down the line. The company strongly believes that the program that we have proposed will make meaningful and sustainable contributions to the communities progress and wellbeing. Each efforts will be complemented by a positive impact through the Social Investment for Taxes mechanism, known in Spanish as obras por impuestos, which will allow SPCC to fund public investments in necessary public infrastructure and credit these expenditures against its taxes. \n For 2022, we expect to produce 898,200 tons of copper, a decrease of 3% compared to our 2022 plan of 972,000 tons. We expect our copper production to bounce back in 2023, reaching 971,000 tons of production as we get the Peruvian production back on track and generate new production through our Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrator project. \n For molybdenum, it represented 8.6% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of 2022, and is currently our first byproduct. Molybdenum prices averaged $18.30 per pound in the quarter compared to $13.89 in the second quarter of 2021. This represents an increase of 31.7% in time. Molybdenum production decreased by 9.4% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter to the same period of 2021. This was mainly driven by a decrease in production at the Cuajone operation. La Caridad and Toquepala mines also decreased their production due to lower ore grades mainly in the case of Cuajone, it was the Cuajone stoppage. These results were partially offset by higher production at Buenavista. \n On a year-on-year basis, molybdenum production fell 5.4% in 2022 after production fell at Cuajone and Caridad and was partially offset by an increase in Buenavista and Toquepala mines production. For this year, 2022, we expect to produce 25,700 tons of molybdenum. We believe that for the molybdenum market, prices will be supported by lower exports from China and Russia that are maintaining this market in [indiscernible]. For silver, it represented 4.3% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2022, with an average price of $22.65 per ounce in the quarter, a decrease of 15.4% from the second quarter of 2021 price. Silver is currently our second byproduct. Mine sugar production decreased by 4.3% in the second quarter of this year compared vis-a-vis the same period of 2021 after production of [indiscernible] Toquepala, Cuajone and La Caridad. This was partially offset by an increase in production at the Inca, the Buenavista mine. Refined sugar production increased 1.1% in the second quarter of this year, mainly due to an increase in production at our La Caridad and Inca refineries. \n In 2022, we expect to produce 18.9 million ounces of silver, in line with our 2021 production level. Zinc represented 3.5% of our face value in the second quarter of 2022, with an average price of $1.78 per pound in the quarter, a 34.8% increase from the same period of 2021. Zinc mine production decreased by 11.5% quarter-on-quarter and total 15,141 tons. This was primarily driven by lower production at Charcas and San Martin mine. Refinancing production decreased by 14.8% in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. \n For this year, 2022, we expect to produce 66,900 tons of zinc in line with 2021 production. Looking at our financial results. For the second quarter of 2022, sales were $2.3 billion. This is $590 million lower than sales for the second quarter of 2021 or 20.4% lower sales. Of this amount, $173.5 million are explained by the mark-to-market adjustments, 89.3% by the 9,339 tons of Cuajone production loss in the quarter, $117.8 million by lower sales due to lower ore grade at the Peruvian operations and $105.2 million for 11,000 tons of finished products in inventory. \n Copper sales volume decreased by 16.3%, while value decreased by 23.4% in a scenario of lower prices, mainly as a result of the adjustment that I already mentioned and the reduction in volumes indicated. Regarding our main by-products, we had lower sales of molybdenum due to lower volume, partially compensated by better prices. In the case of silver, sales decreased due to lower prices and volume for zinc sales remained stable with the lower volume compensated by the prices. Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $276.5 million or 22.6% when compared to the second quarter of 2021. \n Main cost increments has been in Mexican workers' participation, purchased copper, diesel and fuel and operating and repair materials. Energy has also increased somehow. These cost increases were partially compensated by lower Peruvian workers' participation, translation difference and other factors. The second quarter of this year, adjusted EBITDA was $1,024 million. which represented a decrease of 45.2% regarding the $1,862.4 million registered in the second quarter of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin of -- in the second quarter stood at 44.3% versus 64.3% in the same period of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in the 6 months was $2.7 billion, a 21% lower than the same mark for the first half of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the 6 months of 2022 stood at 53.2% in versus 62.9% in the same period of 2021. \n Cash cost. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before the product credit was $2.15 per ton in the second quarter of 2022. That is $0.32 higher than the value for the first quarter of 2022. This 17.4% increase in operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost, treating and refining charges and administrative expenses. This was partially compensated by higher premium on refined copper. Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of our product trade was $1.10 per pound in the second quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.54 higher than the cash cost of $55.5 that we had in the first quarter of this year. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $465.3 million or $1.05 per pound in the second quarter of 2022. These figures represent a 17.6% decrease when compared with the credit of $583.5 million or $1.275 per pound in the first quarter of this year. Net income in the second quarter of 2022 was $432.3 million, which represent a 53.7% decrease regarding the $932.7 million registered in the second quarter of 2021. \n The net income margin stood at 18.7% versus 32.2% in the same period of 2021. This is for the second quarter. On a year -- as mentioned before, our financial results this quarter has been impacted by unusual circumstances. Nonetheless, we believe Southern Copper is well positioned to leverage our strength in that challenging environment. Our strong financial position, low cash cost, operating cost efficiency programs and our significant copper reserves will let us whether both current and eventual circumstances. We remain fully committed to creating [ act ] value and positive impact for our shareholders and for all the communities where we operate. \n Cash flow from operating activities in the 6 months of 2022 was $1,130.5 million, which represented a decrease of 38.7% over the $1,844.2 million post in the 6 months of 2021. This effect was attributable to lower sales value and to a mark-to-market adjustment already indicated. Let me add to that, that in the first 2 quarters of the year, we have a structurally higher and increase in working capital that reduced our cash flow available in the first half of the year. Capital investments, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. \n Through the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. In 2022, we spent $224.6 million on capital investments, which reflected a 2.2% increase over the figure reported in 2021 and represented a 51.9% of net income this quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent $429.7 million on capital investments, which represented 35.3% of net income. Our current portfolio for approved projects in Peru totaled $2.8 billion, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested. If we include the Michiquillay $2.5 billion project and the chunk a $2.6 billion projects, our total investment program in Peru reflects a commitment of $7.9 billion. \n For Tia Maria in Arequipa, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of Islay province. Apart from these efforts we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay. \n In 2021, our Southern Copper fortified its relationship with the regional government and successfully overcome its opposition to project initiation. This new consensus were reflected in an agreement for social investment for taxes for projects relative to health facilities and roads. Our efforts to ensure the current and long-term welfare of the population in the area of influence of the Tia Maria project were recognized by several local associations, which send letters to the National Government to request project initiation. \n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for  the Islay province and the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We will make it a priority to hire local labels to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria construction. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenue in the Arequipa region. The company has made an offer to the Peruvian government to build the Paltiture dam, instead of a desalinization plant originally proposed to provide water for -- to both the project and the community. \n The dam will have a total capacity of 73 million cubic meters of which the company will use a maximum of 10 million cubic meters. The remaining 63 million will be for community use. The dam is built, will require a much higher investment than the $100 million budget planned for the desalinization plan. Nevertheless, the company believes that by increasing the water supply, it will generate more capable benefits for local communities. We expect the Peruvian government to continue to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently, take the necessary steps to provide SCC with adequate support to initiate construction. \n Los Chancas is a greenfield project located in Apurimac, Peru. It's a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposits. Current estimates of indicated copper mineral resources are 98 million tons of oxide with a copper content of 0.45% and 52 million tons of sulfide with a copper content of 0.59%. The Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The estimated capital investment is $2.6 billion, and the project is estimated to begin operating in 2027. \n In February of this year, a group of legal miners occupied parts of the land of the project and started to produce copper with a low-scale artisan process. On May of 31st of this year, a group of people attacks he project mining camps causing a fire and completely destroyed installations. There were no fatalities to regret. As of today, these illegal miners are working in the zone. The company expects strong action from the authorities to restore the land to the company so that it can continue to develop the project. \n For the Michiquillay project, in June of 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru. The company has created a multi-disciplinary management team to plan the development of these projects. As part of this plan, the company has established venues of contact with the local and regional authorities and communities to promote programs for sustainable development in the area. In 2021, the company signed a social agreement with the Michiquillay and the Enca\u00f1ada Communities. And on October 1, 2021, the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the semi-detailed Environmental Impact Study for project. Social agreements with the Michiquillay and the Enca\u00f1ada Communities represent an opportunity to improve the quality of life of the residents of those committed via our strong social program and backed by a solid framework for technical work at the project level. \n At the end of June, the project has all the required permits for exploration activity. These events are important steps that will allow Southern Copper to initiate an in-depth exploration program in this quarter, the third quarter of 2022. Michiquillay is a world-class mining project with inferred mineral resources of 2,288 million tons with an estimated copper grade of 0.43%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tons of copper per year, along with byproducts of molybdenum, gold and silver for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash cost. We estimate an investment of approximately $2.5 billion will be required and expect production to start by 2028. Michiquillay will become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region, generate new jobs for the local communities and contribute with taxes and royalties to the local, regional and national governments. \n For our Mexican projects, we have to Buenavista Zinc project, which is located within the Buenavista facility in Sonora and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the engineering study and in order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 has been put in place. Procurement has progressed 99%, and all main equipment is on site. Construction site works are in progress. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. As of June of this year, we had invested $264.9 million in this project. We expect to initiate operations in the second half of 2022. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n For the Pilares project, also in Sonora, this is a project located 6 kilometers from La Caridad and consists of an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks has been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining the 0.78% expected from Pilares with the 0.34% from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, of which we have invested $80.9 million as of June 30, 2022. \n The project has obtained all permits and licenses required, and we expect to begin production in the last quarter of 2022. El Pilar is a low-capital intensity copper greenfield project strategically located in Sonora, also in Mexico. It is approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 317 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.249%. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. We expect production to begin in 2024, and the mine life is estimated at 13 years. The results from experimental paths in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study is finished and the company continues developing the project and site environmental activities. \n El Arco. it's a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula with ore reserves of over 1,230 million tons with an average ore grade of 0.40%. It has also 141 million tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.27%. The project includes an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. Several years back, we began to acquire the rights to all relevant mining concessions in the area. This process was completed in 2020. \n As you all know, Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and informing the investment community and other stakeholders about our progress in this market. In line with best practice, on July 21, our Board of Directors approved the formation of a new Sustainability Committee chaired by an independent director, actually composed by independent directors. The purpose of the -- this committee is to support the Board of Directors of Southern Corporate Corporation in developing and monitoring the company's compliance with ongoing commitment to environment, health and safety, communities, human rights and corporate governance. This is a significant step in our pledge to a robust and strong environmental, social and government performance. \n Quoting the Chairman of our Board of Directors in the letter that contains the 2021 sustainable development report of our holding, Grupo Mexico: \"A business model focused on responsible and transparent management in the social, economic and environmental spheres are essential to guarantee sustainable development\". S&P Global has recognized SEC sustainability efforts by including it in a new index, S&P/ Bolsa de Valores de Lima Peru General ESG, as of April of this year. \n This index is the first of its kind in the Peruvian market and recognizes a total of 17 companies that need high standards for environmental, social and governance management. In light of its improvement in the realm of ESG, ESP has also upgraded the Company's Sustainability Assessment, which rose from 50 over 100 points in 2020 to 61 over 100 points in 2021. This is a 22% increase. These results led to our inclusion in Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the MILA region in 2019, and we have also been included in the 2022 Sustainability Yearbook. \n We aim to improve our sustainability management and performance to ensure that we maintain and continuously improve our sustainability ratings. Certification of our environmental and occupational health and safety management systems allows the company to reinforce a preventive culture that is aligned with best international practices. We continue to make progress in our quest to achieve ISO 45001 and 14001 certifications. \n During the second quarter of 2022, the Maritime Terminal of Guaymas, Mexico received ISO 45001 certification, and the Charcas unit in Mexico became the first of our underground mines to obtain ISO 14001 certification. Given the importance of water for our operations and the broader perspective of climate change, the company recently appointed a Water Resources Director at the executive level, whose main function will be to coordinate the actions needed to promote water management at all our operations and ensure our place as a responsible partner in the regional management of these available results. \n SCC seeks sustainability by managing different fronts, the Metallurgical Complex in Sonora where we smelt and refined material mine from the region, was recognized in the ranking of the 10 Best Places to Work for Women. With this recognition, this plant has consolidated its position as the employer of choice for the best professionals in the country and has strengthened an organizational culture based on safety, predictability and employee trust. This industrial complex was also given the 2021 National Export Award in the category of large industrial exporting companies for its contribution to foreign trade and international business in the country. This distinction recognizes SCC\u2019s responsible production of essential raw materials, environmental presentation efforts and the economic benefits and support it provides to bolster the well-being of workers and their families. \n In Peru, a couple of weeks ago, the Prime Minister joined us for the inauguration of the Cularjahuira dam at a cost of $11.5 million, which was the fruit of a joint investment between the company and government authorities and the highland community of Camilaca. This project will help us strengthen our cultural activities in the province of Candarave near our Toquepala operations and will be complemented by work on a new Callazas dam at an estimated cost of $35 million, which SCC hopes to finance through the Social Investments for Taxes or obras por impuestos in Spanish. This is a mechanism that allow us to credit to our taxes, investments in social infrastructure. \n While these process and these efforts are evolving in the context of market by record highs for the company's tax contributions to the regional government of Moquegua and Tacna in 2021. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the Company's policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. \n Accordingly, as announced to the market on July 21st the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.75 per share of common stock, payable on August 25 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 11, 2022. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. \nTimna Tanners: Thanks for the overview. I wanted to explore a little bit more the cost guidance, if you could. Obviously, some of the cost pressures in the second quarter would be attributable to Cuajone being down. So I was just wondering if you could help us think about the cadence into the second -- the third quarter and the fourth quarter from what you know today, energy price is probably up on average, but certainly those onetime items coming out. So can you talk a little bit more about costs, please? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Thank you for your question, Tina. Well, as you will mention, we were impacted by a reduction in production in the second quarter, resulting in among other reasons, but mainly for 2, it was driven by 2 factors: the Cuajone stoppage that affected the first 23 days of April. And the second factor was the ore grades that were -- are lower, particularly at the Peruvian operations and also at a La Caridad a little bit in Mexico. The ore grade, it's a factor that we indicated to the market a while ago. This year, we were expecting to produce less than last year due to ore grades decays for a temporary base in the case of our operations. \n The unexpected factor was the Cuajone stoppage. Now Cuajone is currently working at full capacity. We have reviewed our program for the year, our production program for the year. And we have made an adjustment, as I mentioned in the production profile that we have, we are expecting now to produce 898,000 tons of copper for the full year, and we have produced already 423,000 round numbers. So we're expecting to produce for the remaining of 2022, 475,000 tons of copper. This will come from different sources, but mainly, we will be recuperating the production at the Cuajone operation. We have reviewed our operating plans, particularly at the Toquepala mine, and we're improving a little bit our production for this year. \n And with that, we are expecting to get to our expectation of 598,000 tonnes. Now cost guidance for the third and fourth quarter, well, I think we're all seeing that fuel prices are decreasing slowly, a little bit when compared to what we had in the first and particularly the second quarter. More production will allow us to distribute the fixed cost on a much lower weight per ton of copper. So we are expecting to have a better cost per pound for the second part of the year. Overall, we're expecting to have a cash cost by year-end of $0.86 per pound for the full year. \n And this is based on the improvement in production plus better also by production because they have been also affected by -- in the case of Cuajone, molybdenum and silver were affected by [indiscernible] based on the improvement in production, plus better also by problems of production because they have been also affected by -- in the case of Cuajone, molybdenum and silver were affected by that. Since we had to stop some days in the second quarter, the Ilo smelter, we had a reduction in sulfuric acid production as well and some other material that was passed to all refineries. So we're expecting for quarters 3 and 4 of this year having a much better performance as what we have seen for the second quarter. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. That's helpful. If I could, one more and I'll pass it off. On the lower dividend, understandable given the changes in commodity prices and dynamics. But -- if you look at the second quarter, your total cash position fell by, what, $900 million, and a lot of that was the payout. So just trying to think going forward, can you help us with like the right position -- the amount of cash that you'd like to have on your balance sheet? And can you help us with how to think about the dividend policy relative to the copper price going forward? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. We have -- I mentioned that while during the presentation that in the first and second quarter of the year, the Company usually has an increase in working capital, consequently reducing our cash flow from operations. If I look at the second quarter, of this year, and you can see that as well, cash from operations was $641.9 million. The expenses that we have in the second quarter are usually the paying of the profit sharing for the Mexican workforce. And on some taxes that are paid in Peru. \n In total, this year, for instance, that amount was $255 million. On top of that, we had lower revenues due to the inventory buildup of finance products that we already mentioned. So if you think about, we have about $400 million that are at or were asked at to working capital in the second quarter and that obviously, that affected our cash position. We don't expect that to be as strong as it has been the case in the second quarter for quarters #3 and 4, but at the same time, we're currently in a different price environment. \n So we believe that we will have a much higher cash generation but aligned with the new price set that we're seeing now as we speak. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. \nCarlos de Alba: So just one clarification on the information you gave on cash costs, $0.86 per pound. That is after byproducts, can you give us the number before by-products? And then I have a few others. \nRaul Jacob: [indiscernible] We expect to close the year with $1.92 per pound of cash cost before byproduct credits. \nCarlos de Alba: Right. And then some of the questions I have on the projects and one question is on the projects and the other is on third-party concentrate. On the projects, I saw there was basically no progress in Buenavista Zinc in the last quarter remains at 99% procurement progress for this operation. Can you give us a little bit more color? You were about a year or more before that operation ramps up. Can you give us more color on any delays or anything that may be slowing down the progress that we have seen in that project? And then on Tia Maria, very, very interesting move to offer the community to build a dam given obviously the history of the project. What would be the steps? Why do you -- what do you expect to hear from the community or from the government that will really -- the impact in which we have been for quite some time at that operation. \n And then just finally, on the third-party concentrate, you had to [indiscernible] because of the impact of Cuajone that we saw in Q1 -- in Q2. Do you expect the third-party concentrate purchase to come down significantly in the second half of the year? If you can give us a little bit of a -- if you can give us a guidance, that would be great. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you very much for your questions, Carlos. Okay. I don't agree with your first statement of no progress on the Buenavista Zinc in the last quarter because we're currently working, I mean, building the plant, once a month, we review at the management level, we review the advancement in the project. And quite clearly, we're on the civil works of the project, we already have all the equipment -- pretty much all the equipment, as you mentioned, in 99% and some of the total engineering and the equipment, the procurement is also well advanced. So what we are seeing is that the project is moving forward at a good pace. \n We had a delay in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemia, but now it's moving forward at a very good pace. We're expecting it to initiate production in the second half of next year. And we will be giving a more specific period once we approach to the end of the construction phase of the project. For Tia Maria, well, this is a proposal that the company is making to the authorities and the community to build a dam that would provide water for the communities as well as water for the project will take a minor portion of the water and the remaining will be available for the community and the particularly Tambo Valley population. \n We are -- we believe that circumstances are evolving in a very positive fashion for Tia Maria in Arequipa and in the Islay area. That's where we're seeing a very significant progress. We think that the national government can do its part by joining this process, but we're not seeing that so far. \n And regarding your final point on purchase concentrates. Well, we don't expect to buy it as we have done through the second quarter and the first quarter of this year. It was just -- as I mentioned, the -- and during the presentation of results, it was more -- was driven -- we didn't want -- we don't want to have to call for a force majeure. That's why we -- in order to comply with our contracts, we acquire copper concentrates from third parties, particularly from Peru. And we use that material for feeding our Ilo smelter and refinery so we can back our contracts that allow us to continue our flow of revenues and so on at the cost of higher cost because, as you know, purchase concentrates are paid at market prices in certain discounts, while our production is at cost. \n For the next quarters, we will be -- let me mention also that we are long both in Mexico and Peru in copper concentrates. So we produce much more copper concentrates than our smelting and refining capacities, both in Mexico and Peru. So generally speaking, we are not buying significant amounts or no buying purchased copper from third parties at all. And that's what we expect to do in the second half of the year. And that will be one of the factors that will help our cost control in the second half of 2022. \nCarlos de Alba: All right. And just for modeling purposes then, in the first quarter of 2022 the company purchased less than 3,000 tons trade from -- last year, second quarter was around 3,500, 3,600 tonnes. So is that a number that we should consider that you do on the regular course of business? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. And some of these -- if you look at what we have acquired last year in the first half was 4,300 tons of copper from third parties. It's a very small amount. I mean, it's about 1% of our total production. It's a very small amount. So we don't have to -- we will most likely come back to that regarding copper concentrates and copper from third parties. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Fernando Assad with Ashmore. \nFernando Assad: Raul, just 3 clarifications, if I may. Again, continue from Carlos. The cash costs that you highlighted, $0.86 and $1.98. Is that by year-end or for the full year of '22? And do you have a figure again for 2023? \nRaul Jacob: Yes, I do Fernando. Thank you for your question. Let me be very specific. For the year -- for the full year, we expect to close the year with a cash cost of $0.86, composed by $1.92 cash cost before credits and credits for $1.06. For next year, we're expecting to have $1.82, keep in mind that we will have more production coming from Pilares and Buenavista Zinc next year. And our cash cost at the end of the year will be $0.89 per pound. And it will be at about that level up to the beginning of -- up to 2026 when we will have a slightly higher cash cost of close to $1. And then come back until we will come back to about that, the $0.86, $0.90 per pound range when we will get the benefit of the new projects that -- particularly the greenfield projects such as El Arco, well, Buenavista, [indiscernible] Los Chancas, Tia Maria and Michiquillay. \nFernando Assad: Great. Great. And just following on from that, now that the first half is completed, do you continue to expect this lower grades temporary issue on the copper side to be a 2022 issue and you're back to steady state in 2023? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. The straight answer to your question is yes. we expect to have lower grades because we're moving into areas of the mine, particularly the Peruvian operations, where ore grades are lower and this will allow us to get to areas where the ore grades will be higher next year. That's -- it's part of our mining plan, which we're following through this year. And we advised on this -- well, 2 years ago, actually, we indicated that we will have a slowdown in our copper production due to lower grades. And that's -- the bounce back is expected for next year. I really -- let me mention what we're expecting is that for 2023, we should be producing 971,000 tons of copper, for 2024, 1,047,000 tons, for 2025, 1,100,000 tons. \nFernando Assad: Okay. And final bit of clarification. In Cuajone, we're back to full capacity, the only downtime that we had in the second quarter was actually during April and since then, there was a ramp up back to full capacity, no other stoppages in May and June, correct? \nRaul Jacob: That's quite correct. At the very beginning of the stoppage because the stoppage was a result of the committee taking the water facilities that supply water for Cuajone. So the concentrator and the plant, generally speaking, the mine were not affected directly. But not having water, it was impossible to operate, the concentrator and the other facilities. So we did some advanced maintenance in our Cuajone facilities at the first phase of the stoppage. And we believe that, that will be helpful for producing a little bit more than what we expect in our original plans for quarters 3 and 4 of this year. \n In total, in the second quarter, the Cuajone mine was stopped by 20 days, and we received the order facilities and the railroad line on April 21 and 3 days after that, we were operating at full capacity. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Alfonso Salazar with Scotiabank. \nAlfonso Salazar: I have a couple of questions. The first one is a very simple one. The second one, probably not that much. The one is regarding water. And if I -- as I'm not mistaken, the Tia Maria project, something that you mentioned before is that it was really not a problem with water. There is plenty of water in the region. And if you check the World Resources Institute, that's what they say that it's not a region with any water stress problem. So what is the benefit? If there is no real water problem, what is the real benefit of having this dam, how does this impact the sentiment of people?\n The second question is regarding [indiscernible] Sonora. That's a problem where water stress is really is a big big problem. So I was just wondering if you have any comments on how are your operations? If you have any contingency plan in case that the situation gets even worse in terms of water use in the state of Sonora. And just a follow-up on the production that you just mentioned for '23 to 2025. There is an increase in production of 130,000 tons, which projects are you including in this period from your pipeline? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Hold on a second, please. Okay. Let me start by the last question. We're considering Pilares, Buenavista Zinc and El Pilar as well as a partial -- as well as a partial production of Tia Maria, that's for 2025. \nAlfonso Salazar: Correct. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Now regarding your first question, let me clarify this. We, in Peru, are operating now at the northern part of the Atacama Desert. So we are in an area where water, generally speaking, is relatively scarce. We have water scarcity, generally speaking. That's why we are focusing in our operations, in trying to improve our water recycling and water savings. Now having said that, what I mentioned a while ago in some other conference calls is that there is enough water in the area for providing the Tia Maria project with water. However, given the pattern of agriculture, crops that are produced in this area, in Islay province, it's a strong in very good quality of rice production. Well, as you know rice is a water-intensive crop. So considering that, there is -- there are some months of the year where there is some stress, water stress, given the pattern of agricultural production of the area. That's why we're at [ press ], dam as the one that we are proposing to the government could be of help. \n On top of that, there are the certain areas that may be irrigated with the extra water that the dam will provide. And that is where the opportunity. It's therefore, the population of this area. Regarding Sonora, where we are doing a very -- as I mentioned before, the company has appointed a high-level Water Management Director in order to review the water supply for the company. But -- as important as it is to be sure that we have the water that we require for our operations. It is also extremely important to be a partner in developing new water sources and water conservation for the whole areas where we operate. And that's the idea behind pointing a high-level, a high-rank position in water management at the company that is certainly looking at the Sonora water situation where there is some water stress. \n We're currently securing water sources for our operations, but we will live as I say, we can be a cooperative partner for other efforts on a regional level, both in Sonora where we have our open-pit operations as well as some other parts in the Mexican Republic as well as at the southern part of Peru, where we have the Toquepala and Cuajone operations currently. \nAlfonso Salazar: I think this is a great decision to have appointed this person. Hopefully, we can have a conversation with him or inviting for a conference call sometime because I think he can add a lot to the water problem and how the company is facing it. \nRaul Jacob: Yes. That's a very good depth. Thank you very much for your comment Alfonso and that high rank position, it's also, as I mentioned, joined by a high-level ESG committee form and at the Board -- by our Board and composed by 2 independent board members. One of them is the share of the committee, as I indicated. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Isabella Vasconcelos with Bradesco. \nIsabella Vasconcelos: I just have a couple of questions on my end. Most of have been answered. But the first one on the pricing adjustment mechanisms that generated a negative impact in the second quarter. If you could comment how much of the volumes were exposed to the pricing adjustments and the expectations looking ahead into the third quarter, if we should expect another hit to result given volatility has remained high in commodity prices? And the second question, a quick one on those smelters if they have already been Board approved or not? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. On the pricing adjustment, let me explain what is -- what -- this is what we do. And this is an accounting process that we have to follow and it's [indiscernible] mandated. We look at the future prices curve, and we see some of our sales, particularly from concentrates such as copper concentrates, molybdenum concentrates are done with collection terms in 3 to 4 months ahead on time. So if we sell now that we are in July, we will be having a final price or that specific shipment 4 months from now, let's say, in October or November. \n Consequently, we have to do adjustments on the final price. By the way, we collect most of the money relatively in a short period of time, but the final price is something that we have to get once we have the final payment on the material. So we look at the future prices curve, and we adjust the sales that are not with final prices that are for, as I say, for future prices, for whatever is the position at the end of the month. \n Generally speaking, this affects our copper concentrate sales that have terms of 3 or 4 months ahead- in time, for the later part of the year and the molybdenum sales that have also -- that kind of sales conditions. Now concentrate sales are about 25% of our total sales for copper and in molybdenum, it's all sold as a concentrate. So this is affecting mainly molybdenum and a portion of our copper sales. However, when we have a significant variance in prices as was the case in the second quarter, we initiated the quarter with prices over $4 per pound, and we closed it very close to to $3.50 or so. That's where you have to make an adjustment that is as strong as I mentioned. \n I think we're already past the worst part of it -- but that's my personal view, and it doesn't mean that it will be like that. It depends on how the market evolves in the next few months. On the news letters for Peru and Mexico, no, they have not been Board approved. The company has made a very detailed review, the technology, on the cost we believe that there is good economic value for the company in moving forward with these 2 investments. But so far, they have not been bore to proof. \nIsabella Vasconcelos: Great. That's very clear. And in terms of timing for Board approval, is there any field there or not? \nRaul Jacob: No. We are going to do during this part of the -- second part of the year, we'll do a full -- through full review on the CapEx projects that we have and make some adjustments, we'll most likely report on that on the next conference call. But so far, nothing has been set on specific dates for these kind of investments. \nIsabella Vasconcelos: Okay. Great. And in terms of the review of the CapEx, is it just for the smelters or for all of the projects that are currently under contract? \nRaul Jacob: All the projects, all the projects. We will report on that on the next conference call. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from [ Enrique Braga ] with Morgan Stanley. \nUnknown Analyst: I just have a quick one. If you could repeat your production guidance estimate -- your new estimates for the year? \nRaul Jacob: Sure. For production, it's 898,000 tons, for cash cost it's $0.86 per pound by year-end. $1.92 will be before credits and credits will be for $1.06. \nUnknown Analyst: I think you also mentioned silver, zinc and molybdenum during the presentation. Is that correct? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. For molybdenum, will be 25,700 tonnes, for zinc, 67,000 tons and for server, 19 million ounces. \nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue, sir. Yes, sir. You can continue with any final remarks. One moment, please. We don't have any other questions, sir. \nRaul Jacob: Hello, [ Carmen ]? \nOperator: Yes, sir. Thank you for joining everybody. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, [ Carmen ], and good morning to everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation's Second Quarter Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board Member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market. We will then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Before we go into the details of the second quarter of this year, let me mention that our financial results have been impacted by some unusual circumstances. This scenario has been compounded by 3 major factors: increases in cost for fuel, power and some other operating materials due to inflation, a drop in copper prices that affected results for the quarter as well as open sales through a significant mark-to-market adjustments, which led sales to drop $173.5 million, mark-to-market is our required accounting method to reflect the fair value of sales that have no final price due to quotational periods in the future time. \n In other words, when prices drop, we have to adjust sales that we have not collected. The value of these sales are the ones that are reflected in our financials. And as a consequence, we have this $173.5 million adjustment. Our third part, so, is that quarterly results were also affected by 25,624 tons decrease in copper production at our Peruvian operations, attributable to the stoppage at Cuajone and lower ore grades. To avoid [indiscernible] event, production losses were temporarily offset with copper purchase from third parties, albeit at a higher cost. \n Finally, net sales were affected by lower sales volumes due to an uptick in the finished goods inventory translated into $105.2 million sales reduction. Now let's focus on the copper market. In the second quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased 2% from an average of $4.40 per pound in 2021 to $4.32 in this quarter. However, during the month of June, we had a significant drop in copper prices down to its current level of between $3.30 and $3.40 per pound. A concern for a simultaneous recession in the U.S., Europe and China is dominated in the market and consequently affecting copper prices. \n These years are based upon the following impacts, the consistent increment in interest rates by the Fed, the [ SCB ] and other relevant central banks. The slowdown of the Chinese economy due to COVID-19 lockdowns and a minus 31% reduction in construction activities year-on-year. Even though these are issues that concern us, we should note that the most relevant market intelligence houses for the copper market, are expecting balance or small deficit for 2022 in the copper market. \n This assumes also that we're assuming that demand will grow between 1% and 2.5% this year, particularly in terms of [ capital ] consumption in the U.S. There is uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, which together represent about 40% of the total copper supply. The major warehouses have not reported a relevant increase in copper inventories. Just to give you an idea, the sum of the London Metal Exchange COMEX, Shanghai and bonded warehouses in China, altogether represent as of June 30, 80 days -- 8-days of consumption at relatively low level of refined material available. We believe the economic slowdowns in the U.S., China and Europe have temporarily weakened the demand for copper and are driving reductions in current prices. \n It is important to emphasize that copper trace a leading role in the global shift between -- which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper will be strong in the long term. In this scenario, we believe the current cycle of low prices should be [ shortly ]. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 78% of our sales in the second quarter of 2022. Copper production registered a decrease of 12.1% in the second quarter. In a quarter-on-quarter terms to spend 208,428 tons. Our quarterly results reflect a 25.3% drop in production in Peru, which was triggered by a production loss of 9,339 tons at the Cuajone Mine. This growth was primarily attributable to a 54-day mine stoppage and secondarily to a decrease in ore grades at both Toquepala and La Caridad. On a year-on-year basis, copper production fell 11.1% in 2022 to stand at 422,908 tons. \n Regarding the Cuajone stoppage, on April 30 of this year, the Peruvian government issued a Ministerial Resolution to set up a 3-party roundtable or dialogue with members of the community, government and company officials to better understand all parties concerned. As of today, 9 roundtable meetings and 3 direct meetings with this community has been held. The company has proposed plans to invest in social programs and address the needs voiced by the communities and SCC has indicated interest in purchasing land near the Cuajone operations to establish a buffer zone to protect installations and production down the line. The company strongly believes that the program that we have proposed will make meaningful and sustainable contributions to the communities progress and wellbeing. Each efforts will be complemented by a positive impact through the Social Investment for Taxes mechanism, known in Spanish as obras por impuestos, which will allow SPCC to fund public investments in necessary public infrastructure and credit these expenditures against its taxes. \n For 2022, we expect to produce 898,200 tons of copper, a decrease of 3% compared to our 2022 plan of 972,000 tons. We expect our copper production to bounce back in 2023, reaching 971,000 tons of production as we get the Peruvian production back on track and generate new production through our Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrator project. \n For molybdenum, it represented 8.6% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of 2022, and is currently our first byproduct. Molybdenum prices averaged $18.30 per pound in the quarter compared to $13.89 in the second quarter of 2021. This represents an increase of 31.7% in time. Molybdenum production decreased by 9.4% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter to the same period of 2021. This was mainly driven by a decrease in production at the Cuajone operation. La Caridad and Toquepala mines also decreased their production due to lower ore grades mainly in the case of Cuajone, it was the Cuajone stoppage. These results were partially offset by higher production at Buenavista. \n On a year-on-year basis, molybdenum production fell 5.4% in 2022 after production fell at Cuajone and Caridad and was partially offset by an increase in Buenavista and Toquepala mines production. For this year, 2022, we expect to produce 25,700 tons of molybdenum. We believe that for the molybdenum market, prices will be supported by lower exports from China and Russia that are maintaining this market in [indiscernible]. For silver, it represented 4.3% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2022, with an average price of $22.65 per ounce in the quarter, a decrease of 15.4% from the second quarter of 2021 price. Silver is currently our second byproduct. Mine sugar production decreased by 4.3% in the second quarter of this year compared vis-a-vis the same period of 2021 after production of [indiscernible] Toquepala, Cuajone and La Caridad. This was partially offset by an increase in production at the Inca, the Buenavista mine. Refined sugar production increased 1.1% in the second quarter of this year, mainly due to an increase in production at our La Caridad and Inca refineries. \n In 2022, we expect to produce 18.9 million ounces of silver, in line with our 2021 production level. Zinc represented 3.5% of our face value in the second quarter of 2022, with an average price of $1.78 per pound in the quarter, a 34.8% increase from the same period of 2021. Zinc mine production decreased by 11.5% quarter-on-quarter and total 15,141 tons. This was primarily driven by lower production at Charcas and San Martin mine. Refinancing production decreased by 14.8% in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021. \n For this year, 2022, we expect to produce 66,900 tons of zinc in line with 2021 production. Looking at our financial results. For the second quarter of 2022, sales were $2.3 billion. This is $590 million lower than sales for the second quarter of 2021 or 20.4% lower sales. Of this amount, $173.5 million are explained by the mark-to-market adjustments, 89.3% by the 9,339 tons of Cuajone production loss in the quarter, $117.8 million by lower sales due to lower ore grade at the Peruvian operations and $105.2 million for 11,000 tons of finished products in inventory. \n Copper sales volume decreased by 16.3%, while value decreased by 23.4% in a scenario of lower prices, mainly as a result of the adjustment that I already mentioned and the reduction in volumes indicated. Regarding our main by-products, we had lower sales of molybdenum due to lower volume, partially compensated by better prices. In the case of silver, sales decreased due to lower prices and volume for zinc sales remained stable with the lower volume compensated by the prices. Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $276.5 million or 22.6% when compared to the second quarter of 2021. \n Main cost increments has been in Mexican workers' participation, purchased copper, diesel and fuel and operating and repair materials. Energy has also increased somehow. These cost increases were partially compensated by lower Peruvian workers' participation, translation difference and other factors. The second quarter of this year, adjusted EBITDA was $1,024 million. which represented a decrease of 45.2% regarding the $1,862.4 million registered in the second quarter of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin of -- in the second quarter stood at 44.3% versus 64.3% in the same period of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in the 6 months was $2.7 billion, a 21% lower than the same mark for the first half of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the 6 months of 2022 stood at 53.2% in versus 62.9% in the same period of 2021. \n Cash cost. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before the product credit was $2.15 per ton in the second quarter of 2022. That is $0.32 higher than the value for the first quarter of 2022. This 17.4% increase in operating cash cost is a result of higher cost per pound from production cost, treating and refining charges and administrative expenses. This was partially compensated by higher premium on refined copper. Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of our product trade was $1.10 per pound in the second quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.54 higher than the cash cost of $55.5 that we had in the first quarter of this year. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $465.3 million or $1.05 per pound in the second quarter of 2022. These figures represent a 17.6% decrease when compared with the credit of $583.5 million or $1.275 per pound in the first quarter of this year. Net income in the second quarter of 2022 was $432.3 million, which represent a 53.7% decrease regarding the $932.7 million registered in the second quarter of 2021. \n The net income margin stood at 18.7% versus 32.2% in the same period of 2021. This is for the second quarter. On a year -- as mentioned before, our financial results this quarter has been impacted by unusual circumstances. Nonetheless, we believe Southern Copper is well positioned to leverage our strength in that challenging environment. Our strong financial position, low cash cost, operating cost efficiency programs and our significant copper reserves will let us whether both current and eventual circumstances. We remain fully committed to creating [ act ] value and positive impact for our shareholders and for all the communities where we operate. \n Cash flow from operating activities in the 6 months of 2022 was $1,130.5 million, which represented a decrease of 38.7% over the $1,844.2 million post in the 6 months of 2021. This effect was attributable to lower sales value and to a mark-to-market adjustment already indicated. Let me add to that, that in the first 2 quarters of the year, we have a structurally higher and increase in working capital that reduced our cash flow available in the first half of the year. Capital investments, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. \n Through the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. In 2022, we spent $224.6 million on capital investments, which reflected a 2.2% increase over the figure reported in 2021 and represented a 51.9% of net income this quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent $429.7 million on capital investments, which represented 35.3% of net income. Our current portfolio for approved projects in Peru totaled $2.8 billion, $1.6 billion of which has already been invested. If we include the Michiquillay $2.5 billion project and the chunk a $2.6 billion projects, our total investment program in Peru reflects a commitment of $7.9 billion. \n For Tia Maria in Arequipa, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of Islay province. Apart from these efforts we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay. \n In 2021, our Southern Copper fortified its relationship with the regional government and successfully overcome its opposition to project initiation. This new consensus were reflected in an agreement for social investment for taxes for projects relative to health facilities and roads. Our efforts to ensure the current and long-term welfare of the population in the area of influence of the Tia Maria project were recognized by several local associations, which send letters to the National Government to request project initiation. \n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for  the Islay province and the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We will make it a priority to hire local labels to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria construction. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenue in the Arequipa region. The company has made an offer to the Peruvian government to build the Paltiture dam, instead of a desalinization plant originally proposed to provide water for -- to both the project and the community. \n The dam will have a total capacity of 73 million cubic meters of which the company will use a maximum of 10 million cubic meters. The remaining 63 million will be for community use. The dam is built, will require a much higher investment than the $100 million budget planned for the desalinization plan. Nevertheless, the company believes that by increasing the water supply, it will generate more capable benefits for local communities. We expect the Peruvian government to continue to acknowledge the significant progress the project has made on the social front and the important contributions that Tia Maria will generate for Peru's economy and consequently, take the necessary steps to provide SCC with adequate support to initiate construction. \n Los Chancas is a greenfield project located in Apurimac, Peru. It's a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposits. Current estimates of indicated copper mineral resources are 98 million tons of oxide with a copper content of 0.45% and 52 million tons of sulfide with a copper content of 0.59%. The Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The estimated capital investment is $2.6 billion, and the project is estimated to begin operating in 2027. \n In February of this year, a group of legal miners occupied parts of the land of the project and started to produce copper with a low-scale artisan process. On May of 31st of this year, a group of people attacks he project mining camps causing a fire and completely destroyed installations. There were no fatalities to regret. As of today, these illegal miners are working in the zone. The company expects strong action from the authorities to restore the land to the company so that it can continue to develop the project. \n For the Michiquillay project, in June of 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru. The company has created a multi-disciplinary management team to plan the development of these projects. As part of this plan, the company has established venues of contact with the local and regional authorities and communities to promote programs for sustainable development in the area. In 2021, the company signed a social agreement with the Michiquillay and the Encan\u0303ada Communities. And on October 1, 2021, the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the semi-detailed Environmental Impact Study for project. Social agreements with the Michiquillay and the Encan\u0303ada Communities represent an opportunity to improve the quality of life of the residents of those committed via our strong social program and backed by a solid framework for technical work at the project level. \n At the end of June, the project has all the required permits for exploration activity. These events are important steps that will allow Southern Copper to initiate an in-depth exploration program in this quarter, the third quarter of 2022. Michiquillay is a world-class mining project with inferred mineral resources of 2,288 million tons with an estimated copper grade of 0.43%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tons of copper per year, along with byproducts of molybdenum, gold and silver for an initial mine life of more than 25 years and at a competitive cash cost. We estimate an investment of approximately $2.5 billion will be required and expect production to start by 2028. Michiquillay will become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region, generate new jobs for the local communities and contribute with taxes and royalties to the local, regional and national governments. \n For our Mexican projects, we have to Buenavista Zinc project, which is located within the Buenavista facility in Sonora and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the engineering study and in order to continue with the project, stronger preventive measures to combat COVID-19 has been put in place. Procurement has progressed 99%, and all main equipment is on site. Construction site works are in progress. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. As of June of this year, we had invested $264.9 million in this project. We expect to initiate operations in the second half of 2022. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n For the Pilares project, also in Sonora, this is a project located 6 kilometers from La Caridad and consists of an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks has been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade, combining the 0.78% expected from Pilares with the 0.34% from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, of which we have invested $80.9 million as of June 30, 2022. \n The project has obtained all permits and licenses required, and we expect to begin production in the last quarter of 2022. El Pilar is a low-capital intensity copper greenfield project strategically located in Sonora, also in Mexico. It is approximately 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 317 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.249%. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. We expect production to begin in 2024, and the mine life is estimated at 13 years. The results from experimental paths in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study is finished and the company continues developing the project and site environmental activities. \n El Arco. it's a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California peninsula with ore reserves of over 1,230 million tons with an average ore grade of 0.40%. It has also 141 million tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.27%. The project includes an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request the environmental impact permit. Several years back, we began to acquire the rights to all relevant mining concessions in the area. This process was completed in 2020. \n As you all know, Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and informing the investment community and other stakeholders about our progress in this market. In line with best practice, on July 21, our Board of Directors approved the formation of a new Sustainability Committee chaired by an independent director, actually composed by independent directors. The purpose of the -- this committee is to support the Board of Directors of Southern Corporate Corporation in developing and monitoring the company's compliance with ongoing commitment to environment, health and safety, communities, human rights and corporate governance. This is a significant step in our pledge to a robust and strong environmental, social and government performance. \n Quoting the Chairman of our Board of Directors in the letter that contains the 2021 sustainable development report of our holding, Grupo Mexico: \"A business model focused on responsible and transparent management in the social, economic and environmental spheres are essential to guarantee sustainable development\". S&P Global has recognized SEC sustainability efforts by including it in a new index, S&P/ Bolsa de Valores de Lima Peru General ESG, as of April of this year. \n This index is the first of its kind in the Peruvian market and recognizes a total of 17 companies that need high standards for environmental, social and governance management. In light of its improvement in the realm of ESG, ESP has also upgraded the Company's Sustainability Assessment, which rose from 50 over 100 points in 2020 to 61 over 100 points in 2021. This is a 22% increase. These results led to our inclusion in Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the MILA region in 2019, and we have also been included in the 2022 Sustainability Yearbook. \n We aim to improve our sustainability management and performance to ensure that we maintain and continuously improve our sustainability ratings. Certification of our environmental and occupational health and safety management systems allows the company to reinforce a preventive culture that is aligned with best international practices. We continue to make progress in our quest to achieve ISO 45001 and 14001 certifications. \n During the second quarter of 2022, the Maritime Terminal of Guaymas, Mexico received ISO 45001 certification, and the Charcas unit in Mexico became the first of our underground mines to obtain ISO 14001 certification. Given the importance of water for our operations and the broader perspective of climate change, the company recently appointed a Water Resources Director at the executive level, whose main function will be to coordinate the actions needed to promote water management at all our operations and ensure our place as a responsible partner in the regional management of these available results. \n SCC seeks sustainability by managing different fronts, the Metallurgical Complex in Sonora where we smelt and refined material mine from the region, was recognized in the ranking of the 10 Best Places to Work for Women. With this recognition, this plant has consolidated its position as the employer of choice for the best professionals in the country and has strengthened an organizational culture based on safety, predictability and employee trust. This industrial complex was also given the 2021 National Export Award in the category of large industrial exporting companies for its contribution to foreign trade and international business in the country. This distinction recognizes SCC's responsible production of essential raw materials, environmental presentation efforts and the economic benefits and support it provides to bolster the well-being of workers and their families. \n In Peru, a couple of weeks ago, the Prime Minister joined us for the inauguration of the Cularjahuira dam at a cost of $11.5 million, which was the fruit of a joint investment between the company and government authorities and the highland community of Camilaca. This project will help us strengthen our cultural activities in the province of Candarave near our Toquepala operations and will be complemented by work on a new Callazas dam at an estimated cost of $35 million, which SCC hopes to finance through the Social Investments for Taxes or obras por impuestos in Spanish. This is a mechanism that allow us to credit to our taxes, investments in social infrastructure. \n While these process and these efforts are evolving in the context of market by record highs for the company's tax contributions to the regional government of Moquegua and Tacna in 2021. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the Company's policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. \n Accordingly, as announced to the market on July 21st the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.75 per share of common stock, payable on August 25 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 11, 2022. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. Yes. Thank you for your question, Tina. Well, as you will mention, we were impacted by a reduction in production in the second quarter, resulting in among other reasons, but mainly for 2, it was driven by 2 factors: the Cuajone stoppage that affected the first 23 days of April. And the second factor was the ore grades that were -- are lower, particularly at the Peruvian operations and also at a La Caridad a little bit in Mexico. The ore grade, it's a factor that we indicated to the market a while ago. This year, we were expecting to produce less than last year due to ore grades decays for a temporary base in the case of our operations. \n The unexpected factor was the Cuajone stoppage. Now Cuajone is currently working at full capacity. We have reviewed our program for the year, our production program for the year. And we have made an adjustment, as I mentioned in the production profile that we have, we are expecting now to produce 898,000 tons of copper for the full year, and we have produced already 423,000 round numbers. So we're expecting to produce for the remaining of 2022, 475,000 tons of copper. This will come from different sources, but mainly, we will be recuperating the production at the Cuajone operation. We have reviewed our operating plans, particularly at the Toquepala mine, and we're improving a little bit our production for this year. \n And with that, we are expecting to get to our expectation of 598,000 tonnes. Now cost guidance for the third and fourth quarter, well, I think we're all seeing that fuel prices are decreasing slowly, a little bit when compared to what we had in the first and particularly the second quarter. More production will allow us to distribute the fixed cost on a much lower weight per ton of copper. So we are expecting to have a better cost per pound for the second part of the year. Overall, we're expecting to have a cash cost by year-end of $0.86 per pound for the full year. \n And this is based on the improvement in production plus better also by production because they have been also affected by -- in the case of Cuajone, molybdenum and silver were affected by [indiscernible] based on the improvement in production, plus better also by problems of production because they have been also affected by -- in the case of Cuajone, molybdenum and silver were affected by that. Since we had to stop some days in the second quarter, the Ilo smelter, we had a reduction in sulfuric acid production as well and some other material that was passed to all refineries. So we're expecting for quarters 3 and 4 of this year having a much better performance as what we have seen for the second quarter. Yes. We have -- I mentioned that while during the presentation that in the first and second quarter of the year, the Company usually has an increase in working capital, consequently reducing our cash flow from operations. If I look at the second quarter, of this year, and you can see that as well, cash from operations was $641.9 million. The expenses that we have in the second quarter are usually the paying of the profit sharing for the Mexican workforce. And on some taxes that are paid in Peru. \n In total, this year, for instance, that amount was $255 million. On top of that, we had lower revenues due to the inventory buildup of finance products that we already mentioned. So if you think about, we have about $400 million that are at or were asked at to working capital in the second quarter and that obviously, that affected our cash position. We don't expect that to be as strong as it has been the case in the second quarter for quarters #3 and 4, but at the same time, we're currently in a different price environment. \n So we believe that we will have a much higher cash generation but aligned with the new price set that we're seeing now as we speak. [indiscernible] We expect to close the year with $1.92 per pound of cash cost before byproduct credits. Okay. Thank you very much for your questions, Carlos. Okay. I don't agree with your first statement of no progress on the Buenavista Zinc in the last quarter because we're currently working, I mean, building the plant, once a month, we review at the management level, we review the advancement in the project. And quite clearly, we're on the civil works of the project, we already have all the equipment -- pretty much all the equipment, as you mentioned, in 99% and some of the total engineering and the equipment, the procurement is also well advanced. So what we are seeing is that the project is moving forward at a good pace. \n We had a delay in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemia, but now it's moving forward at a very good pace. We're expecting it to initiate production in the second half of next year. And we will be giving a more specific period once we approach to the end of the construction phase of the project. For Tia Maria, well, this is a proposal that the company is making to the authorities and the community to build a dam that would provide water for the communities as well as water for the project will take a minor portion of the water and the remaining will be available for the community and the particularly Tambo Valley population. \n We are -- we believe that circumstances are evolving in a very positive fashion for Tia Maria in Arequipa and in the Islay area. That's where we're seeing a very significant progress. We think that the national government can do its part by joining this process, but we're not seeing that so far. \n And regarding your final point on purchase concentrates. Well, we don't expect to buy it as we have done through the second quarter and the first quarter of this year. It was just -- as I mentioned, the -- and during the presentation of results, it was more -- was driven -- we didn't want -- we don't want to have to call for a force majeure. That's why we -- in order to comply with our contracts, we acquire copper concentrates from third parties, particularly from Peru. And we use that material for feeding our Ilo smelter and refinery so we can back our contracts that allow us to continue our flow of revenues and so on at the cost of higher cost because, as you know, purchase concentrates are paid at market prices in certain discounts, while our production is at cost. \n For the next quarters, we will be -- let me mention also that we are long both in Mexico and Peru in copper concentrates. So we produce much more copper concentrates than our smelting and refining capacities, both in Mexico and Peru. So generally speaking, we are not buying significant amounts or no buying purchased copper from third parties at all. And that's what we expect to do in the second half of the year. And that will be one of the factors that will help our cost control in the second half of 2022. Yes. And some of these -- if you look at what we have acquired last year in the first half was 4,300 tons of copper from third parties. It's a very small amount. I mean, it's about 1% of our total production. It's a very small amount. So we don't have to -- we will most likely come back to that regarding copper concentrates and copper from third parties. Yes, I do Fernando. Thank you for your question. Let me be very specific. For the year -- for the full year, we expect to close the year with a cash cost of $0.86, composed by $1.92 cash cost before credits and credits for $1.06. For next year, we're expecting to have $1.82, keep in mind that we will have more production coming from Pilares and Buenavista Zinc next year. And our cash cost at the end of the year will be $0.89 per pound. And it will be at about that level up to the beginning of -- up to 2026 when we will have a slightly higher cash cost of close to $1. And then come back until we will come back to about that, the $0.86, $0.90 per pound range when we will get the benefit of the new projects that -- particularly the greenfield projects such as El Arco, well, Buenavista, [indiscernible] Los Chancas, Tia Maria and Michiquillay. Yes. The straight answer to your question is yes. we expect to have lower grades because we're moving into areas of the mine, particularly the Peruvian operations, where ore grades are lower and this will allow us to get to areas where the ore grades will be higher next year. That's -- it's part of our mining plan, which we're following through this year. And we advised on this -- well, 2 years ago, actually, we indicated that we will have a slowdown in our copper production due to lower grades. And that's -- the bounce back is expected for next year. I really -- let me mention what we're expecting is that for 2023, we should be producing 971,000 tons of copper, for 2024, 1,047,000 tons, for 2025, 1,100,000 tons. That's quite correct. At the very beginning of the stoppage because the stoppage was a result of the committee taking the water facilities that supply water for Cuajone. So the concentrator and the plant, generally speaking, the mine were not affected directly. But not having water, it was impossible to operate, the concentrator and the other facilities. So we did some advanced maintenance in our Cuajone facilities at the first phase of the stoppage. And we believe that, that will be helpful for producing a little bit more than what we expect in our original plans for quarters 3 and 4 of this year. \n In total, in the second quarter, the Cuajone mine was stopped by 20 days, and we received the order facilities and the railroad line on April 21 and 3 days after that, we were operating at full capacity. Yes. Hold on a second, please. Okay. Let me start by the last question. We're considering Pilares, Buenavista Zinc and El Pilar as well as a partial -- as well as a partial production of Tia Maria, that's for 2025. Okay. Now regarding your first question, let me clarify this. We, in Peru, are operating now at the northern part of the Atacama Desert. So we are in an area where water, generally speaking, is relatively scarce. We have water scarcity, generally speaking. That's why we are focusing in our operations, in trying to improve our water recycling and water savings. Now having said that, what I mentioned a while ago in some other conference calls is that there is enough water in the area for providing the Tia Maria project with water. However, given the pattern of agriculture, crops that are produced in this area, in Islay province, it's a strong in very good quality of rice production. Well, as you know rice is a water-intensive crop. So considering that, there is -- there are some months of the year where there is some stress, water stress, given the pattern of agricultural production of the area. That's why we're at [ press ], dam as the one that we are proposing to the government could be of help. \n On top of that, there are the certain areas that may be irrigated with the extra water that the dam will provide. And that is where the opportunity. It's therefore, the population of this area. Regarding Sonora, where we are doing a very -- as I mentioned before, the company has appointed a high-level Water Management Director in order to review the water supply for the company. But -- as important as it is to be sure that we have the water that we require for our operations. It is also extremely important to be a partner in developing new water sources and water conservation for the whole areas where we operate. And that's the idea behind pointing a high-level, a high-rank position in water management at the company that is certainly looking at the Sonora water situation where there is some water stress. \n We're currently securing water sources for our operations, but we will live as I say, we can be a cooperative partner for other efforts on a regional level, both in Sonora where we have our open-pit operations as well as some other parts in the Mexican Republic as well as at the southern part of Peru, where we have the Toquepala and Cuajone operations currently. Yes. That's a very good depth. Thank you very much for your comment Alfonso and that high rank position, it's also, as I mentioned, joined by a high-level ESG committee form and at the Board -- by our Board and composed by 2 independent board members. One of them is the share of the committee, as I indicated. Okay. On the pricing adjustment, let me explain what is -- what -- this is what we do. And this is an accounting process that we have to follow and it's [indiscernible] mandated. We look at the future prices curve, and we see some of our sales, particularly from concentrates such as copper concentrates, molybdenum concentrates are done with collection terms in 3 to 4 months ahead on time. So if we sell now that we are in July, we will be having a final price or that specific shipment 4 months from now, let's say, in October or November. \n Consequently, we have to do adjustments on the final price. By the way, we collect most of the money relatively in a short period of time, but the final price is something that we have to get once we have the final payment on the material. So we look at the future prices curve, and we adjust the sales that are not with final prices that are for, as I say, for future prices, for whatever is the position at the end of the month. \n Generally speaking, this affects our copper concentrate sales that have terms of 3 or 4 months ahead- in time, for the later part of the year and the molybdenum sales that have also -- that kind of sales conditions. Now concentrate sales are about 25% of our total sales for copper and in molybdenum, it's all sold as a concentrate. So this is affecting mainly molybdenum and a portion of our copper sales. However, when we have a significant variance in prices as was the case in the second quarter, we initiated the quarter with prices over $4 per pound, and we closed it very close to to $3.50 or so. That's where you have to make an adjustment that is as strong as I mentioned. \n I think we're already past the worst part of it -- but that's my personal view, and it doesn't mean that it will be like that. It depends on how the market evolves in the next few months. On the news letters for Peru and Mexico, no, they have not been Board approved. The company has made a very detailed review, the technology, on the cost we believe that there is good economic value for the company in moving forward with these 2 investments. But so far, they have not been bore to proof. No. We are going to do during this part of the -- second part of the year, we'll do a full -- through full review on the CapEx projects that we have and make some adjustments, we'll most likely report on that on the next conference call. But so far, nothing has been set on specific dates for these kind of investments. All the projects, all the projects. We will report on that on the next conference call. Sure. For production, it's 898,000 tons, for cash cost it's $0.86 per pound by year-end. $1.92 will be before credits and credits will be for $1.06. Yes. For molybdenum, will be 25,700 tonnes, for zinc, 67,000 tons and for server, 19 million ounces. Hello, [ Carmen ]?"

With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the first quarter of 2022 as well as answer any questions that you might have. \n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. \n Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of the information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP. Now I'll pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Victor. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation First Quarter of 2022 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member. \n In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market. We will then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Now let's focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the first quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $3.85 per pound in the first quarter of 2021, up to $4.53 per pound, that is an 18% price increase. Currently, we're seeing prices in the range of $4.30 to $4.40 per pound, which remains higher than the 2021 average of $4.23 per pound. And those are positive outlook for the company. \n We believe the following factors are influencing the market. The first place, we are assuming that demand will grow between 2% to 2.5% in this year, particularly in terms of copper consumption in the U.S. An economic slowdown is expected in China due to recent COVID-19 outbreak. \n Regarding supply, we understand that uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, which together represent 40% of the world supply of copper, it's affecting the market. \n Chile registered a production drop of 7% in the first quarter of this year. While in Peru, 13% of its production is currently at risk due to the social conflicts in the Iquitos. In addition to these supply disturbances, Russia's copper supply, which is about 400,000 tons per year has been shut out of the market due to the invasion of Ukraine. Considering these factors, the most relevant market in Peruvian houses for the copper market are expecting a market deficit for this year of about 100,000 tons for [indiscernible].\n Looking at our production profile, copper represented 78% of our sales in the first quarter of this year. Copper production registered a decrease of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and reached 214,480 tons in this quarter. \n This was attributable to the effect of the stoppage of the corporations at Cuajone, which led production to fall 15,278 tons from the level reported in the same quarter of 2021. In addition to the Cuajone event, we experienced temporary reduction in production at our Toquepala and La Caridad mines due to lower ore grades and recoveries. These results were partially offset by a higher production at Buenavista.\n Let me focus on the Cuajone stoppage that affected us during the past quarter. On February 28 of this year, a minority group of approximately [ 17 individuals ] from the community of Tumilaca, Pocata, Coscore and Tala. Let me say that it is 1 community that has 4 names and comprised 472 members. These protesters seized the facilities at the Vi\u00f1a Blanca water reservoir and cut off the water supply to the homes of approximately 5,000 people that live in Cuajone. These also affected the Cuajone operations. \n Prior to this illegal action, in February 18, the railway between Cuajone and Ilo was also blocked by a group of about 20 community members -- excuse me, please. After several weeks of several attempts by the authorities to restore order through dialogue, on April 20, the Peruvian government declared a state of emergency in the Moquegua region. \n On April 21, the protesters returned the installations of the Vi\u00f1a Blanca water reservoir and the railway to the company. SCC personnel immediately evaluated the damage caused to the facilities by acts of vandalism and took the necessary steps to resume production at the Cuajone mining unit. As of today, the Industrial railroad and the Cuajone mine concentrator and related facilities are operating at full capacity. \n This past Saturday, that is on April 30, the Peruvian government issued a Ministerial Resolution to set up a 3-party-round-table, including representatives of the state, community and the company to establish a dialogue to better understand all parties' concerns. \n The recognition of the fundamental rights of our employees and their families to safe drinking water and the fact that a formal dialogue process with the communities will shortly begin bodes well for a satisfactory solution for all concerns.\n We trust in the goodwill of all the parties to obtain agreements that benefit both the community and the company's employees. The initiation of work at Cuajone will contribute much needed revenues to the Peruvian government and the material region and bolster the company's efforts to drive development in Peru. \n For 2022, we expect to produce 895,800 tons of copper, which represents a decrease of 2.8% compared to the 2022 plan. Our plan for copper is for this year 922,000 tons. Annual production will continue to be affected by the stoppage at Cuajone and by the temporary reduction in ore grades and recoveries at the Peruvian operations. We expect our copper production to bounce back in 2023 to around 971,000 tons, as we get Peruvian production back on track and generate new production through our projects of Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrated. \n For molybdenum, it represented 10% of the company sales in the first quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices average almost $19 per pound in the quarter compared to the $11.19 that we had in the same quarter of last year. This represents a significant increase of about 70% in molybdenum prices. \n Molybdenum production decreased by 1.5% in the first quarter, which was mainly driven by a decrease in production at both the Cuajone and Caridad mines due to lower grades in the case of Cuajone obviously, the impact of the blockage. And these results were partially offset by higher production at our Buenavista and Toquepala operations. \n We believe that prices for molybdenum will be supported by the lower exports that we're seeing from China, which is also affected by an uptick in delivery times and port congestion. We believe these factors will help maintaining prices at good levels through 2022. Silver represented 3.8% of our sales value in the first quarter of this year, with an average price of $24.05 per ounce in the quarter, a decrease of 8.5% from the same period of 2021.\n Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production decreased by 13.4% in this past quarter after production fell at Cuajone by 35%. We had also a reduction in silver production from Toquepala, IMMSA and La Caridad, and that was -- all of the reductions were partially offset by an increase in production at the Buenavista mines. Refined silver production increased 7% in the first quarter, mainly due to an increase in production at our La Caridad refinery. \n Looking into our zinc sales, they represented 3.6% of our total sales value with an average price of $1.70 per pound in the quarter. This is a 36% increase in prices -- I'm sorry, in sales wise. Zinc mine production decreased by 10.6% quarter-on-quarter, totaled 14,726 tons. This was primarily driven by lower production at Santa Barbara and San Martin and Charcas. \n Refined zinc production increased by 33.2% in the first quarter. And this was mainly explained by the bounce backing of refinery production after we had -- last year, we had an incident affecting our refinery at the beginning of the year that was sold through 2021 and we're back at full operating capacity at the San Martin and the San Luis Potosi refinery. \n Looking at our financial results. For the first quarter of this year, sales were $2.8 billion. This is $231 million higher than sales for the first quarter of 2001 sic [ 2021 ] or 9.1% increase in sales. Copper sales volume decreased by 13.4%, while value increased 1.8% due to better prices. As I'd say, prices increased by 18%. \n Regarding our main by-products, we reported higher sales of molybdenum, which increased by 63% due to better prices and partially offset by a decrease in volume. We have an uptick in zinc sales of 176% due to better prices and volume. \n In the case of silver, we have a decrease in sales of 24% due to lower prices and volume. Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $112.8 million or 9.6%. The main cost increment has been due to local currency appreciation, purchased copper, diesel and fuel, operating and repair material, explosive and exploration costs. These cost increases were partially compensated by lower inventory consumption and workers' participation. \n The first quarter of 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $1,678 million, which represented an increase of 8% with regard to the $1,554 million registered in the first quarter of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 60.7%, slightly lower than the 61.4% that we had in the same period of 2021. \n For cash cost, operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.83 per pound in the first quarter of this year. That is $0.01 lower than the value for the fourth quarter of last year, which was $1.84. This decrease in operating cash cost is a result of lower cost per pound from treatment and refining charges, higher premium and the aforementioned was partially offset by increases in the production cost and administrative expenses. \n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credit was $0.56 per pound in the first quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.20 lower and the cash cost of $0.76 that we had in the fourth quarter of 2021. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $583.5 million or $1.27 per pound in the first quarter of this year. \n These figures represent an 18% increase when compared with a trade of $539 million or $1.08 per pound for the fourth quarter of last year. Total credits have increased for zinc, silver and sulfuric acid and decreased for molybdenum when we compared the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2021. \n Net income in the first quarter of 2022 was $784.7 million, which represented a 2.7% increase when compared with the $763.8 million registered in the first quarter of 2021. The net income margin in the first quarter of this year was 28.4% versus 30.2% in the first quarter of last year. \n Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter was $820.7 million, which represented an increase of 5% over the $782.6 million posted in the first quarter of 2021. This improvement was attributable to strong cash generation at our operations resulting from higher sales and cost control efficiency. \n Looking into our CapEx investments. As we have mentioned before, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. \n In the first quarter of this year, we spent $205 million on capital investments, which reflected an 11.8% decrease compared to the same period of 2021. This quarter's -- or this past quarter's CapEx represented 26.1% of our net income for the year. \n Looking at our Peruvian projects, our current portfolio for projects approved for Peru totaled $2.8 billion, of which $1.6 billion has been already invested. If we include the up-and-coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion investment and Los Chancas $2.6 billion projects, our total investment program in Peru reflects a commitment of $7.9 billion. \n For the Tia Maria project located in the Arequipa region in Peru, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of the Islay province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, healthcare and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay. \n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and the Arequipa region. Given the current economic situation in Peru, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria construction. \n When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs to another 4,200. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes. \n Los Chancas in Apurimac. This is a greenfield project. It's located in this region of Apurimac in Peru. It's a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates of indicated copper mineral resources are 98 million tons of oxides with a copper content of 0.45% and 52 million tons of sulfides with a copper content of 0.59%. The Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The estimated investment for this project is $2.6 billion, and the project is expected to begin operations in 2027. \n In the first quarter, we continued to engage in social and environmental improvements for the local communities and work on the project's environmental impact assessment. \n For the Michiquillay program, Michiquillay is a world-class mining project with inferred mineral resources of 2.3 million tons -- billion tons with an estimated copper grade of 0.43%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tons of copper per year along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver for an initial life mine of 25 years and a competitive cash cost. We estimate that an investment of approximately $2.5 billion will be required for Michiquillay and expect production to start up by 2028. \n Michiquillay will become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region, generate new jobs for the local communities and contribute with taxes and royalties to the local, regional and national governments.\n The social agreement signed last year with the Michiquillay and the Enca\u00f1ada communities represent an opportunity to improve the quality of life of the residents of these communities via our strong social programs and backed by a social framework for technical work at the project level. These events are important steps that will allow Southern Copper to initiate an in-depth exploration program in the second quarter of this year. \n For the Mexican projects, we have the Buenavista zinc concentrator in Sonora. This project is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the engineering study and procurement has progressed 99% at all the main equipment, which is on site.\n Construction site works are in progress. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. As of March of this year, we have invested $240.5 million in this project. We expect to initiate operations in the second half of next year 2023. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n The Pilares project is located 6 kilometers from our La Caridad mine also in Sonora. This project consists of an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks have been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. \n This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade of the concentrator at La Caridad. We will obtain that by combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, of which we have invested $79.5 million as of March of this year. The project has obtained all permits and licenses required, and we expect to begin production in the last quarter of 2022. \n El Pilar, it's a low capital intensity -- low capital intensity copper greenfield project, which is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico. It's approximately away 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 317 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.25%. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as an open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. \n We expect production to begin in 2024, and the mine life is estimated at 13 years. The results from the experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study -- the basic engineer study is finished and the company continues developing the project and site environmental activities. \n El Arco, which is located in Baja California, is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the peninsula of Baja California. It has all reserves of over 1,230 million tons with an average ore grade of 0.40%. It has also 141 million tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.27%. The project includes an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request environmental impact permit. Several years back, we began to acquire the rights to all relevant mining concessions in the area, completing this process in 2020.\n SCC is committed to improving its ESG record that is environmental, social and governance by adopting best practices and informing the investment community and other stakeholders about our progress in these matters. In line with our sustainability strategy, we've registered ongoing improvement in our main sustainability indicators. \n In terms of safety, we reduced the accident rate of our own personnel and contractors by 22% in the last 3 years. As far as the main environmental indicators are concerned, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by more than 10% and increased the efficiency of the freshwater consumption in the concentrator by 4% over the period.\n In social matters, the population served through our community programs has tripled, while we continue to strengthen the mechanisms for listening to and addressing concerns. In order to provide certainty to our investors and stakeholders, we present our progress regarding third-party validation of our environmental and social practices. \n Efforts to certify our occupational health and safety management systems and in the international standard, ISO 45001 and our environmental management systems under ISO 14001 are underway at all our mining units.\n In the first quarter of this year, the Santa Barbara and San Martin mines obtained ISO 45001 certification. And the Caridad mine and the Lime Plant in Sonora, ISO 14001 certification.\n Regarding our climate change management in 2021, Grupo Mexico rose 2 levels in the evaluation of the carbon disclosure project, going from Level C to Level B, which positions the company above the average for the sector and region. The communities surrounding our operations in Peru comprise dozens of small towns that live between the high Andean desert region and the coast. We continue to address the needs and challenges relative to the water supply, education and employment.\n Investments in infrastructure for water supply standout representing 70% of the $93.6 million invested in the last 10 years. In the first quarter of this year, we completed the construction of the Cularjahuira dam located in the province of Candarave. This is in the area of influence of our Toquepala mine. This facility will start up to 2.6 million cubic meters of water to irrigate 500 hectares of agricultural land and will directly benefit 585 families of local farmers.\n Regarding dividend, as you know, it is a company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. \n Accordingly, as announced to the market on April 28, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1.25 per share of common stock. This is payable on May 31 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 17, 2022.\n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. \nCarlos de Alba: My first question has to be with Cuajone. And if you could clarify what are the communities that stopped the operation -- or maybe want? And is it likely that we can find a sustainable solution to the conflict, given obviously what we're for [indiscernible] very painful in the current situation. \n Also related to the topic, the cost performance was quite good, so positively surprising given what happened there in the last month of the quarter. But what are the prospects for cost and the potential impact from the Cuajone stoppage in the second quarter? And how do you see cost in the remaining year?\n  And then finally, still in Peru on -- my last question, sorry for asking 3 that is sort of related. From a long-term perspective, how is the company seeing the development of Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in light of the negative experience and the challenges that the company has seen in Cuajone, which obviously is a big question mark on overall in Peru? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you very much for your questions, Carlos. Okay. The community indicated -- on the Cuajone conflict, the community indicated that the company been operating lands that were property of the community, and they want compensation for that. What they are requesting, it's a compensation of $5 billion in U.S. dollars. For the use of this land, they claim that it goes through the second half of last year -- last century up to this one as well.\n As far as we understand, and we have all the titles in order to prove it they are wrong, the company has been operating land -- let me -- just for a well understanding of this matter to all the listeners at this call explain how the Cuajone -- the Cuajone mine was developed in the second half of the last century. \n In 1969, the company signed a contract with the Peruvian government at that time. And the Peruvian government, they gave a concession to operate and open up the Cuajone mine using state-owned lands. All the lands that we received at that time were state lands. It was not community land, and we have all the titles in order to prove that. So we believe that we will explain this to the local community.\n I'd like to add that at the beginning of the current -- of this century, about 2006, members from this community sued the company for the same reason and the Peruvian Supreme Court after a process -- a legal process indicated that we were right and fix the limits of the areas of the old land that the company received at the beginning of the Cuajone mine operations.\n Looking at your second question, cost performance or the prospect or the impact of the Cuajone stoppage flow, we already mentioned in our press release. We mentioned that during the first quarter, we have lost some land -- some production -- copper production to the Cuajone stoppage. \n As you know, this was started on February 28 and went all the way down to April 21. We are estimating that about 30,000 tons of additional production of Cuajone was lost in the second quarter of this year. That will certainly affect our production profile in the second quarter. We have been using copper concentrate from a local supplier and our Buenavista copper production. As you all know, Southern Copper is long concentrates both in Mexico and Peru. \n In the case of Peru, well, the Cuajone stoppage made us consume certain reserves that we have at the Ilo smelter as well as the Cuajone operation of copper concentrate inventories. And once we finish with that, we acquired or we have sent copper concentrates from Buenavista to supply the Ilo requirement for production.\n Currently, we're expecting a cash cost in the range of where we are now. We have a very strong -- as you know, very strong response from by-products. And we expect to maintain our cash cost where it is at this point. We may have an impact in the total cost of sales due to the purchases of copper concentrate that we have made from our Buenavista production, but that will be an intercompany transaction. So at the end of the day, we expect to maintain our cash costs, as I say, where it is nowadays. \nCarlos de Alba: And that also applies to before by-products, cash cost, stable. \nRaul Jacob: Yes, yes. Well, actually, it should improve as we get all the volumes. Keep in mind that we are -- we have lost business in Peru that I mentioned in the 2 quarters. But we will be recuperating our production level this month. Actually, since about April 24, we were operating at full speed in Cuajone. So a few days off April and then back to normal in May and June.\n Now looking into your last concern, Carlos, the impact of this that this may have on Los Chancas and Michiquillay. Well, we believe that so far, we don't see -- we see no connection between these -- the Tia Maria matters on issues and what is happening in Los Chancas and Michiquillay.\n In Michiquillay, as you know, we have signed a social agreements with the 2 communities that are over there. Cajamarca is a mining region. They understand mining. They have a very well-trained workforce for mining activities. And we believe that so far, we have no concerns about that. In the case of Los Chancas, we are working on the environmental study that corresponds for this property. And we believe that we will be on time to develop them. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Thiago Lofiego from Bradesco BBI. \nThiago Lofiego: Raul, 2 maybe different questions here. Just on the capital allocation side, would you consider any M&A on zinc in Peru? Or any other potential opportunities on copper M&A maybe to accelerate growth in copper rather than executing those big projects?\n And then the second question is just on the volume outlook for the second quarter. Just -- I'm sorry if you already mentioned, but just to make sure here, should we expect lower sequential volumes in the second quarter due to Cuajone or you think you'll be able to make it up for the quarter? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. For the second quarter, let me start by your last question, Thiago. For the second quarter, we are expecting a loss in production of 13,000 tons. That's our current estimate. However, we will hopefully catch up at least partially on that. \n As I mentioned before, our plan for the year with 922,000 tons and currently we're expecting to produce 895,000 tons for 2022. So well, that's the total impact that we have for the Cuajone event, and that's basically it. \nThiago Lofiego: So Raul, the opportunity -- yes, go ahead, sorry. \nRaul Jacob: So a portion of that was absorbed in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we're expecting 13,000 tons in total to be absorbed. And that's basically it. Do you like to comment on this before I go to the M&A part of your questions? \nThiago Lofiego: Yes, very quickly. Regarding ore grades and recovery rates, so how should we think about the coming quarters? Any improvement on that front? \nRaul Jacob: Well, regarding ore grades, we're doing a little bit better in Mexico, in particular at Buenavista. The Peruvian operations, we knew from a few years back that we were expecting an ore-grade -- temporary ore grade for Cuajone and Toquepala. That's basically -- that's in the mine plan where we're doing some -- this year, we're doing some stripping on certain areas of both Cuajone and Toquepala that have lower ore grades, and that's why we do know that for the year, it's going to be, as I said, slightly lower than last year for Toquepala and lower -- well, excluding the impact of the stoppage in Cuajone, we will be pretty much at the same level that we had last year. But well, we have to consider that as part of our current situation.\n If I go to your M&A question for zinc or copper, the straight answer is, no, we are not looking into anything specific in these 2 metals in Peru. So -- but obviously, if there is a good opportunity, we will certainly review it and make a recommendation to our Board, if there is a good chance that we see a good opportunity on this. \nThiago Lofiego: If I may, a very quick follow-up here from the numbers you mentioned. You said 895,000 tons production for the year. I thought I had heard 922,000 before. What's the... \nRaul Jacob: Yes, that's the plan. That's the plan, Thiago. \nThiago Lofiego: 922,000? \nRaul Jacob: So at the beginning of the year -- yes, at the beginning of the year, we mentioned that our goal for this year, given the all grade reductions and recoveries that we are expecting, of that we were expecting at that time, it was 922,000 tons of copper production for the year. \n Well, if we include what happened in the first quarter, that number has decreased to 895,000 tons. We expect to be better and that -- but that is something that will be shown through the second quarter and the rest of the year. \nOperator: Next question on the line is Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. \nTimna Tanners: I wanted to just ask a little bit about the project pipeline. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we noticed that Pilares has moved out to the fourth quarter from kind of more second half guidance. And Buenavista was guided to second half of 2023. So just wanted to know what was causing some of those delays? \nRaul Jacob: In the case of Pilares, as you may imagine, well, we're currently acquiring some mining equipment, and there has been some delays in delivery times mainly related to COVID for Pilares. And so that's basically it. In the case of Buenavista, it's a better understanding of all the work that has to be done made us move slightly to the end of the year. In that case, for the second half of next year, the Buenavista zinc start up. That's basically it, Timna. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then just kind of asking a little more generically on the cost side, a lot of the miners have been talking about higher cost and challenge there. And I just was wondering, you've been able to keep it lower. But aside from obviously by-product credits, is there anything you're doing or that you could highlight for us that gives us confidence in keeping a lid on cost going forward? And can you talk about that a little? \nRaul Jacob: Sure. Well, there are 2 major comments. First, where are we seeing higher cost? And that's basically well fields in general and materials that are related to steel industry. That's where we're seeing significant price increases. Where we are not seeing that, it's in labor cost, I mean there are some cost increases, but not in the same range that we were seeing in, say, fuel. Labor costs or power, meaning by this electricity, which are not increasing as the inflationary trend that we see in some of the materials. So that's a general comment on where are we in this regard.\n Now we have been for many, many years, doing different programs to reduce our cost -- the cost impact of our operations. For instance, we have been replacing truck haulage by conveyor belt transportation of our mineral. And in that, we're basically replacing, well, the much higher cost that has moved a ton of mineral from the mine to the concentrator or to the dams areas of the operations. We're placing a much higher cost by truck loading, not only in operating costs, but also on CapEx by the most efficient one of conveyor belts. That's just to mention one way to control cost.\n The other one is the ones that we're using in some of our operations, which are the high-pressure grinding rolls, where we have installed these facilities in Peru as well as -- in the Peruvian operations, particularly. The high-pressure grinding rolls are as the main phase 2 roles that somehow break the mineral before it goes into the concentrators mills. And by doing that, we get a much faster milling process. \n We maintain the concentrators milling the material that they were designed to not -- rock harness is not affecting the milling process by using these facilities. And we're -- in general, we're acquiring new technologies that has been proved to work. This is very important. We are sure that what we are introducing, for instance, conveyor belt haulage or grinding rolls -- high-pressure grinding rolls or technologies that has been working that are known that will produce at cost saving impact in our operations.\n By doing that, we are somehow containing costs. In this past quarter, in particular, we have better premiums coming in our smelting and refining process. And that has somehow helped us to maintain our cash cost in line or decrease at least the  production cost -- the total cost of operations for cash cost purposes. Now over the long term, the goal is to be as efficient as we can, developing projects that are very, very good in terms of their characteristics. \n And I'd like to stress here that all the ore grades that we have for our SX-EW projects, for instance, are very high for this kind of projects. What I mean by that is that the cash cost that will result from, say, El Pilar and some other project that has SX-EW facilities will be very competitive because we are starting with a very good mineral base for development of this type of projects. So over the long term, we're expecting our cash cost to maintain its current characteristics of being, say, where we are today or slightly higher if material prices decrease a little bit. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos. \nJohn Tumazos: In Mexico and Peru in your communities, is there a significant increase in the last months in the poverty level, not among your employees, but the other people in the towns with the rise in energy and food prices? And I know you're not the government, but can government address those issues when some of the population has an economic shock like this? \nRaul Jacob: Thank you for your question, John. And the straight answer to it is, yes. They could do -- because at the same time, we're seeing -- I mean, let me make a general comment. The COVID-19 impact in both Mexico and Peru and worldwide has been not -- I mean we are not better off after COVID. It's exactly the contrary. And if you add to that, that a few related materials that are consumed are impacting in terms of inflation. \n That's where you have the -- well, the upsetness of many people in these 2 countries and worldwide as well. Now the government can do something to reduce that? Oh, certainly, they can, and we expect the government of both Mexico and Peru to address these matters.\n In the case of our Cuajone operation, we are initiating a dialogue process in the next few days. We expect to clarify the concerns that the committee have. But at the same time, we believe that these are our door-to-door neighbors, and we have to be in good shape with them. So we hopefully expect to have -- to return to what has been a good relationship with these communities in the last few years. \n And we think that the current moment for a mining country as Peru and for the mining industry in Mexico as well, are very positive. And the government will have the resources to put in place programs that should help to reduce the concern that local communities and families have about their current situation. \nJohn Tumazos: We know it's a very challenging time to manage any business today just survive and we congratulate you on your good work. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alfonso Salazar from Scotiabank. \nAlfonso Salazar: The question that I have is regarding the labor situation in La Caridad. There was a press article in Mexico saying that in the union [ the SINTTIA ] wanted to secure workers' participation in line with past levels -- past  [indiscernible] what the labor consists. And they wanted to not only for this year but future years as well. So I just wonder if you can comment on that, give us an update... \nRaul Jacob: Alfonso, please, I can't copy you. Could you repeat your question, please? \nAlfonso Salazar: Sure. Can you hear me better now? \nRaul Jacob: Yes, I do. \nAlfonso Salazar: Okay. Good. So the question that I have is regarding the labor situation in La Caridad. And I understand that the union [ the SINTTIA ] wanted to get workers participation in line with what the workers were having -- getting before the labor reform. I don't know if -- and they wanted not only for this year but to secure that it will continue over the coming years. Just wanted to know what's the situation there? If you can provide an update on -- whether it was a similar situation at the Buenavista mine? \nRaul Jacob: Well, as far as we understand there is some concerns on -- I mean, generally speaking, all mining operations are having -- all the workforce not only in Mexico or specifically in our Buenavista and Caridad are having some concerns that -- this is a general thing. We don't have nothing in particular to report about this Alfonso. \n As you know, we have a biannual review of salaries and working conditions in our Mexican operations. And we believe that this process will move on as usual, in good terms. We haven't had any strikes in Mexico since we solved the problems that we had with another union that is no longer in our operations nowadays. \nAlfonso Salazar: Okay. Fair enough. The second question that I have is regarding a follow-up on cost and the spend on CapEx because, yes, you have done a great job controlling cost increases. What about CapEx for the future projects? Because it has been pretty much the same CapEx figures that you provide for these projects over several years, and we see CapEx inflation as well. So it is likely that at the end, there could be some inflationary pressures on CapEx? \nRaul Jacob: Well, obviously, if there are higher fuel costs that should affect our cost of equipment, generally speaking. And in an inflationary environment, that is also something that we may expect. We haven't updated -- I mean, let me explain, the projects that are being under development we believe that CapEx cost will remain as reported.\n For instance, in the Buenavista zinc, we already acquired 99% of the equipment that we will be using in these projects. So that's basically it. In the case of Pilares, we are acquiring some tracks and shovels and so on for operating the mine. On those, we are seeing some cost increases, but still under the budget that we put in place for this project.\n In the case of El Pilar, where we are still doing -- well, we're looking at the quality of the mineral and how it works, and we are thinking about the form of the plan that the quality or the size of the plan that we're going to use for this project. We may have some inflation impact. But so far, we haven't run the numbers again.\n Now for the long-term greenfield projects that we have in Peru, we will be updating cost as we move on in time. But so far, if you see what happened this quarter, the company or the Board decided to increase the company's dividend to $1.25. That's -- it was formerly $1 in the prior quarters. The Board increased by $0.25. And the reason for that -- one of the reasons was that we made a review on the expected cost of -- for the next 5 years in our projects. \n And as a consequence, there was room for increasing our dividend to $1.25, and that's why the Board proceeding in that direction. So Obviously, as we have explained, we don't have any specific number for a dividend quarterly or given the rate for profits, for instance. \n But we do have a track record of not holding cash, which certainly means that we will send any cash that is perceived an extra cash for our revenue -- for our shareholders. And that's how we have proceeded. So even though we may have some higher costs in the future, we believe that so far, at this point, we are controlling CapEx expenditures, and we are seeing some opportunities to reward a little bit more our shareholders through the dividends. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Grant Sporre, Blomberg. \nGrant Sporre: It's actually a follow-up on a comment you made in the last question. Have you -- are you downgrading perhaps your CapEx expectations or your spend for this year? I think you previously guided to just around $1.5 billion. And in light of the higher dividend, is that still going to be $1.5 billion for this year? \nRaul Jacob: We decreased slightly our budget. As you've mentioned, we mentioned at the beginning of the year, our expectation was to spend $1,542 million. And currently, our expectation is $1,481 million. So that is a $61 million reduction in our CapEx for the year. But keep in mind that we don't only have higher copper prices, but our main by-product, which is molybdenum, it has almost doubled.\n I mean, it increased its price by 70% when you compare this quarter from, say, a year ago. So we are getting significant revenues -- higher revenues in by-products as well as in copper. And we are seeing this year's balance to have slightly higher cash from operations generation. \n Let me explain also that in the first quarter of this year, we have some once-a-year payments, mainly taxes in Peru and Mexico.  We have been paying the special mining tax in Mexico, which is on a yearly basis. In Peru, a portion of the income tax, a catch-up in the income tax for 2021 is paid in the first quarter of the year as well as the dividend tax. So we have once in a year payment in the first quarter and the worker participation in Peru as well that won't be there in the rest of the year.\n So when you do that, you see that you get a good cash flow for the remaining of 2022. And given the forecast for CapEx and so on, the market view, et cetera, the Board decided to increase the dividend from $1 to $1.25. \nGrant Sporre: Just a quick follow-up then. In terms of the profile of the CapEx spend, should we expect it to be second half weighted or weighted towards the fourth quarter? \nRaul Jacob: No, it's on the projects that we're currently that are country under construction where we're at full speed. For instance, on the zinc concentrator in Pilares, we're spending at full speed. While some other projects that are related to the duly projects such as acquisition of replacement of some equipment and so on, usually, those ones are getting a higher expense at the second half of the year, but that's something that it's like the common trend that we have had in some other years as well. \nOperator: I turn the call back over to your speakers for the closing remarks. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Victor. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for the first quarter of 2022 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report this quarter -- the second quarter of this year. Thank you very much, and have a very good day today. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Victor. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation First Quarter of 2022 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm accompanied by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO and Board member. \n In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market. We will then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Now let's focus on the copper market, the core of our business. In the first quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased from an average of $3.85 per pound in the first quarter of 2021, up to $4.53 per pound, that is an 18% price increase. Currently, we're seeing prices in the range of $4.30 to $4.40 per pound, which remains higher than the 2021 average of $4.23 per pound. And those are positive outlook for the company. \n We believe the following factors are influencing the market. The first place, we are assuming that demand will grow between 2% to 2.5% in this year, particularly in terms of copper consumption in the U.S. An economic slowdown is expected in China due to recent COVID-19 outbreak. \n Regarding supply, we understand that uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru, which together represent 40% of the world supply of copper, it's affecting the market. \n Chile registered a production drop of 7% in the first quarter of this year. While in Peru, 13% of its production is currently at risk due to the social conflicts in the Iquitos. In addition to these supply disturbances, Russia's copper supply, which is about 400,000 tons per year has been shut out of the market due to the invasion of Ukraine. Considering these factors, the most relevant market in Peruvian houses for the copper market are expecting a market deficit for this year of about 100,000 tons for [indiscernible].\n Looking at our production profile, copper represented 78% of our sales in the first quarter of this year. Copper production registered a decrease of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and reached 214,480 tons in this quarter. \n This was attributable to the effect of the stoppage of the corporations at Cuajone, which led production to fall 15,278 tons from the level reported in the same quarter of 2021. In addition to the Cuajone event, we experienced temporary reduction in production at our Toquepala and La Caridad mines due to lower ore grades and recoveries. These results were partially offset by a higher production at Buenavista.\n Let me focus on the Cuajone stoppage that affected us during the past quarter. On February 28 of this year, a minority group of approximately [ 17 individuals ] from the community of Tumilaca, Pocata, Coscore and Tala. Let me say that it is 1 community that has 4 names and comprised 472 members. These protesters seized the facilities at the Vin\u0303a Blanca water reservoir and cut off the water supply to the homes of approximately 5,000 people that live in Cuajone. These also affected the Cuajone operations. \n Prior to this illegal action, in February 18, the railway between Cuajone and Ilo was also blocked by a group of about 20 community members -- excuse me, please. After several weeks of several attempts by the authorities to restore order through dialogue, on April 20, the Peruvian government declared a state of emergency in the Moquegua region. \n On April 21, the protesters returned the installations of the Vin\u0303a Blanca water reservoir and the railway to the company. SCC personnel immediately evaluated the damage caused to the facilities by acts of vandalism and took the necessary steps to resume production at the Cuajone mining unit. As of today, the Industrial railroad and the Cuajone mine concentrator and related facilities are operating at full capacity. \n This past Saturday, that is on April 30, the Peruvian government issued a Ministerial Resolution to set up a 3-party-round-table, including representatives of the state, community and the company to establish a dialogue to better understand all parties' concerns. \n The recognition of the fundamental rights of our employees and their families to safe drinking water and the fact that a formal dialogue process with the communities will shortly begin bodes well for a satisfactory solution for all concerns.\n We trust in the goodwill of all the parties to obtain agreements that benefit both the community and the company's employees. The initiation of work at Cuajone will contribute much needed revenues to the Peruvian government and the material region and bolster the company's efforts to drive development in Peru. \n For 2022, we expect to produce 895,800 tons of copper, which represents a decrease of 2.8% compared to the 2022 plan. Our plan for copper is for this year 922,000 tons. Annual production will continue to be affected by the stoppage at Cuajone and by the temporary reduction in ore grades and recoveries at the Peruvian operations. We expect our copper production to bounce back in 2023 to around 971,000 tons, as we get Peruvian production back on track and generate new production through our projects of Pilares and Buenavista zinc concentrated. \n For molybdenum, it represented 10% of the company sales in the first quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices average almost $19 per pound in the quarter compared to the $11.19 that we had in the same quarter of last year. This represents a significant increase of about 70% in molybdenum prices. \n Molybdenum production decreased by 1.5% in the first quarter, which was mainly driven by a decrease in production at both the Cuajone and Caridad mines due to lower grades in the case of Cuajone obviously, the impact of the blockage. And these results were partially offset by higher production at our Buenavista and Toquepala operations. \n We believe that prices for molybdenum will be supported by the lower exports that we're seeing from China, which is also affected by an uptick in delivery times and port congestion. We believe these factors will help maintaining prices at good levels through 2022. Silver represented 3.8% of our sales value in the first quarter of this year, with an average price of $24.05 per ounce in the quarter, a decrease of 8.5% from the same period of 2021.\n Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production decreased by 13.4% in this past quarter after production fell at Cuajone by 35%. We had also a reduction in silver production from Toquepala, IMMSA and La Caridad, and that was -- all of the reductions were partially offset by an increase in production at the Buenavista mines. Refined silver production increased 7% in the first quarter, mainly due to an increase in production at our La Caridad refinery. \n Looking into our zinc sales, they represented 3.6% of our total sales value with an average price of $1.70 per pound in the quarter. This is a 36% increase in prices -- I'm sorry, in sales wise. Zinc mine production decreased by 10.6% quarter-on-quarter, totaled 14,726 tons. This was primarily driven by lower production at Santa Barbara and San Martin and Charcas. \n Refined zinc production increased by 33.2% in the first quarter. And this was mainly explained by the bounce backing of refinery production after we had -- last year, we had an incident affecting our refinery at the beginning of the year that was sold through 2021 and we're back at full operating capacity at the San Martin and the San Luis Potosi refinery. \n Looking at our financial results. For the first quarter of this year, sales were $2.8 billion. This is $231 million higher than sales for the first quarter of 2001 sic [ 2021 ] or 9.1% increase in sales. Copper sales volume decreased by 13.4%, while value increased 1.8% due to better prices. As I'd say, prices increased by 18%. \n Regarding our main by-products, we reported higher sales of molybdenum, which increased by 63% due to better prices and partially offset by a decrease in volume. We have an uptick in zinc sales of 176% due to better prices and volume. \n In the case of silver, we have a decrease in sales of 24% due to lower prices and volume. Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $112.8 million or 9.6%. The main cost increment has been due to local currency appreciation, purchased copper, diesel and fuel, operating and repair material, explosive and exploration costs. These cost increases were partially compensated by lower inventory consumption and workers' participation. \n The first quarter of 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $1,678 million, which represented an increase of 8% with regard to the $1,554 million registered in the first quarter of 2021. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 60.7%, slightly lower than the 61.4% that we had in the same period of 2021. \n For cash cost, operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.83 per pound in the first quarter of this year. That is $0.01 lower than the value for the fourth quarter of last year, which was $1.84. This decrease in operating cash cost is a result of lower cost per pound from treatment and refining charges, higher premium and the aforementioned was partially offset by increases in the production cost and administrative expenses. \n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credit was $0.56 per pound in the first quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.20 lower and the cash cost of $0.76 that we had in the fourth quarter of 2021. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $583.5 million or $1.27 per pound in the first quarter of this year. \n These figures represent an 18% increase when compared with a trade of $539 million or $1.08 per pound for the fourth quarter of last year. Total credits have increased for zinc, silver and sulfuric acid and decreased for molybdenum when we compared the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2021. \n Net income in the first quarter of 2022 was $784.7 million, which represented a 2.7% increase when compared with the $763.8 million registered in the first quarter of 2021. The net income margin in the first quarter of this year was 28.4% versus 30.2% in the first quarter of last year. \n Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter was $820.7 million, which represented an increase of 5% over the $782.6 million posted in the first quarter of 2021. This improvement was attributable to strong cash generation at our operations resulting from higher sales and cost control efficiency. \n Looking into our CapEx investments. As we have mentioned before, Southern Copper's investment philosophy is not based on the outlook for copper prices but on the quality of the assets that we operate and develop. Throughout the years, our strong financial discipline has consistently allowed us to make ongoing investments in our considerable asset portfolio. \n In the first quarter of this year, we spent $205 million on capital investments, which reflected an 11.8% decrease compared to the same period of 2021. This quarter's -- or this past quarter's CapEx represented 26.1% of our net income for the year. \n Looking at our Peruvian projects, our current portfolio for projects approved for Peru totaled $2.8 billion, of which $1.6 billion has been already invested. If we include the up-and-coming Michiquillay $2.5 billion investment and Los Chancas $2.6 billion projects, our total investment program in Peru reflects a commitment of $7.9 billion. \n For the Tia Maria project located in the Arequipa region in Peru, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of the Islay province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, healthcare and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay. \n We reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for the Islay province and the Arequipa region. Given the current economic situation in Peru, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during the Tia Maria construction. \n When operating, we expect Tia Maria to directly employ 600 workers and indirectly provide jobs to another 4,200. Additionally, from day 1 of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region via royalties and taxes. \n Los Chancas in Apurimac. This is a greenfield project. It's located in this region of Apurimac in Peru. It's a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. Current estimates of indicated copper mineral resources are 98 million tons of oxides with a copper content of 0.45% and 52 million tons of sulfides with a copper content of 0.59%. The Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The estimated investment for this project is $2.6 billion, and the project is expected to begin operations in 2027. \n In the first quarter, we continued to engage in social and environmental improvements for the local communities and work on the project's environmental impact assessment. \n For the Michiquillay program, Michiquillay is a world-class mining project with inferred mineral resources of 2.3 million tons -- billion tons with an estimated copper grade of 0.43%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tons of copper per year along with by-products of molybdenum, gold and silver for an initial life mine of 25 years and a competitive cash cost. We estimate that an investment of approximately $2.5 billion will be required for Michiquillay and expect production to start up by 2028. \n Michiquillay will become one of Peru's largest copper mines and will create significant business opportunities in the Cajamarca region, generate new jobs for the local communities and contribute with taxes and royalties to the local, regional and national governments.\n The social agreement signed last year with the Michiquillay and the Encan\u0303ada communities represent an opportunity to improve the quality of life of the residents of these communities via our strong social programs and backed by a social framework for technical work at the project level. These events are important steps that will allow Southern Copper to initiate an in-depth exploration program in the second quarter of this year. \n For the Mexican projects, we have the Buenavista zinc concentrator in Sonora. This project is located within the Buenavista facility and includes the development of a new concentrator to produce approximately 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. We have completed the engineering study and procurement has progressed 99% at all the main equipment, which is on site.\n Construction site works are in progress. The project has all the necessary permits and the capital budget is $413 million. As of March of this year, we have invested $240.5 million in this project. We expect to initiate operations in the second half of next year 2023. When completed, this new facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide 490 direct jobs and 1,470 indirect jobs. \n The Pilares project is located 6 kilometers from our La Caridad mine also in Sonora. This project consists of an open-pit mine operation with an annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. A new 25-meter wide off-road facility for mining trucks have been built and will be used to transport the ore from the pit to the primary crushers at the La Caridad copper concentrator. \n This project will significantly improve the overall mineral ore grade of the concentrator at La Caridad. We will obtain that by combining the 0.78% expected ore grade from Pilares with the 0.34% from La Caridad. The budget for Pilares is $159 million, of which we have invested $79.5 million as of March of this year. The project has obtained all permits and licenses required, and we expect to begin production in the last quarter of 2022. \n El Pilar, it's a low capital intensity -- low capital intensity copper greenfield project, which is strategically located in Sonora, Mexico. It's approximately away 45 kilometers from our Buenavista mine. Its copper oxide mineralization contains estimated proven and probable reserves of 317 million tons of ore with an average copper grade of 0.25%. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as an open-pit mine with an annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. \n We expect production to begin in 2024, and the mine life is estimated at 13 years. The results from the experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study -- the basic engineer study is finished and the company continues developing the project and site environmental activities. \n El Arco, which is located in Baja California, is a world-class copper deposit located in the central part of the peninsula of Baja California. It has all reserves of over 1,230 million tons with an average ore grade of 0.40%. It has also 141 million tons of leach material with an ore grade of 0.27%. The project includes an open-pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold with an estimated capital budget of $2.9 billion. The company has started the baseline study and is reviewing the basic engineering analysis to request environmental impact permit. Several years back, we began to acquire the rights to all relevant mining concessions in the area, completing this process in 2020.\n SCC is committed to improving its ESG record that is environmental, social and governance by adopting best practices and informing the investment community and other stakeholders about our progress in these matters. In line with our sustainability strategy, we've registered ongoing improvement in our main sustainability indicators. \n In terms of safety, we reduced the accident rate of our own personnel and contractors by 22% in the last 3 years. As far as the main environmental indicators are concerned, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by more than 10% and increased the efficiency of the freshwater consumption in the concentrator by 4% over the period.\n In social matters, the population served through our community programs has tripled, while we continue to strengthen the mechanisms for listening to and addressing concerns. In order to provide certainty to our investors and stakeholders, we present our progress regarding third-party validation of our environmental and social practices. \n Efforts to certify our occupational health and safety management systems and in the international standard, ISO 45001 and our environmental management systems under ISO 14001 are underway at all our mining units.\n In the first quarter of this year, the Santa Barbara and San Martin mines obtained ISO 45001 certification. And the Caridad mine and the Lime Plant in Sonora, ISO 14001 certification.\n Regarding our climate change management in 2021, Grupo Mexico rose 2 levels in the evaluation of the carbon disclosure project, going from Level C to Level B, which positions the company above the average for the sector and region. The communities surrounding our operations in Peru comprise dozens of small towns that live between the high Andean desert region and the coast. We continue to address the needs and challenges relative to the water supply, education and employment.\n Investments in infrastructure for water supply standout representing 70% of the $93.6 million invested in the last 10 years. In the first quarter of this year, we completed the construction of the Cularjahuira dam located in the province of Candarave. This is in the area of influence of our Toquepala mine. This facility will start up to 2.6 million cubic meters of water to irrigate 500 hectares of agricultural land and will directly benefit 585 families of local farmers.\n Regarding dividend, as you know, it is a company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. \n Accordingly, as announced to the market on April 28, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1.25 per share of common stock. This is payable on May 31 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 17, 2022.\n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open up the forum for questions. Okay. Thank you very much for your questions, Carlos. Okay. The community indicated -- on the Cuajone conflict, the community indicated that the company been operating lands that were property of the community, and they want compensation for that. What they are requesting, it's a compensation of $5 billion in U.S. dollars. For the use of this land, they claim that it goes through the second half of last year -- last century up to this one as well.\n As far as we understand, and we have all the titles in order to prove it they are wrong, the company has been operating land -- let me -- just for a well understanding of this matter to all the listeners at this call explain how the Cuajone -- the Cuajone mine was developed in the second half of the last century. \n In 1969, the company signed a contract with the Peruvian government at that time. And the Peruvian government, they gave a concession to operate and open up the Cuajone mine using state-owned lands. All the lands that we received at that time were state lands. It was not community land, and we have all the titles in order to prove that. So we believe that we will explain this to the local community.\n I'd like to add that at the beginning of the current -- of this century, about 2006, members from this community sued the company for the same reason and the Peruvian Supreme Court after a process -- a legal process indicated that we were right and fix the limits of the areas of the old land that the company received at the beginning of the Cuajone mine operations.\n Looking at your second question, cost performance or the prospect or the impact of the Cuajone stoppage flow, we already mentioned in our press release. We mentioned that during the first quarter, we have lost some land -- some production -- copper production to the Cuajone stoppage. \n As you know, this was started on February 28 and went all the way down to April 21. We are estimating that about 30,000 tons of additional production of Cuajone was lost in the second quarter of this year. That will certainly affect our production profile in the second quarter. We have been using copper concentrate from a local supplier and our Buenavista copper production. As you all know, Southern Copper is long concentrates both in Mexico and Peru. \n In the case of Peru, well, the Cuajone stoppage made us consume certain reserves that we have at the Ilo smelter as well as the Cuajone operation of copper concentrate inventories. And once we finish with that, we acquired or we have sent copper concentrates from Buenavista to supply the Ilo requirement for production.\n Currently, we're expecting a cash cost in the range of where we are now. We have a very strong -- as you know, very strong response from by-products. And we expect to maintain our cash cost where it is at this point. We may have an impact in the total cost of sales due to the purchases of copper concentrate that we have made from our Buenavista production, but that will be an intercompany transaction. So at the end of the day, we expect to maintain our cash costs, as I say, where it is nowadays. Yes, yes. Well, actually, it should improve as we get all the volumes. Keep in mind that we are -- we have lost business in Peru that I mentioned in the 2 quarters. But we will be recuperating our production level this month. Actually, since about April 24, we were operating at full speed in Cuajone. So a few days off April and then back to normal in May and June.\n Now looking into your last concern, Carlos, the impact of this that this may have on Los Chancas and Michiquillay. Well, we believe that so far, we don't see -- we see no connection between these -- the Tia Maria matters on issues and what is happening in Los Chancas and Michiquillay.\n In Michiquillay, as you know, we have signed a social agreements with the 2 communities that are over there. Cajamarca is a mining region. They understand mining. They have a very well-trained workforce for mining activities. And we believe that so far, we have no concerns about that. In the case of Los Chancas, we are working on the environmental study that corresponds for this property. And we believe that we will be on time to develop them. Okay. For the second quarter, let me start by your last question, Thiago. For the second quarter, we are expecting a loss in production of 13,000 tons. That's our current estimate. However, we will hopefully catch up at least partially on that. \n As I mentioned before, our plan for the year with 922,000 tons and currently we're expecting to produce 895,000 tons for 2022. So well, that's the total impact that we have for the Cuajone event, and that's basically it. So a portion of that was absorbed in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we're expecting 13,000 tons in total to be absorbed. And that's basically it. Do you like to comment on this before I go to the M&A part of your questions? Well, regarding ore grades, we're doing a little bit better in Mexico, in particular at Buenavista. The Peruvian operations, we knew from a few years back that we were expecting an ore-grade -- temporary ore grade for Cuajone and Toquepala. That's basically -- that's in the mine plan where we're doing some -- this year, we're doing some stripping on certain areas of both Cuajone and Toquepala that have lower ore grades, and that's why we do know that for the year, it's going to be, as I said, slightly lower than last year for Toquepala and lower -- well, excluding the impact of the stoppage in Cuajone, we will be pretty much at the same level that we had last year. But well, we have to consider that as part of our current situation.\n If I go to your M&A question for zinc or copper, the straight answer is, no, we are not looking into anything specific in these 2 metals in Peru. So -- but obviously, if there is a good opportunity, we will certainly review it and make a recommendation to our Board, if there is a good chance that we see a good opportunity on this. Yes, that's the plan. That's the plan, Thiago. So at the beginning of the year -- yes, at the beginning of the year, we mentioned that our goal for this year, given the all grade reductions and recoveries that we are expecting, of that we were expecting at that time, it was 922,000 tons of copper production for the year. \n Well, if we include what happened in the first quarter, that number has decreased to 895,000 tons. We expect to be better and that -- but that is something that will be shown through the second quarter and the rest of the year. In the case of Pilares, as you may imagine, well, we're currently acquiring some mining equipment, and there has been some delays in delivery times mainly related to COVID for Pilares. And so that's basically it. In the case of Buenavista, it's a better understanding of all the work that has to be done made us move slightly to the end of the year. In that case, for the second half of next year, the Buenavista zinc start up. That's basically it, Timna. Sure. Well, there are 2 major comments. First, where are we seeing higher cost? And that's basically well fields in general and materials that are related to steel industry. That's where we're seeing significant price increases. Where we are not seeing that, it's in labor cost, I mean there are some cost increases, but not in the same range that we were seeing in, say, fuel. Labor costs or power, meaning by this electricity, which are not increasing as the inflationary trend that we see in some of the materials. So that's a general comment on where are we in this regard.\n Now we have been for many, many years, doing different programs to reduce our cost -- the cost impact of our operations. For instance, we have been replacing truck haulage by conveyor belt transportation of our mineral. And in that, we're basically replacing, well, the much higher cost that has moved a ton of mineral from the mine to the concentrator or to the dams areas of the operations. We're placing a much higher cost by truck loading, not only in operating costs, but also on CapEx by the most efficient one of conveyor belts. That's just to mention one way to control cost.\n The other one is the ones that we're using in some of our operations, which are the high-pressure grinding rolls, where we have installed these facilities in Peru as well as -- in the Peruvian operations, particularly. The high-pressure grinding rolls are as the main phase 2 roles that somehow break the mineral before it goes into the concentrators mills. And by doing that, we get a much faster milling process. \n We maintain the concentrators milling the material that they were designed to not -- rock harness is not affecting the milling process by using these facilities. And we're -- in general, we're acquiring new technologies that has been proved to work. This is very important. We are sure that what we are introducing, for instance, conveyor belt haulage or grinding rolls -- high-pressure grinding rolls or technologies that has been working that are known that will produce at cost saving impact in our operations.\n By doing that, we are somehow containing costs. In this past quarter, in particular, we have better premiums coming in our smelting and refining process. And that has somehow helped us to maintain our cash cost in line or decrease at least the  production cost -- the total cost of operations for cash cost purposes. Now over the long term, the goal is to be as efficient as we can, developing projects that are very, very good in terms of their characteristics. \n And I'd like to stress here that all the ore grades that we have for our SX-EW projects, for instance, are very high for this kind of projects. What I mean by that is that the cash cost that will result from, say, El Pilar and some other project that has SX-EW facilities will be very competitive because we are starting with a very good mineral base for development of this type of projects. So over the long term, we're expecting our cash cost to maintain its current characteristics of being, say, where we are today or slightly higher if material prices decrease a little bit. Thank you for your question, John. And the straight answer to it is, yes. They could do -- because at the same time, we're seeing -- I mean, let me make a general comment. The COVID-19 impact in both Mexico and Peru and worldwide has been not -- I mean we are not better off after COVID. It's exactly the contrary. And if you add to that, that a few related materials that are consumed are impacting in terms of inflation. \n That's where you have the -- well, the upsetness of many people in these 2 countries and worldwide as well. Now the government can do something to reduce that? Oh, certainly, they can, and we expect the government of both Mexico and Peru to address these matters.\n In the case of our Cuajone operation, we are initiating a dialogue process in the next few days. We expect to clarify the concerns that the committee have. But at the same time, we believe that these are our door-to-door neighbors, and we have to be in good shape with them. So we hopefully expect to have -- to return to what has been a good relationship with these communities in the last few years. \n And we think that the current moment for a mining country as Peru and for the mining industry in Mexico as well, are very positive. And the government will have the resources to put in place programs that should help to reduce the concern that local communities and families have about their current situation. Alfonso, please, I can't copy you. Could you repeat your question, please? Yes, I do. Well, as far as we understand there is some concerns on -- I mean, generally speaking, all mining operations are having -- all the workforce not only in Mexico or specifically in our Buenavista and Caridad are having some concerns that -- this is a general thing. We don't have nothing in particular to report about this Alfonso. \n As you know, we have a biannual review of salaries and working conditions in our Mexican operations. And we believe that this process will move on as usual, in good terms. We haven't had any strikes in Mexico since we solved the problems that we had with another union that is no longer in our operations nowadays. Well, obviously, if there are higher fuel costs that should affect our cost of equipment, generally speaking. And in an inflationary environment, that is also something that we may expect. We haven't updated -- I mean, let me explain, the projects that are being under development we believe that CapEx cost will remain as reported.\n For instance, in the Buenavista zinc, we already acquired 99% of the equipment that we will be using in these projects. So that's basically it. In the case of Pilares, we are acquiring some tracks and shovels and so on for operating the mine. On those, we are seeing some cost increases, but still under the budget that we put in place for this project.\n In the case of El Pilar, where we are still doing -- well, we're looking at the quality of the mineral and how it works, and we are thinking about the form of the plan that the quality or the size of the plan that we're going to use for this project. We may have some inflation impact. But so far, we haven't run the numbers again.\n Now for the long-term greenfield projects that we have in Peru, we will be updating cost as we move on in time. But so far, if you see what happened this quarter, the company or the Board decided to increase the company's dividend to $1.25. That's -- it was formerly $1 in the prior quarters. The Board increased by $0.25. And the reason for that -- one of the reasons was that we made a review on the expected cost of -- for the next 5 years in our projects. \n And as a consequence, there was room for increasing our dividend to $1.25, and that's why the Board proceeding in that direction. So Obviously, as we have explained, we don't have any specific number for a dividend quarterly or given the rate for profits, for instance. \n But we do have a track record of not holding cash, which certainly means that we will send any cash that is perceived an extra cash for our revenue -- for our shareholders. And that's how we have proceeded. So even though we may have some higher costs in the future, we believe that so far, at this point, we are controlling CapEx expenditures, and we are seeing some opportunities to reward a little bit more our shareholders through the dividends. We decreased slightly our budget. As you've mentioned, we mentioned at the beginning of the year, our expectation was to spend $1,542 million. And currently, our expectation is $1,481 million. So that is a $61 million reduction in our CapEx for the year. But keep in mind that we don't only have higher copper prices, but our main by-product, which is molybdenum, it has almost doubled.\n I mean, it increased its price by 70% when you compare this quarter from, say, a year ago. So we are getting significant revenues -- higher revenues in by-products as well as in copper. And we are seeing this year's balance to have slightly higher cash from operations generation. \n Let me explain also that in the first quarter of this year, we have some once-a-year payments, mainly taxes in Peru and Mexico.  We have been paying the special mining tax in Mexico, which is on a yearly basis. In Peru, a portion of the income tax, a catch-up in the income tax for 2021 is paid in the first quarter of the year as well as the dividend tax. So we have once in a year payment in the first quarter and the worker participation in Peru as well that won't be there in the rest of the year.\n So when you do that, you see that you get a good cash flow for the remaining of 2022. And given the forecast for CapEx and so on, the market view, et cetera, the Board decided to increase the dividend from $1 to $1.25. No, it's on the projects that we're currently that are country under construction where we're at full speed. For instance, on the zinc concentrator in Pilares, we're spending at full speed. While some other projects that are related to the duly projects such as acquisition of replacement of some equipment and so on, usually, those ones are getting a higher expense at the second half of the year, but that's something that it's like the common trend that we have had in some other years as well. Thank you very much, Victor. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for the first quarter of 2022 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report this quarter -- the second quarter of this year. Thank you very much, and have a very good day today."

With us today, we have Southern Copper Corporation, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the past quarter and year 2023 as well as answer any questions that you may have. \n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP. \n Now I will pass the call to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter of 2023 and full year 2023 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board member as well as Leonardo Contreras who is also a board member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Before we get into the details of this past quarter, I'd like to make some comments regarding the company results in 2023. Even though 2023 was a challenging year of Southern Copper, we believe the company achieved good results. 2023 net sales were $9,896 million. This is $152 million or 1.5% lower than 2022 net sales. This result was driven by higher sales volumes for copper of 2.2% and molybdenum of 2.3%, better prices for molybdenum by 28% and silver. This situation was partially offset by a decrease in metal prices for copper and zinc and by a reduction in the sales volume of silver and zinc. \n Net sales in 2023 were negatively impacted by a year accounting adjustment of $406 million for lower metal prices on sales. In addition to this, we estimate that 2023 sales were affected by a larger copper anode inventory in process at year-end. If we exclude these two effects, the sales for 2023 would have been 3% higher than the 2022 mark. The 2023 copper production increased 1.8% year-on-year to 911,000 tonnes of copper. \n The yearly result was mainly attributable to higher production at our Peruvian operations a result that was partially offset by a reduction in production of our Mexican operations, which was mainly fueled by a drop in mineral processing and recovery at the Buenavista mine. In the second half of last year, we experienced a reduction of fresh water at our Buenavista operation, which was generated by the fact that we lacked the permit we expect to receive for building a pipeline of approximately 20 kilometers to transport water from the wells to the operations and nearby townsites. For 2024, the company has decided to transport the water through other means to secure the supplies required to ensure that Buenavista can operate at full capacity for copper production and the ramp-up of new zinc concentrator operations. \n For our byproducts, molybdenum production totaled 26,836 tons in 2023, which was 2.3% higher than the figure of 2022. This increase was due to higher production at 3 of our 4 mines, the exception was Toquepala. Mine zinc production rose 9.2% year-on-year due to higher production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara man. Mined silver production was less than 1% in 2023, primarily driven by lower production at the Buenavista mine. This decrease was partially offset by higher production at our Peruvian operations. \n In 2023, the operating cash cost per pound of copper, including by-product revenue credits was $1.03, a $0.25 increase in cash cost reported versus $0.78 per pound in 2022 was mainly attributable to $0.17 per pound increase in the production cost and $0.08 in by-product revenue credits. \n At this point, we believe we are seeing the end of the inflation-related cost. Our cash cost before by-product trade credits evolved from $2.09 per pound in the first quarter of 2023 to $2.23 per pound in the fourth quarter. It is important to note that levels were pretty stable through the second half of last year. \n For 2024, we expect our cash cost before by-product credits to be $2.20 per pound. We expect zinc and silver to contribute positivity to growth in 2024 on the back of an uptick in volumes. For zinc, we expect a growing introduction of 80%, 80%. For silver, 13%. Nonetheless, we also expect molybdenum prices to remain at the level that they are now, which is about $19 per pound. In this scenario, all in company cash cost credit for 2024 will total $1.03 per count. Therefore, our cash cost after by-product credits is estimated at $1.17 per pound for this year 2024. This increase in value was driven primarily by a 13% reduction in by-product sales. \n Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $5,029 million. This is 6% lower or $320 million below the figure of 2022. The drop in adjusted EBITDA year-on-year was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales equivalent to $152 million, a $113 million nonrecurring variance in other income due to 2022 insurance and tax refunds and a $54 million uptick in operating costs. The adjusted EBITDA margin in 2023 was 50.8% versus 53.2% in 2022. \n For net income, last year, we had $2,425 million, that's 8% lower than the mark for 2022. The net income margin was 24.5% last year versus 26.3% in 2022. \n Now let us focus on the copper market. The London Metal Exchange copper price increased 2.2% from an average of $3.63 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022, up to $3.71 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2023. At the beginning of last quarter, we were expecting a market surplus for this year. However, after a significant reduction in copper production was announced by some producers, market expectations for surplus ceased and were replaced by concerns about potential deficits due to the extremely low available inventory. Even though there are significant uncertainties this year for the world economy, such as the slow recovery of China, a recession in Europe and a soft landing or minor recession in the U.S., we believe copper prices should have good support through 2024. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. For copper, it represented 77.8% of our sales in the fourth quarter of last year. Copper production registered a decrease of 3% in the fourth quarter in a quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 234,089 tonnes. Our quarterly results reflect a 9.6% decrease in production in Mexico, driven by our Buenavista mine, which was partially offset by higher production at La Caridad mine due to better ore grades. Production at our Peruvian operations increased 6.6% in a quarter-on-quarter terms, which was mainly due to higher production at our Toquepala operations. Compared to the third quarter of last year, copper production increased 3.5%, which was mainly attributable to higher production at the Cuajone, Toquepala and Caridad mine. \n For this year, we expect to produce 936,000 tonnes of copper, an increase of 3% over the 2023 production. Last year, we drove our Pilares project to full capacity and initiated a ramp-up at the Buenavista zinc concentrator. For 2024, we expect these 2 projects to contribute with 44,000 tonnes of copper to our production. \n Molybdenum represented 10% of the company's sales value in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is currently our best seller. Molybdenum prices averaged $18.41 per pound in the quarter compared to $21.17 in the fourth quarter of 2022. This represents a decrease of 13%. Molybdenum production increased 6.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter of 2022. This was mainly driven by an increase in production at Toquepala and Caridad mine due to higher ore grades in both operations. These results were partially offset by lower production at the Cuajone and Buenavista mine. Molybdenum production increased 2.3% year-on-year in 2023 after production grew at La Caridad, Cuajone and Buenavista. This was partially offset by lower production at Toquepala. For this year 2024, we expect to produce 25,500 tonnes of molybdenum. \n For silver, it represented 4.3% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of 2023, with an average price of $23.25 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected an increase of 9%. Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production decreased 3.2% in the fourth quarter versus the same mark of 2022 after production reduced Buenavista and -- after production reduced in Buenavista and Cuajone. This was partially offset by higher production at the Toquepala, Caridad and in IMMSA operations. Refined production fell by 40% quarter-on-quarter, which was mainly driven by a drop in all of our refineries. And this, I'd like to comment that we're expecting -- we're having a different -- a change in commercial conditions and that has somehow altered the purchases of material for silver production at the refineries in Mexico.\n In 2024, we expect to produce 20.7 million ounces of silver, an increase of 13% compared to 2023. Zinc represented 3.3% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of 2023. Zinc prices averaged $1.14 per pound in the quarter. This is a 17% decrease regarding the fourth quarter of 2022 figure. Zinc mined production increased 11% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 16,930 tonnes. This was driven primarily by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas mine. Refined zinc production increased by 1% in the fourth quarter. \n In 2023, we produced 65,509 tonnes of zinc, an increase of 9.2% compared to 2022. This was mainly driven by an uptick in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas operations. This was partially offset by a decreased production at the San Martin mine. Refined zinc production increased by 1% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n For this year, we expected to produce 113,800 tonnes of zinc, which represents an increase of 80% over our 2023 production level. This growth will be driven by the start-up of the Buenavista zinc concentrator that will contribute with 54,400 tonnes of zinc. For the year 2025 and on, we expect to produce over 170,000 tonnes per year of zinc. \n Financial results. For the fourth quarter of 2023 sales were $2.3 billion which is $525 million lower than sales for the fourth quarter or 19% -- or a 19% reduction. Even though copper prices were 2% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2022, sales of this metal decreased almost 10%. Net sales in the past quarter were negatively impacted by a quarterly adjustment -- accounting assessment of $62.3 million for copper sales, and this was basically for lower metal prices and sales. \n In addition to this, at the end of the past quarter we have a larger copper anode inventory in process and that also affected copper. Regarding our byproducts, despite a 6% increase in the volume of molybdenum sold, growth of our main byproduct decreased 54% due to lower prices and an important accounting adjustment of $106.2 million of molybdenum sales. Zinc sales decreased 18% due to lower prices and volumes. For silver, sales fell 10% due to lower volume, which was partially offset by better price. So the fourth quarter of last year, sales reduction was mainly affected by an increase in copper inventory and adjustments on sales of copper and molybdenum for $168.4 million. \n Operating cost. Our total operating costs and expenses decreased by $23.5 million or 2% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The main cost reduction has been in inventory consumption, capitalized leachable material, workers participation and tenders. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher contractor costs, labor, exchange rate variances, raw materials, water, fuel and other costs. \n The fourth quarter of 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $1,055 million, which came 35.3% under the $1,631 million registered in the fourth quarter of 2022. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 46% versus 58% in the fourth quarter 2022. Cash flows. Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproduct sales was $1.25 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2023. This cash cost was $0.27 higher than the cash cost of $0.98 in the third quarter of this year -- of this past year. \n Operating cash cost per ton of copper before by-product credit was $2.23 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2023. That is $0.01 lower than the value for the third quarter. This 1% decrease in operating cash cost is a result of lower cost per pound from production and lower administrative expenses were partially offset by lower premiums on cathode sales and higher treatment and refining charges on concentrate pay. \n Regarding by-products, we recorded a $0.28 reduction in credits. This fourth quarter production in 2023 had -- we had a credit of -- for the fourth quarter of last year, we had a credit of $491 million or $0.984 per pound. These figures represent a 22% decrease when compared to a credit of $604 million or $1.26 per pound in the third quarter of last year. Total credits increased 16% but decreased for molybdenum 33% and sulfuric acid to 11%. \n Net income in the fourth quarter was $445 million, which represented a 51% decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2022 figures. The net income margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 19% versus 32% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income was affected by lower sales as explained earlier and by year-end non-recurrent adjustments in nonoperating costs as well as tax. \n Cash from operations. Cash flow from operating activities in 2023 was $3,572 million, which represented an increase of 27% over the $2,802 million posted in 2022. This result was mainly driven by a reduction in working capital. \n For capital investments, our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and it currently includes investments in the Buenavista zinc and Pilares project in Mexico and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. In 2023, we spent $1 billion on capital investments, which reflected a 6% increase year-on-year and represented 41% of net income in 2023.\n Since there is a description of our main capital project in Southern Copper's press release, I'm going to focus on updating new development for each. For the Buenavista zinc concentrator in Sonora, the capital budget for the project is $439 million, most of which has already been invested. We have initiated the commissioning process and progress is 99%. Ramping up of the plant began in the first quarter of this year, this quarter after technical adjustments to the concentrator. We expect to produce 54,500 tonnes of zinc and 11,900 tonnes of copper in 2024 and an average of 90,200 tonnes of zinc and 20,700 tonnes of copper per year in the next 5 years. \n For the Pilares project in Sonora, Mexico, the budget for this project is $176 million, of which $145 million has been invested. Pilares is currently operating at full capacity and delivering copper ore to La Caridad operation. Since Pilares is fully integrated into our operations, this will be the last time we are reporting on it as a project. In other words, Pilares graduated from the project stage and is now part of the La Caridad operations. \n For the Peruvian project, in the case of the Tia Maria project in Arequipa, we reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for Islay province and the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We expect to begin the construction phase of the project in the near future. We will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during Tia Maria's construction. Additionally, from day one of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region by paying royalties and later on income tax. \n The Los Chancas project in Apurimac it's a greenfield project in which we are in a coordinated effort with the Peruvian authorities of the company, making significant progress in eradicating the illegal mining activities at our concession. Once this process is complete, we will restart environmental impact assessment, conduct a diamond drilling campaign for 40,000 meters and initiate hydrogeological and geotechnical studies to gather additional information on the characteristics of the Los Chancas deposit. \n The Michiquillay project in Cajamarca as of December 31 of last year, we have drilled 63,000 meters from a total program of 110,000 meters and obtained 20,137 core samples for chemical analysis. Geological modeling, cross section interpretation and drilling logging are currency underway. For 2024, the company expects to complete the diamond drilling product, geological modeling and resource evaluation. We will also begin hydrogeological and geotechnical studies and assess results of metallurgical testing at the deposit. The company continues working with the Michiquillay and La Enca\u00f1ada communities following the guidelines of the social agreements signed with them. \n For environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG practices, major improvement -- we have a major improvement in water recovery that we want to report on. \n Over the last 4 years, we have improved the use of water at our operations going from 0.64 cubic meters, less than 1 cubic meter, 0.64 of water to a milled ton of mineral in 2020 to 0.53 cubic meters in 2023. This represents an increase in efficiency of 17%. Improvement has primarily been driven by the company's initiatives to recover water from our Quebrada Honda tailings dam in Peru and by an uptick in the water volume recovered at the Buenavista del Cobre mine in Mexico. \n We continue to make progress in our sustainability ratings. S&P Global results in its Corporate Sustainability Assessment or CSA, indicate that Southern Copper Corporation has achieved a place among the top 10 performers in the mining sector with a rating that exceed the industry average by 100%. These results reflect our ongoing commitment to improving our sustainability practices and maintaining the company's inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the Latin American region. This year marked our fifth consecutive year in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. In 2023, SCC achieved some of the highest scores in the sector for key CSA indicators, including transparency and disclosure, occupational safety and health, operations closure and human capital development. \n We obtained a score of 90 out of 100 on CSA's climate governance index. This attests to the progress the company has made in this area. Additionally, we achieved a score of 100 in the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures which focus on management and disclosure of financial risks and opportunities related to climate change. Additionally, investor-led Climate Action 100 plus initiative recognized our efforts to develop an emissions reduction roadmap and awarded us a full compliance rating in the TCFD category. Furthermore, the rating agency Sustainalytics reduced the company's risk by two levels between 2020 and 2023. \n In 2023, we registered a 97% increase in year-to-date -- year-to-year investment in social infrastructure. In Mexico, $35.9 million was allocated to these efforts. A project that was particularly noteworthy this year focused on improving water infrastructure for the communities of Cananea and Nacozari. In Peru, $45.7 million was invested in social infrastructure, including the progress in building the wastewater treatment plant or PTAR in Ilo. \n The company also prioritized educational infrastructure development in Peru and will build upon successful previous initiatives in Moquegua and Tacna. Continuing our commitment, the company is actively expanding educational infrastructure to benefit the community under the Works for Taxes modality. This effort includes setting up 5 high-performance schools of COAR that is the acronym in Spanish for 1,500 students to strengthen the capacities of outstanding students in the state educational circuit. Two schools are currently under construction in Moquegua and Tacna. These investments have made Southern Copper the primary private investor in Peru's national educational infrastructure. \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company's policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on January 25, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.80 per share of common stock payable on February 29 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 13, 2024. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like to now open up the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] It comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. \nTimna Tanners: Good day and happy Friday. Can you hear me okay? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. \nTimna Tanners: I had a bunch of questions. First off, I wanted to hear about how you are guiding to lower costs? And just if you could provide some more color on how the costs come down, just given broader inflation that we've been seeing prevalent in the last couple of years? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Basically, what we're seeing is that after enough uptick in prices, saying after the Russian invasion to Ukraine, we saw a combination of the impact that it has on energy and some key materials for us, such as ammonia that is used as a material for explosive production as well as steel, for instance, and obviously oil. And we had some cost push. Well, we react to that. We are signing -- changing the mix of explosives, changing -- making more research to improve our cost on steel as well as looking into some other ways to save energy, both at power and at fuel. And that somehow has helped us and made us stabilize our cash cost before credits at about $2.23, $2.24 last year, and we have the expectation of decreasing it a little bit more through 2024. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. That's helpful. Regarding Tia Maria, you sounded more constructive in the release this time and in the remarks. And I'm just wondering if it's actually time to put it in our estimates coming forward. And if so, if you could elaborate on timing. Also, that $1.4 billion amount in light of all the cost inflation around miners globally. Can you just remind us if that's an updated number and what that entails? \nRaul Jacob: Sure. Regarding the CapEx, we already have spent a little bit north of $350 million on equipment that is stored with the proper care nearby the Tia Maria deposit. And we are more positive for sure on Tia Maria and we are moving forward with some actions that -- and we will report on progress as we get better news on it. But yes, we are much more positive regarding the project. But we will like to give good news when we have something relevant to report. \nOperator: It comes from the line of Gabriel Simoes with Goldman Sachs. \nGabriel Simoes: So the first one if you could provide some more details on the gap that we observed in production versus copper sales in this quarter. So you mentioned this is due to the anode inventory... \nRaul Jacob: I can't copy you Gabriel, I can't copy you at all, could you get closer to... \nGabriel Simoes: Is it better? \nRaul Jacob: Yes, much better now. \nGabriel Simoes: Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry about that. So the first question is about the gap that we observed this quarter in production versus sales for copper. So you mentioned that this is due to the anode inventory situation, but any additional detail that you could provide us on the market here would be interesting. And in addition, would you expect this gap to be reversed in the coming quarters, so that the excess inventory that you accumulated due to the higher production that will be interesting to know as well. \n And my second question is regarding the comment that you guys made on the Buenavista water situation. So I just wanted to have some more color on how this is going. And if it has already impacted some of your costs in some way, it should affect your cost in a meaningful way in the short term? And if there is a longer-term solution for this already underway? Or could it structurally increase the cost of the mine in the future? If this is a relevant metaphor for the costs? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you very much for your questions, Gabriel. Okay. Well, we have an inventory built up at the -- related to Minera Mexico refinery. At the end of the past quarter, we had about 7,800 tonnes of copper in process that should be sold I believe this quarter in the first quarter of this year. So this is not like -- it's more like one thing. Obviously, inventories have not -- are bearing all the time. But in this case, we had some repairs that were scheduled for the end of the year that generated this uptick in inventories in process. \n Regarding the Buenavista water situation, well, we have -- as I mentioned, we -- the company has taken action on solving this program for this year. We're basically moving water using water tankers, trucks. And obviously, it has an impact in cost. We'll see that -- it's about $29 million that we're expecting. And in terms of production, it created a problem in production at Buenavista. If you look at the metrics that we're reporting for Buenavista, we're mentioning that there was a reduction in mineral process as well as recovery. \n That's directly related to the lack of orders. So that's why the company has made us -- evaluated different ways to solve this. And we finally took a decision and are implementing it since this month -- I'm sorry, since January. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alfonso Salazar with Scotiabank. \nAlfonso Salazar: I have three questions. The first one is regarding the water concessions. And I want to understand how this water from Cananea relates with a new law in Mexico that requires a mining concession for use of water, specifically for mining activities. So I just want to understand if there is a link between these two things. If I'm not mistaken, I remember correctly back in November 2022, there was a misunderstanding between the government and the company because of some concessions -- water concessions granted to the company at Buenavista, which I think the company clarified that there were no such concessions granted. \n And the second question was regarding El Arco. I didn't see the details in the press release about this project. I just want to understand why is that? And the third question that I have is regarding the blended grade that we should expect at La Caridad and basically because it's going to be using Pilares as a satellite mine, so I would imagine that we should increase the La Caridad mine as more production comes from Pilares. So I just want to understand what to expect in terms of the blended grade there. And these are the three questions that I have. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Alfonso, good hearing from you. Okay. In the water concessions, well, basically, we do have the concession for the wells. What we don't have, it's the final permit to build a pipeline. So that is something that we expect to have when we finish working on the construction for the wells, but we haven't received it yet. So this is what has created this. This plus some lower rain than expected this year -- this past year, I should say. That is basically what we have in the wells will solve the problem in terms of water availability, no matter how the weather affects rains in the area. \n Now in the case of El Arco, we haven't made any reference to the project because we have not much progress to report. We will do that when we have something relevant to share with the financial community. At this point, we're advancing the project, but there is nothing relevant to report. And then on the blended rate expected for La Caridad, let me explain what's happening in -- when we initiated the production of mineral at La Caridad -- the Pilares project, we found that there was an oxide layer that had to be removed before getting into full force, which are the feed for the concentrator. So the first month, this was at the end of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. \n We basically removed these oxides from the Pilares deposits and send it to our SX-EW leaching areas. That material is being processed. So we will expect to have some more refined SX-EW copper coming from Pilares in the near future. And then we look at the prices -- relative prices of molybdenum vis-a-vis copper. This was by mid-2023, molybdenum had very good prices and copper not as good as we had say in the year before. And after making some numbers, some financial reviews, we conclude that it was interesting to increase the molybdenum production of La Caridad, which is from our 4 open pit mines, the ones that have the best ore grade for molybdenum. \n So the company favored the production of molybdenum at La Caridad and that was sold taking the opportunity of much higher prices for molybdenum. That has passed the last quarter, we had a price that was reported lower than what we had before. And consequently, we're coming back to sending ore from Pilares to La Caridad. Our expectation is that we should be producing about 35,000 tons of copper from Pilares in the mix at the Caridad concentrator with Caridad material. \nAlfonso Salazar: Okay. And if I understand, in case moly prices soar again, you may reduce the input from Pilares to produce more molybdenum, right? \nRaul Jacob: If prices make -- if the prices make sense to do that, we'll consider it. \nAlfonso Salazar: And just to confirm, the problem with water that you have at Buenavista does not relate with the changes to the mining law and the water concessions? \nRaul Jacob: I don't think so. I think that this is a different matter. It's just a pipeline permit that is taking longer than what we belief when we initiated this -- the work in these two wells. \nOperator: Comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. \nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much. I apologize if I have any construction noise in the background. Southern Copper had 24,500 tonnes less output from purchased ores in 2023 and $113.5 million less other income. Could you describe whether the purchased ores were in Sonora or Southern copper? And if it's a regular sustainable or sort of an episodic thing and what had been the other income, which declined? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Let me address the last question. Other income was the expected one in 2023, other income/spend was the proper one, the usual trend of the company in 2023. The anomaly was in 2022. And it was a positive thing for the company. We had some insurance refunds as well as tax refund that we had in 2022. So more than having lower other income in 2023, we had an exceptional, very good 2022 in that regard. \n Getting into the ore purchases, basically, we have to purchase an unusual amount of copper concentrate in 2022 to fill up our smelter in Peru due to the Cuajone mine stoppage of 54 days. We had a committee that blockaded the water supply for Cuajone for, as I say, 54 days that was in 2022. So in 2023, Cuajone operated at full capacity, which is excellent for us. \n And that's why we reduced significantly our purchases of third-party's material. Generally speaking, we are buying third-party's copper for technical reasons because as you know, John, we are low in copper concentrates, so we keep using just our own material, fill up our smelters and refineries. But sometimes, we want to acquire third-party material that has technical characteristics that improve our process, and that's why we are buying some of that as our report shows. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Sofia Martin with GBM. \nSof\u00eda Martin: I was just wondering if you could share your production guidance going forward for the next couple of years? \nRaul Jacob: Certainly, Sofia. Okay. I already mentioned that for 2024, it's 935,000 -- 936,000. For 2025, 956,000; 2026, 985,000; 2027, 1,001,000; 2028, 1,018,000. I also mentioned that from this year, we're increasing our zinc production from 65,500 last year, up to 118,000 this year, and then over 170,000 for the next foreseeable future. \nOperator: It's a follow-up from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. \nTimna Tanners: I just had two more questions. One was related to the reported interest of Grupo management... \nRaul Jacob: We cannot -- we don't hear -- we couldn't hear you at the beginning. \nTimna Tanners: Sorry. So just two quick questions. One is related to the reported interest in Las Cruces from Grupo Mexico. Is that anything you can comment on? And the second one, just is there anything that you can provide in terms of color on the Board's decision to cut the dividend? \nRaul Jacob: The first one, I couldn't get your question. I am so sorry. \nTimna Tanners: Sorry about that. My connection might be kind of rough. So it's been reported that Grupo Mexico is looking at Las Cruces, the Spanish mine owned by First Quantum. So I was just wondering if you have any comment on that or if it's relevant for Southern Copper? \nRaul Jacob: It's a relevant question for Grupo Mexico actually. But just what we do, if there is a good opportunity to generate value for our shareholders through an acquisition, we dive into these alternatives. In this case, the company is not directly involved. It's through AMC that the Las Cruces evaluation is being done. \n In the case of the dividend, well, it's -- as we explained, in each board meeting, the company, the Board looks at how the market is, what are the next payments that the company has to do, what are the investment requirements? And in this case, if you see our cash generation from operations was somehow lower. So the Board decided to cut a little bit the copper -- I'm sorry, the dividend in order to maintain a solid cash position for the company. \nOperator: And sir, I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you very much, Carmen. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's fourth quarter and full year results for 2023. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the first quarter of 2024 results. Thank you very much for being with us, and have a very nice day. \nOperator: And thank you all for joining our call today, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter of 2023 and full year 2023 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board member as well as Leonardo Contreras who is also a board member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Before we get into the details of this past quarter, I'd like to make some comments regarding the company results in 2023. Even though 2023 was a challenging year of Southern Copper, we believe the company achieved good results. 2023 net sales were $9,896 million. This is $152 million or 1.5% lower than 2022 net sales. This result was driven by higher sales volumes for copper of 2.2% and molybdenum of 2.3%, better prices for molybdenum by 28% and silver. This situation was partially offset by a decrease in metal prices for copper and zinc and by a reduction in the sales volume of silver and zinc. \n Net sales in 2023 were negatively impacted by a year accounting adjustment of $406 million for lower metal prices on sales. In addition to this, we estimate that 2023 sales were affected by a larger copper anode inventory in process at year-end. If we exclude these two effects, the sales for 2023 would have been 3% higher than the 2022 mark. The 2023 copper production increased 1.8% year-on-year to 911,000 tonnes of copper. \n The yearly result was mainly attributable to higher production at our Peruvian operations a result that was partially offset by a reduction in production of our Mexican operations, which was mainly fueled by a drop in mineral processing and recovery at the Buenavista mine. In the second half of last year, we experienced a reduction of fresh water at our Buenavista operation, which was generated by the fact that we lacked the permit we expect to receive for building a pipeline of approximately 20 kilometers to transport water from the wells to the operations and nearby townsites. For 2024, the company has decided to transport the water through other means to secure the supplies required to ensure that Buenavista can operate at full capacity for copper production and the ramp-up of new zinc concentrator operations. \n For our byproducts, molybdenum production totaled 26,836 tons in 2023, which was 2.3% higher than the figure of 2022. This increase was due to higher production at 3 of our 4 mines, the exception was Toquepala. Mine zinc production rose 9.2% year-on-year due to higher production at the Charcas and Santa Barbara man. Mined silver production was less than 1% in 2023, primarily driven by lower production at the Buenavista mine. This decrease was partially offset by higher production at our Peruvian operations. \n In 2023, the operating cash cost per pound of copper, including by-product revenue credits was $1.03, a $0.25 increase in cash cost reported versus $0.78 per pound in 2022 was mainly attributable to $0.17 per pound increase in the production cost and $0.08 in by-product revenue credits. \n At this point, we believe we are seeing the end of the inflation-related cost. Our cash cost before by-product trade credits evolved from $2.09 per pound in the first quarter of 2023 to $2.23 per pound in the fourth quarter. It is important to note that levels were pretty stable through the second half of last year. \n For 2024, we expect our cash cost before by-product credits to be $2.20 per pound. We expect zinc and silver to contribute positivity to growth in 2024 on the back of an uptick in volumes. For zinc, we expect a growing introduction of 80%, 80%. For silver, 13%. Nonetheless, we also expect molybdenum prices to remain at the level that they are now, which is about $19 per pound. In this scenario, all in company cash cost credit for 2024 will total $1.03 per count. Therefore, our cash cost after by-product credits is estimated at $1.17 per pound for this year 2024. This increase in value was driven primarily by a 13% reduction in by-product sales. \n Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $5,029 million. This is 6% lower or $320 million below the figure of 2022. The drop in adjusted EBITDA year-on-year was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales equivalent to $152 million, a $113 million nonrecurring variance in other income due to 2022 insurance and tax refunds and a $54 million uptick in operating costs. The adjusted EBITDA margin in 2023 was 50.8% versus 53.2% in 2022. \n For net income, last year, we had $2,425 million, that's 8% lower than the mark for 2022. The net income margin was 24.5% last year versus 26.3% in 2022. \n Now let us focus on the copper market. The London Metal Exchange copper price increased 2.2% from an average of $3.63 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2022, up to $3.71 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2023. At the beginning of last quarter, we were expecting a market surplus for this year. However, after a significant reduction in copper production was announced by some producers, market expectations for surplus ceased and were replaced by concerns about potential deficits due to the extremely low available inventory. Even though there are significant uncertainties this year for the world economy, such as the slow recovery of China, a recession in Europe and a soft landing or minor recession in the U.S., we believe copper prices should have good support through 2024. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. For copper, it represented 77.8% of our sales in the fourth quarter of last year. Copper production registered a decrease of 3% in the fourth quarter in a quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 234,089 tonnes. Our quarterly results reflect a 9.6% decrease in production in Mexico, driven by our Buenavista mine, which was partially offset by higher production at La Caridad mine due to better ore grades. Production at our Peruvian operations increased 6.6% in a quarter-on-quarter terms, which was mainly due to higher production at our Toquepala operations. Compared to the third quarter of last year, copper production increased 3.5%, which was mainly attributable to higher production at the Cuajone, Toquepala and Caridad mine. \n For this year, we expect to produce 936,000 tonnes of copper, an increase of 3% over the 2023 production. Last year, we drove our Pilares project to full capacity and initiated a ramp-up at the Buenavista zinc concentrator. For 2024, we expect these 2 projects to contribute with 44,000 tonnes of copper to our production. \n Molybdenum represented 10% of the company's sales value in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is currently our best seller. Molybdenum prices averaged $18.41 per pound in the quarter compared to $21.17 in the fourth quarter of 2022. This represents a decrease of 13%. Molybdenum production increased 6.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter of 2022. This was mainly driven by an increase in production at Toquepala and Caridad mine due to higher ore grades in both operations. These results were partially offset by lower production at the Cuajone and Buenavista mine. Molybdenum production increased 2.3% year-on-year in 2023 after production grew at La Caridad, Cuajone and Buenavista. This was partially offset by lower production at Toquepala. For this year 2024, we expect to produce 25,500 tonnes of molybdenum. \n For silver, it represented 4.3% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of 2023, with an average price of $23.25 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected an increase of 9%. Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production decreased 3.2% in the fourth quarter versus the same mark of 2022 after production reduced Buenavista and -- after production reduced in Buenavista and Cuajone. This was partially offset by higher production at the Toquepala, Caridad and in IMMSA operations. Refined production fell by 40% quarter-on-quarter, which was mainly driven by a drop in all of our refineries. And this, I'd like to comment that we're expecting -- we're having a different -- a change in commercial conditions and that has somehow altered the purchases of material for silver production at the refineries in Mexico.\n In 2024, we expect to produce 20.7 million ounces of silver, an increase of 13% compared to 2023. Zinc represented 3.3% of our sales value in the fourth quarter of 2023. Zinc prices averaged $1.14 per pound in the quarter. This is a 17% decrease regarding the fourth quarter of 2022 figure. Zinc mined production increased 11% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 16,930 tonnes. This was driven primarily by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas mine. Refined zinc production increased by 1% in the fourth quarter. \n In 2023, we produced 65,509 tonnes of zinc, an increase of 9.2% compared to 2022. This was mainly driven by an uptick in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas operations. This was partially offset by a decreased production at the San Martin mine. Refined zinc production increased by 1% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n For this year, we expected to produce 113,800 tonnes of zinc, which represents an increase of 80% over our 2023 production level. This growth will be driven by the start-up of the Buenavista zinc concentrator that will contribute with 54,400 tonnes of zinc. For the year 2025 and on, we expect to produce over 170,000 tonnes per year of zinc. \n Financial results. For the fourth quarter of 2023 sales were $2.3 billion which is $525 million lower than sales for the fourth quarter or 19% -- or a 19% reduction. Even though copper prices were 2% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2022, sales of this metal decreased almost 10%. Net sales in the past quarter were negatively impacted by a quarterly adjustment -- accounting assessment of $62.3 million for copper sales, and this was basically for lower metal prices and sales. \n In addition to this, at the end of the past quarter we have a larger copper anode inventory in process and that also affected copper. Regarding our byproducts, despite a 6% increase in the volume of molybdenum sold, growth of our main byproduct decreased 54% due to lower prices and an important accounting adjustment of $106.2 million of molybdenum sales. Zinc sales decreased 18% due to lower prices and volumes. For silver, sales fell 10% due to lower volume, which was partially offset by better price. So the fourth quarter of last year, sales reduction was mainly affected by an increase in copper inventory and adjustments on sales of copper and molybdenum for $168.4 million. \n Operating cost. Our total operating costs and expenses decreased by $23.5 million or 2% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The main cost reduction has been in inventory consumption, capitalized leachable material, workers participation and tenders. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher contractor costs, labor, exchange rate variances, raw materials, water, fuel and other costs. \n The fourth quarter of 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $1,055 million, which came 35.3% under the $1,631 million registered in the fourth quarter of 2022. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 46% versus 58% in the fourth quarter 2022. Cash flows. Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproduct sales was $1.25 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2023. This cash cost was $0.27 higher than the cash cost of $0.98 in the third quarter of this year -- of this past year. \n Operating cash cost per ton of copper before by-product credit was $2.23 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2023. That is $0.01 lower than the value for the third quarter. This 1% decrease in operating cash cost is a result of lower cost per pound from production and lower administrative expenses were partially offset by lower premiums on cathode sales and higher treatment and refining charges on concentrate pay. \n Regarding by-products, we recorded a $0.28 reduction in credits. This fourth quarter production in 2023 had -- we had a credit of -- for the fourth quarter of last year, we had a credit of $491 million or $0.984 per pound. These figures represent a 22% decrease when compared to a credit of $604 million or $1.26 per pound in the third quarter of last year. Total credits increased 16% but decreased for molybdenum 33% and sulfuric acid to 11%. \n Net income in the fourth quarter was $445 million, which represented a 51% decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2022 figures. The net income margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 19% versus 32% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income was affected by lower sales as explained earlier and by year-end non-recurrent adjustments in nonoperating costs as well as tax. \n Cash from operations. Cash flow from operating activities in 2023 was $3,572 million, which represented an increase of 27% over the $2,802 million posted in 2022. This result was mainly driven by a reduction in working capital. \n For capital investments, our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and it currently includes investments in the Buenavista zinc and Pilares project in Mexico and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. In 2023, we spent $1 billion on capital investments, which reflected a 6% increase year-on-year and represented 41% of net income in 2023.\n Since there is a description of our main capital project in Southern Copper's press release, I'm going to focus on updating new development for each. For the Buenavista zinc concentrator in Sonora, the capital budget for the project is $439 million, most of which has already been invested. We have initiated the commissioning process and progress is 99%. Ramping up of the plant began in the first quarter of this year, this quarter after technical adjustments to the concentrator. We expect to produce 54,500 tonnes of zinc and 11,900 tonnes of copper in 2024 and an average of 90,200 tonnes of zinc and 20,700 tonnes of copper per year in the next 5 years. \n For the Pilares project in Sonora, Mexico, the budget for this project is $176 million, of which $145 million has been invested. Pilares is currently operating at full capacity and delivering copper ore to La Caridad operation. Since Pilares is fully integrated into our operations, this will be the last time we are reporting on it as a project. In other words, Pilares graduated from the project stage and is now part of the La Caridad operations. \n For the Peruvian project, in the case of the Tia Maria project in Arequipa, we reiterate our view that the initiation of construction activities at Tia Maria will generate significant economic opportunities for Islay province and the Arequipa region. Given the current Peruvian economic situation, it is crucial to move ahead on projects that will stimulate a sustainable growth cycle. We expect to begin the construction phase of the project in the near future. We will make it a priority to hire local labor to fill the 9,000 jobs that we expect to generate during Tia Maria's construction. Additionally, from day one of our operations, we will generate significant contribution to revenues in the Arequipa region by paying royalties and later on income tax. \n The Los Chancas project in Apurimac it's a greenfield project in which we are in a coordinated effort with the Peruvian authorities of the company, making significant progress in eradicating the illegal mining activities at our concession. Once this process is complete, we will restart environmental impact assessment, conduct a diamond drilling campaign for 40,000 meters and initiate hydrogeological and geotechnical studies to gather additional information on the characteristics of the Los Chancas deposit. \n The Michiquillay project in Cajamarca as of December 31 of last year, we have drilled 63,000 meters from a total program of 110,000 meters and obtained 20,137 core samples for chemical analysis. Geological modeling, cross section interpretation and drilling logging are currency underway. For 2024, the company expects to complete the diamond drilling product, geological modeling and resource evaluation. We will also begin hydrogeological and geotechnical studies and assess results of metallurgical testing at the deposit. The company continues working with the Michiquillay and La Encan\u0303ada communities following the guidelines of the social agreements signed with them. \n For environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG practices, major improvement -- we have a major improvement in water recovery that we want to report on. \n Over the last 4 years, we have improved the use of water at our operations going from 0.64 cubic meters, less than 1 cubic meter, 0.64 of water to a milled ton of mineral in 2020 to 0.53 cubic meters in 2023. This represents an increase in efficiency of 17%. Improvement has primarily been driven by the company's initiatives to recover water from our Quebrada Honda tailings dam in Peru and by an uptick in the water volume recovered at the Buenavista del Cobre mine in Mexico. \n We continue to make progress in our sustainability ratings. S&P Global results in its Corporate Sustainability Assessment or CSA, indicate that Southern Copper Corporation has achieved a place among the top 10 performers in the mining sector with a rating that exceed the industry average by 100%. These results reflect our ongoing commitment to improving our sustainability practices and maintaining the company's inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the Latin American region. This year marked our fifth consecutive year in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. In 2023, SCC achieved some of the highest scores in the sector for key CSA indicators, including transparency and disclosure, occupational safety and health, operations closure and human capital development. \n We obtained a score of 90 out of 100 on CSA's climate governance index. This attests to the progress the company has made in this area. Additionally, we achieved a score of 100 in the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures which focus on management and disclosure of financial risks and opportunities related to climate change. Additionally, investor-led Climate Action 100 plus initiative recognized our efforts to develop an emissions reduction roadmap and awarded us a full compliance rating in the TCFD category. Furthermore, the rating agency Sustainalytics reduced the company's risk by two levels between 2020 and 2023. \n In 2023, we registered a 97% increase in year-to-date -- year-to-year investment in social infrastructure. In Mexico, $35.9 million was allocated to these efforts. A project that was particularly noteworthy this year focused on improving water infrastructure for the communities of Cananea and Nacozari. In Peru, $45.7 million was invested in social infrastructure, including the progress in building the wastewater treatment plant or PTAR in Ilo. \n The company also prioritized educational infrastructure development in Peru and will build upon successful previous initiatives in Moquegua and Tacna. Continuing our commitment, the company is actively expanding educational infrastructure to benefit the community under the Works for Taxes modality. This effort includes setting up 5 high-performance schools of COAR that is the acronym in Spanish for 1,500 students to strengthen the capacities of outstanding students in the state educational circuit. Two schools are currently under construction in Moquegua and Tacna. These investments have made Southern Copper the primary private investor in Peru's national educational infrastructure. \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company's policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on January 25, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.80 per share of common stock payable on February 29 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 13, 2024. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like to now open up the call for questions. Yes. Okay. Basically, what we're seeing is that after enough uptick in prices, saying after the Russian invasion to Ukraine, we saw a combination of the impact that it has on energy and some key materials for us, such as ammonia that is used as a material for explosive production as well as steel, for instance, and obviously oil. And we had some cost push. Well, we react to that. We are signing -- changing the mix of explosives, changing -- making more research to improve our cost on steel as well as looking into some other ways to save energy, both at power and at fuel. And that somehow has helped us and made us stabilize our cash cost before credits at about $2.23, $2.24 last year, and we have the expectation of decreasing it a little bit more through 2024. Sure. Regarding the CapEx, we already have spent a little bit north of $350 million on equipment that is stored with the proper care nearby the Tia Maria deposit. And we are more positive for sure on Tia Maria and we are moving forward with some actions that -- and we will report on progress as we get better news on it. But yes, we are much more positive regarding the project. But we will like to give good news when we have something relevant to report. I can't copy you Gabriel, I can't copy you at all, could you get closer to... Yes, much better now. Okay. Thank you very much for your questions, Gabriel. Okay. Well, we have an inventory built up at the -- related to Minera Mexico refinery. At the end of the past quarter, we had about 7,800 tonnes of copper in process that should be sold I believe this quarter in the first quarter of this year. So this is not like -- it's more like one thing. Obviously, inventories have not -- are bearing all the time. But in this case, we had some repairs that were scheduled for the end of the year that generated this uptick in inventories in process. \n Regarding the Buenavista water situation, well, we have -- as I mentioned, we -- the company has taken action on solving this program for this year. We're basically moving water using water tankers, trucks. And obviously, it has an impact in cost. We'll see that -- it's about $29 million that we're expecting. And in terms of production, it created a problem in production at Buenavista. If you look at the metrics that we're reporting for Buenavista, we're mentioning that there was a reduction in mineral process as well as recovery. \n That's directly related to the lack of orders. So that's why the company has made us -- evaluated different ways to solve this. And we finally took a decision and are implementing it since this month -- I'm sorry, since January. Thank you very much, Alfonso, good hearing from you. Okay. In the water concessions, well, basically, we do have the concession for the wells. What we don't have, it's the final permit to build a pipeline. So that is something that we expect to have when we finish working on the construction for the wells, but we haven't received it yet. So this is what has created this. This plus some lower rain than expected this year -- this past year, I should say. That is basically what we have in the wells will solve the problem in terms of water availability, no matter how the weather affects rains in the area. \n Now in the case of El Arco, we haven't made any reference to the project because we have not much progress to report. We will do that when we have something relevant to share with the financial community. At this point, we're advancing the project, but there is nothing relevant to report. And then on the blended rate expected for La Caridad, let me explain what's happening in -- when we initiated the production of mineral at La Caridad -- the Pilares project, we found that there was an oxide layer that had to be removed before getting into full force, which are the feed for the concentrator. So the first month, this was at the end of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. \n We basically removed these oxides from the Pilares deposits and send it to our SX-EW leaching areas. That material is being processed. So we will expect to have some more refined SX-EW copper coming from Pilares in the near future. And then we look at the prices -- relative prices of molybdenum vis-a-vis copper. This was by mid-2023, molybdenum had very good prices and copper not as good as we had say in the year before. And after making some numbers, some financial reviews, we conclude that it was interesting to increase the molybdenum production of La Caridad, which is from our 4 open pit mines, the ones that have the best ore grade for molybdenum. \n So the company favored the production of molybdenum at La Caridad and that was sold taking the opportunity of much higher prices for molybdenum. That has passed the last quarter, we had a price that was reported lower than what we had before. And consequently, we're coming back to sending ore from Pilares to La Caridad. Our expectation is that we should be producing about 35,000 tons of copper from Pilares in the mix at the Caridad concentrator with Caridad material. If prices make -- if the prices make sense to do that, we'll consider it. I don't think so. I think that this is a different matter. It's just a pipeline permit that is taking longer than what we belief when we initiated this -- the work in these two wells. Okay. Let me address the last question. Other income was the expected one in 2023, other income/spend was the proper one, the usual trend of the company in 2023. The anomaly was in 2022. And it was a positive thing for the company. We had some insurance refunds as well as tax refund that we had in 2022. So more than having lower other income in 2023, we had an exceptional, very good 2022 in that regard. \n Getting into the ore purchases, basically, we have to purchase an unusual amount of copper concentrate in 2022 to fill up our smelter in Peru due to the Cuajone mine stoppage of 54 days. We had a committee that blockaded the water supply for Cuajone for, as I say, 54 days that was in 2022. So in 2023, Cuajone operated at full capacity, which is excellent for us. \n And that's why we reduced significantly our purchases of third-party's material. Generally speaking, we are buying third-party's copper for technical reasons because as you know, John, we are low in copper concentrates, so we keep using just our own material, fill up our smelters and refineries. But sometimes, we want to acquire third-party material that has technical characteristics that improve our process, and that's why we are buying some of that as our report shows. Certainly, Sofia. Okay. I already mentioned that for 2024, it's 935,000 -- 936,000. For 2025, 956,000; 2026, 985,000; 2027, 1,001,000; 2028, 1,018,000. I also mentioned that from this year, we're increasing our zinc production from 65,500 last year, up to 118,000 this year, and then over 170,000 for the next foreseeable future. We cannot -- we don't hear -- we couldn't hear you at the beginning. The first one, I couldn't get your question. I am so sorry. It's a relevant question for Grupo Mexico actually. But just what we do, if there is a good opportunity to generate value for our shareholders through an acquisition, we dive into these alternatives. In this case, the company is not directly involved. It's through AMC that the Las Cruces evaluation is being done. \n In the case of the dividend, well, it's -- as we explained, in each board meeting, the company, the Board looks at how the market is, what are the next payments that the company has to do, what are the investment requirements? And in this case, if you see our cash generation from operations was somehow lower. So the Board decided to cut a little bit the copper -- I'm sorry, the dividend in order to maintain a solid cash position for the company. Okay. Thank you very much, Carmen. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's fourth quarter and full year results for 2023. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the first quarter of 2024 results. Thank you very much for being with us, and have a very nice day."

With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the third quarter 2023. As well as answer any questions you may have. \n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP. Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Third Quarter of 2023 Results Conference Call. Before we go into today's agenda, let me mention that on October 5 of this year, Southern Copper lost one of the pillars of our organization. Mr. Xavier Garcia de Quevedo Board member and Executive Vice President of Grupo Mexico passed away. \n Over a period of spanning 50 years Xavier, had steer the company with intelligence, sound judgment and hard work. He took great pleasure in shared knowledge, mentoring and developing talent. As well as supporting multiple generations of employees at our organization. We will miss him. \n At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board member. As well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, who is also a Board member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results, expansion projects and ESG.. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Now let us focus on the copper market. In the first quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased 8% from an average of $3.51 per pound in the third quarter of last year, up to $2.79 this year. Even though this is a better price than what we had a year ago, we still see the market reflecting the uncertainty that involves basic metals due to a slow recovery of the Chinese economy, a recession in Europe and a soft landing or minor recession in the U.S. \n At this point, we see the following factors affecting the copper market. The most relevant market intelligent houses for the copper market are now expecting a market in surplus of about 170,000 tons for this year. Even though copper inventories are still at a very low level, they have increased from 235,000 tons in June, up to 292,000 tons in September. This is a 24% increase. And what we're looking at is the some of the London Metal Exchange, the COMEX Exchange, Shanghai Exchange and the bonded warehouses in China. \n On top of this, we are seeing stronger than expected U.S. dollar, which is reducing copper and other metal prices expressed in the [indiscernible]. It is important to emphasize that Copper plays a leading role in the global shift to clean energy, which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper, will be strong in the long term. In this scenario, we believe the current cycle of relatively low prices will be shortlist.\n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 75% of our sales in the third quarter of 2023. Copper production registered a decrease of 1.9% in the third quarter of this year in quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 226,120 tons. Our quarterly result reflects a 2.1% decrease in production in Peru, driven by our Cuajone mine, which reported lower ore grades. This was partially offset by higher production at Toquepala due to better ore grade. \n Production at our Mexican operations decreased 1.8% in a quarter-to-quarter terms, mainly due to lower production at our Buenavista mine. Compared to the second quarter of this year, copper production slightly decreased 0.6%, which was mainly attributable to a reduction in production at the Cuajone and Buenavista mines.\n For this year 2023, we expect to produce 917,000 tons -- 700 tons of copper, an increase of 2.6% over the 2022's  final price. For molybdenum, it represented 40% of the company's sales value in the third quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. \n Molybdenum prices averaged $23.59 per pound in the quarter compared to $16 in the third quarter of 2022. This represents an increase of 47.4% in the molybdenum price. Molybdenum production increased also by 12.6% in the third quarter of 2023. This was mainly driven by an increase in production at La Caridad, Toquepala and Buenavista mines due to higher ore grades, and these results were partially offset by lower production at the Cuajone mine. \n For 2023, we expect to produce 25,900 tons of molybdenum. For the short term, we believe molybdenum prices will have good support due to a market deficit and higher demand coming from the aerospace and defense industries. Silver represented 4% of our sales value in the third quarter of 2023, with an average price of $23.60 per ounce in the quarter. This reflected an increase of 23.5% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Silver is currently our second by-product. \n Mined silver production decreased 10% in the third quarter, versus the same period of 2022, after production decreased at our operations with the sole exception of the Toquepala mine. Refined silver production fell by 11.4% quarter-over-quarter, which was mainly driven by a drop in production at our IMMSA refinery. \n For commercial and operational reasons, the lead concentrate is now being sold to the market as concentrate instead of being processed in the refinery. In 2023, we expect to produce 19.3 million ounces of silver, an increase of 4% compared to 2022. Zinc represented 3% of our sales value in the third quarter of 2023, with an average price of $1.10 per pound in the quarter. This represents a 26% decrease with regard to the third quarter of 2022 figure. \n Zinc mine production increased 9.4% quarter-on-quarter and total 16,281 tons. This was driven primarily by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas mines. Which was partially offset by lower production at the San Martin mine. Refined zinc production decreased by 12% in the third quarter compared to the same period of 2022.\n For the year 2023, we expect to produce 64,200 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 7% over our 2022 production levels. For our financial results, in the third quarter of 2023, sales were $2.5 billion. This is $348  million higher than sales for the third quarter of 2022, which is a 16% increase in sales. \n Copper sales volume decreased by 4.5%, while value increased 16% in a scenario of better prices for this metal. Regarding our main by-products, we had higher sales of molybdenum, that increased by 61% in the molybdenum sales, and this was due to a combination of better prices and higher volume. Silver sales increased 19% due mainly to better prices. On zinc, we had lower sales by 31%, mainly due to lower prices and volumes. \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $67 million or 5%, when compared to the third quarter of 2022. The main cost increases has been in repair materials, workers' participation, depreciation, sales expenses, operations contractors and other factors. These cost increases were partially compensated by lower energy costs and lower inventory consumption. \n The third quarter of 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $1,291 million, which represented an increase of 27% with regard to the $1,018 million registered in the third quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter stood at 52% versus 47% in the same period of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the 9 months was $3,974 million. This is 7% higher than what we had in 2022 for the 9 months. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the 9 months of 2023 stood at 52%, which compares with 51% in the same period of 2022. \n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.98 per pound in the third quarter of 2023. This cash cost was $0.14 lower than the cash cost of $1.12, that we had in the second quarter of this year. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was  $2.24 per pound in the third quarter of this year. That is $0.05 higher than the value for the second quarter of 2023, which was a $2.19. This 3% increase in operating cash cost before credits is a result of higher cost per pound from production and administrative expenses and administrative expenses, these 2 increases in costs were partially compensated by lower treatment and refining charges and higher premiums. \n Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $604 million or $1.26 per pound in the third quarter of this year. These figures represent an 18% per pound increase in by-product credits, in compared to the credit that we have in 2022, which was $517 million in total credit or $1.07 per pound. That's for the second quarter of 2023. \n Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc and sulfuric acid and decreased for silver. For net income, net income in the third quarter of this year was $619.5 million, which represented a 19.4% increase, with regard to the $519 million registered in the third quarter of 2022. \n The net income margin was in the third quarter of this year, 24.7%, versus 24.1% in the third quarter of -- in the same period of 2022. These improvements were mainly driven by an increase in sales. Cash flow from operating activities in the 9 months of this year was $3,032 million, which represented an increase of 76% over the $1,720 million post in the 9 months of 2022.  \n For capital expenditures, our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments in the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of the El Arco Project. \n In the 9 months of the year, we spent $753 million on capital investments, which represent a 38% of net income and reflect a 14.5% uptick in capital expenses year-on-year. Since there is a short description of our main capital projects in SEC's press release, I'm going to update new developments for each. \n For the Buenavista Zinc concentrator in Sonora, the capital budget for this project is $413 million, most of which has already been invested. Progress is 99%, and we have initiated the commissioning process. Ramping up of the plant, initially scheduled to conclude in this quarter has been pushed back to the first quarter of 2024. Given that the concentrator require some technical adjustments. \n For the Pilares project in Sonora, this is a project that has a value for value and $176 million, of which $144 million has been invested. Pilares is currently operating and delivering copper ore to the Caridad concentrator. We will report on Pilares one more time at the closing of 2023. And after that, we will remove it from the list of ongoing projects of the company. For the El Pilar project in Sonora, we are having already the results from experimental paths in the leaching process, that have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. And we're evaluating different options to improve the same. Basic engineering study has been completed and the company is engaging in project developing and on-site environmental activities. \n Project Engineering is being developed by an external engineering and technology company. Mine life of Buenavista is estimated at 13 years. For El Arco, the company has completed the environmental baseline study for the mine concentrator and after facilities and will proceed to submit the environmental impact statement in Spanish manifestation the impact on the [indiscernible] to the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, SEMARNAT. \n This respective environmental impact permit. The company is currently preparing studies for the port, power line, town site and auxiliary services. For the Peruvian project, we have the Tia Maria project in the Arequipa region in Peru. This is a greenfield project located in Arequipa, Peru, that will use a state-of-the-art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards to produce 120,000 tons of SX-EW copper cathodes per year. \n The estimated capital budget for this project is $1.4 billion. It's important to mention that the company is ready to undertake this project. We have national -- the resources as well as all the engineering ready to go for Tia Maria. Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of Islay province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, healthcare and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. \n We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay. For Los Chancas in the Apurimac region of Peru, as of September 30 of this year, the company has held talks with representatives of the [indiscernible] community, but require -- part of the land required for the project. Simultaneously, we continue to work with the Peruvian authorities to eliminate illegal mining activities at our concession. SEC will initiate hydrogeological and geotechnical studies soon, to gather additional information on the characteristics of the Los Chancas deposit. \n The Michiquillay project in the Cajamarca region of Peru in 2023 in accordance with our social agreements with the Michiquillay [ can [ community, the company has hired unskilled labor and is paying for the use of surface land. We're also supporting social programs in both communities. Simultaneously, exploration activities are underway. \n As of September of this year, we have drilled 46,500 meters and obtained 14,282 core samples, which are currently under evaluation. Regarding environmental, social and corporate governance practices, ESG as it is known, while building drinking water infrastructure to remedy shortages in Cananea and Nacozari communities in Sonora in Mexico. \n Approximately 75,000 residents will benefit from these initiatives. This effort is aligned with our policies and commitments for sustainable development and is part of the $77 million, that we have invested in Mexico and Peru over the last 5 years. \n We're doing some innovation in the use and efficiency of water. We are currently recovering about 6,000 cubic meters of water per day, through the new tailings filtering plant in Quebrada Honda in Peru. This is equivalent to 0.6 cubic meters of water per tonne of tailings. With a design capacity of 10,000 tonnes per day and an investment to date of $27 million, this dam filter is the largest tailings processing unit of its kind in the market. \n We're continuing with focus on prevention and risk management. In September of this year, our Buenavista Recovery Unit in Sonora received a safe and healthy work environment recognition from the Mexican government, after successfully passing an audit conducted by the Mexican Social Security Institute. \n All of our other Mexican units also hold this recognition, which is awarded to companies that implement effective strategies and preventive actions for operational health and safety. We continue to make progress with our critical risk registry and the performance levels of the controls in place to prevent or mitigate undesirable events have improved. \n To receive this, we have involved the head of each operating unit in the process, to establish and continuously monitor controls. All results are reported to managing executives on a monthly basis to facilitate supervision and subsequent monitoring by the Board of Directors. \n Innovation in climate change mitigation. In September of this year also, Southern Peru received the 2023 National Mining Award in the mining economy category, within the framework of PERUMIN 36 Mining Convention held in the Arequipa region in Peru. The winning study, integration scenarios of renewable electricity generation systems in the mining sector of Peru by 2050, prepared by engineered Rolando Jes\u00fas Claros from the Power Systems area of Southern Peru proposes the use of clean and renewable energy sources as part of the global energy transition process. \n Southern Copper aims to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. For disclosure, transparency and accountability, to provide more clarity regarding Southern Copper's performance on ESG issues, we have published a supplement to the 2022 Sustainable Development Report and have also incorporated new topics on our Sustainable Development page to address biodiversity, our people, human rights and supply chain. \n At the behest of our investors, we have expand our responses to the CVP questionnaires to include the forest questioner. This information components responses to our climate change and water security questioners that has been available, since 2016 and 2022 respectively.\n From [ last to me ] a journey of environmental restoration. Year-to-date, we have reinforced 3x the area impact in the same period. We have restored 1,388 hectares, we planted versus 424 hectares impacted. Additionally, we have implemented the works to retain 10,722 tons of soil that will have otherwise been lost to erosion in the state of Sonora in Mexico. \n These actions are between the framework of our strategy to achieve zero net deforestation and generate a net positive impact on biodiversity, particularly in areas close to our operations. In having terms of the communities near our operations are highly active in future programs we offer. Thus far this year, we have recorded 170,000 participations in these programs, which is a 7% increase from the previous year. \n One of our most noteworthy efforts, the Youth Orchestra and Choirs program recently celebrated its fifth year and is now presenting in 11 communities with 1,596 students in Mexico and Peru. To date, 8 out of 10 of our alumni pursue a bachelor's degree with 2% choosing music as their lifestyle. \n Changing subjects, regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs in each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on October 19, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock, which will be payable on November 22 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 8 of this year. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us. And we would like now to open up the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And it's coming from the line of Gabriel Simoes with Godman Sachs. \nGabriel Simoes: I have 2 questions here. The first one is about capital allocation, right? So El Pilar was postponed a bit basically because of the new regulatory process, that you have to go through to get approved in Mexico. And some issues, we've seen some issues with the other projects advancing in the near term. So we're at the point that El Pilar is the last Board approved project. \n So I just wanted to have an idea of what we should expect in terms in CapEx, and the capital allocation for the coming years? And when we should see new projects being taken to the Board given the advancements that you guys are making on the other projects that you have on the pipeline? And in the meantime, if you have any thoughts that you could share on dividend distribution, thinking about the future distributions. So that's the first question. \n And then the second question here is about the costs in the mining division here for the company. So in the beginning of the year, if I'm not mistaken, we were in at $1.9 per pound, before by-product for the cost and we're running at a much higher level. So we just wanted to understand what was the main change this year versus the beginning of the year that would explain this difference and the fact that we're running at higher levels. I mean, how should we think about the cost for the fourth quarter and for 2024 and the main drivers for this in your opinion? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Thank you for your question, Gabriel. Actually, you said 2 questions, but they are at least 4, but I'm glad that you made them. \nGabriel Simoes: Sorry about that. \nRaul Jacob: No, no, no problem at all. On capital allocation, well, we are working -- we're still doing some engineering work for [indiscernible] some tests. We want to be sure on the recovery. And actually, what we would like to get is even an improvement of the current recovery rates that were -- that we have in the history, just to improve its profitability for the future. This is the time where you need to do this test, not when you have the whole facility design and already built. \n On the other projects, basically, we will be informing to the market, as we undertake the different project that are in our pipeline. We can give you with a forecast of our CapEx, considering the development of the projects that I comment a few minutes ago, and I'll do that now. \n For this year, we're expecting to finish the year at about $1 billion in capital expenditures. For 2024, number will be $1.3 billion, for 2025 $1.7 billion, 2026, $2.1 billion and 2027 to $2.6 billion. Dividends, it's always up to the Board. The Board approved a dividend of $1 per share for the last quarter. And if you look at our track record, it's quite clear that the company will not hold cash. That has been our record, and we expect that to be the case for the future as well. \n Cash cost, we have some expenditures that were not considered in terms of our operating cost, and let me comment on that. As you may know, the Mexican exchange rate appreciated through the year, that impact our peso-denominated cost in the Peruvian case, we had no significant variance in the exchange rates. So we didn't have that much of an effect on that. \n For for some costs, we are seeing now the reflect of inventory consumption. And a practical example is what has happened with the tariffs for mining trucks. When we have the beginning of the war or the invasion to be more proper of Russia to Ukraine, we have the right away an increase in fuel and some other materials like ammonia that was used for explosives. But certain costs, such as the one for tires were not impacted because we were consuming our stocks. \n Now we're replenishing the stocks for some of these materials, and that is somehow affecting our cash cost per pound, even though we are producing a little bit more copper than next year. But as I'm saying that, we're also seeing some reductions in some costs, particularly in 3 items. Fuel, where we have a small slight variance, explosive also some reductions in costs as well as still -- and what we are also doing is catching up in certain maintenance expenditures, that we could make in the -- through the COVID years and later on last year. \n Regarding what we are expecting for cash cost for -- for this year, we believe we could close at about the level that we are now, we're slightly better because we will have a little bit more production in the fourth quarter. For 2024, about $1, very close to where we are now. And then it depends on how the new projects are kicking in into our production profile for the next few years. \nGabriel Simoes: That's very clear. I just wanted to do a follow-up basically on the cash cost. I just wanted to understand the -- if you have a guidance for the 4 byproduct costs as well. That would be helpful. \nRaul Jacob: At above we are now in the last quarter. In the last quarter, it was $2.24 per pound. We believe it could be lower than that for the next few quarters. But for now, it will be a little bit more of $2.20. \nOperator: All right. It comes from the line of Sofia Martin with [indiscernible]. \nUnknown Analyst: Congratulations on your results. I have 2 main questions. My first one is, could you give us any color on production for the rest of the year and 2024? And if you have any further guidance going forward? And my second question is related to copper prices and market dynamics. Do you have any color heading into 2024? \nRaul Jacob: Thank you for your questions, Sofia. For this year, as I mentioned, we're expecting 918,000 tons, that's for 2023. For next year, we expect to increase it for a few reasons. Let me comment on that. \n Our goal is 946,700 for next year. We will have the contribution at full speed of Pilares. Pilares this year, we're getting about 23,000 tons of copper from Pilares. And the reason for that is that at the beginning of the project, we had oxide that are -- that were sent to mineral in the form of oxides, that were sent to our SX-EW plant, and they take a little bit longer to process than the usual sulfuric mineral. \n For next year, we're expecting Pilares to increase from 23,000 tons of copper to 30,000 tonnes of copper. We will get the positive contribution of Buenavista Zinc for about 30,000 tons. And we will have improvement in the Toquepala and Cuajone ore grades, that will increase a little bit their production. In the case of Toquepala by 7,000, in the case of Caujone by 9,000. So you have some additions on that. \n Later on, we will have for 2025, our expectation is 956,500, in that case, we are expecting the contribution of El Pilar, a partial contribution of El Pilar as well as Buenavista Zinc and Pilares copper production at full speed. For 2026, 985,400 and for 2027, 1 million tons of copper production. \n For 2024, well, it's hard to say. We're looking at the market, as I mentioned, even though we had an 8% increase in prices, we're still seeing a market that stopped defining, its direction actually. For now, we are expecting prices in the range of where we are now, maybe a little bit better if China comes back consuming, more basic materials than what has had in the past through this year. That is hard to predict at this point. \n Long term, we do see a very strong demand coming from the energy revolution that includes electric vehicles and some other important copper construction, consumption as transmission lines, Eolica energy and so on. \nOperator: And it comes from the line of John Tumazos with Very Independent Research. \nJohn Tumazos: Thank you very much. The $1 quarterly dividends, thank you have been bigger than reported earnings in 2022 and 2023. And the 4 very big capital projects are delayed and distant. There is $7 billion of debt and lease, before cash balances and investments. The Board places a priority on perhaps reducing the debt, just in case when feasibility studies are updated, the capital cost rise. There's other companies or projects, where capital costs doubled. I know that won't happen in Southern Copper, but, you never know. Thank you. \nRaul Jacob: Well, I think that the -- let me comment on our debt position. Currently, well, you indicated, John, that you're considering also lease included and as part of our debt. Actually, it's a long-term contract. It's a PPA that we have for power, for both the Peruvian and Mexican operations.\n Accounting-wise, we have to register that as a lease, but actually it's a PPA, Pre-Purchase Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement. But our debt position, it's about $6.2 billion. The average rate is 6%. In the last few years, we did several bond issues that allow us to capture lower rates, and that has improved our debt profile. We will not have to pay for any principal up to 2025. When we have $500 million that are due. Last year, we paid $300 million. \n And for now, unless we have a project going on and getting into the construction phase, one of the main projects that I mentioned already. We believe that we will maintain the current cash position and debt position. For dividends, as I mentioned, it's a decision that always taken by the Board. But what we are seeing is that, generally speaking, the company is not holding any cash. And I think that, that will be our behavior in the next few quarters. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. \nTimna Tanners: %I know one of the other large copper producer CEO has mentioned that at current copper prices, projects were no longer so attractive, especially given higher costs for start-ups. But I'd like your thoughts on that. I know you still have quite a few projects in your pipeline, but they have been delayed a bit. And I'm just wondering if you still find building attractive or if there's a different approach to building versus buying, if M&A is interesting, great to get your thoughts. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much for your question, Timna. Okay. On our projects, the price the -- at current prices, say, [ $260 million ], even though costs have increased for both CapEx as well as OpEx, we see that they are attractive in terms of the returns that they are providing to the company. I think that as costs increase for operating purposes, we are seeing also an increase in the long-term price for the market. \n And let me explain what I mean. Usefully, long term -- a reasonable way to look at the long-term price will be the average industry cost plus maintenance capital for the current operations worldwide. As the long-term price used to be at about [ $330 million ] to promote the growth of our industry. Now you have to add to that, whatever inflation it's affecting both CapEx as well as OpEx. And considering that, I believe that we will be at about [ $360 million ] or even higher than that for the long run as a new price reference. \n So I believe that the copper prices decreased further down from where they are, which is not our base case, but that may happen. We should see Again, what we have seen in some other copper price cycle, where supply is somehow affected by demand restriction. \n Now having said that, it seems important to me to consider that production coming from Chile and Peru has been affected by different circumstances in these 2 countries. And that has somehow slowed the development of new projects that should supply the copper for the future. So my view is that it's positive in the sense of midterm to long term, but we still have to pass through this strange fees that we're seeing nowadays. \nTimna Tanners: That's helpful. I know there's also been some headlines around your Buenavista operations and some on blockages that have been reported in the local press, that have caused some concern. I think that wasn't a cause of any disruption, but it would be great to get your perspective on that or how you see that getting resolved? \nRaul Jacob: Well, as you was mentioning it has not affected our operations. We are seeing some -- mainly related to the political campaign that, it's about to begin or it's already under course in Mexico. As you know, there is -- we have a significant change in unions regarding the Buenavista operation in the past decade. And I think that there are certain external forces or political forces, that would like to affect our operations. They are haven't had any success so far in these many years, and I believe that, that will be the case for the future as well. \nOperator: And it comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. \nAlexander Hacking: Raul, I just wanted to clarify on the guidance. And you said 946,000 tons next year. In my notes, I had that last quarter that, that guidance was 1,026,000 tons, which is a 80,000-ton cut to that guidance. Am I correct? And if so, I guess, what's driven that downgrade and expectation for next year? \nRaul Jacob: Hold-on a sec please. The reference that you gave us, Alex, is correct. We have made an adjustment in our production for the current operations, particularly Buenavista and Buenavista Zinc. Those 2 has been -- has reduced their forecast for next year. This number is still under review. We will do a new set of forecast at the beginning of next year in our January conference. And currently, what we're considering is how are we going to improve the 946,000 tons, that I mentioned before. \nAlexander Hacking: And then just to follow-up with the issue there, obviously, there's a little bit of timing slippage right on Buenavista Zinc. But would the other -- would the main issue be great? Would that be the reason that like the grade is effectively going to be a little bit lower than this previously forecast? \nRaul Jacob: It's basically ore grade because the operations are at full speed, all the time, 24/7. So it's mainly ore grades or recoveries, depending on the different phases you are in the mines. That changes a little bit. And that plus the start-up of projects are the drivers of changes in production on the yearly basis. \nOperator: And it comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. \nCarlos de Alba: So Raul, any comments on how Southern Copper has taken the plan proposed by the Mexican government to remediate what they claim is still a contamination in river Sonora from this period in 2014. \nRaul Jacob: Very straightforward answer is no, Carlos. We are looking at the information and we're studying it, and we'll answer that when within corresponds. But at this point, we have no comments on this. \nCarlos de Alba: Okay. That's clear. Now just the company, if I understand correctly, has done several analyses throughout the years. And they don't show any contamination left. Is that fair? \nRaul Jacob: That's our view on the matter, yes. \nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you very much, Carmen. And this will conclude our Conference Call for the Third Quarter of 2023. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us, when we report the fourth quarter of this year and the end of the year results in January. Thank you very much, and have a nice day. \nOperator: Thank you all for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Third Quarter of 2023 Results Conference Call. Before we go into today's agenda, let me mention that on October 5 of this year, Southern Copper lost one of the pillars of our organization. Mr. Xavier Garcia de Quevedo Board member and Executive Vice President of Grupo Mexico passed away. \n Over a period of spanning 50 years Xavier, had steer the company with intelligence, sound judgment and hard work. He took great pleasure in shared knowledge, mentoring and developing talent. As well as supporting multiple generations of employees at our organization. We will miss him. \n At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board member. As well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, who is also a Board member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results, expansion projects and ESG.. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Now let us focus on the copper market. In the first quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price increased 8% from an average of $3.51 per pound in the third quarter of last year, up to $2.79 this year. Even though this is a better price than what we had a year ago, we still see the market reflecting the uncertainty that involves basic metals due to a slow recovery of the Chinese economy, a recession in Europe and a soft landing or minor recession in the U.S. \n At this point, we see the following factors affecting the copper market. The most relevant market intelligent houses for the copper market are now expecting a market in surplus of about 170,000 tons for this year. Even though copper inventories are still at a very low level, they have increased from 235,000 tons in June, up to 292,000 tons in September. This is a 24% increase. And what we're looking at is the some of the London Metal Exchange, the COMEX Exchange, Shanghai Exchange and the bonded warehouses in China. \n On top of this, we are seeing stronger than expected U.S. dollar, which is reducing copper and other metal prices expressed in the [indiscernible]. It is important to emphasize that Copper plays a leading role in the global shift to clean energy, which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper, will be strong in the long term. In this scenario, we believe the current cycle of relatively low prices will be shortlist.\n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 75% of our sales in the third quarter of 2023. Copper production registered a decrease of 1.9% in the third quarter of this year in quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 226,120 tons. Our quarterly result reflects a 2.1% decrease in production in Peru, driven by our Cuajone mine, which reported lower ore grades. This was partially offset by higher production at Toquepala due to better ore grade. \n Production at our Mexican operations decreased 1.8% in a quarter-to-quarter terms, mainly due to lower production at our Buenavista mine. Compared to the second quarter of this year, copper production slightly decreased 0.6%, which was mainly attributable to a reduction in production at the Cuajone and Buenavista mines.\n For this year 2023, we expect to produce 917,000 tons -- 700 tons of copper, an increase of 2.6% over the 2022's  final price. For molybdenum, it represented 40% of the company's sales value in the third quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. \n Molybdenum prices averaged $23.59 per pound in the quarter compared to $16 in the third quarter of 2022. This represents an increase of 47.4% in the molybdenum price. Molybdenum production increased also by 12.6% in the third quarter of 2023. This was mainly driven by an increase in production at La Caridad, Toquepala and Buenavista mines due to higher ore grades, and these results were partially offset by lower production at the Cuajone mine. \n For 2023, we expect to produce 25,900 tons of molybdenum. For the short term, we believe molybdenum prices will have good support due to a market deficit and higher demand coming from the aerospace and defense industries. Silver represented 4% of our sales value in the third quarter of 2023, with an average price of $23.60 per ounce in the quarter. This reflected an increase of 23.5% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Silver is currently our second by-product. \n Mined silver production decreased 10% in the third quarter, versus the same period of 2022, after production decreased at our operations with the sole exception of the Toquepala mine. Refined silver production fell by 11.4% quarter-over-quarter, which was mainly driven by a drop in production at our IMMSA refinery. \n For commercial and operational reasons, the lead concentrate is now being sold to the market as concentrate instead of being processed in the refinery. In 2023, we expect to produce 19.3 million ounces of silver, an increase of 4% compared to 2022. Zinc represented 3% of our sales value in the third quarter of 2023, with an average price of $1.10 per pound in the quarter. This represents a 26% decrease with regard to the third quarter of 2022 figure. \n Zinc mine production increased 9.4% quarter-on-quarter and total 16,281 tons. This was driven primarily by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas mines. Which was partially offset by lower production at the San Martin mine. Refined zinc production decreased by 12% in the third quarter compared to the same period of 2022.\n For the year 2023, we expect to produce 64,200 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 7% over our 2022 production levels. For our financial results, in the third quarter of 2023, sales were $2.5 billion. This is $348  million higher than sales for the third quarter of 2022, which is a 16% increase in sales. \n Copper sales volume decreased by 4.5%, while value increased 16% in a scenario of better prices for this metal. Regarding our main by-products, we had higher sales of molybdenum, that increased by 61% in the molybdenum sales, and this was due to a combination of better prices and higher volume. Silver sales increased 19% due mainly to better prices. On zinc, we had lower sales by 31%, mainly due to lower prices and volumes. \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $67 million or 5%, when compared to the third quarter of 2022. The main cost increases has been in repair materials, workers' participation, depreciation, sales expenses, operations contractors and other factors. These cost increases were partially compensated by lower energy costs and lower inventory consumption. \n The third quarter of 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $1,291 million, which represented an increase of 27% with regard to the $1,018 million registered in the third quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter stood at 52% versus 47% in the same period of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the 9 months was $3,974 million. This is 7% higher than what we had in 2022 for the 9 months. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the 9 months of 2023 stood at 52%, which compares with 51% in the same period of 2022. \n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.98 per pound in the third quarter of 2023. This cash cost was $0.14 lower than the cash cost of $1.12, that we had in the second quarter of this year. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was  $2.24 per pound in the third quarter of this year. That is $0.05 higher than the value for the second quarter of 2023, which was a $2.19. This 3% increase in operating cash cost before credits is a result of higher cost per pound from production and administrative expenses and administrative expenses, these 2 increases in costs were partially compensated by lower treatment and refining charges and higher premiums. \n Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $604 million or $1.26 per pound in the third quarter of this year. These figures represent an 18% per pound increase in by-product credits, in compared to the credit that we have in 2022, which was $517 million in total credit or $1.07 per pound. That's for the second quarter of 2023. \n Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc and sulfuric acid and decreased for silver. For net income, net income in the third quarter of this year was $619.5 million, which represented a 19.4% increase, with regard to the $519 million registered in the third quarter of 2022. \n The net income margin was in the third quarter of this year, 24.7%, versus 24.1% in the third quarter of -- in the same period of 2022. These improvements were mainly driven by an increase in sales. Cash flow from operating activities in the 9 months of this year was $3,032 million, which represented an increase of 76% over the $1,720 million post in the 9 months of 2022.  \n For capital expenditures, our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments in the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of the El Arco Project. \n In the 9 months of the year, we spent $753 million on capital investments, which represent a 38% of net income and reflect a 14.5% uptick in capital expenses year-on-year. Since there is a short description of our main capital projects in SEC's press release, I'm going to update new developments for each. \n For the Buenavista Zinc concentrator in Sonora, the capital budget for this project is $413 million, most of which has already been invested. Progress is 99%, and we have initiated the commissioning process. Ramping up of the plant, initially scheduled to conclude in this quarter has been pushed back to the first quarter of 2024. Given that the concentrator require some technical adjustments. \n For the Pilares project in Sonora, this is a project that has a value for value and $176 million, of which $144 million has been invested. Pilares is currently operating and delivering copper ore to the Caridad concentrator. We will report on Pilares one more time at the closing of 2023. And after that, we will remove it from the list of ongoing projects of the company. For the El Pilar project in Sonora, we are having already the results from experimental paths in the leaching process, that have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. And we're evaluating different options to improve the same. Basic engineering study has been completed and the company is engaging in project developing and on-site environmental activities. \n Project Engineering is being developed by an external engineering and technology company. Mine life of Buenavista is estimated at 13 years. For El Arco, the company has completed the environmental baseline study for the mine concentrator and after facilities and will proceed to submit the environmental impact statement in Spanish manifestation the impact on the [indiscernible] to the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, SEMARNAT. \n This respective environmental impact permit. The company is currently preparing studies for the port, power line, town site and auxiliary services. For the Peruvian project, we have the Tia Maria project in the Arequipa region in Peru. This is a greenfield project located in Arequipa, Peru, that will use a state-of-the-art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards to produce 120,000 tons of SX-EW copper cathodes per year. \n The estimated capital budget for this project is $1.4 billion. It's important to mention that the company is ready to undertake this project. We have national -- the resources as well as all the engineering ready to go for Tia Maria. Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of Islay province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, healthcare and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. \n We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay. For Los Chancas in the Apurimac region of Peru, as of September 30 of this year, the company has held talks with representatives of the [indiscernible] community, but require -- part of the land required for the project. Simultaneously, we continue to work with the Peruvian authorities to eliminate illegal mining activities at our concession. SEC will initiate hydrogeological and geotechnical studies soon, to gather additional information on the characteristics of the Los Chancas deposit. \n The Michiquillay project in the Cajamarca region of Peru in 2023 in accordance with our social agreements with the Michiquillay [ can [ community, the company has hired unskilled labor and is paying for the use of surface land. We're also supporting social programs in both communities. Simultaneously, exploration activities are underway. \n As of September of this year, we have drilled 46,500 meters and obtained 14,282 core samples, which are currently under evaluation. Regarding environmental, social and corporate governance practices, ESG as it is known, while building drinking water infrastructure to remedy shortages in Cananea and Nacozari communities in Sonora in Mexico. \n Approximately 75,000 residents will benefit from these initiatives. This effort is aligned with our policies and commitments for sustainable development and is part of the $77 million, that we have invested in Mexico and Peru over the last 5 years. \n We're doing some innovation in the use and efficiency of water. We are currently recovering about 6,000 cubic meters of water per day, through the new tailings filtering plant in Quebrada Honda in Peru. This is equivalent to 0.6 cubic meters of water per tonne of tailings. With a design capacity of 10,000 tonnes per day and an investment to date of $27 million, this dam filter is the largest tailings processing unit of its kind in the market. \n We're continuing with focus on prevention and risk management. In September of this year, our Buenavista Recovery Unit in Sonora received a safe and healthy work environment recognition from the Mexican government, after successfully passing an audit conducted by the Mexican Social Security Institute. \n All of our other Mexican units also hold this recognition, which is awarded to companies that implement effective strategies and preventive actions for operational health and safety. We continue to make progress with our critical risk registry and the performance levels of the controls in place to prevent or mitigate undesirable events have improved. \n To receive this, we have involved the head of each operating unit in the process, to establish and continuously monitor controls. All results are reported to managing executives on a monthly basis to facilitate supervision and subsequent monitoring by the Board of Directors. \n Innovation in climate change mitigation. In September of this year also, Southern Peru received the 2023 National Mining Award in the mining economy category, within the framework of PERUMIN 36 Mining Convention held in the Arequipa region in Peru. The winning study, integration scenarios of renewable electricity generation systems in the mining sector of Peru by 2050, prepared by engineered Rolando Jesu\u0301s Claros from the Power Systems area of Southern Peru proposes the use of clean and renewable energy sources as part of the global energy transition process. \n Southern Copper aims to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. For disclosure, transparency and accountability, to provide more clarity regarding Southern Copper's performance on ESG issues, we have published a supplement to the 2022 Sustainable Development Report and have also incorporated new topics on our Sustainable Development page to address biodiversity, our people, human rights and supply chain. \n At the behest of our investors, we have expand our responses to the CVP questionnaires to include the forest questioner. This information components responses to our climate change and water security questioners that has been available, since 2016 and 2022 respectively.\n From [ last to me ] a journey of environmental restoration. Year-to-date, we have reinforced 3x the area impact in the same period. We have restored 1,388 hectares, we planted versus 424 hectares impacted. Additionally, we have implemented the works to retain 10,722 tons of soil that will have otherwise been lost to erosion in the state of Sonora in Mexico. \n These actions are between the framework of our strategy to achieve zero net deforestation and generate a net positive impact on biodiversity, particularly in areas close to our operations. In having terms of the communities near our operations are highly active in future programs we offer. Thus far this year, we have recorded 170,000 participations in these programs, which is a 7% increase from the previous year. \n One of our most noteworthy efforts, the Youth Orchestra and Choirs program recently celebrated its fifth year and is now presenting in 11 communities with 1,596 students in Mexico and Peru. To date, 8 out of 10 of our alumni pursue a bachelor's degree with 2% choosing music as their lifestyle. \n Changing subjects, regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs in each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on October 19, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock, which will be payable on November 22 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 8 of this year. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us. And we would like now to open up the forum for questions. Yes. Thank you for your question, Gabriel. Actually, you said 2 questions, but they are at least 4, but I'm glad that you made them. No, no, no problem at all. On capital allocation, well, we are working -- we're still doing some engineering work for [indiscernible] some tests. We want to be sure on the recovery. And actually, what we would like to get is even an improvement of the current recovery rates that were -- that we have in the history, just to improve its profitability for the future. This is the time where you need to do this test, not when you have the whole facility design and already built. \n On the other projects, basically, we will be informing to the market, as we undertake the different project that are in our pipeline. We can give you with a forecast of our CapEx, considering the development of the projects that I comment a few minutes ago, and I'll do that now. \n For this year, we're expecting to finish the year at about $1 billion in capital expenditures. For 2024, number will be $1.3 billion, for 2025 $1.7 billion, 2026, $2.1 billion and 2027 to $2.6 billion. Dividends, it's always up to the Board. The Board approved a dividend of $1 per share for the last quarter. And if you look at our track record, it's quite clear that the company will not hold cash. That has been our record, and we expect that to be the case for the future as well. \n Cash cost, we have some expenditures that were not considered in terms of our operating cost, and let me comment on that. As you may know, the Mexican exchange rate appreciated through the year, that impact our peso-denominated cost in the Peruvian case, we had no significant variance in the exchange rates. So we didn't have that much of an effect on that. \n For for some costs, we are seeing now the reflect of inventory consumption. And a practical example is what has happened with the tariffs for mining trucks. When we have the beginning of the war or the invasion to be more proper of Russia to Ukraine, we have the right away an increase in fuel and some other materials like ammonia that was used for explosives. But certain costs, such as the one for tires were not impacted because we were consuming our stocks. \n Now we're replenishing the stocks for some of these materials, and that is somehow affecting our cash cost per pound, even though we are producing a little bit more copper than next year. But as I'm saying that, we're also seeing some reductions in some costs, particularly in 3 items. Fuel, where we have a small slight variance, explosive also some reductions in costs as well as still -- and what we are also doing is catching up in certain maintenance expenditures, that we could make in the -- through the COVID years and later on last year. \n Regarding what we are expecting for cash cost for -- for this year, we believe we could close at about the level that we are now, we're slightly better because we will have a little bit more production in the fourth quarter. For 2024, about $1, very close to where we are now. And then it depends on how the new projects are kicking in into our production profile for the next few years. At above we are now in the last quarter. In the last quarter, it was $2.24 per pound. We believe it could be lower than that for the next few quarters. But for now, it will be a little bit more of $2.20. Thank you for your questions, Sofia. For this year, as I mentioned, we're expecting 918,000 tons, that's for 2023. For next year, we expect to increase it for a few reasons. Let me comment on that. \n Our goal is 946,700 for next year. We will have the contribution at full speed of Pilares. Pilares this year, we're getting about 23,000 tons of copper from Pilares. And the reason for that is that at the beginning of the project, we had oxide that are -- that were sent to mineral in the form of oxides, that were sent to our SX-EW plant, and they take a little bit longer to process than the usual sulfuric mineral. \n For next year, we're expecting Pilares to increase from 23,000 tons of copper to 30,000 tonnes of copper. We will get the positive contribution of Buenavista Zinc for about 30,000 tons. And we will have improvement in the Toquepala and Cuajone ore grades, that will increase a little bit their production. In the case of Toquepala by 7,000, in the case of Caujone by 9,000. So you have some additions on that. \n Later on, we will have for 2025, our expectation is 956,500, in that case, we are expecting the contribution of El Pilar, a partial contribution of El Pilar as well as Buenavista Zinc and Pilares copper production at full speed. For 2026, 985,400 and for 2027, 1 million tons of copper production. \n For 2024, well, it's hard to say. We're looking at the market, as I mentioned, even though we had an 8% increase in prices, we're still seeing a market that stopped defining, its direction actually. For now, we are expecting prices in the range of where we are now, maybe a little bit better if China comes back consuming, more basic materials than what has had in the past through this year. That is hard to predict at this point. \n Long term, we do see a very strong demand coming from the energy revolution that includes electric vehicles and some other important copper construction, consumption as transmission lines, Eolica energy and so on. Well, I think that the -- let me comment on our debt position. Currently, well, you indicated, John, that you're considering also lease included and as part of our debt. Actually, it's a long-term contract. It's a PPA that we have for power, for both the Peruvian and Mexican operations.\n Accounting-wise, we have to register that as a lease, but actually it's a PPA, Pre-Purchase Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement. But our debt position, it's about $6.2 billion. The average rate is 6%. In the last few years, we did several bond issues that allow us to capture lower rates, and that has improved our debt profile. We will not have to pay for any principal up to 2025. When we have $500 million that are due. Last year, we paid $300 million. \n And for now, unless we have a project going on and getting into the construction phase, one of the main projects that I mentioned already. We believe that we will maintain the current cash position and debt position. For dividends, as I mentioned, it's a decision that always taken by the Board. But what we are seeing is that, generally speaking, the company is not holding any cash. And I think that, that will be our behavior in the next few quarters. Thank you very much for your question, Timna. Okay. On our projects, the price the -- at current prices, say, [ $260 million ], even though costs have increased for both CapEx as well as OpEx, we see that they are attractive in terms of the returns that they are providing to the company. I think that as costs increase for operating purposes, we are seeing also an increase in the long-term price for the market. \n And let me explain what I mean. Usefully, long term -- a reasonable way to look at the long-term price will be the average industry cost plus maintenance capital for the current operations worldwide. As the long-term price used to be at about [ $330 million ] to promote the growth of our industry. Now you have to add to that, whatever inflation it's affecting both CapEx as well as OpEx. And considering that, I believe that we will be at about [ $360 million ] or even higher than that for the long run as a new price reference. \n So I believe that the copper prices decreased further down from where they are, which is not our base case, but that may happen. We should see Again, what we have seen in some other copper price cycle, where supply is somehow affected by demand restriction. \n Now having said that, it seems important to me to consider that production coming from Chile and Peru has been affected by different circumstances in these 2 countries. And that has somehow slowed the development of new projects that should supply the copper for the future. So my view is that it's positive in the sense of midterm to long term, but we still have to pass through this strange fees that we're seeing nowadays. Well, as you was mentioning it has not affected our operations. We are seeing some -- mainly related to the political campaign that, it's about to begin or it's already under course in Mexico. As you know, there is -- we have a significant change in unions regarding the Buenavista operation in the past decade. And I think that there are certain external forces or political forces, that would like to affect our operations. They are haven't had any success so far in these many years, and I believe that, that will be the case for the future as well. Hold-on a sec please. The reference that you gave us, Alex, is correct. We have made an adjustment in our production for the current operations, particularly Buenavista and Buenavista Zinc. Those 2 has been -- has reduced their forecast for next year. This number is still under review. We will do a new set of forecast at the beginning of next year in our January conference. And currently, what we're considering is how are we going to improve the 946,000 tons, that I mentioned before. It's basically ore grade because the operations are at full speed, all the time, 24/7. So it's mainly ore grades or recoveries, depending on the different phases you are in the mines. That changes a little bit. And that plus the start-up of projects are the drivers of changes in production on the yearly basis. Very straightforward answer is no, Carlos. We are looking at the information and we're studying it, and we'll answer that when within corresponds. But at this point, we have no comments on this. That's our view on the matter, yes. Okay. Thank you very much, Carmen. And this will conclude our Conference Call for the Third Quarter of 2023. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us, when we report the fourth quarter of this year and the end of the year results in January. Thank you very much, and have a nice day."

Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP. \n Now I will pass the call to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Second Quarter of 2023 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board Member; as well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, also a fellow Board Member. \n In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Now let us focus on the copper market. In the second quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased 11% from an average of $4.32 per pound in the second quarter of 2022, down to $3.85 per pound at the close in average for the second quarter. This reflects concerns about the impact of a slowdown of the Chinese economy, a possible recession in Europe and a soft landing or minor recession in the U.S. Current prices for copper at around $3.90 per pound, reflecting a less optimistic market than that seen in the last few quarters. \n At this point, we see the following factors affecting the copper market: a reduction in global inflation, which may portend the end of the interest rate hike cycle led by the Fed and the ECB; a strong recovery of mining production of Peru, who have a 19% growth for the period January-May of this year. This is reducing the uncertainty on current production. \n Chile is still lagging with a 5% reduction in copper production for the same period. Investments for future growth are still affected by expectations of economic changes in Chile and social unrest in Peru. These 2 countries, as you know, represent about 40% of the global supply. The most relevant market intelligent houses for the copper market are now expecting a market in surplus of about 100,000 tons for this year. This assumes a growth in demand of about 1% this year and also about the same level for the supply. \n Low copper inventories is another factor that is affecting the copper market. At the closing of March 31 -- or as of March 31, this -- the sum of the London Metal Exchange, the COMEX Exchange, the Shanghai warehouse and the bundled warehouses in China add up to 411,000 tons of copper in inventories. That number has dropped to about 235,000 tons. This 42% reduction in inventories represents the largest dip since 2005. It is important to emphasize that copper plays a leading role in the global shift to clean energy, which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper will be strong in the long term. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 78% of our sales in the second quarter of 2023. Copper production registered an increase of 9% in the second quarter in a quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 227,533 tons. Our quarterly result reflects a 20% increase in production in Peru, driven by higher recoveries, the return to full capacity -- full operating capacity of the Cuajone mine and higher ore grades at Toquepala. So the return of the Cuajone at full speed and higher ore grades and mineral production at Toquepala are the drivers of the growth of 20% in Peruvian production. \n Production at our Mexican operations increased 3% in a quarter-on-quarter terms. For 2023, we expect to produce 932,000 tons of copper, an increase of 4% over the 2022 final print. This growth will unfold as we get Peruvian production back on track and will be complemented with new production at our Mexican operations through our Pilares and Buenavista Zinc concentrator projects. \n Molybdenum represented 11% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $20.80 per pound in the quarter compared to $18.30 in the second quarter of last year. This represents an increase of 14%. \n Molybdenum production increased by 0.2% in the second quarter compared to the same period of 2022. This was mainly driven by an increase in production at the Cuajone, Caridad and Buenavista mines due to higher ore grades at our Mexico operations and the Cuajone's return to full operating capacity. These results were partially offset by lower production at Toquepala mine. In 2023, we expect to produce 24,200 tons of molybdenum, which represents a decrease of 8% over our 2022 production level. \n Silver represented 4% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2023 with an average price of $24.26 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected an increase of 7%. Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production increased 8% in the second quarter versus the same period of 2022 after production rose at all our operations. \n Refined silver production fell by 31% quarter-on-quarter, and this was mainly driven by a drop in production at our IMMSA and La Caridad units. In 2023, we expect to produce 20 million -- 20.1 million ounces of silver, an increase of 8% compared to 2022 and 6% higher than the 19 million ounces produced in 2021. \n Zinc represented 3% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2023 with an average price of $1.15 per pound in the quarter, which represents a 35% decrease with regard to the second quarter of 2022 figure. Zinc is currently our third by-product. Zinc mine production increased 14% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 17,223 tons. This was driven primarily by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas mines. \n Refined zinc production increased by 10% in the second quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the second quarter of last year. For 2023, we expect to produce 108,000 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 80% over our 2022 production level. This growth will be driven by the production and start-up of the Buenavista Zinc concentrator and by the recovery at the IMMSA mines where better ore grade areas has been identified. For 2024 and on, we expect to produce over 200,000 tons of zinc per year. \n Financial results. For the second quarter of 2023, sales were $2.3 billion. This is almost the same that we sold in the second quarter of 2022. Copper sales volume increased by 12%, while value decreased 1% in a scenario of prices lower by 11%. \n Regarding our main by-products, we reported higher sales of molybdenum that grew 28% due to better prices. Zinc sales, in turn, were down 22% due mainly to -- due to lower prices because we had a volume increase of 13% in silver -- excuse me, on zinc sales. Silver sales were down due to a decrease in volume, which was partially offset by better prices. \n Our total operating cost and expenses decreased by $98 million or 7% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The main cost reductions were reported for workers' participation, purchased copper and other factors. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher costs for repair materials, operating materials, inventory consumption, labor cost and operation contractors and services. It should be noted that year-to-date, we registered unit cost reductions for grinding media, explosives and power costs. \n Our second quarter of 2023 EBITDA was $1,115 million, which represents an increase of 9% with regard to the $1,021 million registered in the second quarter of last year. The EBITDA margin in the second quarter stood at 48% versus 44% in the second quarter of 2022. EBITDA in the 6 months of this year was $2,683 million. This is 1% lower than the same -- and EBITDA for the 6 months of 2022. The EBITDA margin in the 6 months of this year stood at 53%, which was the same as the 2022 mark. \n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $2.19 per pound in the second quarter of this year. That is $0.10 higher than the value for the first quarter of this year, which was $2.09. Even though copper production volumes increased 2% between the second quarter and the first quarter, a 5% increase in operating cash cost is attributable to higher cost per pound from production cost, treatment and refining charges and to lower premium. \n Regarding our by-products, we had a total credit of $517 million or $1.07 per pound in the second quarter of 2023. These figures represent a 20% decrease when compared to the credit of $631 million or $1.33 per pound that we had in the first quarter of 2023. \n By-product volumes increased for zinc, 14%; for silver, 9%; but decreased for molybdenum by 2%. Prices have decreased for molybdenum, 35%; for zinc, 19%; and increased for silver by 8%. As a consequence, total credits have decreased for all of our by-products. \n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $1.12 per pound in the second quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.36 higher than the cash cost of $0.76 registered in the first quarter of 2023. And as you have noticed, mainly we had a $0.05 increase in cash cost -- a 5% increase in operating cash cost, but a significant reduction in by-product credit, and that basically explains the main change that we have in the cash cost. \n 2023 net income was [ $547 million ], which represents a 27% increase with regard to the $432 million registered in the second quarter of 2022. The net income margin of the second quarter stood at 24% versus 19% in the second quarter of 2022. This increase was mainly the result of a 7% reduction in operating costs, which was mainly attributable to a decrease in lower third-party copper concentrate purchases. On a year-on-year basis, net income was 12% higher than in 2022 for similar reasons. \n SCC's second quarter of 2023 net income fell below the $813 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. This dynamic reflects significant differences in copper prices in the period-over-period comparison. In the second quarter of 2023, copper sales dropped $365 million due to lower price. That alone represented an adjustment of $213 million. \n Volume decreased 4%, volume of sales -- or sales volume, I should say, decreased by 4%, and that's another $92 million. And we had an adjustment -- an accounting adjustment on open sales for 104,000 tons of copper that represents about $59 million. \n For the second half of this year, we have a very positive view on the company's sales volumes. And we are expecting that looking at our current operation plans, the ramping up of the new zinc concentrator in Buenavista and the Pilares project, we're expecting to produce 481,300 tons of copper, 11,400 tons of molybdenum, 76,000 tons of zinc and 10.9 million ounces of silver. An uptick in production for copper, zinc and silver in the second half of this year should support our sales through this period. \n Cash from operations. Cash flow from operating activities in the 6 months of this year was $1,982 million, which represents an increase of 75% over the $1,131 million posted in the 6 months of last year. Cash flow in the first half was affect -- of last year was affected by a significant reduction in working capital, which was attributable to the Cuajone mine stoppage. \n Our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments in the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of the El Arco project. \n Since there is a short description of our main capital projects in SCC's press release, I'm going to update new developments for each of them. For the Mexican projects, in the case of the Buenavista Zinc concentrator in Sonora, this is a project that is located within the Buenavista deposit where, as you know, we have built a new concentrator. This facility has a production capacity of 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. The capital budget of the project is $416 million, most of which has already been invested. Progress is 98%, and we have initiated vacuum testing at the plant and expect to initiate operations in August of this year. \n For the project Pilares, also in Sonora, the budget for Pilares is $176 million, of which $131 million has been invested. Pilares is currently operating and delivering copper mineral to the facilities of the La Caridad operation. \n In the case of El Pilar, the results from experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study has been completed, and the company continues to develop the project and engage in on-site environmental activities. Project engineering is being developed by top-tier engineering and technology firms. We expect production to begin in 2025, and mine life is estimated at 13 years. \n El Arco, which is a project in Baja California, the company has completed the environmental baseline study for the mine, concentrator and industrial facilities, and will proceed to submit the Environmental Impact Statement or Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental, MIA, to the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, SEMARNAT, to request the respective environmental impact permits. The company is currently preparing studies for the port, power pipelines, town sites and auxiliary facilities. \n For the Peruvian projects, for Tia Maria, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of the Islay province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay. \n The Los Chancas project in the Apurimac region in Peru, as of June 30 of this year, part of the project's land continued to be occupied by illegal miners, about 75 of them -- of those persons have irregularly registered their stakes in the Integral Registry of Mining Formalization or known as REINFO. The company requested and the authority subsequently ordered that the aforementioned miners be excluded from REINFO and be qualified as illegal miners. The company has also filed criminal complaints and other legal remedies to physically expel the illegal miners from the project and confiscated illegal mined ore. \n The third project that we have in Peru is the Michiquillay project in the Cajamarca region. In 2023, in accordance with our social agreements with the Michiquillay and La Enca\u00f1ada communities, the company has hired unskilled labor and is paying for the use of surface land. We're also supporting social programs in both communities. In addition, we continue exploration activities on this project. And currently, we have installed 10 drilling platforms. \n For environmental, social and governance, or ESG investments, Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and informing the investment community and other stakeholders about our progress in these matters. For risk prevention and management of risk, by the second quarter of the year, all of Southern Copper's operating units had hit a milestone set in 2018 to obtain the ISO 14001 certification for environmental management and the ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety management. \n Our efforts to prevent environmental and security risks are supported by our ISO systems and reflect our alignment with best international practices. The aforementioned represents a significant step in our quest to obtain accreditation for responsible copper production in the framework of The Copper Mark certification. \n We continue to make progress in the development of our Critical Risk Registry. This tool strengthens environmental and safety risk management by increasing the visibility of these components at all levels of the organization. The registry creates a knowledge base for informed decision-making and ensures rigorous follow-up on controls for prevention and mitigation to avoid or respond to unwanted events. \n This quarter, in line with our corporate environmental policy, we formalized our protocols for sustainable water management, biodiversity and closure of operations to establish our priorities and the means by which our operations address increasingly demanding environmental challenges. \n In the ambit of biodiversity, in the second quarter of this year, we reforested 464 hectares in the state of Sonora in Mexico. This represents 10x the area affected in the period. With these effort, we have successfully met an objective set 2 years ago to reduce our historic environmental footprint by reversing the net loss of biodiversity and achieving a net positive impact for the area. In the first half of this year, the reforested area totaled 934 hectares, which is 5.6x the affected area year-to-date. \n The implementation and promotion of best practices such as the aforementioned has helped Southern Copper secure and maintain a place on the S&P Peru General ESG Sustainability Index of the Lima Stock Exchange. On April 28, 2023, Grupo Mexico issued its 2022 Sustainability Development Annual Report, which includes detailed information about Southern Copper's efforts on the social, environmental and corporate governance fronts. \n Positive impact on the communities in which we operate. We have served more than 900 women from communities close to our operations in Southern Peru via our Community Wellbeing Program, which we conducted a mobile health campaign to prevent breast and uterine cancer. \n SCC has been recognized by the Peruvian state agency Pro Inversi\u00f3n for its execution of a drinking water and rural sanitation program in Poblado Yacango, district of Torata. This project, which has benefited 137 families, entailed an investment of $2.8 million. Similarly, in Mexico, we invested 5.6 -- $5.7 million this quarter to improve water distribution in Nacozari and Cananea, benefiting 53,800 residents. \n The Youth Orchestras promoted by Southern Copper were recognized at the Mexican Polymetallic Seminar in 2023. These orchestras support 1,646 students in Mexico and Peru. Additionally, in collaboration with the Instituto de Cultura del Estado, we held our first exhibition of the Traveling Workshop for Documentary Film at the Cineteca in the state of Sonora in Mexico. During this event, 17 original short films were screened. They were produced by some of the 747 students for communities that participated in the workshop. \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company's policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on July 20, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock payable on August 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 9 of this year. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like to now open up the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. \nMatthew Murphy: Raul, thanks for your comments on the projects in the pipeline. I'm interested in Peru, your take on the situation. I guess we've seen the economy in contraction, but we've also seen a bit less disruption to the mining sector. So I guess the first part of the question is, are you seeing improvement in the mining sector's ability to operate in Peru? And the second part of that is just the implications for Tia Maria. You're still, I guess, waiting for the conditions locally and at the federal level to improve. And do you see scope for that to happen this year? And if nothing changes, could this project still be going forward in 2024? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Let me -- thank you for your question, Matt. Well, first, let me say, as a general concept that social circumstance have improved in Peru. Politically speaking, we have -- we are seeing also a significant improvement. The police is doing their activities and on working with the companies to solve the problems that we have that require their intervention. In other cases, we're -- such as the case in Tia Maria, we are working with the local population. We believe that we have been making progress on this matter. And basically, we're relatively much more optimistic than what we were a year ago. \n As I mentioned, the copper production year-to-date has increased 19% in Peru. I should add that in May, the increase has been over 30%. And that is basically comparing a normal operation plus Quellaveco with last year where we had in May, we had Las Bambas' stoppage and the production at Cuajone coming back, but not as strong as we were anticipating at that time. So in general terms, circumstances have improved, and we're seeing Tia Maria moving forward slowly but doing so. \nOperator: One moment for our next question, please, [Operator Instructions], and it comes from the line of Jens Spiess with Morgan Stanley. \nJens Spiess: I just wanted to ask on cash cost guidance for 2023, what do you expect before by-products for the year? \nRaul Jacob: For the second quarter, we're expecting a better cash cost than what we have had in the first part of the year, and the reason for that is two-fold. We're seeing some cost reductions. I mentioned grinding media, explosives and some other materials. But on top of that, we have more production of copper for the second half of the year. That should improve our cost per pound before by-product credits. And also, we should have more credits coming from the volumes, the much better volumes that we're expecting for the second half of the year that I mentioned while doing the company presentation. \nJens Spiess: Okay. And just to clarify, for silver, you expect 20.1 million ounces for 2023, is that what you said? \nRaul Jacob: Yes, let me repeat the volumes that I mentioned. For the second half, we're expecting to produce 481,300 tons of copper, 1,400 (sic) [ 11,400 ] tons of molybdenum, 76,000 tons of zinc and 10.9 million ounces of silver. That's for the second quarter. And I believe that your question was specifically for silver production for the year, right? \nJens Spiess: Yes. \nRaul Jacob: For the year, for silver, we're expecting 20 million -- 20.1 million ounces of silver. \nJens Spiess: Okay. Perfect. And last one, are you factoring in any commercial production from Buenavista Zinc for this year or will be coming online until next year, mainly? \nRaul Jacob: No, no, we're expecting to increase our zinc production coming from the new concentrator in Buenavista for about 43,000 tons of zinc. \nJens Spiess: 43,000? Okay. Perfect. \nRaul Jacob: 43,000, yes, which, by the way, will come in with a very competitive cash cost, given the fact that the copper production of Buenavista will be absorbing the fixed cost. This production will basically enter our cost system at a very, very competitive value. \nOperator: One moment for our next question, please, and it comes from the line of Arthur Biscuola with Santander. \nArthur Biscuola: Just a follow-up on transaction. So your guidance is to reach a total corporate position of roughly 480,000 tons in the second half. But in your view, what would be the main risks for the company to not reach this guidance? And what is -- I mean, what is [ worth the innovations ] here? Also, what to expect in terms of third-party volumes into year-end? \nRaul Jacob: I'm so sorry, Arthur, I couldn't get the second part of your question. Could you repeat, please? \nArthur Biscuola: Yes, sure. So I just want to know what to expect in terms of third-party volumes into year-end? \nRaul Jacob: For the second half? We don't get copper... \nArthur Biscuola: Yes, for the second half. \nRaul Jacob: Yes, copper purchases from third parties will be basically 0. We are -- we will be -- we are long in copper concentrates now, and we want to process 100% of our copper in our own smelters. \nOperator: Arthur, does that answer your question? \nArthur Biscuola: Yes. \nOperator: And Mr. Jacob, I don't see any further questions. I will pass it back to you for any final comments. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you very much... \nOperator: There's one more that just showed up, if you want to pick it up? \nRaul Jacob: Please, please. \nOperator: One moment please, and it does come from the line of Matheus Moreira with Bradesco BBI. \nMatheus Moreira: So you mentioned copper production for this year at about 999,000 tons. Do we also have a guidance on copper production for next year and onwards? \nRaul Jacob: Sure. Thank you very much for your question, Matheus. For this year, I'm going to repeat the goal for the year, for the full 2023 for all the metals, the relevant ones that we produce. For copper, for 2023, we're expecting to produce 932,000 tons; for molybdenum, 24,200 tons; for zinc, 108,000 tons; silver, 20.1 million ounces. \n With that, our expectation is that we should have a cash cost slightly lower than what we're seeing. Well, obviously, this is a continuing of by-product prices. Volumes, we know that we will be better in zinc and silver than what we were last year, I'm talking about the by-products. For copper, obviously, there is a 4% expected growth in production vis-\u00e0-vis 2022. \n For next year, we will have the positive full benefit of the zinc concentrator that has -- we expect to produce about 120,000 tons of zinc coming from the Buenavista Zinc concentrator, that's for next year. In total, for zinc next year, it's going to be 108,000 tons -- I'm sorry, 207 -- 208,000 tons. Let me please -- let me correct that, what I just said is 2,000 -- 8,000 tons for -- 208,000 tons for zinc. \n For silver, next year, it's going to be 27 million ounces; for molybdenum, 26,300 tons; and for copper, 1,026,000 tons. But let me repeat the forecast for 2024 at this point. For copper, 1,000 and 26,000 tons -- 1,026,000 tons; for molybdenum, 26,300 tons; for zinc, 208,000 tons; for silver, 27.1 million ounces, and that's basically it. \nOperator: And I am not showing any further questions, sir. \nRaul Jacob: Okay. So with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's second quarter of 2023 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the third quarter of this year results. \n Thank you very much, and have a nice day. \nOperator: Thank you. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you all for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's Second Quarter of 2023 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board Member; as well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, also a fellow Board Member. \n In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. \n Now let us focus on the copper market. In the second quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased 11% from an average of $4.32 per pound in the second quarter of 2022, down to $3.85 per pound at the close in average for the second quarter. This reflects concerns about the impact of a slowdown of the Chinese economy, a possible recession in Europe and a soft landing or minor recession in the U.S. Current prices for copper at around $3.90 per pound, reflecting a less optimistic market than that seen in the last few quarters. \n At this point, we see the following factors affecting the copper market: a reduction in global inflation, which may portend the end of the interest rate hike cycle led by the Fed and the ECB; a strong recovery of mining production of Peru, who have a 19% growth for the period January-May of this year. This is reducing the uncertainty on current production. \n Chile is still lagging with a 5% reduction in copper production for the same period. Investments for future growth are still affected by expectations of economic changes in Chile and social unrest in Peru. These 2 countries, as you know, represent about 40% of the global supply. The most relevant market intelligent houses for the copper market are now expecting a market in surplus of about 100,000 tons for this year. This assumes a growth in demand of about 1% this year and also about the same level for the supply. \n Low copper inventories is another factor that is affecting the copper market. At the closing of March 31 -- or as of March 31, this -- the sum of the London Metal Exchange, the COMEX Exchange, the Shanghai warehouse and the bundled warehouses in China add up to 411,000 tons of copper in inventories. That number has dropped to about 235,000 tons. This 42% reduction in inventories represents the largest dip since 2005. It is important to emphasize that copper plays a leading role in the global shift to clean energy, which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper will be strong in the long term. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 78% of our sales in the second quarter of 2023. Copper production registered an increase of 9% in the second quarter in a quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 227,533 tons. Our quarterly result reflects a 20% increase in production in Peru, driven by higher recoveries, the return to full capacity -- full operating capacity of the Cuajone mine and higher ore grades at Toquepala. So the return of the Cuajone at full speed and higher ore grades and mineral production at Toquepala are the drivers of the growth of 20% in Peruvian production. \n Production at our Mexican operations increased 3% in a quarter-on-quarter terms. For 2023, we expect to produce 932,000 tons of copper, an increase of 4% over the 2022 final print. This growth will unfold as we get Peruvian production back on track and will be complemented with new production at our Mexican operations through our Pilares and Buenavista Zinc concentrator projects. \n Molybdenum represented 11% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $20.80 per pound in the quarter compared to $18.30 in the second quarter of last year. This represents an increase of 14%. \n Molybdenum production increased by 0.2% in the second quarter compared to the same period of 2022. This was mainly driven by an increase in production at the Cuajone, Caridad and Buenavista mines due to higher ore grades at our Mexico operations and the Cuajone's return to full operating capacity. These results were partially offset by lower production at Toquepala mine. In 2023, we expect to produce 24,200 tons of molybdenum, which represents a decrease of 8% over our 2022 production level. \n Silver represented 4% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2023 with an average price of $24.26 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected an increase of 7%. Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production increased 8% in the second quarter versus the same period of 2022 after production rose at all our operations. \n Refined silver production fell by 31% quarter-on-quarter, and this was mainly driven by a drop in production at our IMMSA and La Caridad units. In 2023, we expect to produce 20 million -- 20.1 million ounces of silver, an increase of 8% compared to 2022 and 6% higher than the 19 million ounces produced in 2021. \n Zinc represented 3% of our sales value in the second quarter of 2023 with an average price of $1.15 per pound in the quarter, which represents a 35% decrease with regard to the second quarter of 2022 figure. Zinc is currently our third by-product. Zinc mine production increased 14% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 17,223 tons. This was driven primarily by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara and Charcas mines. \n Refined zinc production increased by 10% in the second quarter vis-a\u0300-vis the second quarter of last year. For 2023, we expect to produce 108,000 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 80% over our 2022 production level. This growth will be driven by the production and start-up of the Buenavista Zinc concentrator and by the recovery at the IMMSA mines where better ore grade areas has been identified. For 2024 and on, we expect to produce over 200,000 tons of zinc per year. \n Financial results. For the second quarter of 2023, sales were $2.3 billion. This is almost the same that we sold in the second quarter of 2022. Copper sales volume increased by 12%, while value decreased 1% in a scenario of prices lower by 11%. \n Regarding our main by-products, we reported higher sales of molybdenum that grew 28% due to better prices. Zinc sales, in turn, were down 22% due mainly to -- due to lower prices because we had a volume increase of 13% in silver -- excuse me, on zinc sales. Silver sales were down due to a decrease in volume, which was partially offset by better prices. \n Our total operating cost and expenses decreased by $98 million or 7% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The main cost reductions were reported for workers' participation, purchased copper and other factors. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher costs for repair materials, operating materials, inventory consumption, labor cost and operation contractors and services. It should be noted that year-to-date, we registered unit cost reductions for grinding media, explosives and power costs. \n Our second quarter of 2023 EBITDA was $1,115 million, which represents an increase of 9% with regard to the $1,021 million registered in the second quarter of last year. The EBITDA margin in the second quarter stood at 48% versus 44% in the second quarter of 2022. EBITDA in the 6 months of this year was $2,683 million. This is 1% lower than the same -- and EBITDA for the 6 months of 2022. The EBITDA margin in the 6 months of this year stood at 53%, which was the same as the 2022 mark. \n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $2.19 per pound in the second quarter of this year. That is $0.10 higher than the value for the first quarter of this year, which was $2.09. Even though copper production volumes increased 2% between the second quarter and the first quarter, a 5% increase in operating cash cost is attributable to higher cost per pound from production cost, treatment and refining charges and to lower premium. \n Regarding our by-products, we had a total credit of $517 million or $1.07 per pound in the second quarter of 2023. These figures represent a 20% decrease when compared to the credit of $631 million or $1.33 per pound that we had in the first quarter of 2023. \n By-product volumes increased for zinc, 14%; for silver, 9%; but decreased for molybdenum by 2%. Prices have decreased for molybdenum, 35%; for zinc, 19%; and increased for silver by 8%. As a consequence, total credits have decreased for all of our by-products. \n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $1.12 per pound in the second quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.36 higher than the cash cost of $0.76 registered in the first quarter of 2023. And as you have noticed, mainly we had a $0.05 increase in cash cost -- a 5% increase in operating cash cost, but a significant reduction in by-product credit, and that basically explains the main change that we have in the cash cost. \n 2023 net income was [ $547 million ], which represents a 27% increase with regard to the $432 million registered in the second quarter of 2022. The net income margin of the second quarter stood at 24% versus 19% in the second quarter of 2022. This increase was mainly the result of a 7% reduction in operating costs, which was mainly attributable to a decrease in lower third-party copper concentrate purchases. On a year-on-year basis, net income was 12% higher than in 2022 for similar reasons. \n SCC's second quarter of 2023 net income fell below the $813 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. This dynamic reflects significant differences in copper prices in the period-over-period comparison. In the second quarter of 2023, copper sales dropped $365 million due to lower price. That alone represented an adjustment of $213 million. \n Volume decreased 4%, volume of sales -- or sales volume, I should say, decreased by 4%, and that's another $92 million. And we had an adjustment -- an accounting adjustment on open sales for 104,000 tons of copper that represents about $59 million. \n For the second half of this year, we have a very positive view on the company's sales volumes. And we are expecting that looking at our current operation plans, the ramping up of the new zinc concentrator in Buenavista and the Pilares project, we're expecting to produce 481,300 tons of copper, 11,400 tons of molybdenum, 76,000 tons of zinc and 10.9 million ounces of silver. An uptick in production for copper, zinc and silver in the second half of this year should support our sales through this period. \n Cash from operations. Cash flow from operating activities in the 6 months of this year was $1,982 million, which represents an increase of 75% over the $1,131 million posted in the 6 months of last year. Cash flow in the first half was affect -- of last year was affected by a significant reduction in working capital, which was attributable to the Cuajone mine stoppage. \n Our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments in the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of the El Arco project. \n Since there is a short description of our main capital projects in SCC's press release, I'm going to update new developments for each of them. For the Mexican projects, in the case of the Buenavista Zinc concentrator in Sonora, this is a project that is located within the Buenavista deposit where, as you know, we have built a new concentrator. This facility has a production capacity of 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year. The capital budget of the project is $416 million, most of which has already been invested. Progress is 98%, and we have initiated vacuum testing at the plant and expect to initiate operations in August of this year. \n For the project Pilares, also in Sonora, the budget for Pilares is $176 million, of which $131 million has been invested. Pilares is currently operating and delivering copper mineral to the facilities of the La Caridad operation. \n In the case of El Pilar, the results from experimental pads in the leaching process have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study has been completed, and the company continues to develop the project and engage in on-site environmental activities. Project engineering is being developed by top-tier engineering and technology firms. We expect production to begin in 2025, and mine life is estimated at 13 years. \n El Arco, which is a project in Baja California, the company has completed the environmental baseline study for the mine, concentrator and industrial facilities, and will proceed to submit the Environmental Impact Statement or Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental, MIA, to the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, SEMARNAT, to request the respective environmental impact permits. The company is currently preparing studies for the port, power pipelines, town sites and auxiliary facilities. \n For the Peruvian projects, for Tia Maria, Southern Copper has been consistently working to promote the welfare of the population of the Islay province. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, health care and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. We have also promoted agricultural and livestock activities in the Tambo Valley and supported growth in manufacturing, fishing and tourism in Islay. \n The Los Chancas project in the Apurimac region in Peru, as of June 30 of this year, part of the project's land continued to be occupied by illegal miners, about 75 of them -- of those persons have irregularly registered their stakes in the Integral Registry of Mining Formalization or known as REINFO. The company requested and the authority subsequently ordered that the aforementioned miners be excluded from REINFO and be qualified as illegal miners. The company has also filed criminal complaints and other legal remedies to physically expel the illegal miners from the project and confiscated illegal mined ore. \n The third project that we have in Peru is the Michiquillay project in the Cajamarca region. In 2023, in accordance with our social agreements with the Michiquillay and La Encan\u0303ada communities, the company has hired unskilled labor and is paying for the use of surface land. We're also supporting social programs in both communities. In addition, we continue exploration activities on this project. And currently, we have installed 10 drilling platforms. \n For environmental, social and governance, or ESG investments, Southern Copper is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and informing the investment community and other stakeholders about our progress in these matters. For risk prevention and management of risk, by the second quarter of the year, all of Southern Copper's operating units had hit a milestone set in 2018 to obtain the ISO 14001 certification for environmental management and the ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety management. \n Our efforts to prevent environmental and security risks are supported by our ISO systems and reflect our alignment with best international practices. The aforementioned represents a significant step in our quest to obtain accreditation for responsible copper production in the framework of The Copper Mark certification. \n We continue to make progress in the development of our Critical Risk Registry. This tool strengthens environmental and safety risk management by increasing the visibility of these components at all levels of the organization. The registry creates a knowledge base for informed decision-making and ensures rigorous follow-up on controls for prevention and mitigation to avoid or respond to unwanted events. \n This quarter, in line with our corporate environmental policy, we formalized our protocols for sustainable water management, biodiversity and closure of operations to establish our priorities and the means by which our operations address increasingly demanding environmental challenges. \n In the ambit of biodiversity, in the second quarter of this year, we reforested 464 hectares in the state of Sonora in Mexico. This represents 10x the area affected in the period. With these effort, we have successfully met an objective set 2 years ago to reduce our historic environmental footprint by reversing the net loss of biodiversity and achieving a net positive impact for the area. In the first half of this year, the reforested area totaled 934 hectares, which is 5.6x the affected area year-to-date. \n The implementation and promotion of best practices such as the aforementioned has helped Southern Copper secure and maintain a place on the S&P Peru General ESG Sustainability Index of the Lima Stock Exchange. On April 28, 2023, Grupo Mexico issued its 2022 Sustainability Development Annual Report, which includes detailed information about Southern Copper's efforts on the social, environmental and corporate governance fronts. \n Positive impact on the communities in which we operate. We have served more than 900 women from communities close to our operations in Southern Peru via our Community Wellbeing Program, which we conducted a mobile health campaign to prevent breast and uterine cancer. \n SCC has been recognized by the Peruvian state agency Pro Inversio\u0301n for its execution of a drinking water and rural sanitation program in Poblado Yacango, district of Torata. This project, which has benefited 137 families, entailed an investment of $2.8 million. Similarly, in Mexico, we invested 5.6 -- $5.7 million this quarter to improve water distribution in Nacozari and Cananea, benefiting 53,800 residents. \n The Youth Orchestras promoted by Southern Copper were recognized at the Mexican Polymetallic Seminar in 2023. These orchestras support 1,646 students in Mexico and Peru. Additionally, in collaboration with the Instituto de Cultura del Estado, we held our first exhibition of the Traveling Workshop for Documentary Film at the Cineteca in the state of Sonora in Mexico. During this event, 17 original short films were screened. They were produced by some of the 747 students for communities that participated in the workshop. \n Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company's policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on July 20, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock payable on August 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 9 of this year. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like to now open up the forum for questions. Okay. Let me -- thank you for your question, Matt. Well, first, let me say, as a general concept that social circumstance have improved in Peru. Politically speaking, we have -- we are seeing also a significant improvement. The police is doing their activities and on working with the companies to solve the problems that we have that require their intervention. In other cases, we're -- such as the case in Tia Maria, we are working with the local population. We believe that we have been making progress on this matter. And basically, we're relatively much more optimistic than what we were a year ago. \n As I mentioned, the copper production year-to-date has increased 19% in Peru. I should add that in May, the increase has been over 30%. And that is basically comparing a normal operation plus Quellaveco with last year where we had in May, we had Las Bambas' stoppage and the production at Cuajone coming back, but not as strong as we were anticipating at that time. So in general terms, circumstances have improved, and we're seeing Tia Maria moving forward slowly but doing so. For the second quarter, we're expecting a better cash cost than what we have had in the first part of the year, and the reason for that is two-fold. We're seeing some cost reductions. I mentioned grinding media, explosives and some other materials. But on top of that, we have more production of copper for the second half of the year. That should improve our cost per pound before by-product credits. And also, we should have more credits coming from the volumes, the much better volumes that we're expecting for the second half of the year that I mentioned while doing the company presentation. Yes, let me repeat the volumes that I mentioned. For the second half, we're expecting to produce 481,300 tons of copper, 1,400 (sic) [ 11,400 ] tons of molybdenum, 76,000 tons of zinc and 10.9 million ounces of silver. That's for the second quarter. And I believe that your question was specifically for silver production for the year, right? For the year, for silver, we're expecting 20 million -- 20.1 million ounces of silver. No, no, we're expecting to increase our zinc production coming from the new concentrator in Buenavista for about 43,000 tons of zinc. 43,000, yes, which, by the way, will come in with a very competitive cash cost, given the fact that the copper production of Buenavista will be absorbing the fixed cost. This production will basically enter our cost system at a very, very competitive value. I'm so sorry, Arthur, I couldn't get the second part of your question. Could you repeat, please? For the second half? We don't get copper... Yes, copper purchases from third parties will be basically 0. We are -- we will be -- we are long in copper concentrates now, and we want to process 100% of our copper in our own smelters. Okay. Thank you very much... Please, please. Sure. Thank you very much for your question, Matheus. For this year, I'm going to repeat the goal for the year, for the full 2023 for all the metals, the relevant ones that we produce. For copper, for 2023, we're expecting to produce 932,000 tons; for molybdenum, 24,200 tons; for zinc, 108,000 tons; silver, 20.1 million ounces. \n With that, our expectation is that we should have a cash cost slightly lower than what we're seeing. Well, obviously, this is a continuing of by-product prices. Volumes, we know that we will be better in zinc and silver than what we were last year, I'm talking about the by-products. For copper, obviously, there is a 4% expected growth in production vis-a\u0300-vis 2022. \n For next year, we will have the positive full benefit of the zinc concentrator that has -- we expect to produce about 120,000 tons of zinc coming from the Buenavista Zinc concentrator, that's for next year. In total, for zinc next year, it's going to be 108,000 tons -- I'm sorry, 207 -- 208,000 tons. Let me please -- let me correct that, what I just said is 2,000 -- 8,000 tons for -- 208,000 tons for zinc. \n For silver, next year, it's going to be 27 million ounces; for molybdenum, 26,300 tons; and for copper, 1,026,000 tons. But let me repeat the forecast for 2024 at this point. For copper, 1,000 and 26,000 tons -- 1,026,000 tons; for molybdenum, 26,300 tons; for zinc, 208,000 tons; for silver, 27.1 million ounces, and that's basically it. Okay. So with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's second quarter of 2023 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the third quarter of this year results. \n Thank you very much, and have a nice day."

With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation's, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President, Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the first quarter 2023, as well as answer any questions that you may have. \n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP. \n Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's First Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and environmental, social and government. After this, we will open the session for questions. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board Member; as well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, Board Member -- also a Board Members. \n Let's focus now on the copper market. In the first quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased by 11% from the average of $4.53 per pound that we had in the first quarter of 2022. The average price has been $4.05 this past quarter. The price reduction, which is slightly lower as we speak now, reflects concerns about a possible recession in the U.S. and Europe, and this has been partially offset by the good news on China's economy. \n Our current copper prices are, as I say, at around $3.90 per pound. And we believe the prices are being affected by the following factors. One is the reduction in global inflation, which may slow down or even stop interest rates -- the interest rate hike cycle led by the Fed and the ECB. The bouncing back of the Chinese economy after its openness -- after the COVID -- strong COVID measures that they had, China's GDP has been growing at 4.5% and which is slightly higher than the expected 4% that was mentioned by the major companies that follow the Chinese economy. \n We do have some uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru. These 2 countries together represent about 40% of the global supply, and Chile recently reported a copper production decline in the fourth -- in the first quarter this year of about 4%. Considering how demand and supply are evolving, the most relevant market intelligence houses for the copper market are currently expecting a market imbalance or small deficit of about 100,000 tons for this year. \n This assumes a growth in demand between 2% and 2.5%, and lower-than-expected supply growth estimated now between 1.5% and 2%. And this is basically due to the first quarter stoppages that we had in South America. Inventories are still very low at about 411,000 tons as of March 31. These are one of the lowest marks since 2001. \n It is important to emphasize that copper plays a leading role in the global shift to clean energy, which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper will be strong in the long term. In this scenario, we believe the current cycle of low prices will be short-lived. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 77% of our sales in the first quarter of 2023. SCC's copper production registered an increase of 4% in the first quarter in quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 223,272 tons. \n Our quarterly results reflects a 16% increase in production in Peru, mainly from the Cuajone operation that grew 48.5%, and this was basically the result of much more mineral production in Cuajone. As you may recall, this operation had -- was affected by an illegal stoppage in the first and second quarters of 2022. So coming back to operation and operating at full capacity now, Cuajone have much more mineral production and better ore grades and recoveries. That certainly helped this quarter's production. \n In the case of the Mexican operations, we had a drop in production of 2.4%, mainly coming from La Caridad, whose production decreased by 11% due to a temporary lower ore grade. For 2023, we expect to produce 940,000 tons of copper, an increase of 5% over the 2022 final trend. This growth will unfold as we have the Peruvian production at full speed, with -- coupled with new production in our Mexican operations through our Pilares and Buenavista Zinc concentrator project. \n For molybdenum, it represented 11% of the company's sales value in the first quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $32 per pound in the quarter compared to the $19 that they averaged in the first quarter of 2022. This represents an increase in price of 69%. \n Molybdenum production decreased by 9% in the first quarter of this year, and this was mainly driven by a drop in production at the Toquepala mine due to lower ore grades. These results were partially offset by higher production at Cuajone, which increased its molybdenum production by 67%; and La Caridad, which increased its molybdenum production by 5%. These mines had a higher ore grade. In the case of Cuajone, obviously, more volume as well. And more -- better recoveries for Cuajone.\n As you know, molybdenum is primarily used to produce special alloys for stainless steel that require significant levels of hardness and resistance to corrosion and heat. New uses for these metals are associated with lubricants, sulfur filtering of heavy oil and shale gas production. Silver represented 4% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2023, with an average price of $20.53 per ounce in the quarter. This reflected a decrease of 6% in silver price. Silver is currently our second by-product. \n Mined silver production increased by 3% in the first quarter of this year, after production rose at Cuajone and Toquepala. This was partially offset by a decreased introduction of the Mexican operations. Refined silver production fell by 12% quarter-over-quarter mainly driven by a drop in production at our IMMSA refinery due to a temporary slowdown in purchases of third-party subs. \n For zinc, it represented 3% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2023, with an average price of $1.42 per pound in the quarter. This represents a decrease with regard to the first quarter of 2022 figure. Zinc mined production increased by 2% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 15,075 tons. This was driven primarily by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara and San Martin mines. Refined zinc production increased by 11% in the first quarter of this year. \n For 2023, we expect to produce 116,000 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 94% over the 2022 production level. This growth will be driven by the production start-up of the Buenavista Zinc operation that should contribute this year with 52,000 tons of more zinc production, and by the recovery of the IMMSA mines production, where better ore grade areas has been identified. For next year and on, we expect to produce over 200,000 tons of zinc per year. \n Financial results. For the first quarter of 2023, sales were $2.8 billion. This is $30 million higher than sales for the first quarter of 2022. Expansion was primarily fueled by an increase in the sales volume of copper that grew by 10%. Silver grew 15% and zinc 6%. This was partially offset by a decrease in the sales volume of molybdenum that decreased by 8% in sales. Metal prices fell for most of our products, with the exemption of molybdenum that increased, as I mentioned, by 69%. \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $146 million or 11% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. Main cost increments has been in inventory consumption, repair materials, explosives, reagents, sales expenses, diesel and fuel, and operations contractors. These cost increases were partially compensated by exchange rate differences, purchased copper -- lower purchased copper and other factors. \n When looking at our cost this past quarter, please keep in mind the following events. The Cuajone mine illegal stoppage affected our first quarter production and cost. The Russian invasion to Ukraine started in February of last year had an inflationary impact on cost that was mainly reflected after the first quarter of last year in the company's results. \n The first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.568 billion, which represented a decrease of 7% with regard to the $1.678 billion registered in the first quarter of 2022. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 56% in the first quarter of this year versus 61% in the first quarter of 2022. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before byproduct credits was $2.09 per pound in the first quarter of this year. That is $0.051 higher then the value for the fourth quarter of 2022. This 2% increase in operating cash cost before credits is a result of higher cost per pound from production partially compensated by lower treatment and refining charges, lower administrative expenses and higher premiums on refined copper sales. \n Regarding byproducts, we had a total credit of $631 million, or $1.33 per pound, in the first quarter of this year. These figures represent a 16.3% decrease when compared with the credit of $806 million or $1.59 per pound that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Total credits have increased for zinc and silver and decreased for molybdenum significantly and for sulfuric acid. \n Let me point out that we have an adjustment, a negative adjustment on open sales of molybdenum this past quarter of $265 million, and that was compared to a positive adjustment open sales at the closing of the fourth quarter of $141 million. So that is main event that obviously affected our byproduct revenues in this past quarter vis-a-vis the fourth quarter of last year. \n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.75 per pound in the first quarter of this year. These cash cost was $0.31 higher than the cash cost of $0.44 that we had in the fourth quarter of 2022. Of this increase, as I mentioned already, $0.05 came from higher cost per pound, mainly due to lower volume; and $0.26 came from lower byproduct credits resulting, as I mentioned, from lower prices of silver and zinc and the very significant open sales adjustment -- negative adjustment that we have on molybdenum sales in this first quarter. \n Our net income in the first quarter of this year was $813 million, which represented a 4% increase when compared to $784 million registered in the first quarter of 2022. The net income margin in the first quarter of this year was 29% versus 28% in the first quarter of 2022. Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter was $1.185 billion which represented an increase of 44% over the $821 million posted in the first quarter of 2022, and an increase of 10% over the $1.082 billion posted in the fourth quarter of last year. \n For capital investments, our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investment in Buenavista zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of El Arco projects. \n For the Mexican projects, let me start with the Buenavista zinc concentrator in Sonora. As I said, this is a project located in the Buenavista deposit. We're building a new concentrator for zinc, and we are expecting this production facility to produce -- or to add 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper capacities per year. When operating, this facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide more than 2,000 operational jobs. \n Currently, the capital budget for the project is $416 million, most of which has already been invested, and we are about to initiate operations this quarter, the second quarter. For Pilaris, also located in Sonora, this is a former or a brownfield mine that we acquired a few years back. It's located 6 kilometers away from La Caridad. And the project consists of an open-pit mine operation with annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. \n The Pilares budget is $176 million, of which $114 million has been invested. The project is currently operating and delivering copper mineral oxides to the SX-EW facilities of La Caridad operation, and we expect to produce mineral for the Caridad concentrator at full capacity through the second quarter of this year. \n El Pilar, also in Sonora, this is a copper greenfield project, which is strategically located 45 kilometers away from the Buenavista mine. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. \n The results from the experimental pads in the leaching process for El Pilar have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study is finished, and the company continues to develop the project and engage in on-site environmental activities. The SX-EW plant detail engineering is being developed on an ongoing basis, and we expect production to begin in 2025 and mine life is estimated at 13 years. \n For El Arco, located in the Baja California Peninsula, this is our class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California Peninsula. The project includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold. As of March 31, the company has completed environmental baseline study for the mine and industrial facilities, and is reviewing basic engineering analysis to request environmental impact permits. \n For the Peruvian projects, we have the Tia Maria project located in the Arequipa region in Peru. And this is a project that will use a state-of-the-art SX-EW technology, with the highest international environmental standards to produce 120,000 tons of refined copper cathodes per year. The estimated capital budget for the project is $1.4 billion. \n In the case of Los Chancas, also in Peru, it's a project located in the Apurimac region in Peru. This greenfield project located, as I said, in Apurimac, it's a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. The Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The estimated capital investment is $2.6 billion, and the project is expected to begin operating in 2030. \n As of March of this year, part of the project's land continue to be occupied by illegal miners, 70 of whom have regularly registered their stakes in the Integral Registers of Mining Formalization, or REINFO, as it is known in Spanish. The company has requested and the authority has ordered the exclusion of these 70 informal miners from the REINFO register, so that they are now all illegal miners. The company has also filed criminal complaints and other legal remedies to physically expel the illegal miners from the project. \n Michiquillay project. In June of 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca in Peru. Michiquillay is a world-class mining project with inferred mineral resources of 2.3 billion tons, with an estimated copper grade of 0.43%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tons of copper per year along with byproducts of molybdenum, gold and silver. It will have an initial mine life of more than 25 years and a competitive cash cost. We estimate that the investment of approximately $2.5 billion that will be required, and expect to initiate production by 2032.\n In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company informed the Ministry of Energy and Mines that it has begun exploration activities and initiated an assessment of the existing mineral resource at depth. In 2023, in accordance with our social agreements with the Michiquillay and La Encanada communities, the company has hired unskilled labor and is paying for the use of surface land. We're supporting social programs in both communities as we roll out exploration activities. \n Environmental, social and governance investment. SCC is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and informing the investment committee and other stakeholders about our progress in this manner. This year, Grupo Mexico will present edition #15 of the Sustainable Development Report, which contains disaggregated information from Southern Copper Corporation and reaffirms our commitment to transparency and ongoing improvement. \n In 2022, we have placed particular importance on updating our strategy for climate change, which includes targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This year's report also provides information on our program and objectives with regard to promoting diversity and inclusion, both inside the company and within the communities close to our operations.\n Sustainable Development Committee. In 2022, Southern Copper Corporation set up a Sustainable Development Committee, which is presided by an independent director. This committee's main objective is to support SCC's Board of Directors in its in endeavors to supervise management of risks and opportunities in the environment -- in the ambits of environmental, safety and health, community development, human rights and corporate governance. \n The committee meets every quarter and has assessed diverse aspects of the company's ESG trajectory, including adhesion to international agreements and management of water and mineral waste. The Sustainable Development Committee, in its third session, addressed climate change as well as diversity and inclusion and identify opportunities on the corporate governance front. \n Third-party certification. In recognition of our commitment to implement best environmental, social and corporate governance practices, our Buenavista del Cobre mine, located in Mexico in Sonora, has obtained certification for 3 important ISO, International Organization for Standardization, standards: ISO 9001 for quality management; ISO 14001 for environmental management; and ISO 45001 for occupational safety and health management. These certificates are a further proof of our commitment to quality, the environment and the occupational safety and health of our employees. \n Occupational safety and health. At Southern Copper Corporation, our employees' safety is our priority. Our unit in Ilo, located in the Moquegua region in Peru, has earned first place in the smelter and refinery category of the 26 National Competition for Mining Safety, organized by the Peruvian Institute of Mining Safety.  This the distinction recognizes SCC's performance with regard to indicators of our employees, occupational safety and health, and is a reflection of our ongoing commitment to ensuring the sustainability of our operations.\n Biodiversity. In March 2023, environmental management unit at Buenavista del Cobre obtained certification from the Wildlife Habitat Council in recognition for our contributions to efforts to prevent the extension of the Mexican gray wolf. Thanks to these actions, populations of these species, which was on the brink of extension in the wild, has multiplied in their natural habitat in Mexico. Going forward, we will continue to work side-by-side with society and authorities to serve the common good in the regions in which we operate. \n Community development. At SCC, we continue to strengthen our community development model and currently operate 29 community centers that provide services to 350,000 people a year in Mexico and Peru. These efforts positively impact the quality of life of the residents in the committees where we work. Recently, we renovated 2 community centers called Casa Grande in Santa Barbara, Chihuahua and Charcas, in San Luis Potosi. These facilities will serve an additional 21,000 people. \n Diversity and inclusion. At SCC, we're convinced that valuing diversity, preventing discrimination and promoting openness to different ways of thinking are fundamental in all efforts to develop inclusive workplace environments that promote the integral development of our employees and stakeholders. We are committed to driving the agenda for diversity and inclusion transversely throughout the company and in the communities around our operations. Our results in 2022 reflect the fruit of our efforts, with a 16% increase in the number of women employed by SCC. \n Dividend announcement. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial means at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on April 20, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock payable on May 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 9, 2023. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end up our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open the phone for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. \nCarlos de Alba: Raul, would you please comment on how you see costs trending in the coming quarters? Clearly, the industry is facing a lot of cost pressures, but Southern Copper has always been a low-cost producer. We've seen recent pressures, obviously, affecting the company, but any guidance would be very interesting to hear. And then my second question is regarding growth with specific wondering -- specifically wondering about Los Chancas. How quickly can you solve the situation there? We heard what you said that you got positive court rulings, but you how quickly can you restart exploration or the work that you were doing at Los Chancas if you had to stop them? \n And combined with this, given the attractive profile of organic growth that you have, but with some of the challenging regarding the timing to execute on those, would the company consider M&A opportunities? You've heard, obviously, there is a couple of recent transactions where copper assets have been in focus. So I wonder to what extent the company will have appetite for a large -- relatively large, medium acquisition in copper, given that so far, you have focused -- the company has focused on smaller opportunities? \nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you for your set of questions, Carlos. Okay. I'm going to touch base on each of them. If I skip one of your concerns, please let me know. Let me start by cost production. We already mentioned that we're expecting an increase in production of about 5% vis-a-vis next year for copper. And we are also expecting to have a much more production from -- for zinc this year, particularly, due to the beginning of the zinc concentrator at Buenavista. In the case of our cost we're expecting a better cash cost for the next quarters. And the reason for that is twofold. \n I mentioned already that we had to include in our financials, a significant open sales reduction in molybdenum. It was $265 million that we have to charge or decrease our sales by that amount. That obviously explain why the company, vis-a-vis the market, has shown this quarter lower-than-expected results regarding particularly EBITDA and some other metrics. \n So we're expecting not to have this type of adjustments in the second quarter. Where already current prices for molybdenum are at about $22 per pound, and we closed the past quarter at $24 per pound. So if there is an adjustment due to negative or to open sales of molybdenum, it will be relatively small than the one -- much more smaller than the one that we have acknowledged or registered in the first quarter. So that should improve our by-product revenues in the second quarter. \n We're also seeing on the total cost of production, some trends that will reflect better cost. Particularly in energy, we're seeing much lower gas price than we had before. That is helping our energy cost of the Mexican operations. We're seeing some relatively lower fuel prices as well, and that will be much more noticeable in this second quarter. So for production, our expectation is to produce, for copper, 940,000 tons, for cost -- some cost reductions that should help to reduce our cash cost and some byproduct revenues, particularly in molybdenum this quarter, and also, through the year, in zinc. Because we will have 52,000 tons coming from the new zinc concentrator that we're about to initiate production in the Buenavista mine. \n Considering the growth, in the case of Los Chancas, we believe that we're in a different environment vis-a-vis the government relation that the company has had. Currently, we're seeing a much stronger commitment from the Peruvian authorities regarding promoting private investments in Peru, which is a positive event for us. In the case of Los Chancas, in particular, we believe that through the year, we will be able to remove these illegal miners from the Chancas premises. And with that, we can come back to exploration efforts, and more important than that, the beginning of environmental impact assessment, which is after the feasibility study, the next step in our work for Los Chancas. \n Finally, in M&A. Well, at this point, we have no -- we are not considering anything specific for M&A. However, it is in the -- the responsible thing to do in this case is to review any opportunities that may arise. And obviously, after a thoughtful review, advise our Board or recommend our Board some action in this matter. But for now, we're not considering anything specific. \nOperator: Our next question, it comes from the line of Isabella Vasconcelos with Bradesco BBI. \nIsabella Vasconcelos: Raul, I have a couple of questions. So the first one  in terms of mining regulation and, particularly in Mexico, what are the kind of expected impacts on your operations deriving from the new mining law and whether it changes anything for El Arco and the development of El Arco. And my second question, specifically on the outlook for production for the coming years. We noticed that there was a slight delay on the start-up of Pilares, if I'm not mistaken. So if you could comment a little bit on the expected production outlook for the coming years for the key commodities. So those are my questions. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Isabella. Okay. At this point, regarding the new mining law in Mexico, we don't see it as -- let me first mention that currently, the bill is not law. It has to pass a process in the Mexican Senate and the senate has to approve it. There are also -- the tax that was approved by the House of Representatives of Mexico, has not significant effect in our current business and our organic growth so far. Now once we have a definite law, we will review it carefully and see if there are any points where it may impact our operations or our growth for the long term. \n And your second question is the outlook for production in the coming years. Already I mentioned, on copper, we're expecting to be at about 940,000 tons this year. For 2022 -- '24, we expect to produce 126,000 tons of copper that will come basically from much more production at the Peruvian operations, mainly for Toquepala, and the contribution at full capacity of Pilares and Buenavista zinc, the copper production of the Buenavista zinc concentrator. As you know, in this case, it is the same concentrator, but it does have some copper production. \n In the case of zinc, let me go on -- excuse me, for copper, in 2025, we're expecting to produce 1,020,000 tons of copper; 2026, 1,100,000 tons; and for 2027, 1,071,000 tons. In the case of zinc, this year, we will be -- we're expecting to produce 116,000 tons of zinc. And after that, we will be over 205,000 tons for the next  4 years and on. It's the ore grade and the expected production of the new zinc concentrator will feed our ore production significantly for zinc in the next few years. \nOperator: Our next question, it comes from the line of Hern\u00e1n Kisluk with MetLife. \nHern\u00e1n Kisluk: It's actually an extension of the question on costs made by Carlos before. So I understand that cost inflation has affected not only you guys but the industry as a whole. But at the end of the day, in mining, it's a game of who is at the lowest percentile of the cash cost curve. So I was wondering if during this period of cost turbulence for the industry as a whole, again, I'm wondering if your position in the cash flow curve has changed during this period. \nRaul Jacob: To put it simply, Hernan, no, it hasn't changed. We're still -- we believe that we're still in the first quartile of cash cost. I haven't seen the latest, I mean, this quarter's information. I'm sure it is available. But so far at the end of 2022, we were certainly at a very competitive position. I mentioned already that we had some events that affected our cash cost in the first quarter, mainly the impact of this negative sales adjustment on molybdenum. \n And for the next quarters, we should be lower than our $0.75 per pound that we marked in this past quarter due to more production coming from our operations and more credit vis-a-vis the same prices for all by-products, due to higher zinc production and lower open sales adjustment for molybdenum. That's our expectation. Obviously, we'll see what happens at the end of the day. What we're seeing in cost, generally speaking, it's a reduction in several cost that has affected our operations in Mexico and Peru. Let me put you a practical example of what I mean. \n When the Russian invasion to Ukraine started, well, Russia has been, for many years, a significant ammonia producer, and ammonia is one of the key elements for open pit explosives. So we had a tenfold increase in the price of the ammonia, tenfold. And that has decreased significantly now that there are some other sources that has been developed for these key elements for open pit explosives, and some Russian production that has been passing through the different markets. So that is a practical example of what I mean, some costs -- some higher costs related to this tragic event has been coming back down. And the company is doing its part by working on producing more copper as well as some more of our byproducts. \nOperator: Our next question, it comes from the line of John Tumazos with Very Independent Research. \nJohn Tumazos: The dividend of $1 was almost as large as net income. Should we infer from this that management expects net income to rebound to the $1.50, $2 a share range? Or are the big capital projects, 5 or more years out, not likely to need money next year or the year after? Or is the dividend a candidate to get adjusted because the payout is too large? \nRaul Jacob: I -- well, it's up to the Board. The Board, as I mentioned, look at the cash position of the company, seeing the requirements of cash. For instance, in terms of debt payments, we have no payments up to 2025, where we will pay $500 million in debt. Last year, we had to pay $300 million. So we, at this point, have no significant debt payments. Prices were, well, better than what they are today. So for a forward looking on dividends, I would say that it will be a discussion at the Board level. \n For now, the Board decided to pay a $1 dividend this past quarter -- or approved a $1 dividend that will be paid this quarter. But no, there are no -- one of the things that we stress is that our dividend policy is flexible depending on the conditions of the market, our cash flow generation and some -- and our growth plans. So this is something that we will review and the Board will make a decision in each Board meeting regarding this matter. \nJohn Tumazos: So there's no simple mechanical formula, like 50% or 70% of earnings or cash flow? \nRaul Jacob: Yes, that's correct. There is no tie to any specific payout ratio or anything. Similarly, it depends on the way that the company sees the market, its commitments to capital as well as any duties that we have regarding debts or things like that. So there is no specific rule regarding dividends.\n One thing that I'd like to stress is that even though we don't have any specific rule, we do have a very good track record of recognizing our shareholders through dividends. And depending on the company's possibilities, the company has always paid a dividend. In certain moments, it has been a relatively higher one, as you mentioned, John, regarding the relationship between net earnings and the dividend pay. But it is always an ongoing discussion. But one thing that I can tell is that we don't want to hold cash, and that is something that is important for -- I believe, for our shareholders. \nOperator: Our next question, it comes from the line of Marcio Farid with Goldman Sachs. \nMarcio Farid Filho: A quick 2 follow-ups for me on my side, please. \nRaul Jacob: So could you move a little bit closer to the microphone, we can't listen to you well. \nMarcio Farid Filho: Is it you better now? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. \nMarcio Farid Filho: All right. Okay. Yes. So a couple of follow-ups for me. First of all, on the molybdenum prices. Just wondering if you have any outlook that you can provide to us, as in the market that we have a hard time trying to track. So just trying to understand how sustainable the current high prices are, what has been the main drivers and how to think about it going into the end of the year. Because it has obviously provided good cost support after byproducts for Southern Copper, right? \n And secondly, specifically on Peru, it does feel like the worst of the social unrest has been left behind for now. So just trying to understand how you see the current operational environment in Peru, if there is anything that you would highlight going forward. And how confident you are that going to be seeing some sort of stability when it comes to mining production in Peru. \nRaul Jacob: You're welcome, Marcio, and thank you very much for your questions. On the drivers for molybdenum prices, it's very hard to know what is going to happen. And let me explain you why. This is an extremely shallow market. Just to give you an idea, in copper on a yearly basis, there are about 25 million tons of copper, refined copper being produced and consumed. For molybdenum, it's less than 300,000. So it's a fraction, almost 10%, a little bit more than that, 15% in the volume of developed markets such as the copper one. \n What has happened in the fourth quarter as low -- as much as we understand, and our commercial team has shared with us, is that given the uncertainties that we had in Chile and Peru, major molybdenum suppliers well as copper, some consumers decided to increase their inventories just to protect their pipelines of production in their own activity, these industrial consumers. And that somehow move up the price of molybdenum. Well, production in Peru has been much more stable through the quarter as well as some other higher operations in some other locations. So that has made the prices to adjust downward. \n At this point, prices are at about $20 per pound for molybdenum, which is a good level for us. We won't regret receiving these prices for our production. It will be always better if they are higher, but that's where we are. And as long as it is stable, we will not have this bounce up and down in open sales that we have faced in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year. \n Regarding Peruvian social unrest, as you have mentioned, Marcio, it's left behind. The environment -- the current environment operation is absolutely normal. All the mines and different mining facilities in Peru are operating right now. There is no mining, say, operation being affected significantly by any kind of stoppages. And we believe that this is something that will certainly help to make more peaceful social environment through 2023. So I think that that's it. \nOperator: And sir, I'm not showing any questions in the queue. You may proceed within final remarks. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you, Carmen. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for the first quarter of 2023. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the second quarter of 2023 results. Thank you very much, and have a very nice day today. \nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's First Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and environmental, social and government. After this, we will open the session for questions. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board Member; as well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, Board Member -- also a Board Members. \n Let's focus now on the copper market. In the first quarter of this year, the London Metal Exchange copper price decreased by 11% from the average of $4.53 per pound that we had in the first quarter of 2022. The average price has been $4.05 this past quarter. The price reduction, which is slightly lower as we speak now, reflects concerns about a possible recession in the U.S. and Europe, and this has been partially offset by the good news on China's economy. \n Our current copper prices are, as I say, at around $3.90 per pound. And we believe the prices are being affected by the following factors. One is the reduction in global inflation, which may slow down or even stop interest rates -- the interest rate hike cycle led by the Fed and the ECB. The bouncing back of the Chinese economy after its openness -- after the COVID -- strong COVID measures that they had, China's GDP has been growing at 4.5% and which is slightly higher than the expected 4% that was mentioned by the major companies that follow the Chinese economy. \n We do have some uncertainty regarding future production growth in Chile and Peru. These 2 countries together represent about 40% of the global supply, and Chile recently reported a copper production decline in the fourth -- in the first quarter this year of about 4%. Considering how demand and supply are evolving, the most relevant market intelligence houses for the copper market are currently expecting a market imbalance or small deficit of about 100,000 tons for this year. \n This assumes a growth in demand between 2% and 2.5%, and lower-than-expected supply growth estimated now between 1.5% and 2%. And this is basically due to the first quarter stoppages that we had in South America. Inventories are still very low at about 411,000 tons as of March 31. These are one of the lowest marks since 2001. \n It is important to emphasize that copper plays a leading role in the global shift to clean energy, which correlates positively with our assertion that the underlying demand for copper will be strong in the long term. In this scenario, we believe the current cycle of low prices will be short-lived. \n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 77% of our sales in the first quarter of 2023. SCC's copper production registered an increase of 4% in the first quarter in quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 223,272 tons. \n Our quarterly results reflects a 16% increase in production in Peru, mainly from the Cuajone operation that grew 48.5%, and this was basically the result of much more mineral production in Cuajone. As you may recall, this operation had -- was affected by an illegal stoppage in the first and second quarters of 2022. So coming back to operation and operating at full capacity now, Cuajone have much more mineral production and better ore grades and recoveries. That certainly helped this quarter's production. \n In the case of the Mexican operations, we had a drop in production of 2.4%, mainly coming from La Caridad, whose production decreased by 11% due to a temporary lower ore grade. For 2023, we expect to produce 940,000 tons of copper, an increase of 5% over the 2022 final trend. This growth will unfold as we have the Peruvian production at full speed, with -- coupled with new production in our Mexican operations through our Pilares and Buenavista Zinc concentrator project. \n For molybdenum, it represented 11% of the company's sales value in the first quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $32 per pound in the quarter compared to the $19 that they averaged in the first quarter of 2022. This represents an increase in price of 69%. \n Molybdenum production decreased by 9% in the first quarter of this year, and this was mainly driven by a drop in production at the Toquepala mine due to lower ore grades. These results were partially offset by higher production at Cuajone, which increased its molybdenum production by 67%; and La Caridad, which increased its molybdenum production by 5%. These mines had a higher ore grade. In the case of Cuajone, obviously, more volume as well. And more -- better recoveries for Cuajone.\n As you know, molybdenum is primarily used to produce special alloys for stainless steel that require significant levels of hardness and resistance to corrosion and heat. New uses for these metals are associated with lubricants, sulfur filtering of heavy oil and shale gas production. Silver represented 4% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2023, with an average price of $20.53 per ounce in the quarter. This reflected a decrease of 6% in silver price. Silver is currently our second by-product. \n Mined silver production increased by 3% in the first quarter of this year, after production rose at Cuajone and Toquepala. This was partially offset by a decreased introduction of the Mexican operations. Refined silver production fell by 12% quarter-over-quarter mainly driven by a drop in production at our IMMSA refinery due to a temporary slowdown in purchases of third-party subs. \n For zinc, it represented 3% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2023, with an average price of $1.42 per pound in the quarter. This represents a decrease with regard to the first quarter of 2022 figure. Zinc mined production increased by 2% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 15,075 tons. This was driven primarily by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara and San Martin mines. Refined zinc production increased by 11% in the first quarter of this year. \n For 2023, we expect to produce 116,000 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 94% over the 2022 production level. This growth will be driven by the production start-up of the Buenavista Zinc operation that should contribute this year with 52,000 tons of more zinc production, and by the recovery of the IMMSA mines production, where better ore grade areas has been identified. For next year and on, we expect to produce over 200,000 tons of zinc per year. \n Financial results. For the first quarter of 2023, sales were $2.8 billion. This is $30 million higher than sales for the first quarter of 2022. Expansion was primarily fueled by an increase in the sales volume of copper that grew by 10%. Silver grew 15% and zinc 6%. This was partially offset by a decrease in the sales volume of molybdenum that decreased by 8% in sales. Metal prices fell for most of our products, with the exemption of molybdenum that increased, as I mentioned, by 69%. \n Our total operating cost and expenses increased by $146 million or 11% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. Main cost increments has been in inventory consumption, repair materials, explosives, reagents, sales expenses, diesel and fuel, and operations contractors. These cost increases were partially compensated by exchange rate differences, purchased copper -- lower purchased copper and other factors. \n When looking at our cost this past quarter, please keep in mind the following events. The Cuajone mine illegal stoppage affected our first quarter production and cost. The Russian invasion to Ukraine started in February of last year had an inflationary impact on cost that was mainly reflected after the first quarter of last year in the company's results. \n The first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.568 billion, which represented a decrease of 7% with regard to the $1.678 billion registered in the first quarter of 2022. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 56% in the first quarter of this year versus 61% in the first quarter of 2022. Operating cash cost per pound of copper before byproduct credits was $2.09 per pound in the first quarter of this year. That is $0.051 higher then the value for the fourth quarter of 2022. This 2% increase in operating cash cost before credits is a result of higher cost per pound from production partially compensated by lower treatment and refining charges, lower administrative expenses and higher premiums on refined copper sales. \n Regarding byproducts, we had a total credit of $631 million, or $1.33 per pound, in the first quarter of this year. These figures represent a 16.3% decrease when compared with the credit of $806 million or $1.59 per pound that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Total credits have increased for zinc and silver and decreased for molybdenum significantly and for sulfuric acid. \n Let me point out that we have an adjustment, a negative adjustment on open sales of molybdenum this past quarter of $265 million, and that was compared to a positive adjustment open sales at the closing of the fourth quarter of $141 million. So that is main event that obviously affected our byproduct revenues in this past quarter vis-a-vis the fourth quarter of last year. \n Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.75 per pound in the first quarter of this year. These cash cost was $0.31 higher than the cash cost of $0.44 that we had in the fourth quarter of 2022. Of this increase, as I mentioned already, $0.05 came from higher cost per pound, mainly due to lower volume; and $0.26 came from lower byproduct credits resulting, as I mentioned, from lower prices of silver and zinc and the very significant open sales adjustment -- negative adjustment that we have on molybdenum sales in this first quarter. \n Our net income in the first quarter of this year was $813 million, which represented a 4% increase when compared to $784 million registered in the first quarter of 2022. The net income margin in the first quarter of this year was 29% versus 28% in the first quarter of 2022. Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter was $1.185 billion which represented an increase of 44% over the $821 million posted in the first quarter of 2022, and an increase of 10% over the $1.082 billion posted in the fourth quarter of last year. \n For capital investments, our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investment in Buenavista zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico and in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of El Arco projects. \n For the Mexican projects, let me start with the Buenavista zinc concentrator in Sonora. As I said, this is a project located in the Buenavista deposit. We're building a new concentrator for zinc, and we are expecting this production facility to produce -- or to add 100,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper capacities per year. When operating, this facility will double the company's zinc production capacity and provide more than 2,000 operational jobs. \n Currently, the capital budget for the project is $416 million, most of which has already been invested, and we are about to initiate operations this quarter, the second quarter. For Pilaris, also located in Sonora, this is a former or a brownfield mine that we acquired a few years back. It's located 6 kilometers away from La Caridad. And the project consists of an open-pit mine operation with annual production capacity of 35,000 tons of copper in concentrate. \n The Pilares budget is $176 million, of which $114 million has been invested. The project is currently operating and delivering copper mineral oxides to the SX-EW facilities of La Caridad operation, and we expect to produce mineral for the Caridad concentrator at full capacity through the second quarter of this year. \n El Pilar, also in Sonora, this is a copper greenfield project, which is strategically located 45 kilometers away from the Buenavista mine. We anticipate that El Pilar will operate as a conventional open pit mine with annual production capacity of 36,000 tons of copper cathodes. This operation will use highly cost-efficient and environmentally friendly SX-EW technology. The budget for El Pilar is $310 million. \n The results from the experimental pads in the leaching process for El Pilar have confirmed adequate levels of copper recovery. Basic engineering study is finished, and the company continues to develop the project and engage in on-site environmental activities. The SX-EW plant detail engineering is being developed on an ongoing basis, and we expect production to begin in 2025 and mine life is estimated at 13 years. \n For El Arco, located in the Baja California Peninsula, this is our class copper deposit located in the central part of the Baja California Peninsula. The project includes an open pit mine combining concentrator and SX-EW operations. Annual production is expected to total 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold. As of March 31, the company has completed environmental baseline study for the mine and industrial facilities, and is reviewing basic engineering analysis to request environmental impact permits. \n For the Peruvian projects, we have the Tia Maria project located in the Arequipa region in Peru. And this is a project that will use a state-of-the-art SX-EW technology, with the highest international environmental standards to produce 120,000 tons of refined copper cathodes per year. The estimated capital budget for the project is $1.4 billion. \n In the case of Los Chancas, also in Peru, it's a project located in the Apurimac region in Peru. This greenfield project located, as I said, in Apurimac, it's a copper and molybdenum porphyry deposit. The Los Chancas project envisions an open-pit mine with a combined operation of concentrator and SX-EW processes to produce 130,000 tons of copper and 7,500 tons of molybdenum annually. The estimated capital investment is $2.6 billion, and the project is expected to begin operating in 2030. \n As of March of this year, part of the project's land continue to be occupied by illegal miners, 70 of whom have regularly registered their stakes in the Integral Registers of Mining Formalization, or REINFO, as it is known in Spanish. The company has requested and the authority has ordered the exclusion of these 70 informal miners from the REINFO register, so that they are now all illegal miners. The company has also filed criminal complaints and other legal remedies to physically expel the illegal miners from the project. \n Michiquillay project. In June of 2018, Southern Copper signed a contract for the acquisition of the Michiquillay project in Cajamarca in Peru. Michiquillay is a world-class mining project with inferred mineral resources of 2.3 billion tons, with an estimated copper grade of 0.43%. When developed, we expect Michiquillay to produce 225,000 tons of copper per year along with byproducts of molybdenum, gold and silver. It will have an initial mine life of more than 25 years and a competitive cash cost. We estimate that the investment of approximately $2.5 billion that will be required, and expect to initiate production by 2032.\n In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company informed the Ministry of Energy and Mines that it has begun exploration activities and initiated an assessment of the existing mineral resource at depth. In 2023, in accordance with our social agreements with the Michiquillay and La Encanada communities, the company has hired unskilled labor and is paying for the use of surface land. We're supporting social programs in both communities as we roll out exploration activities. \n Environmental, social and governance investment. SCC is committed to improving its ESG record by adopting best practices and informing the investment committee and other stakeholders about our progress in this manner. This year, Grupo Mexico will present edition #15 of the Sustainable Development Report, which contains disaggregated information from Southern Copper Corporation and reaffirms our commitment to transparency and ongoing improvement. \n In 2022, we have placed particular importance on updating our strategy for climate change, which includes targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This year's report also provides information on our program and objectives with regard to promoting diversity and inclusion, both inside the company and within the communities close to our operations.\n Sustainable Development Committee. In 2022, Southern Copper Corporation set up a Sustainable Development Committee, which is presided by an independent director. This committee's main objective is to support SCC's Board of Directors in its in endeavors to supervise management of risks and opportunities in the environment -- in the ambits of environmental, safety and health, community development, human rights and corporate governance. \n The committee meets every quarter and has assessed diverse aspects of the company's ESG trajectory, including adhesion to international agreements and management of water and mineral waste. The Sustainable Development Committee, in its third session, addressed climate change as well as diversity and inclusion and identify opportunities on the corporate governance front. \n Third-party certification. In recognition of our commitment to implement best environmental, social and corporate governance practices, our Buenavista del Cobre mine, located in Mexico in Sonora, has obtained certification for 3 important ISO, International Organization for Standardization, standards: ISO 9001 for quality management; ISO 14001 for environmental management; and ISO 45001 for occupational safety and health management. These certificates are a further proof of our commitment to quality, the environment and the occupational safety and health of our employees. \n Occupational safety and health. At Southern Copper Corporation, our employees' safety is our priority. Our unit in Ilo, located in the Moquegua region in Peru, has earned first place in the smelter and refinery category of the 26 National Competition for Mining Safety, organized by the Peruvian Institute of Mining Safety.  This the distinction recognizes SCC's performance with regard to indicators of our employees, occupational safety and health, and is a reflection of our ongoing commitment to ensuring the sustainability of our operations.\n Biodiversity. In March 2023, environmental management unit at Buenavista del Cobre obtained certification from the Wildlife Habitat Council in recognition for our contributions to efforts to prevent the extension of the Mexican gray wolf. Thanks to these actions, populations of these species, which was on the brink of extension in the wild, has multiplied in their natural habitat in Mexico. Going forward, we will continue to work side-by-side with society and authorities to serve the common good in the regions in which we operate. \n Community development. At SCC, we continue to strengthen our community development model and currently operate 29 community centers that provide services to 350,000 people a year in Mexico and Peru. These efforts positively impact the quality of life of the residents in the committees where we work. Recently, we renovated 2 community centers called Casa Grande in Santa Barbara, Chihuahua and Charcas, in San Luis Potosi. These facilities will serve an additional 21,000 people. \n Diversity and inclusion. At SCC, we're convinced that valuing diversity, preventing discrimination and promoting openness to different ways of thinking are fundamental in all efforts to develop inclusive workplace environments that promote the integral development of our employees and stakeholders. We are committed to driving the agenda for diversity and inclusion transversely throughout the company and in the communities around our operations. Our results in 2022 reflect the fruit of our efforts, with a 16% increase in the number of women employed by SCC. \n Dividend announcement. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial means at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, as announced to the market on April 20, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $1 per share of common stock payable on May 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 9, 2023. \n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we would like to end up our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we would like now to open the phone for questions. Okay. Thank you for your set of questions, Carlos. Okay. I'm going to touch base on each of them. If I skip one of your concerns, please let me know. Let me start by cost production. We already mentioned that we're expecting an increase in production of about 5% vis-a-vis next year for copper. And we are also expecting to have a much more production from -- for zinc this year, particularly, due to the beginning of the zinc concentrator at Buenavista. In the case of our cost we're expecting a better cash cost for the next quarters. And the reason for that is twofold. \n I mentioned already that we had to include in our financials, a significant open sales reduction in molybdenum. It was $265 million that we have to charge or decrease our sales by that amount. That obviously explain why the company, vis-a-vis the market, has shown this quarter lower-than-expected results regarding particularly EBITDA and some other metrics. \n So we're expecting not to have this type of adjustments in the second quarter. Where already current prices for molybdenum are at about $22 per pound, and we closed the past quarter at $24 per pound. So if there is an adjustment due to negative or to open sales of molybdenum, it will be relatively small than the one -- much more smaller than the one that we have acknowledged or registered in the first quarter. So that should improve our by-product revenues in the second quarter. \n We're also seeing on the total cost of production, some trends that will reflect better cost. Particularly in energy, we're seeing much lower gas price than we had before. That is helping our energy cost of the Mexican operations. We're seeing some relatively lower fuel prices as well, and that will be much more noticeable in this second quarter. So for production, our expectation is to produce, for copper, 940,000 tons, for cost -- some cost reductions that should help to reduce our cash cost and some byproduct revenues, particularly in molybdenum this quarter, and also, through the year, in zinc. Because we will have 52,000 tons coming from the new zinc concentrator that we're about to initiate production in the Buenavista mine. \n Considering the growth, in the case of Los Chancas, we believe that we're in a different environment vis-a-vis the government relation that the company has had. Currently, we're seeing a much stronger commitment from the Peruvian authorities regarding promoting private investments in Peru, which is a positive event for us. In the case of Los Chancas, in particular, we believe that through the year, we will be able to remove these illegal miners from the Chancas premises. And with that, we can come back to exploration efforts, and more important than that, the beginning of environmental impact assessment, which is after the feasibility study, the next step in our work for Los Chancas. \n Finally, in M&A. Well, at this point, we have no -- we are not considering anything specific for M&A. However, it is in the -- the responsible thing to do in this case is to review any opportunities that may arise. And obviously, after a thoughtful review, advise our Board or recommend our Board some action in this matter. But for now, we're not considering anything specific. Thank you very much, Isabella. Okay. At this point, regarding the new mining law in Mexico, we don't see it as -- let me first mention that currently, the bill is not law. It has to pass a process in the Mexican Senate and the senate has to approve it. There are also -- the tax that was approved by the House of Representatives of Mexico, has not significant effect in our current business and our organic growth so far. Now once we have a definite law, we will review it carefully and see if there are any points where it may impact our operations or our growth for the long term. \n And your second question is the outlook for production in the coming years. Already I mentioned, on copper, we're expecting to be at about 940,000 tons this year. For 2022 -- '24, we expect to produce 126,000 tons of copper that will come basically from much more production at the Peruvian operations, mainly for Toquepala, and the contribution at full capacity of Pilares and Buenavista zinc, the copper production of the Buenavista zinc concentrator. As you know, in this case, it is the same concentrator, but it does have some copper production. \n In the case of zinc, let me go on -- excuse me, for copper, in 2025, we're expecting to produce 1,020,000 tons of copper; 2026, 1,100,000 tons; and for 2027, 1,071,000 tons. In the case of zinc, this year, we will be -- we're expecting to produce 116,000 tons of zinc. And after that, we will be over 205,000 tons for the next  4 years and on. It's the ore grade and the expected production of the new zinc concentrator will feed our ore production significantly for zinc in the next few years. To put it simply, Hernan, no, it hasn't changed. We're still -- we believe that we're still in the first quartile of cash cost. I haven't seen the latest, I mean, this quarter's information. I'm sure it is available. But so far at the end of 2022, we were certainly at a very competitive position. I mentioned already that we had some events that affected our cash cost in the first quarter, mainly the impact of this negative sales adjustment on molybdenum. \n And for the next quarters, we should be lower than our $0.75 per pound that we marked in this past quarter due to more production coming from our operations and more credit vis-a-vis the same prices for all by-products, due to higher zinc production and lower open sales adjustment for molybdenum. That's our expectation. Obviously, we'll see what happens at the end of the day. What we're seeing in cost, generally speaking, it's a reduction in several cost that has affected our operations in Mexico and Peru. Let me put you a practical example of what I mean. \n When the Russian invasion to Ukraine started, well, Russia has been, for many years, a significant ammonia producer, and ammonia is one of the key elements for open pit explosives. So we had a tenfold increase in the price of the ammonia, tenfold. And that has decreased significantly now that there are some other sources that has been developed for these key elements for open pit explosives, and some Russian production that has been passing through the different markets. So that is a practical example of what I mean, some costs -- some higher costs related to this tragic event has been coming back down. And the company is doing its part by working on producing more copper as well as some more of our byproducts. I -- well, it's up to the Board. The Board, as I mentioned, look at the cash position of the company, seeing the requirements of cash. For instance, in terms of debt payments, we have no payments up to 2025, where we will pay $500 million in debt. Last year, we had to pay $300 million. So we, at this point, have no significant debt payments. Prices were, well, better than what they are today. So for a forward looking on dividends, I would say that it will be a discussion at the Board level. \n For now, the Board decided to pay a $1 dividend this past quarter -- or approved a $1 dividend that will be paid this quarter. But no, there are no -- one of the things that we stress is that our dividend policy is flexible depending on the conditions of the market, our cash flow generation and some -- and our growth plans. So this is something that we will review and the Board will make a decision in each Board meeting regarding this matter. Yes, that's correct. There is no tie to any specific payout ratio or anything. Similarly, it depends on the way that the company sees the market, its commitments to capital as well as any duties that we have regarding debts or things like that. So there is no specific rule regarding dividends.\n One thing that I'd like to stress is that even though we don't have any specific rule, we do have a very good track record of recognizing our shareholders through dividends. And depending on the company's possibilities, the company has always paid a dividend. In certain moments, it has been a relatively higher one, as you mentioned, John, regarding the relationship between net earnings and the dividend pay. But it is always an ongoing discussion. But one thing that I can tell is that we don't want to hold cash, and that is something that is important for -- I believe, for our shareholders. So could you move a little bit closer to the microphone, we can't listen to you well. Yes. You're welcome, Marcio, and thank you very much for your questions. On the drivers for molybdenum prices, it's very hard to know what is going to happen. And let me explain you why. This is an extremely shallow market. Just to give you an idea, in copper on a yearly basis, there are about 25 million tons of copper, refined copper being produced and consumed. For molybdenum, it's less than 300,000. So it's a fraction, almost 10%, a little bit more than that, 15% in the volume of developed markets such as the copper one. \n What has happened in the fourth quarter as low -- as much as we understand, and our commercial team has shared with us, is that given the uncertainties that we had in Chile and Peru, major molybdenum suppliers well as copper, some consumers decided to increase their inventories just to protect their pipelines of production in their own activity, these industrial consumers. And that somehow move up the price of molybdenum. Well, production in Peru has been much more stable through the quarter as well as some other higher operations in some other locations. So that has made the prices to adjust downward. \n At this point, prices are at about $20 per pound for molybdenum, which is a good level for us. We won't regret receiving these prices for our production. It will be always better if they are higher, but that's where we are. And as long as it is stable, we will not have this bounce up and down in open sales that we have faced in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year. \n Regarding Peruvian social unrest, as you have mentioned, Marcio, it's left behind. The environment -- the current environment operation is absolutely normal. All the mines and different mining facilities in Peru are operating right now. There is no mining, say, operation being affected significantly by any kind of stoppages. And we believe that this is something that will certainly help to make more peaceful social environment through 2023. So I think that that's it. Thank you, Carmen. Well, with this, we conclude our conference call for the first quarter of 2023. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the second quarter of 2023 results. Thank you very much, and have a very nice day today."

All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP. Now, I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob.\nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's second quarter 2024 results conference call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board Member; as well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, who is also a Board Member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results, expansion projects, and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. Now, let us focus on the copper market. The London Metal Exchange copper price increased 15% from an average of $3.85 per pound in the second quarter of 2023, up to $4.42 this quarter. Based on the production cuts announced by several producers and other information to date, we're expecting a market deficit of about 217,000 tons of copper for 2024. At this point in time, we estimate that the copper supply will increase slightly by 0.6% or that about 0.5% or 0.5 percentage point. Looking at the demand, even though we see weak China's demand mainly from its real-estate market, a resilient U.S. economy, and new demand from decarbonization technologies as well as artificial intelligence are supporting copper demand and prices. Now, let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 76% of our sales in the second quarter of this year. Copper production [technical difficulty] in the second quarter in quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 242,474 tons. Our quarterly result reflects a 15% increase in production in Peru and this improvement was driven by growth at the Toquepala mine, which increased its production by 21%, which was boosted by higher ore grades. Production at our Mexican operations increased by 0.7% in quarter-to-quarter terms, mainly due to higher production at our La Caridad mine, partially offset by a decrease in the production at Buenavista and Inca. For 2024, we expect to produce 963,200 [technical difficulty] 2023 final print. This growth will be fueled by recovery at our SX/EW facilities at Buenavista and by the copper production of our new Buenavista zinc concentrator, which is operating at full capacity. Molybdenum production represented 12% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of this year and is currently our first byproduct. Molybdenum prices averaged $21.69 per pound to $20.87 per pound in the second quarter of last year. This represents an increase of 4%. Molybdenum production increased by 21% in the second quarter compared to the same period of last year. This was mainly driven by higher production at the Peruvian operations and the Buenavista mine due to higher ore grades. These results were partially offset by lower production at La Caridad mine. In 2024, we expect to produce 27,400 tons of molybdenum, which represents an increase of 2% over our 2023 production levels. Silver represented 5% of our sales value in the second quarter of this year with an average price of $28.84 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected an increase of 19% versus the 2023 second-quarter price. Silver is currently our second byproduct. Mine silver production increased 8% in the second quarter of 2024 versus the same period of 2023 with the sole exemption of Inca, production rose at all our operations. Refined silver production increased by 28% quarter-over-quarter, which was mainly driven by growth in our La Caridad and Ilo refineries. In 2024, we expect to produce 20.6 million ounces of silver, an increase of 12% compared to 2023. Zinc represented 4% of our sales value in the second quarter of this year with an average price of $1.29 per pound in the quarter, which represents a 12% increase in price compared to the second quarter of last year. Zinc mine production increased 71% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 29,419 tons. Growth was driven primarily by the 13,653 tons produced at the new Buenavista zinc concentrator and by an increasing production at the Charcas mine. Refined zinc production increased 6% in the second quarter of 2022 -- 2024 vis-a-vis the second quarter of last year. For this year, we expect to produce 121,800 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 86% over our 2023 production level. So we are increasing our expected production for zinc in 86% this year. This growth will be driven by production at our Buenavista zinc concentrator that will add 55,400 tons which has ramped up to better than planned. For 2025 and on, we expect to produce 178,000 tons of zinc per year. Financial results. This year, net sales were $3,818 million which represented growth of 36% with regard to the second quarter of the past year. Expansion was primarily fueled by an increase in sales volumes of copper, which grew 5.5%, molybdenum by 21% increase, silver 32% increase, and zinc 78% increase in sales volumes. Also, we had an increase in metal prices for all of our products. Our total operating cost and expenses increased $111 million or 8% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The main cost increment has been in workers' participation, repair materials, contractors and operating material, sales expenses, copper, and other factors. These cost increments were partially offset by a decrease in the energy cost and in exchange rate variance. In the first half of the year, we saw unitary cost reductions for several materials and services such as branding media, steel, explosive, tires, and power costs. These savings, however, has been somewhat offset by higher costs associated with growth in production and sales volume and by an increase in maintenance and contractors' expenditures, which we are closely monitoring and controlling. Looking at our EBITDA, the second quarter of this year adjusted EBITDA was $1,797 million, which represented an increase of 61% with regard to the $1,116 million registered in the same period of 2023 in the second quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter of this year stood at 58% versus 49% in the same period of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA in the six months of 2024 was $3,215 million. This is 20% higher than what we had at the six months of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the first half of the year stood at 56% versus 53% in the same period of 2023. Cash cost. Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproduct credit was $0.76 per pound in the second quarter of 2024. This cash cost was $0.31 lower than the cash cost of $1.07 as we had for the first quarter of 2024. This is a 29% reduction in cash cost. Before by-product credit, the operating cash cost was $2.15 per pound this past quarter. This is $0.04 higher than the value that we had for the first quarter of 2024. This 2% increase in the operating cash cost before by-product credit reflects an increase in cost per pound from production costs, administrative expenses, lower premiums, and these higher costs were partially offset by higher led by lower treatment and refining charges. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $716 million or $1.40 per pound in the second quarter of this year. These figures represent a 34% increase in byproducts when compared with the credit of $532 million or $1.04 that we had in the first quarter of this year. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc, and silver and decreased somehow for sulfuric acid. The second quarter of 2024 net income was $950 million, which represents a 74% increase with regard to a $548 million registered in the second quarter of last year. The net income margin in the second quarter stood at 31% versus 24% in the second quarter of 2023. This increase was mainly driven by a 36% increase in sales, which was partially offset by higher operating costs related to sales volume, G&A, and exploration expenses. On a year-on-year basis, net income was 24% higher than in the -- in 2023 for similar reasons. Cash from operations, cash flow from operating activities in the six months of this year was $1,622 million, which represents a decrease of 18% compared to the $1,982 million posted in the six months of 2023. Cash flow in the first half of this year was affected by a significant increase in working capital of $511 million, which was mainly driven by an increase in accounts receivable at our Mexican operations. For capital investments, our current capital investment program exceeds $15 billion and it's included -- and it includes investments in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas, and Michiquillay projects in Peru and in the Buenavista Zinc, El Pilar, and El Arco projects in Mexico. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to boastness of the El Arco project. In the second quarter of this year, we spent $332 million on capital investments, which reflected a 31% increase over the figure reported in the second quarter of 2023 and represents 36% of net income this quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent $546 million on capital investments, which represents 33% of net income and reflects the impact of an 11% increase in capital expenses year-on-year. Since there is a description of our main capital projects in Southern Copper's press release, I'm going to focus on updating new developments for each. This past quarter, we completed ramp-up at the Buenavista Zinc concentrator, which graduated from project to operating unit status. The zinc concentrator is operating according to our expectations, producing 23,300 tons of zinc and 5,500 tons of copper today. Our projections indicate that we will comply with the 2024 plan of producing 55,400 tons this year and we expect this facility to generate an average of 90,200 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year in the next five years. For the Peruvian projects, we have the Tia Maria project, which is a greenfield project location. This project will use a state-of-the-art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards to produce 120,000 tons of SX- EW copper cathodes per year. Southern Copper has consistently promoted the welfare of the population of the Islay province and the Arequipa region. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, healthcare, and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. As of July 1st of this year, the company has restarted activities at the Tia Maria in the province of Islay, the Arequipa region, and at the national level. We reiterate our view that Tia Maria will generate significant economic and social opportunities for Islay province and the Arequipa region. In 2024, the Company will, among other scheduled activities, install a live fence as well as 1,000 fog catchers. Southern Copper will also roll out earth-moving work this year. All these activities will generate 270 direct jobs in 2024 for the local population. In 2025, we expect to begin mine construction, which will generate 1,100 direct jobs [technical difficulty] with workers from the Islay province. When we start operations in 2027, the project will generate 600 direct jobs and an estimate of 4,800 indirect jobs. Our social programs in Islay totaled $6.3 million in the last two years. Our current programs promote a reduction in the cost of agricultural production by improving productivity with cutting-edge technology. Additionally, we are working to provide Internet access to 4,600 school students. On top of this, we are committed to developing health facilities, high-performance schools, research centers, and roads in the Arequipa region via the work for taxes mechanism. Tia Maria will generate significant revenues for the Arequipa region from day one of its operations. At current copper prices, we expect to export $17.5 billion and contribute with $3.4 billion in taxes and royalties during the first 20 years of operation. The company is currently reviewing its historical capital budget for Tia Maria of $1.4 billion. We will update this budget by year-end. For Los Chancas project located in the Apurimac region in Peru, the company continues to coordinate efforts with the Peruvian authorities to eradicate illegal mining activity. [technical difficulty] 40,000 meters to gather additional information on the characteristics of the Los Chancas deposit. For the Michiquillay project in the Cajamarca region of Peru, as of June 30th of this year, total advancement on the exploration project stood at 30%. We drilled 104,000 meters on a total program of 148,000 meters and obtained 33,991 core samples for chemical analysis. Diamond drilling is underway, which will provide data for cross-section interpretation, geological modeling, and resource evaluation. This month, we will begin hydrogeological studies and in August, geotechnical studies will commence. We will also assess the results of metallurgical testing at the deposit in August. For environmental, social, and corporate governance or ESG practices, we are glad to report that on August 1st of this year, the company will begin receiving eolic energy from the Fenicias wind park, which is operated by Grupo Mexico Infraestructura. This will reduce our CO2 emission by approximately 250,000 tons per year, which is equivalent to 7% of Southern Copper's carbon footprint. Southern Copper recently published its Sustainability Development Report, significantly improving the granularity and specificity of information regarding our performance, commitment, and efforts in the environmental, social, and governance areas. Our Buenavista mine in Sonora, Mexico, has received The Copper Mark, The Zinc Mark, and The Molybdenum Mark certifications for responsible production following a third-party independent evaluation of our performance in environmental, social, and governance matters. Including on this human rights. Consequently, all open-pit copper, zinc, and molybdenum production from our Mexican operation is currently certified by Mark standards. For Education, our IMPULSA program seeks to provide our workers in Mexico with opportunity to qualify for certification of attaining of primary and secondary education and bachelor's degrees. From 2022 to date, more than 970,000 people -- I'm sorry, 970 people have participated in this program and 430 have graduated. At present, there are 540 workers actively participating in IMPULSA. For Human Development, the sports advisor and coach of the Sonora operations' swimming team, Jorge Iga, qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games after breaking the Mexican record for the 100-meter freestyle. Thanks to Mr. Iga's support, in 2024, 17 students from our academies participated in six top-level competitions. Dividend announcement. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is a company policy to review our cash position, expected cash-flow generation from operations, capital investment plans, and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, on July 18th of this year, Southern Copper Corporation announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share of common stock and a stock dividend of 0.0056 shares of common stock per share. This is payable on August 26th of this year 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 9th, 2024. Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us. Now, we would like to open the forum for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nCarlos de Alba: Thank you very much, Raul, and everyone. Good talking to you. Raul, just on Tia Maria, I would like to understand the rationale behind the new environmental approval that -- or starting the company is doing or getting -- trying to get from the government that would be in relation to a dam that will supply water and not pursue the original desalination or planned post-pumping station and pipeline. Given the less and optimal or less and positive history of the project, why would the company introduce this new uncertainty, which honestly, in my opinion, is just going to complicate matters for the company? Potentially, but I want to clarify with you, this is because the CapEx will be lower and/or the OpEx will be lower? Can you talk about like the magnitude -- if I'm correct, the magnitude of the return on investment that the company would get with a dam as opposed to a desalination plant or how much is the CapEx for the desalination, the pumping station and the pipeline relative to the construction of a dam? And what is the difference in the OpEx going forward within the two projects? Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: Okay. Thank you very much for your question, Carlos. At this point, we are maintaining our approved project, which considers a desal plant. This is what we're developing right now. If there is a possibility later on in time of including them to get the water that the project requires, we will consider that. But at this point, we have -- we're following our current desal plan for the project. Regarding the costs, we're currently [technical difficulty] that has been -- as you know, we have been reporting a capital expense of about $1.4 billion for the project, but we are currently revising it because we want to add some facilities that were not considered in the first project and we have obviously, we need to accommodate some inflation cost in the project total CapEx. For new facilities, I mean, a new road that will connect the project to the coast of Islay, not passing through the Tambo Valley. That will remove one of the concerns that the farmers of Islay or the valley have about the trucks and all the materials that will move on for the project construction that will disturb the valley's environment. So for avoiding that, we're considering building a new road that will -- it's a 20-kilometer road, roughly speaking, and some other changes since the project was approved in 2014, we have seen some technological advances that we want to include in the capital budget as well. So as we indicated in the press release, we are expecting to announce this by year end at the most. And so that's the current status.\nCarlos de Alba: Thanks. Just one clarification. So you will be -- you will build a road, not a railway, right?\nRaul Jacob: No, both things. The railroad will be for moving up the sulfuric acid and materials that we need to operate and down basically the production on a daily basis. However, for the construction phase and to communicate directly to the coast, we will be a road that will connect the plant and the facilities for the project with the cost of OEM.\nCarlos de Alba: All right, got it. Okay. And then my second question is relating to the outlook for cost before byproducts. If I missed it, I'm sorry, but if you didn't mentioned, could you please let us know how you see the evolution of your cash cost before byproduct -- the benefit of byproduct?\nRaul Jacob: Well, it's hard to know because you always have price variances either way, but I believe that we will be at about $2 per pound before subtracting credit. Please keep in mind that those $2 now include the additional cost of our new concentrator for zinc. So it's all the cost of the company, which includes the cost of the byproduct plants that are related to our production complex divided by the pounds of copper that we're producing. So the -- for this year, we expect it to be at about $2. And then it depends on the production level that we have. If we -- for instance, in 2027, when we add Tia Maria to our current production profile, we certainly will reduce our cost before by-products because the Tia Maria expected cash cost is in the range -- the lower range of $1 plus.\nCarlos de Alba: Okay. Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome, Carlos.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and it's coming from Marcio Farid with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nMarcio Farid: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the opportunity. A couple of follow-ups on my side here. Firstly, Raul I think CapEx execution was a bit stronger than we're expecting for the quarter. It's still relatively half of yearly guidance, right? But just trying to understand if investments for Tia Maria are expected to be materially higher for this year, I think you had pretty much close to zero for Tia Maria in the guidance for this year. Are you anticipating some more disbursements related to that as investments seems to be quite remarkable at this point? And yes, and how should we think about final year CapEx and for Tia Maria specifically as well? And similarly for production as well, I think pretty good numbers, but roughly in-line with our estimates. We had, I think guidance for the year is around 950,000 tons. How you're thinking about final year guidance and your ability to reach the production guidance for the year, please? That would be my questions. Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: The second one is, how sure do we feel about the production guidance, right?\nMarcio Farid: Yes. Yes.\nRaul Jacob: Okay. Let me start by this one. Okay, we feel very confident that we will either maintain or improve our production guidance in the second half of this year. We are seeing our zinc new concentrator, it's certainly operating at a very good pace. We were very satisfied on that. On the first half of the year, our SX-EW production at Buenavista was affected by some water scarcity that has been fixed. It's already -- we're already getting even more water than what we expect to have due to higher rainy season that we're seeing at the Sonora State. So that is going to help our production of SX-EW copper for the second half of this year. We have not included that as part of our current guidance and I believe that will be an upside factor for us. Coming to your first question on the CapEx for Tia Maria, this year we are spending, as I'd say, we're doing a live fence that will be around the expected place for the new facilities for the project and we will basically spend much less than a project of this magnitude would require. However, we believe that we could -- we will be accelerating the capital expenditures for the project through the second half of the year. And for 2025, we spend in Tia Maria about $316 million. That will be for earth-moving activities and some other items that are related to the project. I mentioned the road that we want to build that will be obviously a very important source of a new labor requirement, which is one of our priorities to use people from the Islay province and the Tambo Valley specifically. And then for the rest of the CapEx for Tia Maria, we will advise on -- before year-end on this.\nMarcio Farid: Okay. Can I just -- quick follow-up. It sounds like the cost was a lot better on after-byproduct space. Volumes are strong, obviously, we have -- we did not have the breakdown by each product until the full financial statements are out. But where do you think was the beat in terms of positive surprise for after byproducts costs and obviously byproducts production and revenues as well, please?\nRaul Jacob: Well, as I commented when we covered the cash cost portion of the presentation, we have had the benefit of both better prices and higher volumes. The new zinc concentrator obviously was important for getting higher volumes. We have also a molybdenum production coming from our mines. I think, well, I mentioned already the impact of having a much higher zinc production coming from the new zinc concentrator. And silver comes in higher quantities, not only from our mines but also as a byproduct of the zinc concentrator. So higher volumes and better prices, that's what the -- in my view, explain the positive surprise that you were mentioning, Marcio.\nMarcio Farid: That's great, Raul. Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it's from the line of Alejandro Demichelis with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nAlejandro Demichelis: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have a couple of things. First is a follow-up on your net cash cost, yes? Raul, if I'm understanding correctly what you were saying, which is higher volumes on zinc, higher volumes of silver, then we should assume that, that extra by-product's revenues should be stable, obviously with all the variations of prices, but then your net cash cost, should it kind of remain below the $1 per pound?\nRaul Jacob: Hopefully, yes, but we have to see where the prices are going through the rest of the year. We don't know where prices are going to be in the second half of this year. But regarding volumes, I believe that we will maintain the volumes that we're -- we have been achieving year-to-date for our byproducts as well as copper. I already mentioned on copper that we would like to improve on the forecast that we mentioned that for byproducts also, we should maintain the production level. Hopefully, prices will be well the same or even better if we see a better forecast but that's where we are now.\nAlejandro Demichelis: Okay. And then it is a follow-up, obviously from the last quarter. Maybe you can give us some kind of indication of how we should think about or how you're thinking about dividends for the rest of the year? Should we assume it's like a 50-50 between cash and stock?\nRaul Jacob: I can only say that it's up to the Board to make that decision. I think that the dividend as was approved, having 50% in cash and 50% in shares is reflecting the -- well, the new investments that we are undertaking the Tia Maria investment as well as some payments that we have to do for next year. If you see in our balance sheet, we have almost $500 million in debt repayment that we'll have to do in April next year. So that has -- I believe that has made our Board a little bit more conservative in the cash dividend and will a way to reflect the good time that we're seeing in our market and the production levels of the company that has been joined by dividend in shares as well.\nAlejandro Demichelis: Okay, that's great. And just to confirm, you said that for Tia Maria for 2025, the CapEx expectation is about $300 million, something like that?\nRaul Jacob: $316 million, that's the current budget. However, it's under review and we would like to accelerate our CapEx expenses in Tia Maria. We will -- but obviously, with the proper activities to move on.\nAlejandro Demichelis: Okay, that's fantastic. Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question that comes from Sofia Martin with GBM. Please proceed.\nSofia Martin: Hi, thank you for taking my call. I was just wondering if you could share with us your copper production guidance for the next couple of years. Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: Certainly, Sofia. Okay, for 2024, I already mentioned 963,200 tons. For 2025, we will have a slight reduction in production coming from the Buenavista mine and the open-pit operations of Peru. That will put us now at 921,000 tons. Then we will have an adjustment. All these adjustments are basically coming from lower ore grades. For 2026, we are expecting a little bit less than 900,000 tons; 2027, 960,000, and 970,000 tons. And then when we get in 2000 -- well, in 2027 and 2028, we'll be getting the benefit of the Tia Maria full production and that will increase our production forecast to over 1 million tons by 2028.\nSofia Martin: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: Yes. And for the next years, even though we haven't received the Board approval yet, we're considering an expansion of the Cuajone mine that will increase its capacity by about one-third of what it is right now. However, that is not included in our current capital forecast. That is something that the company is working on.\nSofia Martin: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hernan Kisluk with MetLife. Please proceed.\nHernan Kisluk: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Following-up on the previous questions about dividend and also talking about Tia Maria and the CapEx that you need going forward. Can you maybe remind us what are your capital allocation priorities? So we think that CapEx will be higher, but then thinking about the cash position, the net-debt level and the changes that you have been doing on the dividend front, how should we think about going forward?\nRaul Jacob: Well, going-forward, the company is focused as it is a -- it has been mentioned in several forums as well as these conference calls. We are focusing on organic growth. We are currently developing the -- we already finished the zinc, the new zinc concentrator in Buenavista and we are focusing on the projects that the company has which are pretty much 100% owned by the company and well currently we are moving forward with Tia Maria. We already finished the zinc concentrator in Mexico. We do have two other projects in Peru and one with big project in Mexico, which is in Peru, the Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects and in Mexico, El Arco and El Pilar. That are two projects and that's a part of our pipeline in mining-specific copper mining projects. And besides that, for the future, we're also considering the construction of metallurgical complexes, one in Peru and one in Mexico. That will certainly be -- we will await to process the long concentrate production that we have now.\nHernan Kisluk: And given the growth projects that you have obviously going to grow the asset base, should we expect a stable net-debt level for the next few years or will it go along with that?\nRaul Jacob: I am so sorry. Hernan, I'm so sorry, I couldn't get what you said. Our net debt level?\nHernan Kisluk: On net debt. Yes. Should we consider that it will grow?\nRaul Jacob: Well --\nHernan Kisluk: Together with the asset tightening next year?\nRaul Jacob: For now, we are -- we have been paying our total debt and we paid about $700 million in the last five years. Next year, we have the maturity of one of our 10-year loans, the bonds that will mature say in April and it has a CapEx or a principal of $500 million. And if we move on with projects, I believe that we will certainly touch the debt markets in the future. But at this point, we have no concreate plans to do that.\nHernan Kisluk: Okay. Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it's from the line of Alfonso Salazar with Scotiabank. Please proceed.\nAlfonso Salazar: Hi, Raul, and good day. Two questions from my side. The first one is regarding production and sales levels. For several quarters now, we have seen that production is above shipments. So just wondering what is behind this and if there is any reason in the long-term to assume that these numbers shouldn't be the same? And the second question is regarding permits for tailing plants in Mexico, which we heard that some companies are having problems to secure these permits and they have to slow down production or they are considering having to do that in the future unless they get these permits. If there is any situation like that in your case? And also if there is any update on the water pipeline that you need for one of these?\nRaul Jacob: Okay. Well, we have the difference that you mentioned, Alfonso, refers to the difference between the copper contained in our mine production vis-a-vis the refined copper that we sell. As you know, we sell about 75% of all the copper production that we do is sold as refined copper or further processed copper such as rocks. [technical difficulty] If you see our production of copper and the sales usually they are slightly lower the sales in volume compared to the production volumes that we report. That's one of the reasons why you see this over time. And your second question, I'm sorry, could you repeat it, please?\nAlfonso Salazar: Yes, sure. Regarding tailings dam permits in Mexico because I heard that some companies are having some problems.\nRaul Jacob: Yes. No, we have -- we don't have -- we haven't had any problems with that. We're currently working to have all of our tailings dams not only operating with the safety that we need them to have in order to maintain the -- our operations at a sound pace. But no, nothing to report on that regard. We are basically looking into growing the capacity of these tailings dams and where so far with no issues about this.\nAlfonso Salazar: Excellent. Any update on the water pipeline for Buenavista?\nRaul Jacob: No, for now, it's basically as has been reported before.\nAlfonso Salazar: Okay. Perfect. Thank you, Raul.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it's from the line of Myles Allsop with UBS. Please proceed.\nMyles Allsop: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe just a few quick questions, follow-up. So with Tia Maria, since your activity has been picking up over the last few months, have you seen any social unrest? Clearly, that's been an issue for many years with Tia Maria, but do you feel you have more acceptance by the local community at this juncture?\nRaul Jacob: Much better local acceptance to the project. Obviously, there are some people that will never change their mind. They don't like mining and they are protesting, but so far we are seeing that the majority of these live population, which is, roughly speaking, a little bit more than 50,000 people live in this province of Arequipa. Of those, 50,000, we don't see -- we see interest in the project to move on. People is registering themselves into a website that we have opened for job offers. So we are seeing a very positive development in that regard. And we will obviously, we are making efforts to explain that the project will be environmentally safe for the people of Islay. I think is the case with our operations in the southern part of Peru, where we have no issues regarding environmental matters with the local population of Moquegua, Pacocha, and Ilo.\nMyles Allsop: Yes. Okay. And then maybe coming back to that capital allocation question earlier. Where does M&A fit within -- obviously, organic growth is clearly the priority, but there are a few opportunities in Europe and so on. At the moment, where does the M&A kind of optionality set within the priority of management?\nRaul Jacob: Well, the company is always open to review any opportunities that we have on the M&A -- of M&A issues. At this point, we're not looking into anything specific. We are working on organic growth. But if there is a good opportunity out there, our responsibility as management will be to analyze it and to report to our Board of Directors and ask them for a decision on that.\nMyles Allsop: There is only really like Tier-1 assets that you're interested in like proper big 120,000 plus tons or would you look at smaller opportunities as well?\nRaul Jacob: We have made both things in the past. So the answer is yes and yes. We're -- we have looked into assets that have over 100,000 tons of copper production. As long as they are a good fit with our current operations, meaning by these mainly copper and low cash cost. Then that can be assets of 100,000 plus size or smaller assets that are close to our operations as it has been the case with El Pilar for instance. We have been -- we have developed that deposit and it's feeding our Caridad operations right now. So it depends on certain conditions, but for smaller assets, they should most likely be relatively close to where we have our major operations. For bigger ones, that's a different story.\nMyles Allsop: Okay. No, that makes sense. Maybe last question just on Mexico. Obviously, we've had the elections and do you think that those -- the new government and the policy will impact your operations potentially in Mexico? Obviously, there has been kind of incremental challenges, shall we say, over the last six years. And just on the El Pilar project as well, it's never really talked about, so small. But is that still got all the permitting? Is it actually moving forward or is that still on hold? Is El Arco viable under the current administration?\nRaul Jacob: For El Pilar, we are looking into some issues regarding the recovery of the SX-EW solution. We are working on that. For the other concern that you indicated on the question for all the new policies of the coming government, we have to see when they present them. At this point, we have no specific issues to comment on this.\nMyles Allsop: Okay. Thank you very much.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it's from the line of Jon Brandt with HSBC. Please proceed.\nJonathan Brandt: Hi, good morning, Raul. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two really quick ones from me. Just on Tia Maria, I know you're reviewing the CapEx that you have, but I'm more curious about the timing. I believe you're looking at a potential start-up in the second half of 2027. Do you see any risk that, that maybe slips into 2028? If you could just talk a little bit about the timing as you see things? And then second question is, you mentioned the possibility of expanding the Cuajone mine. I'm hoping you can give us a few more details around that. And if there are any other similar type sort of smaller brownfield projects that you might have at your other mines that could help boost production in the coming years? Thank you.\nRaul Jacob: Yes, thank you for your question, John. In the case of the Tia Maria current timeline, that's the best that we have at this point is finishing the project by the first half of 2027, initiating the ramping-up, and having the project stabilized and it's operating at full capacity by this -- sometime between the second and the third [technical difficulty].\nOperator: We lost your audio, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, please standby.\nRaul Jacob: I'm going to connect again. Okay?\nOperator: Okay, perfect. Please standby. Thank you for your patience, ladies and gentlemen, just one moment while he connects. And thank you for your patience, ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience, please continue to standby.\nRaul Jacob: Can you hear now?\nOperator: Yes, we can hear you now. You can continue your presentation from this line.\nRaul Jacob: Carmen, can you listen to us now?\nOperator: I can hear you. Yes.\nRaul Jacob: Will the audience listen to us?\nOperator: The audience is listening to you. And we still have Mr. John Brandt from HSBC with his question.\nRaul Jacob: Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. First, let me excuse ourselves for what just happened. So sorry about that. We will move on with John Brandt's question -- second question on the copper expansion. The idea is to increase the capacity of the copper operation by about one-third of its current capacity. Nowadays, Cuajone mill about 90,000 tons of minerals per day on the Cuajone concentrator. They need to build new facilities that will allow Cuajone to increase its capacity to 120,000 tons of material. That's basically, as I say and let me stress, we're still working on that. We have noted Board approval which is important that you keep in mind. And I think that you already covered another -- a question about on this kind of project that we have been looking at.\nJonathan Brandt: All right. Great. Thanks, Raul.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Feng with CICC. Please proceed.\nDavid Feng: Oh, good morning, Raul and team. This is David from CICC. Thanks for taking my question. Just one quick question on your pricing for copper. We know that the COMEX copper price tends to have some premium over LME copper price in some time this year. And given that our customers are mainly based in Americas, so I just wonder, shall we assume that the COMEX copper price would be a better referencing index for your copper sales instead of the LME copper price in most of your contracts?.\nRaul Jacob: Okay, David, we do have most of our sales from the Mexican operations are priced basically COMEX price. For the Peruian operations and some of the concentrate sales of the Mexican operation, we have reference the LME price. And well for now it looks more attractive selling on the COMEX market but that could change very quickly. This year it is, as you say, there's this arbitrage has been favoring the COMEX market due to the relatively scarcity that we're seeing in this market that prices will commence vis-a-vis the LME market. But that's something that may vary over time. So we are for that reason, having a portion of our sales in COMEX terms as well as the LME terms for some other portion of our sales.\nDavid Feng: Understood. That's really helpful. Thank you so much, Raul.\nRaul Jacob: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And Raul, I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I will pass it back to you for final comments.\nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Carmen. With this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Carmen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's second quarter 2024 results conference call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board Member; as well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, who is also a Board Member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating costs, financial results, expansion projects, and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions. Now, let us focus on the copper market. The London Metal Exchange copper price increased 15% from an average of $3.85 per pound in the second quarter of 2023, up to $4.42 this quarter. Based on the production cuts announced by several producers and other information to date, we're expecting a market deficit of about 217,000 tons of copper for 2024. At this point in time, we estimate that the copper supply will increase slightly by 0.6% or that about 0.5% or 0.5 percentage point. Looking at the demand, even though we see weak China's demand mainly from its real-estate market, a resilient U.S. economy, and new demand from decarbonization technologies as well as artificial intelligence are supporting copper demand and prices. Now, let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 76% of our sales in the second quarter of this year. Copper production [technical difficulty] in the second quarter in quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 242,474 tons. Our quarterly result reflects a 15% increase in production in Peru and this improvement was driven by growth at the Toquepala mine, which increased its production by 21%, which was boosted by higher ore grades. Production at our Mexican operations increased by 0.7% in quarter-to-quarter terms, mainly due to higher production at our La Caridad mine, partially offset by a decrease in the production at Buenavista and Inca. For 2024, we expect to produce 963,200 [technical difficulty] 2023 final print. This growth will be fueled by recovery at our SX/EW facilities at Buenavista and by the copper production of our new Buenavista zinc concentrator, which is operating at full capacity. Molybdenum production represented 12% of the company's sales value in the second quarter of this year and is currently our first byproduct. Molybdenum prices averaged $21.69 per pound to $20.87 per pound in the second quarter of last year. This represents an increase of 4%. Molybdenum production increased by 21% in the second quarter compared to the same period of last year. This was mainly driven by higher production at the Peruvian operations and the Buenavista mine due to higher ore grades. These results were partially offset by lower production at La Caridad mine. In 2024, we expect to produce 27,400 tons of molybdenum, which represents an increase of 2% over our 2023 production levels. Silver represented 5% of our sales value in the second quarter of this year with an average price of $28.84 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected an increase of 19% versus the 2023 second-quarter price. Silver is currently our second byproduct. Mine silver production increased 8% in the second quarter of 2024 versus the same period of 2023 with the sole exemption of Inca, production rose at all our operations. Refined silver production increased by 28% quarter-over-quarter, which was mainly driven by growth in our La Caridad and Ilo refineries. In 2024, we expect to produce 20.6 million ounces of silver, an increase of 12% compared to 2023. Zinc represented 4% of our sales value in the second quarter of this year with an average price of $1.29 per pound in the quarter, which represents a 12% increase in price compared to the second quarter of last year. Zinc mine production increased 71% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 29,419 tons. Growth was driven primarily by the 13,653 tons produced at the new Buenavista zinc concentrator and by an increasing production at the Charcas mine. Refined zinc production increased 6% in the second quarter of 2022 -- 2024 vis-a-vis the second quarter of last year. For this year, we expect to produce 121,800 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 86% over our 2023 production level. So we are increasing our expected production for zinc in 86% this year. This growth will be driven by production at our Buenavista zinc concentrator that will add 55,400 tons which has ramped up to better than planned. For 2025 and on, we expect to produce 178,000 tons of zinc per year. Financial results. This year, net sales were $3,818 million which represented growth of 36% with regard to the second quarter of the past year. Expansion was primarily fueled by an increase in sales volumes of copper, which grew 5.5%, molybdenum by 21% increase, silver 32% increase, and zinc 78% increase in sales volumes. Also, we had an increase in metal prices for all of our products. Our total operating cost and expenses increased $111 million or 8% when compared to the second quarter of last year. The main cost increment has been in workers' participation, repair materials, contractors and operating material, sales expenses, copper, and other factors. These cost increments were partially offset by a decrease in the energy cost and in exchange rate variance. In the first half of the year, we saw unitary cost reductions for several materials and services such as branding media, steel, explosive, tires, and power costs. These savings, however, has been somewhat offset by higher costs associated with growth in production and sales volume and by an increase in maintenance and contractors' expenditures, which we are closely monitoring and controlling. Looking at our EBITDA, the second quarter of this year adjusted EBITDA was $1,797 million, which represented an increase of 61% with regard to the $1,116 million registered in the same period of 2023 in the second quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter of this year stood at 58% versus 49% in the same period of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA in the six months of 2024 was $3,215 million. This is 20% higher than what we had at the six months of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the first half of the year stood at 56% versus 53% in the same period of 2023. Cash cost. Southern Copper's operating cash cost, including the benefit of byproduct credit was $0.76 per pound in the second quarter of 2024. This cash cost was $0.31 lower than the cash cost of $1.07 as we had for the first quarter of 2024. This is a 29% reduction in cash cost. Before by-product credit, the operating cash cost was $2.15 per pound this past quarter. This is $0.04 higher than the value that we had for the first quarter of 2024. This 2% increase in the operating cash cost before by-product credit reflects an increase in cost per pound from production costs, administrative expenses, lower premiums, and these higher costs were partially offset by higher led by lower treatment and refining charges. Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $716 million or $1.40 per pound in the second quarter of this year. These figures represent a 34% increase in byproducts when compared with the credit of $532 million or $1.04 that we had in the first quarter of this year. Total credits have increased for molybdenum, zinc, and silver and decreased somehow for sulfuric acid. The second quarter of 2024 net income was $950 million, which represents a 74% increase with regard to a $548 million registered in the second quarter of last year. The net income margin in the second quarter stood at 31% versus 24% in the second quarter of 2023. This increase was mainly driven by a 36% increase in sales, which was partially offset by higher operating costs related to sales volume, G&A, and exploration expenses. On a year-on-year basis, net income was 24% higher than in the -- in 2023 for similar reasons. Cash from operations, cash flow from operating activities in the six months of this year was $1,622 million, which represents a decrease of 18% compared to the $1,982 million posted in the six months of 2023. Cash flow in the first half of this year was affected by a significant increase in working capital of $511 million, which was mainly driven by an increase in accounts receivable at our Mexican operations. For capital investments, our current capital investment program exceeds $15 billion and it's included -- and it includes investments in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas, and Michiquillay projects in Peru and in the Buenavista Zinc, El Pilar, and El Arco projects in Mexico. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to boastness of the El Arco project. In the second quarter of this year, we spent $332 million on capital investments, which reflected a 31% increase over the figure reported in the second quarter of 2023 and represents 36% of net income this quarter. In the first half of the year, we spent $546 million on capital investments, which represents 33% of net income and reflects the impact of an 11% increase in capital expenses year-on-year. Since there is a description of our main capital projects in Southern Copper's press release, I'm going to focus on updating new developments for each. This past quarter, we completed ramp-up at the Buenavista Zinc concentrator, which graduated from project to operating unit status. The zinc concentrator is operating according to our expectations, producing 23,300 tons of zinc and 5,500 tons of copper today. Our projections indicate that we will comply with the 2024 plan of producing 55,400 tons this year and we expect this facility to generate an average of 90,200 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year in the next five years. For the Peruvian projects, we have the Tia Maria project, which is a greenfield project location. This project will use a state-of-the-art SX-EW technology with the highest international environmental standards to produce 120,000 tons of SX- EW copper cathodes per year. Southern Copper has consistently promoted the welfare of the population of the Islay province and the Arequipa region. As part of these efforts, we have implemented successful social programs in education, healthcare, and productive development to improve the quality of life in the region. As of July 1st of this year, the company has restarted activities at the Tia Maria in the province of Islay, the Arequipa region, and at the national level. We reiterate our view that Tia Maria will generate significant economic and social opportunities for Islay province and the Arequipa region. In 2024, the Company will, among other scheduled activities, install a live fence as well as 1,000 fog catchers. Southern Copper will also roll out earth-moving work this year. All these activities will generate 270 direct jobs in 2024 for the local population. In 2025, we expect to begin mine construction, which will generate 1,100 direct jobs [technical difficulty] with workers from the Islay province. When we start operations in 2027, the project will generate 600 direct jobs and an estimate of 4,800 indirect jobs. Our social programs in Islay totaled $6.3 million in the last two years. Our current programs promote a reduction in the cost of agricultural production by improving productivity with cutting-edge technology. Additionally, we are working to provide Internet access to 4,600 school students. On top of this, we are committed to developing health facilities, high-performance schools, research centers, and roads in the Arequipa region via the work for taxes mechanism. Tia Maria will generate significant revenues for the Arequipa region from day one of its operations. At current copper prices, we expect to export $17.5 billion and contribute with $3.4 billion in taxes and royalties during the first 20 years of operation. The company is currently reviewing its historical capital budget for Tia Maria of $1.4 billion. We will update this budget by year-end. For Los Chancas project located in the Apurimac region in Peru, the company continues to coordinate efforts with the Peruvian authorities to eradicate illegal mining activity. [technical difficulty] 40,000 meters to gather additional information on the characteristics of the Los Chancas deposit. For the Michiquillay project in the Cajamarca region of Peru, as of June 30th of this year, total advancement on the exploration project stood at 30%. We drilled 104,000 meters on a total program of 148,000 meters and obtained 33,991 core samples for chemical analysis. Diamond drilling is underway, which will provide data for cross-section interpretation, geological modeling, and resource evaluation. This month, we will begin hydrogeological studies and in August, geotechnical studies will commence. We will also assess the results of metallurgical testing at the deposit in August. For environmental, social, and corporate governance or ESG practices, we are glad to report that on August 1st of this year, the company will begin receiving eolic energy from the Fenicias wind park, which is operated by Grupo Mexico Infraestructura. This will reduce our CO2 emission by approximately 250,000 tons per year, which is equivalent to 7% of Southern Copper's carbon footprint. Southern Copper recently published its Sustainability Development Report, significantly improving the granularity and specificity of information regarding our performance, commitment, and efforts in the environmental, social, and governance areas. Our Buenavista mine in Sonora, Mexico, has received The Copper Mark, The Zinc Mark, and The Molybdenum Mark certifications for responsible production following a third-party independent evaluation of our performance in environmental, social, and governance matters. Including on this human rights. Consequently, all open-pit copper, zinc, and molybdenum production from our Mexican operation is currently certified by Mark standards. For Education, our IMPULSA program seeks to provide our workers in Mexico with opportunity to qualify for certification of attaining of primary and secondary education and bachelor's degrees. From 2022 to date, more than 970,000 people -- I'm sorry, 970 people have participated in this program and 430 have graduated. At present, there are 540 workers actively participating in IMPULSA. For Human Development, the sports advisor and coach of the Sonora operations' swimming team, Jorge Iga, qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games after breaking the Mexican record for the 100-meter freestyle. Thanks to Mr. Iga's support, in 2024, 17 students from our academies participated in six top-level competitions. Dividend announcement. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is a company policy to review our cash position, expected cash-flow generation from operations, capital investment plans, and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, on July 18th of this year, Southern Copper Corporation announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share of common stock and a stock dividend of 0.0056 shares of common stock per share. This is payable on August 26th of this year 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 9th, 2024. Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us. Now, we would like to open the forum for questions. Okay. Thank you very much for your question, Carlos. At this point, we are maintaining our approved project, which considers a desal plant. This is what we're developing right now. If there is a possibility later on in time of including them to get the water that the project requires, we will consider that. But at this point, we have -- we're following our current desal plan for the project. Regarding the costs, we're currently [technical difficulty] that has been -- as you know, we have been reporting a capital expense of about $1.4 billion for the project, but we are currently revising it because we want to add some facilities that were not considered in the first project and we have obviously, we need to accommodate some inflation cost in the project total CapEx. For new facilities, I mean, a new road that will connect the project to the coast of Islay, not passing through the Tambo Valley. That will remove one of the concerns that the farmers of Islay or the valley have about the trucks and all the materials that will move on for the project construction that will disturb the valley's environment. So for avoiding that, we're considering building a new road that will -- it's a 20-kilometer road, roughly speaking, and some other changes since the project was approved in 2014, we have seen some technological advances that we want to include in the capital budget as well. So as we indicated in the press release, we are expecting to announce this by year end at the most. And so that's the current status. No, both things. The railroad will be for moving up the sulfuric acid and materials that we need to operate and down basically the production on a daily basis. However, for the construction phase and to communicate directly to the coast, we will be a road that will connect the plant and the facilities for the project with the cost of OEM. Well, it's hard to know because you always have price variances either way, but I believe that we will be at about $2 per pound before subtracting credit. Please keep in mind that those $2 now include the additional cost of our new concentrator for zinc. So it's all the cost of the company, which includes the cost of the byproduct plants that are related to our production complex divided by the pounds of copper that we're producing. So the -- for this year, we expect it to be at about $2. And then it depends on the production level that we have. If we -- for instance, in 2027, when we add Tia Maria to our current production profile, we certainly will reduce our cost before by-products because the Tia Maria expected cash cost is in the range -- the lower range of $1 plus. You're welcome, Carlos. The second one is, how sure do we feel about the production guidance, right? Okay. Let me start by this one. Okay, we feel very confident that we will either maintain or improve our production guidance in the second half of this year. We are seeing our zinc new concentrator, it's certainly operating at a very good pace. We were very satisfied on that. On the first half of the year, our SX-EW production at Buenavista was affected by some water scarcity that has been fixed. It's already -- we're already getting even more water than what we expect to have due to higher rainy season that we're seeing at the Sonora State. So that is going to help our production of SX-EW copper for the second half of this year. We have not included that as part of our current guidance and I believe that will be an upside factor for us. Coming to your first question on the CapEx for Tia Maria, this year we are spending, as I'd say, we're doing a live fence that will be around the expected place for the new facilities for the project and we will basically spend much less than a project of this magnitude would require. However, we believe that we could -- we will be accelerating the capital expenditures for the project through the second half of the year. And for 2025, we spend in Tia Maria about $316 million. That will be for earth-moving activities and some other items that are related to the project. I mentioned the road that we want to build that will be obviously a very important source of a new labor requirement, which is one of our priorities to use people from the Islay province and the Tambo Valley specifically. And then for the rest of the CapEx for Tia Maria, we will advise on -- before year-end on this. Well, as I commented when we covered the cash cost portion of the presentation, we have had the benefit of both better prices and higher volumes. The new zinc concentrator obviously was important for getting higher volumes. We have also a molybdenum production coming from our mines. I think, well, I mentioned already the impact of having a much higher zinc production coming from the new zinc concentrator. And silver comes in higher quantities, not only from our mines but also as a byproduct of the zinc concentrator. So higher volumes and better prices, that's what the -- in my view, explain the positive surprise that you were mentioning, Marcio. You're welcome. Hopefully, yes, but we have to see where the prices are going through the rest of the year. We don't know where prices are going to be in the second half of this year. But regarding volumes, I believe that we will maintain the volumes that we're -- we have been achieving year-to-date for our byproducts as well as copper. I already mentioned on copper that we would like to improve on the forecast that we mentioned that for byproducts also, we should maintain the production level. Hopefully, prices will be well the same or even better if we see a better forecast but that's where we are now. I can only say that it's up to the Board to make that decision. I think that the dividend as was approved, having 50% in cash and 50% in shares is reflecting the -- well, the new investments that we are undertaking the Tia Maria investment as well as some payments that we have to do for next year. If you see in our balance sheet, we have almost $500 million in debt repayment that we'll have to do in April next year. So that has -- I believe that has made our Board a little bit more conservative in the cash dividend and will a way to reflect the good time that we're seeing in our market and the production levels of the company that has been joined by dividend in shares as well. $316 million, that's the current budget. However, it's under review and we would like to accelerate our CapEx expenses in Tia Maria. We will -- but obviously, with the proper activities to move on. You're welcome. Certainly, Sofia. Okay, for 2024, I already mentioned 963,200 tons. For 2025, we will have a slight reduction in production coming from the Buenavista mine and the open-pit operations of Peru. That will put us now at 921,000 tons. Then we will have an adjustment. All these adjustments are basically coming from lower ore grades. For 2026, we are expecting a little bit less than 900,000 tons; 2027, 960,000, and 970,000 tons. And then when we get in 2000 -- well, in 2027 and 2028, we'll be getting the benefit of the Tia Maria full production and that will increase our production forecast to over 1 million tons by 2028. Yes. And for the next years, even though we haven't received the Board approval yet, we're considering an expansion of the Cuajone mine that will increase its capacity by about one-third of what it is right now. However, that is not included in our current capital forecast. That is something that the company is working on. You're welcome. Well, going-forward, the company is focused as it is a -- it has been mentioned in several forums as well as these conference calls. We are focusing on organic growth. We are currently developing the -- we already finished the zinc, the new zinc concentrator in Buenavista and we are focusing on the projects that the company has which are pretty much 100% owned by the company and well currently we are moving forward with Tia Maria. We already finished the zinc concentrator in Mexico. We do have two other projects in Peru and one with big project in Mexico, which is in Peru, the Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects and in Mexico, El Arco and El Pilar. That are two projects and that's a part of our pipeline in mining-specific copper mining projects. And besides that, for the future, we're also considering the construction of metallurgical complexes, one in Peru and one in Mexico. That will certainly be -- we will await to process the long concentrate production that we have now. I am so sorry. Hernan, I'm so sorry, I couldn't get what you said. Our net debt level? Well -- For now, we are -- we have been paying our total debt and we paid about $700 million in the last five years. Next year, we have the maturity of one of our 10-year loans, the bonds that will mature say in April and it has a CapEx or a principal of $500 million. And if we move on with projects, I believe that we will certainly touch the debt markets in the future. But at this point, we have no concreate plans to do that. You're welcome. Okay. Well, we have the difference that you mentioned, Alfonso, refers to the difference between the copper contained in our mine production vis-a-vis the refined copper that we sell. As you know, we sell about 75% of all the copper production that we do is sold as refined copper or further processed copper such as rocks. [technical difficulty] If you see our production of copper and the sales usually they are slightly lower the sales in volume compared to the production volumes that we report. That's one of the reasons why you see this over time. And your second question, I'm sorry, could you repeat it, please? Yes. No, we have -- we don't have -- we haven't had any problems with that. We're currently working to have all of our tailings dams not only operating with the safety that we need them to have in order to maintain the -- our operations at a sound pace. But no, nothing to report on that regard. We are basically looking into growing the capacity of these tailings dams and where so far with no issues about this. No, for now, it's basically as has been reported before. You're welcome. Much better local acceptance to the project. Obviously, there are some people that will never change their mind. They don't like mining and they are protesting, but so far we are seeing that the majority of these live population, which is, roughly speaking, a little bit more than 50,000 people live in this province of Arequipa. Of those, 50,000, we don't see -- we see interest in the project to move on. People is registering themselves into a website that we have opened for job offers. So we are seeing a very positive development in that regard. And we will obviously, we are making efforts to explain that the project will be environmentally safe for the people of Islay. I think is the case with our operations in the southern part of Peru, where we have no issues regarding environmental matters with the local population of Moquegua, Pacocha, and Ilo. Well, the company is always open to review any opportunities that we have on the M&A -- of M&A issues. At this point, we're not looking into anything specific. We are working on organic growth. But if there is a good opportunity out there, our responsibility as management will be to analyze it and to report to our Board of Directors and ask them for a decision on that. We have made both things in the past. So the answer is yes and yes. We're -- we have looked into assets that have over 100,000 tons of copper production. As long as they are a good fit with our current operations, meaning by these mainly copper and low cash cost. Then that can be assets of 100,000 plus size or smaller assets that are close to our operations as it has been the case with El Pilar for instance. We have been -- we have developed that deposit and it's feeding our Caridad operations right now. So it depends on certain conditions, but for smaller assets, they should most likely be relatively close to where we have our major operations. For bigger ones, that's a different story. For El Pilar, we are looking into some issues regarding the recovery of the SX-EW solution. We are working on that. For the other concern that you indicated on the question for all the new policies of the coming government, we have to see when they present them. At this point, we have no specific issues to comment on this. You're welcome. Yes, thank you for your question, John. In the case of the Tia Maria current timeline, that's the best that we have at this point is finishing the project by the first half of 2027, initiating the ramping-up, and having the project stabilized and it's operating at full capacity by this -- sometime between the second and the third [technical difficulty]. I'm going to connect again. Okay? Can you hear now? Carmen, can you listen to us now? Will the audience listen to us? Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. First, let me excuse ourselves for what just happened. So sorry about that. We will move on with John Brandt's question -- second question on the copper expansion. The idea is to increase the capacity of the copper operation by about one-third of its current capacity. Nowadays, Cuajone mill about 90,000 tons of minerals per day on the Cuajone concentrator. They need to build new facilities that will allow Cuajone to increase its capacity to 120,000 tons of material. That's basically, as I say and let me stress, we're still working on that. We have noted Board approval which is important that you keep in mind. And I think that you already covered another -- a question about on this kind of project that we have been looking at. You're welcome. Okay, David, we do have most of our sales from the Mexican operations are priced basically COMEX price. For the Peruian operations and some of the concentrate sales of the Mexican operation, we have reference the LME price. And well for now it looks more attractive selling on the COMEX market but that could change very quickly. This year it is, as you say, there's this arbitrage has been favoring the COMEX market due to the relatively scarcity that we're seeing in this market that prices will commence vis-a-vis the LME market. But that's something that may vary over time. So we are for that reason, having a portion of our sales in COMEX terms as well as the LME terms for some other portion of our sales. You're welcome. Thank you very much, Carmen. With this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Southern Copper Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. With us this morning, we have Southern Copper Corporation, Mr. Raul Jacob, Vice President of Finance, Treasurer and CFO, who will discuss the results of the company for the first quarter 2024 as well as answer any questions that you might have.\n The information discussed on today's call may include forward-looking statements regarding the company's results and prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially, and the company cautions to not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Southern Copper Corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All results are expressed in full U.S. GAAP.\n Now I will pass the call on to Mr. Raul Jacob. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Gigi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board member; as well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, who is also Board member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions.\n Now let us focus on the copper market. The London Metal Exchange copper price decreased 5.4% from an average of $4.05 per pound in the first quarter of 2023 to $3.83 in the past quarter. At the end of last year, we were expecting a slight market surplus for 2024. However, after several producers announced reductions in copper production, concerns about a potential deficit displaced market optimism. At this time, we estimate that the copper supply will drop by about 1%. Previously, we were expecting a growth of 3.2% in supply, which has been reversed by this new forecast of a drop of 1% as I said.\n In addition to a significant downward revisions to global copper production projections for this year, we're currently seeing a strong market demand on the back of a resilient U.S. economy, and new demand from decarbonization technologies and artificial intelligence. Demand is expected to grow by about 2.5% this year. We believe these new factors as I say, decarbonization technologies, the resilience of the U.S. economy, will play a significant role in supporting long-term copper demand, sustaining attractive copper prices.\n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 78.6% of our sales in the first quarter of 2024. Copper production registered an increase of 7.6% in the first quarter in quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 240,270 tons. Our quarterly production result reflects a 19% increase in production in Peru due to higher ore grade, mineral processing and recoveries and a 0.5x increase in production in Mexico mines. This includes 2,158 tons of copper from the new zinc concentrator at Buenavista mine. These positive results were partially offset by a decrease in SX-EW cathode production at Buenavista and Toquepala.\n In the fourth quarter of 2023, we reported that our Buenavista operations have experienced difficulties with its water supply. After taking action this past quarter to cover order requirements for this facility, we believe we have ensured sufficient water supplies to operate our Buenavista mine as forecasted in our annual plan. For 2024, we're increasing our forecast of copper production to 948,800 tons of copper, an increase of 4.1% over the 2023 final print. Last year, we drove our Pilares project to full capacity and initiated ramp-up of the Buenavista zinc concentrate. For 2024, we expect these 2 projects to contribute with 43,800 tons of copper.\n For molybdenum, it represented 10.5% of the company's sales value in the first quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $19.84 per pound in the quarter compared to $32.04 in the first quarter of last year, which represents a decrease of 38%. Molybdenum production increased by 9.5% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of last year. This was mainly driven by higher production at the Peruvian operations and the Buenavista mine due to higher ore grades. These results were partially offset by lower production at La Caridad mine. In 2024, we expect to produce 26,100 tons of molybdenum, higher 2.4% than our plan.\n For silver, it represented 4.3% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2024, with an average price of $23.35 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected an increase of 3.6%. Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production increased 8.4% in the first quarter of 2024 versus the first quarter of 2023 after production rose at all our mines with the exception of Buenavista. Refined silver production fell by 1.6% quarter-over-quarter, which was mainly driven by a drop at the IMMSA and La Caridad refinery. In 2024, we expect to produce 20.5 million ounces of silver, an increase of 11.4% compared to 2023.\n Zinc represented 2.7% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2024, with an average price of $1.11 per pound in the quarter. This is 22% lower than last year's first quarter's price for zinc. Zinc mined production increased 75% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 26,366 tons. This was mainly driven by the new Buenavista zinc concentrator production of 9,695 tons over the period and by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara, Charcas and San Martin mine of our IMMSA subsidiary.\n Refined zinc production decreased by 15% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. For this year, we expect to produce 120,300 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 84% over the 2023 production levels. This growth will be driven by the Buenavista zinc concentrator. We expect this facility to produce 54,500 tons of zinc in 2024 and an average of 90,200 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year over the next 5 years.\n Financial results. For the first quarter of 2024, sales were $2.6 billion, that is $194 million lower than sales for the first quarter of 2023 or 7% less. The copper sales volume increased by 2.8%, but value decreased 4.8%, driven by lower prices. Regarding our main by-products, despite an increase in our molybdenum sales volume of 8.4%, sales for molybdenum decreased by 9.3% due to lower prices. As I mentioned, prices dropped by 38% quarter-on-quarter. In the case of silver, sales dropped by 3.1% due to a decrease in volume. This drop was partially offset by better prices. Zinc sales dropped by 24% over the period due to lower prices and slightly lower volume.\n Operating costs. Our total operating cost and expenses decreased by $30 million or 2.1% when compared to the first quarter of 2023. The main cost reduction has been inventory, purchased copper, workers' participation, explosives and grinding media and other factors. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher repair material, diesel and fuel cost, labor and other costs. The first quarter of 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $1,417.7 million, which is 9.6% lower when compared to the $1,568 million registered in the first quarter of 2023. This was due to lower prices for copper and molybdenum. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter of this year was 54.5% versus 56.1% in the first quarter of 2023.\n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $2.11 per pound in the first quarter of 2024. This is $0.12 below the $2.23 registered for the fourth quarter of 2023. This 5.3% decrease in operating cash cost was attributable to lower cost per pound from production, a decrease in treatment and refining costs and a drop in administrative expenses. All of this net of an uptick in the premiums. Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $1.07 per pound in the first quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.18 lower than the cash cost of $1.25 for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $532 million or $1.04 per pound in the first quarter of 2024. These figures represent a 5.9% increase when compared with the credit of $491.5 million, which was an equivalent of $0.984 per pound in the fourth quarter. So we have better credits that increased our -- increased by 6% in absolute dollars, and on a per pound basis, it was $1.04 versus $0.984 in the fourth quarter of last year. Total credits have increased for molybdenum and silver, but decreased for zinc and sulfuric acid. Copper production volumes increased by 2.6% between the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2023. Regarding by-products, production volumes increased for zinc, as I said, 56%, and decreased for molybdenum and silver.\n Net income was $736 million or 9.5% lower when compared to the $813.2 million registered in the first quarter of 2023. Net income margin was -- in the first quarter of this year was 28.3% versus 29.1% in the first quarter of 2023. Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2024 was $659.9 million, which represented an increase of 22% over the $540.9 million posted in the fourth quarter of 2023. This improvement was attributable to strong cash generation at our operations, which was driven by higher sales and cost control efficiency. In the first quarter of this year, cash flow from operating activities was 44% lower than the $1,185 million reported in the first quarter of 2022. This decrease was attributable to $311 million increase in working capital, which was driven primarily by our Mexican operations.\n Capital investments. Our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru and the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of the El Arco project. In the first quarter of this year, we spent $214 million on capital investments, down 10% compared to the first quarter of last year, and 16% versus the figure in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n Capital expenditure represented 29% of net income this quarter. Since there is a description of our main capital project in SCC's press release, I'm going to focus on updating new developments for each of them. For the Buenavista zinc concentrator, the capital budget for the project is $439 million, of which $383 million had been invested as of March 31 of this year. Concentrator operation began in the first quarter of 2024. We expect, as we mentioned already, to produce 54,500 tons of zinc and 11,900 tons of copper this year, and for the next 5 years, we expect to have an average production of 90,200 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year coming from this new Buenavista zinc concentrator.\n For the Peruvian projects, in the case of Los Chancas in Apurimac, the company continues to engage in coordinated efforts with The Peruvian authorities to eradicate illegal mining activity. Once this process is completed, we will resume the environmental impact assessment and initiate hydrogeological as well as geotechnical studies. We will also conduct a diamond drilling campaign of 40,000 meters to gather additional information on the characteristics of the Los Chancas deposit.\n For the Michiquillay project located in the Cajamarca region in Peru, as of March 31 of this year, we have drilled 80,000 meters on a total program of 110,000 meters and obtained 27,902 core samples for chemical analysis. Diamond drilling is underway, which will provide data for cross-section interpretation, geological modeling and resource evaluation. We expect to begin hydrogeological and geotechnical studies soon, and will also assess the results of metallurgical testing at the deposit. The company continues to work with the Michiquillay and La Enca\u00f1ada communities based on the guidelines of corresponding social agreements.\n For environmental, social and corporate governance or ESG, well, we're always -- we are very consistently reporting on ESG assessment conducted by rating agencies on our operations. For the third consecutive year, we were included in the S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook. This means that thanks to our performance in this agency's Corporate Sustainability Assessment and evaluation, we're ranked among the top 15% of the best rated companies in sustainability in mining and metals. Regarding ESG Risk Ratings Report Evaluation by Sustainalytics, SCC reduced its risk level by improving its score within the medium risk category from 27.5 in 2023 to 23.4 in 2024.\n For climate action, in the first quarter of 2024, we received clean energy certificates from one of our electricity suppliers in Peru. With this, all the electrical energy we consume in Peru in 2023 came from renewable sources. Measurements indicate that consumption of renewable electricity, energy -- electrical energy at SCC increased from 23% to 36% in 2023, which means that we have already hit our 2027 target to ensure that 25% of our electrical supply is derived from renewable sources. Over the same period, greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 7.5% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n For climate governance, recently, a briefing from Chapter Zero, home of the Climate Governance Initiative, was held for the directors and management of Southern Copper Corporation to inform them about the risks and opportunities associated with climate change. This initiative, developed in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, aims to support non-executive directors and chairs in integrating climate action into their business strategy.\n For the second consecutive year, we received the Exceptional Company award in Mexico, presented by the Business Coordinating Council, the Communication Council and the Institute for the Promotion of Quality. On this occasion, the success of our Educational Center model was recognized after outstanding results were reported for mathematics and Spanish and English languages, which are above the national and regional average for the cohort of 2,000 students from the 4 basic level schools sponsored by the company in Mexico under a voluntary initiative to benefit our employees.\n In Peru, we inaugurated the High Performance School or COAR. COAR is the acronym in Spanish. The Peruvian -- this was in Tacna, the Peruvian region where our Toquepala mine operates. This campus houses 300 outstanding students for the state educational system. Many of these students come from the most vulnerable areas of the region. The COAR facilities will allow them to continue their studies in state-of-the-art classrooms, laboratories, libraries, residences and sport areas, thanks to an investment of $26 million through the work for taxes modality.\n Dividend announcement. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividends. Accordingly, Southern Copper Corporation announced last Friday that its Board of Directors has approved a quarterly stock dividend of 0.0104 shares of common stock per share payable on May 23, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 8 of this year.\n In lieu of fractional shares, cash will be distributed to each shareholder who will otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share based on a share price of $115.13, which is the average of the high and low share price on April 18, 2024. Shareholders will not be required to take any action to receive the stock dividends. After the payment date, shareholders' book entry accounts will be credited with additional shares that represent the stock dividend. When shares are held in a brokerage account in the name of a broker, the additional shares will be distributed to the broker on the shareholder's behalf. The stock dividend is administered by Computershare, the company's transfer agent.\n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we will like now to open the forum for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba from MS. \nCarlos de Alba: So if I may ask -- I have three questions. One is what drove the decision, the Board decision, to change the dividend from cash to all shares? In all the time I've been covering the stock -- the company, I think only one time that I can remember, the company pay dividends in shares. And at that time, it was partial cash and partial shares. And so yes, any color would be very interesting to understand this deviation from the norm.\n My second question has to do with the appetite for Southern Copper to potentially pursue M&A by a company in the sector as opposed to develop the projects, which, while certainly the portfolio is attractive, they are probably many years away potentially, with the exception of Tia Maria, to be developed.\n And lastly, the cost performance was really good in the quarter. Congratulations on that. I wanted to understand how do you see the trend in cost before by-products, before the benefit of by-products, in the coming quarters? And if you can share the new guidance or how you see the average cost for the year before by-products again? \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much for your questions, Carlos. I'm going to address them now. Well, the change in the dividend, it's because we do have a resource, which are the shares that the company has been buying as part of the buyback program. And given the cash position of the company and the view on the price and how to respond to a sensible, say, dividend yield, given the cash -- the price of the shares, it was considered to pay this dividend that if you do the arithmetic using -- as I referenced, the price that we indicated of $115.34 (sic) [ $115.13 ], I believe, for the price that we used as a reference, is about $1.20 per share.\n The cash generation of the company at the point of the Board meeting was not able without putting in compromise some expenditures for the future, and that's why the Board decided to use this resource and let the shareholders decide if they want to keep the shares or monetize them by selling them in the market.\n Regarding your second concern on the appetite for potential M&A. Basically -- well, we do see -- we do follow what is happening worldwide within M&A opportunities. As you know, we are significantly focused in our organic growth. We're following our projects. We're happy to report on the Pilares well-being in the last year. This year, it's part of our operation, and we're doing also some good work for the zinc concentrator ramping up.\n So those are the project that has been finished lately. And well, the zinc concentrator is in its way up to be in a new operation as well. But generally speaking, what we're doing is we're following what is happening in the market. If we see a good opportunity, for us as management will be appropriate to do some recommendation to our Board, and we're seeing different circumstances. But so far, nothing has been taking our interest specifically.\n And regarding the cost before by-products, keep in mind that producing the by-product has a cost. So the new zinc concentrator divided -- cost divided by the pounds of copper that -- all the pounds of copper that we produce, it's charging us a little bit our cash cost before credits. Obviously, the credits are much, much higher than the cost of this facility on a per pound basis as well. Where -- I believe that we are seeing prices, the cash cost, in the range of what it is now. I think that we are not seeing inflation, for instance, affecting our cash cost now. A little bit may come from higher [ silver ] prices if they keep where they are now, but that's basically it.\n So my view will be that we should maintain our cash cost before credits at this level. After credits, if you add the new production from the Buenavista concentrator, obviously, we will have much higher credits and we reported something of that, even though we had not as good prices as we have in the other quarters. So that's basically it. \nCarlos de Alba: If I may, just on the first question on the dividend. Maybe I just wanted to understand a little bit more, because the company has very strong balance sheet. It finished the year 2023 with $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. It generated cash in the first quarter, another $100-and-some million. So what changed?\n Are you planning on -- maybe do you see Tia Maria being approved soon or any other project starting relatively in the near future? Or maybe an opportunity to acquire an asset that will require cash, and before you decided to use the shares? Because you could have also potentially canceled the shares and increased the EBITDA per share and therefore make stock look cheaper. \nRaul Jacob: Well, if you see our cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $660 million in round numbers. That is a reference that we look at in order to see how much is the capacity of paying a cash dividend coming from our operations. As I mentioned, we had a change in operating assets and liabilities of about $311 million. This, we believe, is going to be a onetime issue. And -- but generally speaking, it was a mix of maintaining a conservative position regarding cash.\n If we see some positive developments in Tia Maria as we're seeing that we're moving forward now, we'll certainly require more and more cash. So this is one of the reasons. The other ones are all related to having a conservative position regarding our cash position. it's more like being been prudent at this point instead of paying a dividend that will create -- may create some problems for the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alejandro Demichelis from Jefferies. \nAlejandro Anibal Demichelis: Actually, just to follow up on the dividend question, Raul. So if I understood correctly, you said that you're using the shares you have in treasury. So should we think that the dividend in stock will only be limited to those shares that you have in treasury? Or can we assume that you could actually expand the share count that you have? That's the first question.\n And then the second question is you mentioned some progress in Tia Maria. Can you give us a little bit more of a flavor of how you're seeing that process going? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Let me start by the last question. We are seeing -- first thing is that the recent change in executive branch authorities related to mining and energy as well as finance as well as environmental affairs has been very positive for the project. The new ministers are working with the company to improve the conditions for the project to start, and that is a very positive result in our view.\n We also acknowledge that -- well, we have been doing social work in the Tambo Valley and the Islay province, and I think that we're seeing a better social environment, generally speaking, for the project. And this is basically the result of many years of consistent work. When we had the last stop at the Tia Maria project a few years ago, we didn't stop making progress on the social front, and that is something that we're seeing it's making a project advance a positive news for now.\n Regarding the dividends, well, we have these shares in treasury. This dividend will consume about 8 million shares of the treasury that we -- the ones that we have in treasury. And that's basically it for now. We are not considering nor what you are saying -- neither what you're saying on using all the shares in treasury or something like that, we are not considering that, and we are not also considering any shares issuance for the future.\n So for now, it is what it is. As was mentioned before, in the first questions that we had from Carlos De Alba, we pay -- a few years ago, in the fourth quarter of 2011, a dividend was paid using the shares that we had at that time. And we -- by doing this, we transfer to the shareholders the decision of monetizing those shares or keeping them, considering the very good outlook that the company has for the future. \nAlejandro Anibal Demichelis: And just to follow up on Tia Maria. Can you give us some time line? Do you have any time line on the process? \nRaul Jacob: No time line. No time line. We're doing progress. We'll report to the market, to investors community, as we move on a quarterly basis, but we don't want to set a time line at this point. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Brandt from HSBC. \nJonathan Brandt: Just wondering, would you -- I mean we've see Codelco talk about maybe taking on some partners to increase production... \nRaul Jacob: Could you -- Jon, please, could you get a little bit closer? I can't talk to you well. \nJonathan Brandt: Is that better? \nRaul Jacob: Much better. \nJonathan Brandt: Okay. We've seen Codelco talk about maybe partnering with some other miners to help increase their production. I'm wondering, you have a really great pipeline of greenfield projects. Is that something that you would consider? Would you partner with another miner? I mean, would that help you pull forward some of the production? Or is there something else you can do to increase the speed of your greenfield projects? I guess that's the first question.\n And then just on Tia Maria, I mean, I think I noticed in your slide, you were talking about a 2027 start-up. When does that assume that you start construction activities? I mean is it a 2-year construction activity before you would see first production? If you could sort of talk about that, that would be great. \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Well, yes, it will be 2-year construction process at this point. This is our estimated time line for construction. We don't know when this is going to be the case to report. But whenever it happens, we'll certainly let you all know. And to your first question, considering a partnering or a partnership with another miner. No, for now, we are not considering that. The company, it's developing these projects as a full-on operations as it is the case with our current operations in general. \nJonathan Brandt: Okay. And just sorry, one follow-up. So just to clarify your answers on the stock dividend. Should we expect next quarter to go back to a cash dividend? Is that how we should interpret your answers? \nRaul Jacob: As I say when I report on the dividend announcement, each Board meeting, the Board discuss the company cash position, the outlook on the market, any payments that we have to do for projects or debt, et cetera. And on that basis, a dividend is declared. How the Board is going to evaluate this in the next Board meeting, I can't advance anything on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. \nTimna Tanners: Happy Friday. So I wanted to probe a little bit more the Buenavista situation. Last quarter, you told us you did not -- not yet been granted the permit and were still moving water via truck. I know you said you covered your needs, but can you give us an update on the supply situation there and any progress toward the permit? \nRaul Jacob: Certainly, Timna. Glad to hear from you. Well, yes, we are -- as you mentioned, we're covering a portion of the water that is required by Buenavista with truck fleet. We're operating that so far this year, and we're -- as we are indicating in the press release, we're covering our water needs for now, and with some excess capacity. So we are comfortable with what we have as water supply. That's basically it.\n On the permit status, we do have the permit to operate the wells. We are using the wells to get the water, but we don't have a permit for building a pipeline that will bring the water from the wells to the facilities. That's why we're using the water trucks at this point. No news on when are we going to get the permits. \nTimna Tanners: Got it. And you anticipated my next question. Okay. And then as we go through with your new guidance for copper, silver and moly and zinc, just looking at the copper side, your guidance implies kind of a little drop off from first quarter run levels -- run rate in the copper, it implies a big step-up in run rate for silver. Just trying to understand a little bit more of the nuances of what drives the little slowdown in moly, a slowdown in copper, and uptick on silver. I think we understand zinc pretty well, but just trying to understand the other items. \nRaul Jacob: Well, actually, on the copper side, we are much more optimistic than -- let me put it differently. We're relatively conservative in our production goal for the year. Hopefully, we'll be better than what we're, at this point, estimating. But that's where we are now. That's our current plans. And so hopefully, we will improve a little bit our final mark for copper.\n In the case of molybdenum, we have been producing more molybdenum than this past quarter and more than the first quarter of last year. The problem here are the prices for molybdenum which are much lower than what we had last year. As I mentioned, we have the 38% drop in price for this quarter vis-a-vis the first one of last year. \nTimna Tanners: Okay. And then on silver, did you have a comment on why that was trending much better than the first quarter run rate? \nRaul Jacob: Sure. It's -- we are getting more silver from our current operating facilities. The new concentrator has also some silver content in the production that we're getting, so that plus better production at our operations is the driver for higher silver production. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alfonso Salazar from Scotiabank. \nAlfonso Salazar: Let me please rephrase a couple of questions from my colleagues. The first one is, because this stock dividend is a one-off, for the next quarter, the Board of Directors will not be considering the possibility of paying a stock dividend again. So is this correct? \nRaul Jacob: It's up to them. It's up to them. I can't comment on what they are going to decide on the next Board meeting. \nAlfonso Salazar: Okay. But in principle, it will be a one-offs? \nRaul Jacob: In principle, it will be a what? \nAlfonso Salazar: A one-off, the payment of a stock dividend. \nRaul Jacob: They approved a stock dividend this quarter. We don't have, at this point, any idea of what they are going to propose on the next one. \nAlfonso Salazar: Can you remind us how many stocks do you have at the treasury after this payment? \nRaul Jacob: Well, before the payments, we had 111 million shares. 111 million. And the share payout is about 8 million, so after this, we will have 103 million. The exact number will be 103,442,000 shares of treasury shares after this dividend payment. \nAlfonso Salazar: That's good. Excellent. The other question that I have is can you remind us your copper production profile for the coming years? And let us know what is your projection for Tia Maria or other projects? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Okay. Hold on a second, please. For this year, as I said, it's going to be 948,800 tons. Next year, 2025, 920,000; 2026, 940,000; 2027, [ 1,005,100 ];  and '28, 1,020,000. \nAlfonso Salazar: And from that, I assume that there is some production coming from Tia Maria by 2027? \nRaul Jacob: Yes. Tia Maria is included in the forecast for '27. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC. \nJohn Tumazos: Raul, is it possible that maybe we're a little spoiled with these long delays in the very big projects moving forward, which permitted large dividends bigger than 50% payout? And now that Tia Maria may advance and the other projects in Peru are advancing, the dividend payout needs to be less than 50% rather than over 50% in cash. It's better not to gain weight, and it's better not to accumulate debt, because both of them are hard to reduce once you accumulate. \nRaul Jacob: Well, I agree on the weight comment on that, John. But I think that the company -- what we have seen and we have shown is that we are conservative and prudent in the use of our cash. We don't want to, for instance, take debt to pay a dividend. I think that, that is not in our DNA. But in certain circumstances, for instance, when we anticipate that our future EBITDA will be higher because we're moving forward with a new project or getting some operations on a better shape, then it is reasonable to have some additional debt.\n As we have been paying all the maturities in our bonds in the last 5 years. I think that as we are doing this, we may consider going to the bond market or to the capital markets at certain point in time. Right now, we're not having any concrete plans for that. This is something that we evaluate on a consistent basis. As you may imagine, interest rates are not what they used to be, and the company took advantage of that.\n If you look at our debt profile, the average interest rate that we're paying is significantly lower than what a company of -- such as ours may get in the next few years or if we go out to the market now. So being prudent is one of the reasons why the company has been considering this dividend in this quarter, and we believe that this prudent view will hold for the next few years. And that's what the -- what we as management are thinking about the use of debt and dividend payments. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Regina Carrillo from GBM. \nRegina Carrillo Villasana: I saw in the presentation that you mentioned investments in the... \nRaul Jacob: Regina, please get a little bit closer to microphone. \nRegina Carrillo Villasana: Is this better? \nRaul Jacob: Much better. Thank you. \nRegina Carrillo Villasana: Perfect. I saw in the presentation that you mentioned investments in the Ilo and the Empalme, and I just wanted to get an update on what you're seeing there. \nRaul Jacob: Yes. We do have some plans for growing in the refining business as well as the mining business.  For that, we have a plan for building a new smelter in Mexico, which at this point is considered to be in the Empalme in Mexico, [ this on ] our state. And for the Peruvian facilities, we do have also plans for new smelter and refinery in the Ilo area, nearby our current facilities for smelting and refining.\n We're seeing that sales, direct sales, to the industrial complexes in both Mexico and Peru will absorb this new material whenever we move on with these projects. At this point, as you know, we are considering them for later on this decade, and we will be updating on any progress on these investments as we move on over time and the projects mature later on in time as well. \nOperator: At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Raul Jacob for closing remarks. \nRaul Jacob: Thank you very much, Gigi. And well with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's first quarter of 2024 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the second quarter results. Thank you very much for being with us today, and have a nice day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raul Jacob",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Gigi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Southern Copper's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. At today's conference, I'm joined by Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, CEO of Southern Copper and Board member; as well as Mr. Leonardo Contreras, who is also Board member. In today's call, we will begin with an update on our view of the copper market and then review Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and ESG. After this, we will open the session for questions.\n Now let us focus on the copper market. The London Metal Exchange copper price decreased 5.4% from an average of $4.05 per pound in the first quarter of 2023 to $3.83 in the past quarter. At the end of last year, we were expecting a slight market surplus for 2024. However, after several producers announced reductions in copper production, concerns about a potential deficit displaced market optimism. At this time, we estimate that the copper supply will drop by about 1%. Previously, we were expecting a growth of 3.2% in supply, which has been reversed by this new forecast of a drop of 1% as I said.\n In addition to a significant downward revisions to global copper production projections for this year, we're currently seeing a strong market demand on the back of a resilient U.S. economy, and new demand from decarbonization technologies and artificial intelligence. Demand is expected to grow by about 2.5% this year. We believe these new factors as I say, decarbonization technologies, the resilience of the U.S. economy, will play a significant role in supporting long-term copper demand, sustaining attractive copper prices.\n Now let's look at Southern Copper's production for the past quarter. Copper represented 78.6% of our sales in the first quarter of 2024. Copper production registered an increase of 7.6% in the first quarter in quarter-on-quarter terms to stand at 240,270 tons. Our quarterly production result reflects a 19% increase in production in Peru due to higher ore grade, mineral processing and recoveries and a 0.5x increase in production in Mexico mines. This includes 2,158 tons of copper from the new zinc concentrator at Buenavista mine. These positive results were partially offset by a decrease in SX-EW cathode production at Buenavista and Toquepala.\n In the fourth quarter of 2023, we reported that our Buenavista operations have experienced difficulties with its water supply. After taking action this past quarter to cover order requirements for this facility, we believe we have ensured sufficient water supplies to operate our Buenavista mine as forecasted in our annual plan. For 2024, we're increasing our forecast of copper production to 948,800 tons of copper, an increase of 4.1% over the 2023 final print. Last year, we drove our Pilares project to full capacity and initiated ramp-up of the Buenavista zinc concentrate. For 2024, we expect these 2 projects to contribute with 43,800 tons of copper.\n For molybdenum, it represented 10.5% of the company's sales value in the first quarter of this year and is currently our first by-product. Molybdenum prices averaged $19.84 per pound in the quarter compared to $32.04 in the first quarter of last year, which represents a decrease of 38%. Molybdenum production increased by 9.5% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of last year. This was mainly driven by higher production at the Peruvian operations and the Buenavista mine due to higher ore grades. These results were partially offset by lower production at La Caridad mine. In 2024, we expect to produce 26,100 tons of molybdenum, higher 2.4% than our plan.\n For silver, it represented 4.3% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2024, with an average price of $23.35 per ounce in the quarter, which reflected an increase of 3.6%. Silver is currently our second by-product. Mined silver production increased 8.4% in the first quarter of 2024 versus the first quarter of 2023 after production rose at all our mines with the exception of Buenavista. Refined silver production fell by 1.6% quarter-over-quarter, which was mainly driven by a drop at the IMMSA and La Caridad refinery. In 2024, we expect to produce 20.5 million ounces of silver, an increase of 11.4% compared to 2023.\n Zinc represented 2.7% of our sales value in the first quarter of 2024, with an average price of $1.11 per pound in the quarter. This is 22% lower than last year's first quarter's price for zinc. Zinc mined production increased 75% quarter-on-quarter and totaled 26,366 tons. This was mainly driven by the new Buenavista zinc concentrator production of 9,695 tons over the period and by an increase in production at the Santa Barbara, Charcas and San Martin mine of our IMMSA subsidiary.\n Refined zinc production decreased by 15% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. For this year, we expect to produce 120,300 tons of zinc, which represents an increase of 84% over the 2023 production levels. This growth will be driven by the Buenavista zinc concentrator. We expect this facility to produce 54,500 tons of zinc in 2024 and an average of 90,200 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year over the next 5 years.\n Financial results. For the first quarter of 2024, sales were $2.6 billion, that is $194 million lower than sales for the first quarter of 2023 or 7% less. The copper sales volume increased by 2.8%, but value decreased 4.8%, driven by lower prices. Regarding our main by-products, despite an increase in our molybdenum sales volume of 8.4%, sales for molybdenum decreased by 9.3% due to lower prices. As I mentioned, prices dropped by 38% quarter-on-quarter. In the case of silver, sales dropped by 3.1% due to a decrease in volume. This drop was partially offset by better prices. Zinc sales dropped by 24% over the period due to lower prices and slightly lower volume.\n Operating costs. Our total operating cost and expenses decreased by $30 million or 2.1% when compared to the first quarter of 2023. The main cost reduction has been inventory, purchased copper, workers' participation, explosives and grinding media and other factors. These cost reductions were partially offset by higher repair material, diesel and fuel cost, labor and other costs. The first quarter of 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $1,417.7 million, which is 9.6% lower when compared to the $1,568 million registered in the first quarter of 2023. This was due to lower prices for copper and molybdenum. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter of this year was 54.5% versus 56.1% in the first quarter of 2023.\n Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $2.11 per pound in the first quarter of 2024. This is $0.12 below the $2.23 registered for the fourth quarter of 2023. This 5.3% decrease in operating cash cost was attributable to lower cost per pound from production, a decrease in treatment and refining costs and a drop in administrative expenses. All of this net of an uptick in the premiums. Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $1.07 per pound in the first quarter of this year. This cash cost was $0.18 lower than the cash cost of $1.25 for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $532 million or $1.04 per pound in the first quarter of 2024. These figures represent a 5.9% increase when compared with the credit of $491.5 million, which was an equivalent of $0.984 per pound in the fourth quarter. So we have better credits that increased our -- increased by 6% in absolute dollars, and on a per pound basis, it was $1.04 versus $0.984 in the fourth quarter of last year. Total credits have increased for molybdenum and silver, but decreased for zinc and sulfuric acid. Copper production volumes increased by 2.6% between the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2023. Regarding by-products, production volumes increased for zinc, as I said, 56%, and decreased for molybdenum and silver.\n Net income was $736 million or 9.5% lower when compared to the $813.2 million registered in the first quarter of 2023. Net income margin was -- in the first quarter of this year was 28.3% versus 29.1% in the first quarter of 2023. Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2024 was $659.9 million, which represented an increase of 22% over the $540.9 million posted in the fourth quarter of 2023. This improvement was attributable to strong cash generation at our operations, which was driven by higher sales and cost control efficiency. In the first quarter of this year, cash flow from operating activities was 44% lower than the $1,185 million reported in the first quarter of 2022. This decrease was attributable to $311 million increase in working capital, which was driven primarily by our Mexican operations.\n Capital investments. Our current capital investment program for this decade exceeds $15 billion and includes investments in the Tia Maria, Los Chancas and Michiquillay projects in Peru and the Buenavista Zinc, Pilares, El Pilar and El Arco projects in Mexico. This capital forecast includes several infrastructure investments, including key investments to bolster the competitiveness of the El Arco project. In the first quarter of this year, we spent $214 million on capital investments, down 10% compared to the first quarter of last year, and 16% versus the figure in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n Capital expenditure represented 29% of net income this quarter. Since there is a description of our main capital project in SCC's press release, I'm going to focus on updating new developments for each of them. For the Buenavista zinc concentrator, the capital budget for the project is $439 million, of which $383 million had been invested as of March 31 of this year. Concentrator operation began in the first quarter of 2024. We expect, as we mentioned already, to produce 54,500 tons of zinc and 11,900 tons of copper this year, and for the next 5 years, we expect to have an average production of 90,200 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of copper per year coming from this new Buenavista zinc concentrator.\n For the Peruvian projects, in the case of Los Chancas in Apurimac, the company continues to engage in coordinated efforts with The Peruvian authorities to eradicate illegal mining activity. Once this process is completed, we will resume the environmental impact assessment and initiate hydrogeological as well as geotechnical studies. We will also conduct a diamond drilling campaign of 40,000 meters to gather additional information on the characteristics of the Los Chancas deposit.\n For the Michiquillay project located in the Cajamarca region in Peru, as of March 31 of this year, we have drilled 80,000 meters on a total program of 110,000 meters and obtained 27,902 core samples for chemical analysis. Diamond drilling is underway, which will provide data for cross-section interpretation, geological modeling and resource evaluation. We expect to begin hydrogeological and geotechnical studies soon, and will also assess the results of metallurgical testing at the deposit. The company continues to work with the Michiquillay and La Encan\u0303ada communities based on the guidelines of corresponding social agreements.\n For environmental, social and corporate governance or ESG, well, we're always -- we are very consistently reporting on ESG assessment conducted by rating agencies on our operations. For the third consecutive year, we were included in the S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook. This means that thanks to our performance in this agency's Corporate Sustainability Assessment and evaluation, we're ranked among the top 15% of the best rated companies in sustainability in mining and metals. Regarding ESG Risk Ratings Report Evaluation by Sustainalytics, SCC reduced its risk level by improving its score within the medium risk category from 27.5 in 2023 to 23.4 in 2024.\n For climate action, in the first quarter of 2024, we received clean energy certificates from one of our electricity suppliers in Peru. With this, all the electrical energy we consume in Peru in 2023 came from renewable sources. Measurements indicate that consumption of renewable electricity, energy -- electrical energy at SCC increased from 23% to 36% in 2023, which means that we have already hit our 2027 target to ensure that 25% of our electrical supply is derived from renewable sources. Over the same period, greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 7.5% in 2023 compared to 2022.\n For climate governance, recently, a briefing from Chapter Zero, home of the Climate Governance Initiative, was held for the directors and management of Southern Copper Corporation to inform them about the risks and opportunities associated with climate change. This initiative, developed in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, aims to support non-executive directors and chairs in integrating climate action into their business strategy.\n For the second consecutive year, we received the Exceptional Company award in Mexico, presented by the Business Coordinating Council, the Communication Council and the Institute for the Promotion of Quality. On this occasion, the success of our Educational Center model was recognized after outstanding results were reported for mathematics and Spanish and English languages, which are above the national and regional average for the cohort of 2,000 students from the 4 basic level schools sponsored by the company in Mexico under a voluntary initiative to benefit our employees.\n In Peru, we inaugurated the High Performance School or COAR. COAR is the acronym in Spanish. The Peruvian -- this was in Tacna, the Peruvian region where our Toquepala mine operates. This campus houses 300 outstanding students for the state educational system. Many of these students come from the most vulnerable areas of the region. The COAR facilities will allow them to continue their studies in state-of-the-art classrooms, laboratories, libraries, residences and sport areas, thanks to an investment of $26 million through the work for taxes modality.\n Dividend announcement. Regarding dividends, as you know, it is the company policy to review our cash position, expected cash flow generation from operations, capital investment plans and other financial needs at each Board meeting to determine the appropriate quarterly dividends. Accordingly, Southern Copper Corporation announced last Friday that its Board of Directors has approved a quarterly stock dividend of 0.0104 shares of common stock per share payable on May 23, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 8 of this year.\n In lieu of fractional shares, cash will be distributed to each shareholder who will otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share based on a share price of $115.13, which is the average of the high and low share price on April 18, 2024. Shareholders will not be required to take any action to receive the stock dividends. After the payment date, shareholders' book entry accounts will be credited with additional shares that represent the stock dividend. When shares are held in a brokerage account in the name of a broker, the additional shares will be distributed to the broker on the shareholder's behalf. The stock dividend is administered by Computershare, the company's transfer agent.\n Ladies and gentlemen, with these comments, we end our presentation today. Thank you very much for joining us, and we will like now to open the forum for questions. Thank you very much for your questions, Carlos. I'm going to address them now. Well, the change in the dividend, it's because we do have a resource, which are the shares that the company has been buying as part of the buyback program. And given the cash position of the company and the view on the price and how to respond to a sensible, say, dividend yield, given the cash -- the price of the shares, it was considered to pay this dividend that if you do the arithmetic using -- as I referenced, the price that we indicated of $115.34 (sic) [ $115.13 ], I believe, for the price that we used as a reference, is about $1.20 per share.\n The cash generation of the company at the point of the Board meeting was not able without putting in compromise some expenditures for the future, and that's why the Board decided to use this resource and let the shareholders decide if they want to keep the shares or monetize them by selling them in the market.\n Regarding your second concern on the appetite for potential M&A. Basically -- well, we do see -- we do follow what is happening worldwide within M&A opportunities. As you know, we are significantly focused in our organic growth. We're following our projects. We're happy to report on the Pilares well-being in the last year. This year, it's part of our operation, and we're doing also some good work for the zinc concentrator ramping up.\n So those are the project that has been finished lately. And well, the zinc concentrator is in its way up to be in a new operation as well. But generally speaking, what we're doing is we're following what is happening in the market. If we see a good opportunity, for us as management will be appropriate to do some recommendation to our Board, and we're seeing different circumstances. But so far, nothing has been taking our interest specifically.\n And regarding the cost before by-products, keep in mind that producing the by-product has a cost. So the new zinc concentrator divided -- cost divided by the pounds of copper that -- all the pounds of copper that we produce, it's charging us a little bit our cash cost before credits. Obviously, the credits are much, much higher than the cost of this facility on a per pound basis as well. Where -- I believe that we are seeing prices, the cash cost, in the range of what it is now. I think that we are not seeing inflation, for instance, affecting our cash cost now. A little bit may come from higher [ silver ] prices if they keep where they are now, but that's basically it.\n So my view will be that we should maintain our cash cost before credits at this level. After credits, if you add the new production from the Buenavista concentrator, obviously, we will have much higher credits and we reported something of that, even though we had not as good prices as we have in the other quarters. So that's basically it. Well, if you see our cash from operating activities in the first quarter was $660 million in round numbers. That is a reference that we look at in order to see how much is the capacity of paying a cash dividend coming from our operations. As I mentioned, we had a change in operating assets and liabilities of about $311 million. This, we believe, is going to be a onetime issue. And -- but generally speaking, it was a mix of maintaining a conservative position regarding cash.\n If we see some positive developments in Tia Maria as we're seeing that we're moving forward now, we'll certainly require more and more cash. So this is one of the reasons. The other ones are all related to having a conservative position regarding our cash position. it's more like being been prudent at this point instead of paying a dividend that will create -- may create some problems for the future. Yes. Let me start by the last question. We are seeing -- first thing is that the recent change in executive branch authorities related to mining and energy as well as finance as well as environmental affairs has been very positive for the project. The new ministers are working with the company to improve the conditions for the project to start, and that is a very positive result in our view.\n We also acknowledge that -- well, we have been doing social work in the Tambo Valley and the Islay province, and I think that we're seeing a better social environment, generally speaking, for the project. And this is basically the result of many years of consistent work. When we had the last stop at the Tia Maria project a few years ago, we didn't stop making progress on the social front, and that is something that we're seeing it's making a project advance a positive news for now.\n Regarding the dividends, well, we have these shares in treasury. This dividend will consume about 8 million shares of the treasury that we -- the ones that we have in treasury. And that's basically it for now. We are not considering nor what you are saying -- neither what you're saying on using all the shares in treasury or something like that, we are not considering that, and we are not also considering any shares issuance for the future.\n So for now, it is what it is. As was mentioned before, in the first questions that we had from Carlos De Alba, we pay -- a few years ago, in the fourth quarter of 2011, a dividend was paid using the shares that we had at that time. And we -- by doing this, we transfer to the shareholders the decision of monetizing those shares or keeping them, considering the very good outlook that the company has for the future. No time line. No time line. We're doing progress. We'll report to the market, to investors community, as we move on a quarterly basis, but we don't want to set a time line at this point. Could you -- Jon, please, could you get a little bit closer? I can't talk to you well. Much better. Yes. Well, yes, it will be 2-year construction process at this point. This is our estimated time line for construction. We don't know when this is going to be the case to report. But whenever it happens, we'll certainly let you all know. And to your first question, considering a partnering or a partnership with another miner. No, for now, we are not considering that. The company, it's developing these projects as a full-on operations as it is the case with our current operations in general. As I say when I report on the dividend announcement, each Board meeting, the Board discuss the company cash position, the outlook on the market, any payments that we have to do for projects or debt, et cetera. And on that basis, a dividend is declared. How the Board is going to evaluate this in the next Board meeting, I can't advance anything on that. Certainly, Timna. Glad to hear from you. Well, yes, we are -- as you mentioned, we're covering a portion of the water that is required by Buenavista with truck fleet. We're operating that so far this year, and we're -- as we are indicating in the press release, we're covering our water needs for now, and with some excess capacity. So we are comfortable with what we have as water supply. That's basically it.\n On the permit status, we do have the permit to operate the wells. We are using the wells to get the water, but we don't have a permit for building a pipeline that will bring the water from the wells to the facilities. That's why we're using the water trucks at this point. No news on when are we going to get the permits. Well, actually, on the copper side, we are much more optimistic than -- let me put it differently. We're relatively conservative in our production goal for the year. Hopefully, we'll be better than what we're, at this point, estimating. But that's where we are now. That's our current plans. And so hopefully, we will improve a little bit our final mark for copper.\n In the case of molybdenum, we have been producing more molybdenum than this past quarter and more than the first quarter of last year. The problem here are the prices for molybdenum which are much lower than what we had last year. As I mentioned, we have the 38% drop in price for this quarter vis-a-vis the first one of last year. Sure. It's -- we are getting more silver from our current operating facilities. The new concentrator has also some silver content in the production that we're getting, so that plus better production at our operations is the driver for higher silver production. It's up to them. It's up to them. I can't comment on what they are going to decide on the next Board meeting. In principle, it will be a what? They approved a stock dividend this quarter. We don't have, at this point, any idea of what they are going to propose on the next one. Well, before the payments, we had 111 million shares. 111 million. And the share payout is about 8 million, so after this, we will have 103 million. The exact number will be 103,442,000 shares of treasury shares after this dividend payment. Yes. Okay. Hold on a second, please. For this year, as I said, it's going to be 948,800 tons. Next year, 2025, 920,000; 2026, 940,000; 2027, [ 1,005,100 ];  and '28, 1,020,000. Yes. Tia Maria is included in the forecast for '27. Well, I agree on the weight comment on that, John. But I think that the company -- what we have seen and we have shown is that we are conservative and prudent in the use of our cash. We don't want to, for instance, take debt to pay a dividend. I think that, that is not in our DNA. But in certain circumstances, for instance, when we anticipate that our future EBITDA will be higher because we're moving forward with a new project or getting some operations on a better shape, then it is reasonable to have some additional debt.\n As we have been paying all the maturities in our bonds in the last 5 years. I think that as we are doing this, we may consider going to the bond market or to the capital markets at certain point in time. Right now, we're not having any concrete plans for that. This is something that we evaluate on a consistent basis. As you may imagine, interest rates are not what they used to be, and the company took advantage of that.\n If you look at our debt profile, the average interest rate that we're paying is significantly lower than what a company of -- such as ours may get in the next few years or if we go out to the market now. So being prudent is one of the reasons why the company has been considering this dividend in this quarter, and we believe that this prudent view will hold for the next few years. And that's what the -- what we as management are thinking about the use of debt and dividend payments. Regina, please get a little bit closer to microphone. Much better. Thank you. Yes. We do have some plans for growing in the refining business as well as the mining business.  For that, we have a plan for building a new smelter in Mexico, which at this point is considered to be in the Empalme in Mexico, [ this on ] our state. And for the Peruvian facilities, we do have also plans for new smelter and refinery in the Ilo area, nearby our current facilities for smelting and refining.\n We're seeing that sales, direct sales, to the industrial complexes in both Mexico and Peru will absorb this new material whenever we move on with these projects. At this point, as you know, we are considering them for later on this decade, and we will be updating on any progress on these investments as we move on over time and the projects mature later on in time as well. Thank you very much, Gigi. And well with this, we conclude our conference call for Southern Copper's first quarter of 2024 results. We certainly appreciate your participation and hope to have you back with us when we report the second quarter results. Thank you very much for being with us today, and have a nice day."
